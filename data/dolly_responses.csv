ADNT## 'rt for 2023, "Adient evaluates its environmental and social policies, actions, and performance based on measures similar to those used by other corporations." \n\nHowever, the documents it provides for review don\'t contain any discussion of environmental or social policies, actions, or performance. All that is described is the scope of the company\'s review, which consists of determining whether potential buyers are familiar with "Adient\'s governance, capital structure, and financial position," its legal structure, and its compliance with certain government regulations. In short, there is no discussion of environmental or social policies, actions, or performance.'

In addition, Essential Utilities has employed a handful of controversial activist attorneys, who have used legal tactics such as "free speech" doctrines to push a "nasty" political agenda and attack the fossil-fuel industry and corporate opponents. Essential Utilities\' work in California has contributed to California\'s notorious "Litigation Killer" laws and practices, which encourage plaintiffs to file numerous, meritless lawsuits in an effort to extract huge settlements, without sufficient evidence or due process.\n\nIn light of its troubling environmental track record, Essential Utilities has made public commitments to put more resources into sustainable practices, to hire more environmental and sustainability experts, to promote "green" jobs, and to'
