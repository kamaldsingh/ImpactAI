thank you. (operator instructions) our first question comes from matthew fields from bank of america merrill lynch. please go ahead.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey everyone. thanks for the updated guidance on convent marine terminal and the expected throughput. just wanted to dig in a little bit on that. so the api2 price really started crashing in march so at 2.1 million tons for the first quarter, you're kind of at the bottom of that new throughput guidance. if prices stayed about $60 a ton where presumably the netback is not favorable to ilb producers, do you see risk to that 8 million to 10 million ton guidance?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
matt, this is mike. thanks for your question. we're comfortable with the guidance and i -- we can't speculate of course on the future, but the forward curve for the api2 was quite a bit higher than the current prices. so, you're correct in your assessment of the current low price makes it difficult for our customers. but looking forward, there are indications of higher prices; but we are comfortable with our guidance given the current pricing level as well as expectations going forward.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and it's important to remember that there is a limited ebitda impact from the reduced base volumes due to the nature of our contracts. so, we recorded deferred revenue here in the quarter so what we see is we'll recognize that in the fourth quarter if our throughput tons are lower than 10 million tons on those base volumes. and also just to add, there's about 1 million tons of merchant volume in that estimate that we provided.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, great. that's very helpful. and then -- so if your sort of on poise on track to achieve 3 times leverage by the end of 2019, are we then to assume kind of after that and after the simplification transaction there'll be some kind of portfolio augmentation through m&a? and if there is, kind of what -- what kind of leverage do you feel comfortable taking the balance sheet up to in search of that portfolio augmentation?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well, the answer to the first part of your question is yes, we will, as we've indicated, pursue both organic growth opportunities and we'll look to grow through m&a initiatives as well. we've targeted 3 times and that's where we'd like to be not only at the end of this year, but in years to come. we might -- on a very temporary basis -- depending upon the opportunity that's in front of us, take it up on a temporary basis. but we believe that with the cash flows that will be available to the company post simplification, that we'll be able to digest some pretty good opportunities without having to concern ourselves or our investors with leverage that is well in excess of 3 times for any prolonged period of time.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
do you have an upper limit on that temporary leverage level like a number behind that or...?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
no. it would be very situational depending -- it would depend on the opportunity and the cash flows available from the opportunity, the timeframe that those cash flows might be available to us. so, i couldn't speak to that without having a specific opportunity in front of us.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. all right. thanks very much. that's it from me.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from mark levin from seaport global. please go ahead.
mark levin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. thanks. congratulations on a very good start to the quarter. it sounded like weather didn't make it easy on you. two quick questions. the first is assuming -- it sounds like this year you will focus on paying down debt getting down to that 3 times leverage ratio, getting the -- hopefully getting the simplification transaction closed. but when you think about 2020 and you look at where -- how much free cash the enterprise will be generating, i think you mentioned looking at organic and potential m&a opportunities. where -- given where the stock is right now and where the free cash flow is, i mean, how do you weigh the opportunity to return cash to shareholders either through a buyback given where the stock is versus those m&a opportunities?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
so, clearly something like a buyback would be a board level decision. we have indicated post simplification that we're going to institute a common dividend of $0.24 for common shareholders. so, there'll be some distribution to the c-corp shareholder post close. depending upon the portfolio of opportunities that's in front of us would influence in some ways a further return of capital to shareholders. but recall that we're going to be quite disciplined in our approach to growth and we're only going to pursue those opportunities, which are additive to our shareholders well. so, we're going to pursue profitable growth opportunities that are well in excess of our cost of capital. so we've got some deleveraging activity to complete which you've mentioned, we're going to institute a common dividend, and then we'll pursue both growth and other avenues to return capital to shareholders in a way that's profitable to them.
mark levin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
that make sense, appreciate it. and then just as a reminder, so the take-or-pay contract that you guys have with murray/foresight, when does that contract expire and how do you think about the -- a world in which api2 prices may not be $80 or $75 or higher in perpetuity?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so, the contract expires for the 10 million tons in 2022 and then there is 4 million tons in 2023. i think you see kind of volatility in the pricing as we've seen kind of recently in the recent past as well. it's very hard to say where the -- where pricing will be long term, but i mean if you look at forward curve, it's in the mid-70s and that's out to 2020. so i think, as you well know mark, there is a demand in the export market and there is a balancing aspect to kind of coal producers as far as what they put into the domestic market versus the export market. and i think the long-term opportunities still exist in convent.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's fair to say and to add to what fay said, we believe our customers have advantaged cost positions with regard to global supply. so, the price will settle out where it does. internationally there should continue to be high levels of demand for thermal coal and low cost producers will participate in that demand. so, our customers notwithstanding the current malaise (ph) in prices are well-positioned for the long term.
mark levin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
great, appreciate it. thanks guys.

our next question comes from lucas pipes from b. riley fbr. please go ahead.
unidentified participant --  -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. this is dan on for lucas. i just have a quick modeling question related to the indiana harbor rebuild. so, your 1.22 million ton run rate annually comes out to about a little over 300,000 tons quarterly. so, is that something we should be thinking about as a fourth quarter event like maybe second half of fourth quarter? i know you're aiming to have that done by the end of the year. thanks.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
go ahead, fay.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
okay. so the 1.22 million ton run rate is something that you should model for 2020. we will be rebuilding the remaining 57 ovens at indiana harbor throughout the year. we plan on being done with that by the end of the year sometime in the fourth quarter. so we'll exit the year at that run rate, but you're not going to see that production in the fourth quarter of 2019.
unidentified participant --  -- analyst
okay. so, there should be a decent jump from 4q '19 to 1q '20 in the run rate?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
unidentified participant --  -- analyst
great. okay. that's all. thanks.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
look, i think,the best way look at it is year-over-year. we've given guidance for '19 and '20. there's ovens coming out of service to be rebuilt, there'll be ovens coming back into service as they're rebuilt, there'll be warming up. so, there's a lot of activity throughout '19. so, the best way for me to think about '19 is just to look at the total for '19 and compare that to '20 if you're looking to model it.
unidentified participant --  -- analyst
yes, cool. that's all. thank you.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

(operator instructions)
at this time, i would like to turn the call over to andy kellogg, treasurer and director of investor relations. mr. kellogg, please go ahead.
andy kellogg -- treasurer and director, investor relations
good morning. thank you for joining us this morning to discuss suncoke energy's first quarter 2019 earnings. with me are mike rippey, president and chief executive officer; and fay west, senior vice president and chief financial officer. following management's prepared remarks, we'll open the call for q&a. this conference call is being webcast live on the investor relations section of our website and a replay will be available later today. if we don't get to your questions on today's call, please feel free to reach out to our investor relations team.
before i turn things over to mike, let me remind you that the various remarks we make on today's call regarding future expectation constitute forward-looking statements. the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in our sec filing apply to the remarks we make today. these documents are available on our website as are reconciliations to any non-gaap financial measures discussed on today's call. in terms of our upcoming investor relations conference schedule, we'll be attending the b. riley fbr institutional conference on may 22nd and may 23rd in los angeles and the jefferies steel & metal summit in new york on june 17th.
with that, i'll now turn things over to mike.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, andy. good morning and thank you all for joining us on this morning's call. beginning on slide 4, we are pleased with the operational performance that our team delivered in the quarter despite adverse weather conditions, including the wettest winter on record and historically cold temperatures, which presented challenges for both our coke and logistics businesses. as you know, all of our plans are exposed to a variety of weather conditions every day, 365 days a year. we take a number of precautionary steps to ensure that we are prepared for inclement weather, including extensive employee training and winterization of our assets. this preparation and safeguarding of our employees and assets allowed us to continue to operate safely during the extreme weather events like the polar vortex, which we experienced this winter, with only limited impact.
on the coke side, we experienced a slight decrease in production versus our expectations and lower coal-to-coke yields. convent, high water on the mississippi added additional cost for the quarter. despite these challenges, we are off to a good start and are making progress toward achieving our 2019 objectives. we achieved record-setting first quarter performance with adjusted ebitda of $67.3 million, 5% improvement year-over-year. the quarter benefited from strong performance in our coke segment with an increase in production of over 40,000 tons compared to the prior year period. significant production improvement is primarily attributable to the operating performance of our rebuilt ovens at the indiana harbor. during the quarter, we began work on the final phase of our indiana harbor rebuild campaign and anticipate our first group of ovens will be back in service in june.
as a reminder, this final phase includes rebuilds of the remaining 57 b-battery ovens. while still early, we are on schedule and on budget and anticipate completing the rebuild program by the end of the year. after this year, we'll have completed rebuilds of all 268 ovens and expect the facility to be back at 1.22 million tons of nameplate capacity in 2020. turning to the balance sheet, we continued execution of our deleveraging initiative and anticipate paying down debt over the balance of the year. we expect to achieve our consolidated gross leverage target of 3 times by year-end. lastly, with a strong start to the year, we are well-positioned to achieve our fiscal year 2019 guidance targets. before i turn it over to fay to review our first quarter earnings, we wanted to provide an update on the progress we have made on the simplification transaction. slide 5, you will see that our team filed the s-4 registration statement with the sec in early march.
we anticipate setting a record date in may for sxc shareholders to vote on the transaction during our june special meeting. following the approval of our shareholders, we anticipate closing the transaction late in the second or early third quarter. as we discussed on our last call, we strongly believe simplification creates immediate and long-term value for suncoke stakeholders. the simplified and consolidated ownership structure will be able to unlock the full potential of the enterprise, which provides numerous benefits to sxc investors. importantly, the merger streamlines our corporate structure, creates a larger stand-alone operating company with increased float and trading liquidity, generates immediate cash flow accretion to shareholders, lowers our cost of funding, better positions us to execute our strategic growth initiatives, and return capital to shareholders. we look forward to the successful close of this transaction and realizing the benefits to drive significant value for all suncoke stakeholders.
with that, i'll turn it over to fay to review our first quarter earnings. fay?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks mike, and good morning, everyone. turning to slide 6. our first quarter net income attributable to sxc was $0.15 per share. eps was up $0.02 versus the prior year period as strong operating performance from our coke segment was partially offset by higher depreciation expense. from an adjusted ebitda perspective, we finished the first quarter at $67.3 million, up 5% versus 2018. the increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes at indiana harbor. moving on to the detailed adjusted ebitda bridge on slide 7. we are pleased with the strong performance in the first quarter and as you can see, consolidated adjusted ebitda is up $3.3 million over the prior year. our coke segment performed well this quarter. these results reflect a $2.6 million adjusted ebitda improvement due to increased volumes. we continue to see sustained operating performance from rebuilt ovens at indiana harbor, which is the primary driver of this increase in production.
coke results also benefited from the timing and scope of planned outages. we did not have any planned outages in the first quarter of 2019 as we did in the prior year period, but we will perform normal routine maintenance work and upgrade work on our heat recovery steam generators and flue gas desulfurization systems across our facilities throughout the year. this work, which will benefit the long-term reliability and operational performance of our assets, was built into our full-year guidance. these improvements began in the second quarter and will impact quarter-over-quarter comparability. the coke segment also benefited this quarter from higher met coal prices and favorable coal cost reimbursement at jewell. as a reminder, while we do pass through the cost of coal to our customers, we generate incremental adjusted ebitda from higher coal prices due to improved yield gain calculations.
as mike referenced, partially offsetting the higher coal prices was lower coal-to-coke yields. in periods of heavy rainfall, the moisture content of coal used for coke production increases above normal level. the elevated coal moisture levels adversely affected our coal-to-coke yield and in turn reduced adjusted ebitda in the quarter. logistics segment was down $900,000 as compared with the first quarter of 2018. solid increase in transloading revenue at our domestic terminal was offset by lower throughput volumes and increased cost at cmt. the significant rainfall throughout the country contributed to high water levels on the mississippi river, which added about $500,000 in the incremental cost above the prior year. when adding in the slightly favorable results in corporate and other, we are off to a solid start with $67.3 million of adjusted ebitda in q1.
looking at domestic coke results in detail on slide 8. first quarter adjusted ebitda per ton was $58 on over 1 million tons of production. these results reflect an increase of over 40,000 tons of coke production across the fleet. ebitda per ton and production also benefited from the previously discussed favorable coal cost recovery at jewell and the absence of outage work during this quarter. the biggest single increase of production versus the prior year comes from indiana harbor as strong operating performance from the rebuilt ovens drove a 22,000 ton increase in production. as previously discussed, we started work on the final phase of our indiana harbor rebuild campaign in the first quarter. we are currently rebuilding 17 of the 57 ovens and anticipate our first group of ovens will be back in service in june. we remain well positioned to achieve our full-year 2019 indiana harbor guidance of approximately $22 million on 1,025,000 tons of coke production.
overall, we are on track to achieve our full-year domestic coke adjusted ebitda per ton and production guidance. moving to slide 9 to discuss our logistics business. our logistics business generated $12.7 million of adjusted ebitda during the first quarter, a slight decrease over the prior year period as a result of the aforementioned adverse weather. we anticipate additional expenses in q2 related to high water at cmt. however, we expect the second half of the year to normalize. our domestic logistics terminals experienced steady growth in volume, up approximately 350,000 tons as compared to the prior year period. transloading revenue was up $1.6 million as we realized increased volumes at both krt and lake terminal. cmt contributed $10 million of adjusted ebitda on 2.1 million tons in the quarter. first quarter adjusted ebitda does not include $3.9 million of deferred revenue, which will be recognized this year in the fourth quarter.
looking forward, given the forward pricing curve of the export coal market, we anticipate our customers will export less tons than was originally forecasted. we are reducing convent's full-year throughput volumes to 8 million tons to 10 million tons from 11.5 million tons. this includes approximately 1 million tons of merchant business. as a reminder, there is limited ebitda impact from the reduced base volumes due to the nature of our take-or-pay contracts. any deferred revenue related to our coal export customers is recognized typically in the fourth quarter if the throughput tons are below our 10 million ton contract. therefore, we remain solidly on track to achieve our logistics adjusted ebitda guidance of $73 million to $75 million in 2019.
turning to slide 10 and looking at our liquidity position for q1. as you can see on the chart, our consolidated cash balance ended at $144 million. capex was $20 million during the quarter, which included approximately $5 million of indiana harbor oven rebuild work and approximately $3 million related to the granite city gas sharing project. we are in the final stages of the granite city gas sharing project and expect to complete the project by the end of the second quarter. in the quarter, we continued to pay down debt and expect additional deleveraging over the balance of the year. we expect to achieve our consolidated gross leverage target of 3 times by the end of 2019. in total, we ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position of over $400 million.
with that, i will turn it back over to mike.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, fay. wrapping up on slide 11. we remain focused on our operational execution, maximizing the capabilities and performance of our coke and logistics assets, ensuring the successful execution of this year's oven rebuild campaign in indiana harbor. additionally, as you have heard this morning, we continue to make good progress on the simplification transaction and are targeting closing the transaction late in the second quarter or early third quarter. also, we continue to pursue our organic and m&a growth strategies, focused on expanding within business verticals that closely align with our core competencies where our knowledge and expertise can create additional value for our shareholders. finally, we are continuously focused on executing on our commitments to shareholders by achieving our full-year 2019 targets and remain on track to do so after a strong start in q1.
with that, we can open up the call for q&a.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from matthew fields from bank of america merrill lynch. your line is open.
matt castellani -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. matt castellani here on from matt fields. congratulations on the quarter and completing the simplification transaction.
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
thank you. good morning.
matt castellani -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, good morning. now that you guys are a consolidated company, we are wondering whatâs sort of our priorities for free cash flow moving forward and also maybe just any potential you guys see for m&a specifically in the logistics base, maybe to add to that portfolio?
mike rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt. as we've indicated before, our first priority is to continue to pay down debt and achieve our leverage target of less than three times, so that's the first priority. we indicated when we announced simplification that we would intend to begin a common dividend in the first full quarter after simplification is complete. that remains the board's intention. and as we've also indicated, we're going to now look aggressively towards opportunities both organic and through m&a to grow our business. having said that we're now looking aggressively, you shouldn't take that to mean that we won't be extremely disciplined. so while we're working hard, both on organic and inorganic opportunities, we'll remain quite disciplined in that process.
so that's really the priority that we've laid out before and it continues to be our priority now that we've completed simplification.
matt castellani -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. got it. great. thank you for that. i think i mentioned it earlier. today you mentioned that the sxcp bond indenture does, in fact have a requirement that a full 10-q be filed later today. so will that basically be the reporting method going forward for sxcp, just a q by itself and no real press release?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
we plan on furnishing sxcp, stand-alone financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the indenture on our website later today. so you should look for full financials on the website later today.
matt castellani -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, great. thanks very much, guys, and congratulations again.

your next question comes from daniel scott from clarksons. your line is open.
daniel scott -- clarksons -- analyst 
good morning. thanks. real solid quarter on the coke making side. i wanted to delve a little more into the logistics. and fay you were talking about kind of changes in how the full year looked. i think what you said was you're now expecting 8 million tons of throughput, of which 1 million tons is non-coal. so that kind of ends up being 3 million tons below the take or pay levels. am i thinking it the right way?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
no, the take or pay levels are 10 million tons. so, that's kind of, you know, the base contracts on -- for our coal customers. so we're guiding right now to about 8 million tons of throughput. inclusive, in that 8 million tons is 1 million tons of merchant volume, either aggregates or pet coke or other -- other -- other materials.
so that's kind of where we're shaking out based on kind of the current, you know, the current volumes that we're seeing through the facility.
daniel scott -- clarksons -- analyst
okay, sure. that's helpful. so that, i guess, the run rate year to date and your expectations for the back half of the year at current api 2 pricing would indicate that there's going to be another revenue shortfall in the third quarter that will be realized in the fourth quarter. is that fair?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
that's fair.
daniel scott -- clarksons -- analyst
ok. and then a last question is, there is some distressed companies in the coal sector right now, including one in illinois basin. have you had any pushbacks or attempts to renegotiate or anything on your take or pays? and if you could help me out also, what are the terms of that for next year and beyond for the take or pays?
mike rippey -- president and chief executive officer
we fully expect our customers to perform their obligations under any contract, take or pay or otherwise that we have.
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, and the contract as, you know, the expiration of those contracts isnât until 2022. and so the volume commitments are the same in 2020 as they are in 2019.
daniel scott -- clarksons -- analyst
okay, great. thank you, very, very helpful.
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer

and you're next question comes from lucas pipes from b riley fbr. your line is open.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. i wanted to ask kind of a higher, bigger picture question on the steel making, coke making side. obviously, there's been a lot of talk about new eas capacity coming online over the next few years. and mike, i was curious kind of how do you think this may play out in terms of market share for blast furnaces? and also, how do you think this will impact your business going forward? very much appreciate your thoughts. thank you.
mike rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well, lucas, this is really a better question, i think, for the steel makers to answer. you read and concern ourselves with the same things you do with regard to capacity additions. you know, those are announced capacity additions. i believe sdi now has more recently confirmed the sighting of their 3 million ton facility. but some of those other announcements are just that. because something's announced doesn't mean it's built. the market for light flat roll continues to grow as it has historically, at kind of half the gdp. infrastructure spending were to increase as it needs over the coming years. there will be greater demand than lesser. so there's room for demand to continue to grow given the fundamentals of our economy, which would absorb, of course, some of that capacity.
also, as you're aware, during this run up that we saw rapid run up in hot roll prices last year, some capacity which had been idled came back on line. some of that capacity, i use the word tertiary, it kind of comes and goes. so some of that capacity could come back off of line. i'm speculating now and again, it's a better question for the steel producers in terms of how they intend to defend and grow their market share in a market that's always seen new investment imports, clear our market. as you're well aware, the u.s. steel market is in structural deficit and is requiring of imports just to balance itself.
so i think you have to think about the presence of imports when you talk about additional capacity, it's not static, itâs rather quite elastic. so imports could be part of that. i think sti has in fact said that that they're well positioned to defend against imports with their new mill in texas.
so it's a good question, but there's a lot more in play than simply adding announced capacity and concluding somehow that has to be surrendered by the existing market. i think our customers are very well positioned to serve the markets that they do. and again, that's a better question for them.
but they've been at it for a long time and i think their customers appreciate the support that they provide with product and innovation and a variety of other services. so -- well, good question. let's wait and see, but we're not overly concerned at this point in time. we -- we believe our customers can compete well.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
that's very helpful. i appreciate that color and that's the real answer. to follow up on one of the earlier questions, you now have more free cash flow to deploy. and with the backdrop from the prior question, kind of where does -- where do investments on the steel making side fit in that you kind of rank your priorities, logistics, steel making, maybe a new business line altogether?
kind of if you could prioritize and order those potential areas of m&a, i would very much appreciate that. thank you.
mike rippey -- president and chief executive officer
we would rank them, on a variety of terms. most importantly would be the risk adjusted return thatâs available to us for making an investment. so if i could make an investment in steel, which provided a risk adjusted return, that's higher than logistics, that's what we do. quite similarly, if logistics was offering us a return which was higher on a risk adjusted basis in steel, that's where we put it. historically, the highest returns have come from organic growth. you know, we're making an investment, as you know, now in the rebuild of the remaining 57 batteries, the b batteries at the indiana harbor works.
our board approved that investment based on its return, the organic opportunities to incrementally grow your business tend to be high returning. so growing our foundation is something that more traditionally has appealed to us. the further we get from things that we know and understand, our requirement for return would grow quite materially. so things that are close to home we understand well. we have technologies, we have operating expertise, we know markets, we know customers. those are the first places we're going to look, because we believe we can add the most value in those areas.
so it's on a return basis. you know, we're not looking at one opportunity, you raised logistics and steel investments more favorably or less than the other. does that answer your question, lucas? did we lose everybody? hello.
operator
your next question comes from nathan martin. your line is open.
nathan martin -- seaport global -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my question, guys. just again, going back to an earlier question, i think it was by dan, adding to the logistics question. if international thermal prices continue to remain at these depressed levels and you know, export coal continues fall off, how are you guys thinking about having to back fill or augment that volume and the ebitda once those take or pays do expire at the end of 2022?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
so as you know, we've been actively working on optimizing our cmt facility for, you know, over the last year or so. and mike mentioned the addition of -- of a new contract to move pet coke through the facility. and so we've been we've been constantly kind of working at getting new -- new volume through the facility.
right now, you know that -- that facility has the ability to have throughput volumes of up to 15 million tons. and so we have an opportunity there actually to providing incremental ebitda. it's something that we are incredibly focused on. and it's taken some time, though, actually, to secure that new business.
and so i think, you know, we are working on the diversification of products. we're working on the diversification of customers. and that's something that's top of mind for us.
nathan martin -- seaport global -- analyst
all right. i appreciate that, fay. and then another question, kind of unrelated, but going back to april 2016, you guys sold some of your coke and coal assets to revelation energy, and i believe it's about $10.3 million to assume those mines and some reclamation liabilities, which were around $12 million. i guess, it's two questions around. is revelation energy still producing and supplying coal to jewell coke? and then is there any risk that those reclamation liabilities ever return to sxc if something happens with revelation? thank you.
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
so you're really testing my memory here, going all the way back to 2016. but i'll answer the reclamation liability. first, those reclamation liabilities are the responsibility of revelation. that was part of the agreement when we divested of those assets. and then as far as coal supply, you know, we have the opportunity to strip coal from a number of vendors in order to supply jewell coal. and we work with our coal procurement department to ensure that we have an adequate supply of the right types of coals to each of our locations to maintain the integrity of our coke making assets as well as to produce coke and spec with our -- for our customers. so, you know, we are, you know, we've got kind of the right coal right now for jewell and the other facilities.
nathan martin -- seaport global -- analyst
so is revelation a part of that blend currently fay or no then? and does it need to be, i guess, if something were to happen, if this comes my way?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
you know, like i said, you know, we have--we have a variety of sources that we could procure from. and it doesn't necessarily need to be part of that coal blend in order for the facility to operate as intended.
nathan martin -- seaport global -- analyst
would it be more costly to move to a different product?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
you know, there's -- there's specifics about kind of coal and â and -- and transportation costs and -- and the right type of coal. and, you know, if you're talking specifically about jewell, jewell coal is really kind of earmarked towards a recovery of that coal prices earmarked towards what haverhill coal -- coal is procured at. so there's always a bit of differential. you know, in my prepared comments, i mentioned that, we, in the first kind of and you see this in the first quarter as well as in second quarter, that we've had kind of favorable recovery. we're dual coal versus kind of the benchmark price that haver held for the first six months.
mike rippey -- president and chief executive officer
and you'll remember that one of the benefits of our technology is the ability to change coal blends almost on a continuous basis. and fay remind me, but i think we had in our fleet last year over 50 blend changes. so we continue to look at coal pricing, the associated logistics cost of delivering that coal to our facility. so we're continuously rebalancing and optimizing our coal blends and we do that in conjunction with our customers. and you'll recall that most of all of our coal costs are passed directly through to our customers. so we continuously look at opportunities, again, with our customers in the marketplace to optimize the coal blend. so change is something that we do and we're pleased that our technology allows us to make these blend changes without jeopardy to the asset itself and that's not necessarily the case with all coke making technology.
nathan martin -- seaport global -- analyst
got it. i really appreciate the comments, guys, and congratulations again on reaching the simplification transaction.
mike rippey -- president and chief executive officer

good morning. my name is jacqueline and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the sun coke energy inc. q2 2019 earnings call. all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. after the speakers remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [operator instructions] thank you, shantanu aggarwal. you may begin your conference.
shantanu agrawal -- investor relations 
good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss sun coke energy's q2 2019 earnings. with me today are mike rippey, president and chief executive officer and fay west, senior vice president and chief financial officer. following management's prepared remarks, will open the call for q&a. this conference call is being webcast live on the investor relations section of our website and a replay will be available later today. if we don't get your questions on the call today, please feel free to reach out to our investor relations team.
before i turn things over to mike, let me remind you that the various remarks we make on today's call regarding future expectations constitute forward looking statements. the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in our sec filings apply to the remarks we make today. these documents are available on our website as a reconciliations to non-gaap financial measures discussed on today's call. with that i will now turn things over to mike.
mike rippey -- president and chief executive officer 
thanks, shantanu. good morning and thank you for joining us on our call this morning. before we review second quarter results, i wanted to provide a few brief thoughts on the overall market and where we see things for the balance of the year. since our fourth quarter earnings call, u.s. steel demand has softened somewhat, with domestic capacity utilization recently dropping below 80% for the first time since september of 2018.
additionally, hot rolled benchmark pricing has fallen from $720 per ton in january to a low of $500 per ton before recovering to $580 per ton today. as we look at the futures pricing curve, coupled with price hikes recently announced by major producers, we believe domestic steel prices have bottomed and are entering a period of relative stability. looking at the current state of the coke market, u.s. steel announced the temporary idling of two blast furnaces and while u.s. steel is one of our key customers, there is no direct impact on suncoke. we continue to supply u.s. steel high quality coke from our granite city facility. due to the temporary idling of these facilities, we believe the coke market is slightly oversupplied in the near-term, assuming no reduction in supply. on the thermal coal export side, we saw a sharp decline in api 2 and newcastle prices, resulting in lower than expected export volumes in the first half of 2019.
export pricing was impacted by lower demand and supply increases from other regions, in particular russia. we expect the export volumes will remain subdued for the balance of the year. in summary, while the macro environment has weakened somewhat over the first half of the year, the impact to our 2019 outlook is minimal based on the nature of our long term take or pay contracts. we will continue to look for opportunities and maximize our operations to serve our customersâ current and future needs.
moving on to second quarter highlights. we completed the simplification transaction on june 28th, with strong support from sxc shareholders. as we have discussed, this is a very important transaction for our company that creates immediate and long term value for suncoke shareholders. the merger creates significant flexibility to allow us to execute against our strategic growth initiatives as well as return capital to shareholders.
at the halfway point of the year, we continue to make good progress toward achieving our 2019 objectives, and our second quarter performance and financial results demonstrate this progress. weather continued to be a factor in the second quarter affecting coal to coke yields on the coke side and causing high water cost at cmt. we are pleased with the operational performance of our plants as they manage through these adverse conditions, delivering solid second quarter adjusted ebitda of at $63.1 million.
our domestic logistics facilities continue to see solid volumes and delivered results as expected for the second quarter. a convent, throughput volumes were lower than the prior year, which is reflective of the subdued macroeconomic conditions for thermal coal. our coke business delivered another consistent quarter and results to reflect increases in coke production as well as good cost discipline. rebuilt ovens at indiana harbor are consistently performing at a high level and we can see this favorable impact in our financial results. as mentioned on our first quarter call, the final phase of the indiana harbor rebuild campaign is well under way and the first 14 ovens were placed back on line in early july. we remain on schedule to complete the oven rebuilds by the end of the year and anticipate achieving indiana harbor's 2019 targets. by the end of the year, we'll complete a rebuild of all 268 ovens and expect the facility to be back at 1.22 million tons of nameplate capacity in 2020. turning to the balance sheet, we're on pace to achieve our gross leverage target of three times by paying down debt through the balance of the year. and lastly, with yearâto-date adjusted ebitda of approximately $130 million, we're well positioned to achieve our full year 2019 guidance targets. with that, i'll turn it over to fay to review our second quarter earnings in details.
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good morning, everyone. turning to slide four, our second quarter net income attributable to sxc was $0.03 per share. eps was down $0.03 versus the prior year period due to lower throughput volumes in our logistics business, higher depreciation expense on certain coke assets and transaction costs associated with the simplification transaction. quarter over quarter comparisons were also impacted by a $5.4 million loss from the sale of an equity method investment realized in the second quarter of 2018. from an adjusted ebitda perspective, we finished the second quarter at $63.1 million, down $4.2 million versus 2018. the decrease was due to lower throughput volumes at cmt, partially offset by good performance in the domestic coke segment.
moving to the detailed adjusted ebitda bridge on slide 5, we are pleased with the overall operating performance of our plant in the second quarter, despite the challenging weather conditions we faced at our facility. our coke segments performed well this quarter and the results reflect strong cost control, as well as higher coke volumes, primarily from indiana harbor. this benefit was partially offset by the timing and scope of planned outages, which are in line with our full year expectations. the coke segment also benefited this quarter from higher met coal prices and favorable coal cost reimbursement at jewell. as a reminder, while we do pass through the cost of our coal to our customers, we generate incremental adjusted ebitda from higher coal prices due to improved yield gain calculations.
offsetting these gains were lower coal to coke yields at our domestic coke facilities. as we previously mentioned, during periods of heavy rainfall, the moisture content of coal used for coke production increases above normal levels. the elevated coal moisture levels adversely affect our volumes and coal to coke yields. in the logistics segment, cmt throughput volumes of approximately 2 million tons were slightly lower than the first quarter of 2019 and lower than the second quarter of 2018. throughput volumes have been impacted by lower api 2 and newcastle pricing, and demand for thermal coal in the export markets. second adjusted ebitda does not include $5.5 million of deferred revenue, which will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019. after adding in the favorable results in corporate and other, we finished the second quarter with $63.1 million of adjusted ebitda.
looking more closely at our domestic coke results on slide 6. second quarter adjusted ebitda per ton was $55 and over 1 million tons of production. these results reflect an increase of over 30,000 tons of coke production quarter-over-quarter, mainly from indiana harbor rebuild ovens. ebitda per ton also benefited from the previously discussed lower operating costs across our fleet. as mentioned before, the lower operating costs were partially offset by the timing and scope of planned outages. we continue to perform normal routine maintenance work and upgrade work on our heat-recovery steam generators and flue gas de-sulfurization systems across our facilities. this work, which will benefit the long term reliability and operational performance of our assets, was built into our full year guidance. these improvements will impact quarter-over-quarter comparability for the remainder of the year. as mike previously mentioned, indiana harbor continues to deliver at a sustained level. the 2019 b battery rebuild campaign is in full swing and the first set of 14 rebuilt ovens were brought back into service in early july. we are currently rebuilding the remaining 43 b battery ovens and anticipate the final set of ovens coming back online in late november or early december. considering the progress to-date, we remain positioned to achieve our full-year 2019 indiana harbor guidance of approximately $22 million of adjusted ebitda on 1.025 million tons of coke production. overall, we are on track to achieve our full year domestic coke adjusted ebitda per ton and production guidance.
slipping to slide 7 to discuss our logistics business. our logistics business generated $11.8 million of adjusted ebitda during the second quarter as compared to $19.7 million in the prior year period.
the decrease in adjusted ebitda is primarily due to lower throughput volumes at cmt. our domestic terminals performed in line with expectations, handling 3.6 million tons during the quarter. although tons were slightly lower quarter-over-quarter, adjusted ebitda was higher due to the mix of handling services provided. cmt contributed $8.5 million of adjusted ebitda on approximately 2 million tons of throughput in the quarter. volumes remain depressed based on current market conditions. and as we look forward, given the forward pricing curve of the export coal market and expected demand, we now anticipate our customers will not export more than the current run rate. we anticipate that throughput volumes will be approximately 8 million tons in 2019 and this number includes approximately 1 million tons of merchant business.
second quarter adjusted ebitda does not include $5.5 million of deferred revenue. as a reminder, there is a limited adjusted ebitda impact from the reduced base volumes due to the nature of our take or pay contracts. any deferred revenue related to our coal export customers is typically recognized in the fourth quarter if throughput volumes are below the contracted 10 million tons. based on throughput tons to date, we anticipate recognizing approximately $9.5 million of deferred revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019.
despite the reduced throughput volumes at cmt, we are on track to achieve logistics adjusted ebitda at the low end of our guidance range of $73 million to $75 million for the full year 2019 after considering deferred revenue from the take or pay contracts. turning to slide 8, and our liquidity position for q2. as you can see on the chart our consolidated cash balance ended the quarter at $102 million. in the quarter cash flow from operating activities finished at $300,000. strong operating performance was offset by higher inventory levels, timing of receivables and the timing of interest payments. weather, specifically flooding on waterways and terminals affected the timing and procurement of coal in the second quarter.
coal inventories were temporarily increased this quarter to ensure that an adequate coal supply was maintained for the seamless production of coke at our facilities. we anticipate that inventories will revert back to normal levels in the back half of the year. additionally, coal inventory at the indiana harbor facility increased as additional coal will be used for increased coke production as rebuilt ovens come back on line. once again, we anticipate that inventory levels will revert back to normalized levels in the back half of the year.
given the timing aspect of these working capital items, we remain in line with our full year operating cash flow guidance of one $176 million to $191 million. capex was $31 million during the quarter, which included approximately $11 million of indiana harbor oven rebuild work and approximately $8 million related to the granite city gas sharing project. the granite city gas sharing project was completed and put in service at the end of the second quarter. we do not anticipate any further capex related to gas sharing. in total, we ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position of over $360 million. with that, i will turn it back over to mike.
mike rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, fay. wrapping up on slide 9, we remain focused on operational execution, maximizing the capability and performance of our coke and logistics assets and ensuring the successful execution of this year's oven rebuild campaign at the indiana harbor. additionally, as mentioned at the start of the call, we delivered on one of our key initiatives having completed the simplification transaction. this is our strategic transaction for suncoke, positioning us for success in the future. also, we continue to pursue our organic and m&a growth strategies, focused on expanding within business verticals that closely align with our core competencies, where our knowledge and expertise can create additional value for our shareholders.
to this end, we recently signed a long-term take or pay contract with an oil refinery to handle pet coke through convent. and finally, we are continuously focused on executing on our commitments to shareholders by achieving our full year 2019 financial targets and are well positioned to do so midway through the year.
with that, we can open up the call for q&a.

thank you [operator instructions] your first question comes from matt vittorioso with jefferies. your line is open.
matt vittorioso -- jefferies -- analyst
yes, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. so just on the updated guidance. the roughly $25 million reduction to your full year ebitda guidance seems to be a 100% murray related. so is there any foresight impact from -- baked into that guidance change? and also, are they -- has foresight continued to pay its take-or-pay?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
we have and you're correct the updated guidance reflects substantially the murray situation.
matt vittorioso -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then -- so i guess, big picture question. as we try to think about 2020, you've got, obviously, the impact of murray, potentially some additional impact if foresight goes down a similar path. and then i think on the coke side, hopefully, you'll have some acceleration or some improvement at indiana harbor. any way for us to think about the net of those three sort of large moving parts around ebitda for 2020?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
matt it's premature really for us to be providing any kind of guidance for 2020. we will do that when we announce our fourth quarter results. the comments you make are appropriate. we've continued to experience excellent results from the rebuild ovens at the harbor works. we expect to complete that rebuild project here in late november of this year and have the full capability of 1.2 million tons available to our customer next year. so that's a good positive for us and one that we've talked about at some length in the past. the new situation is the, the change in circumstance at cmt, with regard to both murray and potentially felt. so as that situation, which is quite fluid evolves, we'll -- we'll reflect that in our guidance for 2020 at the appropriate time.
matt vittorioso -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then on capital allocation, thanks for the detail on that. i guess just as i think about priorities, from a debt perspective, you've said that you'll maintain -- you've achieved and you'll look to maintain or even improve that 3 times gross leverage. based on the $240 million to $250 million of ebitda guidance, assuming you were able to maintain that in 2020, that would imply that you'd still want to take out some additional debt to get down to sort of 3 times growth. so would that be a priority over share buybacks? would you look to achieve and maintain that gross leverage target before you were aggressive with buying back shares?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
matt, it's good question. it has been a priority of our company to get to this 3 times and perhaps below and it remains so. so having appropriate level of debt for our company is a priority, has been a priority and will remain a priority. your point about if our ebitda were to be 250 next year, that's your number not mine, we would expect to maintain our debt ratio of 3 times. and as you suggest that would require us to pay down additional debt.
matt vittorioso -- jefferies -- analyst
yes. okay. one last one for me just on the coke side. obviously, there's questions out there around some of the more near-term contract maturities. i think you've got some coming up with arcelor sooner than later. any -- i mean, are those conversations that you're having currently? any high-level insight as to when we might expect some news on those near-term maturities?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
the maturities you refer to are at the end of 2020. and as you might well expect we've begun discussions with our customer and beyond that we can't comment.
matt vittorioso -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thanks for the time, appreciate it.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
your next question comes from matthew fields with bank of america. your line is open.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
hey guys, was -- just for housekeeping purposes, can you give us the effect of currency on the brazil coke segment?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
it's very nominal. and so i think it -- i think on an annual basis, it's less than a couple of hundred thousand dollar.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
completely immaterial.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. and then on the debt reduction front following on matt's question it kind of -- we're looking at a 2020 where murray and foresight are meaningfully less to your results based on potentially new contract struck as a result of restructuring. do you think of 3.0 times, as still the bogey with meaningful -- meaningfully less coal exposure? and does that still require you to buyback or reduce debt like, you know, you said you would still go into that 3 times target.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
three times is the target has been and will be.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. and then obviously good -- you did a good amount of bond repurchase in the quarter [indecipherable] with bonds and the low to mid 80s at this point, is that something you'd expect to accelerate or continue?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
we'll look to maintain the leverage ratio of three times in the most cost effective manner available to us.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. and then just trying to triangulate cash flow for 2020 although it's still early. based on your '19 capex guidance and we kind of exclude indiana harbor and some gas sharing is 65 to 70, the way you see kind of a base sort of maintenance capex level for suncoke?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i think that's the right number over a period of time. so $65 million to $75 million ongoing maintenance capex. you may have depending on specific projects, a year where you higher and a year where you're lower. we will be giving kind of full some guidance on both ebitda as well as capex in january, february timeframe for 2020. but if you know -- if you wanted to use that as a rough estimate over a number of years that's a good number.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great, that's it for me. thanks very much.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from lucas pipes with b riley, your line is open.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
hi. so the implied ebitda guidance for q4 in the logistics business, i believe is around $10 million with that be kind of a combination of felp and then the river terminals, or am i missing something there?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, that's all in. so our cmt guidance on a full-year basis is what we're estimating between $31 million and $33 million on a full-year. so guidance for cmt is in the fourth quarter is between $5 million and $7 million.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
and so, --.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and the balance then to get to that full-year number, lucas, it's going to be from the river terminal.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
it's very helpful. thank you. and in terms of felp, do you have receivables balance?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so felp has been shipping tons through the facility all year. as we stand today, they're continuing to move product here in the fourth quarter and they are current on their receivables.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
very helpful, thank you for that. and then just kind of longer term thinking about cmt, murray made some comments about the economics of exports in their filing. how do you think about cmt kind of beyond the current volatility, where is its place in the gulf, where do you see market rates, any sort of color, comments on the long-term outlook for this asset would be very much appreciated. thank you.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
cmt is very low cost facility in a very highly automated, it's unique in many ways, with its ability to receive rail very far down the river as well as its large capabilities. so the asset itself, we believe is a low cost provider down on in the region. what you alluded to lucas, i think is the challenging conditions that traditional customers find themselves with api2 prices being down in the mid 50s and as we've said in the past numbers above 70 really provide better opportunities for our producers. so it's a very challenging environment right now and it's most evidence with the bankruptcy we have seen, most notably for us, murray this year so, notwithstanding the fact that we're a low cost provider it's a very challenging market for exporters of coal into the international marketplace right now.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
how easily could this capacity allocated toward other commodities?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well, that's the challenge obviously that we face today. over the past few years, we've been incrementally building our business down there. that's in the presence of 10 million tons of contract to take-or-pay business for the coal customers. now with the filing of murray, we have a substantial ability to go out into the marketplace and then fill that capacity. that's going to be our focus now that obligation is in present to us. as we've said in the past, the supply chains are quite sticky and they will remain so. so we've got our work to do and we will do our work, but it's not like flipping a light switch that we simply replace these volumes on short notice. it's going to take a significant effort on our part to replace these volumes and as you can well imagine we're already about that process, but it's going to take time.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
that's, that's very helpful. thank you, mike, for that commentary. and then just following up on some of the earlier comments regarding debt repurchases, leverage ratios, share buyback obviously all connected. could you maybe describe opportunistic and a little bit more detail, do you have a certain, expect -- do you have an expectation around how much capital you will be for example returning by year-end or a monthly kind of run rate in terms of the share buyback that how -- when we think about the share repurchase authorization of the size of it how quickly do you anticipate to execute against that? thank you.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
we can't comment on that point lucas. clearly, the board authorized a new program with the expectation that we would complete the existing program. so through november, we've given the exact numbers of repurchase that we've done. i believe the number and somebody can help me if i screw it up is $23 million of repurchases through november 1. we have approximately 14 to go -- 16 to go relative to the existing program. so we have a program that continues and we didn't authorize $100 million new program, if we didn't think we would exhaust the existing program.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
[speech overlap] i was just going to say -- we're not -- we can't be terribly prescriptive on how we're going to execute that, but it's you know we need to just remember that we've established a dividend. we put something in place that was sustainable and we believe, and the board will go through this kind of process as it normally does to establish a dividend, but that is something that is sustainable for our company. and even in light of kind of the situation that we find ourselves in with cmt. we also were really kind of clear on our desire to maintain that three times leverage target, right. and so -- and we'll have more information as we develop our 2020 plan, as we develop our 2020 free cash flow and our capex. but clearly the maintenance of the dividend, the maintaining our leverage ratio of three times and then executing against the share repurchases opportunistically, those are our priorities and there will be some fluidity to that.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
that's very helpful. i appreciate all of this and best of luck.

michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks shantanu. good morning and thank you all for joining us on today's call. we have quite a few things to cover, so let's just get right into it. i'd like to start with our logistics business and walk through some meaningful challenges we are experiencing. in previous quarters, i have talked about the thermal coal export market and how it continues to face headwinds with weak power demand, increased russian exports, and an oversupply of lng. during the quarter, that trend continued and was exasperated by significant deterioration in the business of our two largest customers for cmt. as you know, cmt is underpinned by two long-term take-or-pay contracts, each contract for 5 million tons of throughput.
our customers murray energy and foresight energy account for the majority of cmt's adjusted ebitda and have been challenged by both market conditions and their respective capital structures. the sharp decrease in coal export prices coupled with declining domestic coal demand have negatively impacted murray and foresight's free cash flows and liquidity positions. last week, murray filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and foresight extended the grace period repayment on interest by another 60 days. these developments have decreased the number of coal export tons that cmt handled during the quarter and is expected to handle for the balance of 2019. we now anticipate the throughput volumes for the full year at cmt will be approximately 6.5 million tons, 5 million of which will come from our coal export customer foresight energy, murray has not shipped any meaningful volumes through cmt during the first nine months of 2019 nor made any payments under its take-or-pay agreement and we do not anticipate that it will ship any volumes or make any payments in the fourth quarter.
due to the financial impact of murray energy's chapter 11 filing on our logistics business, we are lowering our consolidated ebitda guidance down to $240 million to $250 million from the previous guidance of $266 million to 276 million. on the strength of our core coke making operations will somewhat mitigate the impact from the weakness at cmt, we felt it was prudent to update our guidance given the uncertainty of our cmt customers. notwithstanding these significant challenges, we continue to believe in the potential of our cmt business and are highly focused on exploring opportunities for ways we can maximize our operations and diversify the products we move in order to secure new customers and incremental volume through the facility.
now turning to our financial performance. during the quarter, we generated $66.7 million in adjusted ebitda and $197.1 million in adjusted ebitda year-to-date. these results reflect the strong performance of our domestic coke operations and the lower throughput volumes at convent marine terminal.
at the heart of our business, our coke operations are performing well and we are on schedule to complete the final phase of indiana harbor rebuild in the fourth quarter and expect the facility to be back at 1.2 million tons of nameplate capacity in 2020. we have been extremely pleased with the results of our rebuilt ovens to date. we have executed the rebuild process with methodical and thoughtful approach and the results at indiana harbor are a testament to the hard work of our team.
looking at our year-to-date results, domestic coke ebitda is up over $18 million versus the prior year period. and we are solidly on track to meet our full year guidance expectations at the top end of the range. as we near the completion of our rebuild process, we anticipate our results will continue to benefit from the more efficient rebuilt ovens as a major portion of the rebuild initiative is now behind us.
while the issues with our cmt customers have presented us with significant challenges to work through, we will accelerate the initiatives we have undertaken to strengthen our business. in addition, the operational achievements we have made improving efficiency to our fleet earlier this year, we completed our simplification transaction, setting the foundation for a more flexible structure from which we can pursue strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders.
i'll talk in more detail later to the progress we have made on our capital allocation priorities, this quarter was a strong one on this front. in addition to our organic growth initiative at the indiana harbor, we have made significant improvement to our balance sheet strength, returned meaningful capital to our shareholders through our dividend and opportunistic share repurchases made during the quarter, and established a new $100 million share repurchase authorization.
with that, i will turn it over to fay to review our third quarter earnings in detail. fay?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks mike, and good morning everyone. turning to slide 4. our third quarter net loss attributable to sxc was $1.81 per share, reflecting a $1.94 per share impairment related to charges we took on our logistics goodwill and long-lived assets at cmt. excluding these non-cash charges, adjusted net income attributable to sxc was $0.13 per share, which was down $0.05 versus third quarter 2018, mainly due to the absence of tax benefit recorded in the prior period.
from an adjusted ebitda perspective, we finished the third quarter at $66.7 million, up $0.7 million versus the third quarter 2018. the increase was due to higher volumes at indiana harbor and a decrease in the scope of outage work at granite city, but these favorable increases were mostly offset by lower throughput volumes at cmt.
moving to the detailed adjusted ebitda bridge on slide 5, as you could see consolidated adjusted ebitda was up approximately $0.7 million versus the prior year period. as mike mentioned, our coke segment performed at a high level and delivered excellent results. the oven rebuilds at indiana harbor are yielding higher production and an increase in operating efficiency. the coke segment also benefited this quarter from lower outage related costs. there was a major outage in the third quarter of last year to perform maintenance on herzig and fgd unit at granite city. as a reminder, the financial impact of planned outages are included in our full year guidance. planned outages generally result in incremental operating and maintenance cost, lower energy revenue, and lower coke volumes. timing and scope of outages vary year-to-year, which in turn affects year-over-year comparability.
in terms of our logistics business, cmt throughput volumes continue to be impacted by lower api2 and new capital pricing, as well as demand for thermal coal and export markets and the liquidity challenges faced by our customers outlined by mike. cmt handled only 1.3 million tons this quarter as compared to 3.2 million tons during the third quarter last year, which drove an $11.3 million decrease in adjusted ebitda. after adding in favorable results in corporate and other, mainly due to mark-to-market adjustments in deferred compensation, we finished the quarter with $66.7 million of adjusted ebitda.
looking at domestic coke results in detail on slide 6. third quarter adjusted ebitda per ton was $57 on 1,059,000 tons of production. these results reflect an increase in coke production of over 20,000 tons of granite city and 17,000 tons at indiana harbor quarter-over-quarter. as discussed, the increase in production at indiana harbor is mainly due to oven rebuild. the increase in production at granite city quarter-over-quarter is due to fewer outage days in 2019. energy production and operating costs were also favorably impacted at granite city, due to the aforementioned shorter outage.
i want to briefly elaborate on the indiana harbor oven rebuild project. as evident from our results, the rebuild ovens are performing well. the 2019 b battery rebuild campaign is nearing completion and 40 out of the 57 ovens have returned to service. we are currently rebuilding the remaining 17 b battery ovens and anticipate the final set of ovens coming back online in late november. based on performance today, we are well positioned to execute our full year 2019 indiana harbor guidance of $22 million of adjusted ebitda and are on track to achieve the 1.2 million tons production level in 2020. with solid performance through the first three quarters of the year, we expect to deliver results at the top end of our full-year domestic coke adjusted ebitda per ton guidance of $53 per ton to $55 per ton.
flipping to slide 7 to discuss our logistics business. the logistics business generated $9.6 million of adjusted ebitda during the third quarter as compared to $21 million in the prior year period. the decrease in ebitda is primarily due to the lower throughput volumes at cmt, which we have discussed at length. our domestic terminals were also impacted by softer demand this quarter handling approximately 3.4 million tons during the quarter versus 3.7 million in the prior year period.
cmt contributed $7.4 million of adjusted ebitda and approximately 1.3 million tons in the quarter. volumes remain depressed based on current market conditions. and as we look forward, given the forward pricing curve of the coal export market and liquidity challenges faced by our customers, we now anticipate that throughput volumes for the full year will be approximately 6.5 million tons in 2019 with 5 million tons coming through foresight energy and the remaining 1.5 million tons coming from other products.
as mike mentioned murray energy has not shipped any meaningful volumes through cmt this year and we do not anticipate any additional volumes in the fourth quarter. based on the recent bankruptcy filing by murray, we do not believe that the existing take-or-pay receivables are collectible nor do we believe that we will collect take-or-pay amounts that would be earned in the fourth quarter. as a result, we are lowering our full-year 2019 logistics ebitda guidance to be between $43 million and $45 million versus the previous guidance of $73 million to $75 million. we also recorded a non-cash impairment charge related to this as we previously discussed. our revised guidance includes a $31 million to $33 million adjusted ebitda contribution from cmt. lowered guidance mainly reflects the portion of revenue contributed by murray deemed as non-collectible.
turning to slide 8 and our liquidity position for q3. as you could see on the chart, we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of approximately $94 million. cash flow from operating activities, generated close to $85 million, due to strong operating performance, the timing of cash receipts, and lower inventory balances. we spent $28.4 million on capex in the quarter, which included approximately $11 million on indiana harbor oven rebuild work. full year capex is estimated to be between $110 million and $120 million, unchanged from our previous guidance. during the quarter, we used $46.6 million of cash to extinguish $50 [phonetic] million face value sxcp notes, with an average bond repurchase price of $0.934 on the dollar.
by the end of the quarter on an ltm basis, we achieved our leverage ratio target of three times gross debt to ebitda, we also use $13.2 million to repurchase approximately 2.1 million shares at an average price of $6.38 during the quarter. additionally, we refinanced our revolving credit facilities during the quarter, which lowered our interest rate, increased debt capacity and extended the maturity date. in total, we ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position of approximately $338 million.
before i turn it back over to mike, i want to highlight that we are also lowering our full-year operating cash flow guidance to $150 million to $160 million, which reflects changes in ebitda guidance due to the financial challenges of our coal export customers.
mike?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thank you fay. slide 9 lays out our capital allocation framework and priorities. despite the challenges within our logistics segment, we have aggressively pursued a balanced, yet opportunistic approach to capital allocation. since the announcement of our simplification transaction, we have reiterated multiple times that management is committed to utilizing suncoke's strong cash flow in the most advantageous and value enhancing manner for our shareholders.
our capital allocation progress this quarter, displays the financial flexibility we have built within the company. creating value for shareholders is the goal of our management team and board. and our solid cash flows allowed us to return meaningful capital to shareholders through a share repurchase plan initiated in early august. through november 1st, we have repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares at an average price of $6.02. in addition, to the share repurchases made during the quarter, our board authorized a new $100 million for future share repurchases, which we expect to execute opportunistically as the market dictates balanced against the capital needs of our business. as indicated during the last earnings call, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.06 per share, will be paid on december 2nd.
towards our goal of improving our leverage position, we have extinguished a total of $58 million of debt year-to-date, which includes repurchasing $50 million face value of sxcp 2025 senior notes at a discount. we have now reached our intended long term gross leverage target of three times this quarter. going forward, our goal is to maintain or improve this leverage ratio while balancing our other capital allocation priorities.
and finally, we continue to pursue organic growth opportunities such as the indiana harbor oven rebuilds, which have a very high return on capital. we are keeping a keen eye on the m&a space. but as we have said on every prior occasion we will remain disciplined. our actions this quarter demonstrate our commitment to creating value for shareholders through a disciplined and opportunistic approach to capital allocation. we will continue to find ways to leverage the flexibility we have and opportunistically creating value for our shareholders, while balancing the needs of the business.
let's review our revised guidance on slide 10. we are lowering the consolidated adjusted ebitda guidance down to $240 million to $250 million from the previous guidance of $266 million to $276 million. there is no change to capex or coke production guidance. we are now expecting to deliver at the top end of the domestic coke adjusted ebitda per ton guidance of $53 per ton to $55 per ton. the coal export customer bankruptcy also impacts our operating cash flow guidance lowering it down to $150 million to $160 million versus the previous guidance of $176 million to $191 million. cash tax guidance remains unchanged.
moving on to slide 11, to wrap up. to summarize, we remain confident in the progress we have made, the strength of our core businesses, and the strong and flexible foundation we have worked hard to build in our new simplified structure. through our strong foundation we have the ability to navigate the challenges facing our cmt business, while improving operational efficiency in our coke business and exploring new avenues to leverage our core competencies across the organization.
finally, our focus remains on generating meaningful long-term value for our shareholders. our cash flow is strong and provides us significant flexibility to invest in our business, manage our debt position, and return capital to shareholders through an attractive dividend and opportunistic share repurchases.
with that, we can open up the call for q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of nick jarmoszuk with stifel. nick, your line is open.
nicholas jarmoszuk -- stifel, nicolaus & co., inc. -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the questions. first one on the foundry coke business. can you give us a little detail as to which facility will be producing the foundry coke?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
we will be producing foundry coke out of our jewell facility. we would be able to produce that coke out of other of our facilities, but jewell is well positioned logistically to be the most efficient producer. so we'll be producing out of jewell.
nicholas jarmoszuk -- stifel, nicolaus & co., inc. -- analyst
okay. and then in terms of thinking about the potential ebitda per ton margin, given that it seems like it needs to be in the coke oven for double the amount of time, can we assume that the ebitda margins are going to be materially higher than the existing operations as well?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
as we indicated, approximately a two-for-one replacement ratio. and while we're not providing 2021 guidance today, we are saying that we expect to have a very quick payback on the $12 million investment in capital. so the margin, rather than think about it as per ton is better thought of as per unit of time. so the margins are attractive on a time basis given that it's a two-for-one replacement ratio.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
okay. and then on the haverhill contract, you can correct me if i'm wrong, but the way that i read it is, you'll ship tonnage to arcelor in 2021, but then there is nothing beyond that. is that accurate?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
we have 800,000 tons coming from both facilities in '21. and '22 through '25, we anticipate shipping 400,000 from haverhill, but we have the flexibility should we want to shift that production over to haverhill.
nicholas jarmoszuk -- stifel, nicolaus & co., inc. -- analyst
so it's flexible as to where it can come from?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct.
nicholas jarmoszuk -- stifel, nicolaus & co., inc. -- analyst
between haverhill and jewell?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct.
nicholas jarmoszuk -- stifel, nicolaus & co., inc. -- analyst
okay. and then in terms of the volume decline to arcelor, does that indicate that they're doing something more material on their blast furnace side or how should we think about how they're sourcing their coke that they're going to need to maintain production levels?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well, as it relates to their blast furnace side, that's certainly a better question for them. i think the agreements that we've reach are reflective of the current market circumstance as well as where we have clarity of a view in '21 and '22 and beyond. you shouldn't assume though that we're not in almost a constant dialog with our customers. so our discussions with arcelormittal and other customers are ongoing with regard to their longer term requirements for coke.
nicholas jarmoszuk -- stifel, nicolaus & co., inc. -- analyst
okay. all right, that's all i had. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of matthew castellini with bank of america securities. matthew, your line is open.
matthew castellini -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for taking my question. and i apologize if this was just already answered, i cut out for a bit. but -- so it seems like you're attempting to replace the lost tons from the extended contracts with this foundry coke opportunity. and so if that's lower margin, what's the differential between that and your presumably higher priced blast furnace contract tons?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
i don't want to leave an impression that it's a lower margin at all.
matthew castellini -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
we've made no statement to that effect.
matthew castellini -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. got it. thank you. just second. where do you think you need to get the balance sheet leverage wise over the last couple of years that support if there was sort of a reduced level of ebitda and cash flow based on sort of the different -- the change in contracts?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well, as we have said, our long-term goal continues to be three times, and we'll work toward that. i think capital allocation for 2020 is relatively spoken for in our guidance and it will remain a priority in the years ahead to reduce that debt. so as we talk about 2021, early next year, we'll provide further guidance as to what might be expected in the 2021 period. but we'll continue to look to reduce that to the three times number.
matthew castellini -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. and just lastly, any progress on any asset sales, terminals, etc.?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
now is really not the time to be looking at asset sales of any type. the pandemic has taken a temporary toll on not just the u.s. industrial sector, but the global economy. so our focus currently is to, as we've talked this morning, reduce our cost to the extent possible. recognizing the lower volume levels, we've taken a lot of variable cost out of our, particularly our logistics side where even in the presence of these very, very low volumes, we've been able to maintain positive ebitda as well as look at, on a more permanent basis, our cost structure and that's the $10 million of permanent savings, which begin in 2021.
so our focus now is to generate the $190 million to $200 million of ebitda in 2020 given the greatly reduced volumes on both the logistics and the coke side and be as efficient as we can. as we've said many times, cmt is a very, very efficient terminal, but with the very low volumes, it's hard to demonstrate the real value of that asset. clearly, if an opportunity at attractive and fair price were to be brought to us, we would entertain it.
matthew castellini -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, great. thank you so much for taking the questions.
operator
your next question comes from the line of lucas pipes with b. riley fbr. lucas, your line is open.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
hey, good morning, mike. and first off, congratulations on picking up this call without any operator assistance, it was quite impressive. and speaking of picking things up, obviously with the arcelormittal contract announcement this morning, a lot of questions around there. and it appears a little bit like a now glass half-full, glass half empty type of situation, how would you describe it and how can we get -- how do we get the glass all the way full? thank you very much for your perspective on this.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks for your good questions, lucas. we tend to see the glass already as more than half full. we're pleased to have been able to support our customers this year. we're pleased with the outcome of having 800,000 tons of business from arcelormittal next year in addition to the 1.2 million tons that comes out of a harbor works. but we continue to work with customers. as i said, the industry is currently operating at 59% of capacity. we don't know, i don't think anyone knows, when the industry will fully recover. but when it does, we'll be there with our efficient facilities to serve.
so in the meantime, we again focus on our cost. the addition of foundry to our customer mix, as i said, we're targeting 100,000 next year that replaces 200,000 tons of blast furnace coke. so we've got 800,000, plus if you use the two-for-one replacement ratio, you've got 200,000 tons equivalent of foundry going out next year. we're not stopping at 100 in foundry, there should be no impression of that. it's a 600,000 ton market. and we are going to look to achieve significant market share in that space. we didn't enter this market with the idea of 100,000 tonnes of foundry sales.
that's an initial estimate, our first year in the business. trials with potential customers have gone very, very well. so we looked at good success in foundry. so we're going to pursue foundry hard. and we're, again, in dialog with our blast furnace customers as their markets continue to recover. so that's the focus.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
very helpful, mike. i appreciate that. and two quick questions. one, on foundry coke, why now? is there something that's -- that has allowed this to kind of go make more sense now than in years prior? and then secondly, a very impressive coke margin per ton during the second quarter, can you expand on what's been behind that? and is this a margin that's sustainable as we look ahead into 2021 and beyond? thank you very much for your perspective on this.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
sure. we're not going to start to preview 2021 in this call. but the teams have been working very hard, and i'm very proud of the efforts that all of our coke-producing assets have turned in this year. we've looked to variablize our cost where we can given the lower volume levels, and we're taking our fixed or structural cost as well. so i'm very, very pleased with the cost discipline that everyone's been able to evidence this year.
there is no reason to think that we can't maintain that kind of discipline. certain cost will come back because they are variable, but we're not doing anything to take any risks with regard to the long-term reliability of our assets. so we're not in any way starving an asset. you can do that in the short-term, you can cut back on r&m and save some costs. that's not what's going on here. so we're not sacrificing our future to generate these kind of margins today.
your first question on the foundry side, why now, it's really, lucas, it goes back over a year. we saw over a year ago that certain of the foundry producers, domestic producers were shutting down. we saw foundry customers looking to import. so we started to take a very serious review of our ability to profitably produce this product in a very reliable, very consistent way to meet customer demand. so it goes back a while.
we also of course hear the same things you do about blast furnace participation market share in the future, and we thought it advisable to develop into another market. so we've put a lot of work into this. and clearly, no one could have foresaw the pandemic and the effects on demand in the domestic steel segments. so the timing was not motivated by the current challenges that the market faces. but clearly, it's fortuitous that it all came together with regard to us proving out the ability to produce in this time period. so it's really not a new idea here at suncoke, but rather it's something we've been working on, like i say for over a year. so it's not new. and the value of participating in the market, the ideas of diversification of market and customer aren't new to us either.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
very good to hear. mike and team, really appreciate the efforts and continue. best of luck. thank you.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lucas.
operator
thank you. your final question comes from the line of matthew sandschafer with mesirow financial. matthew, your line is open.
matthew sandschafer -- mesirow financial -- analyst
hi. a couple of quick questions. what percentage of the foundry coke market right now is supplied by imports?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
i think this year it's probably in a 150,000 ton range a quarter.
matthew sandschafer -- mesirow financial -- analyst
150,000 a quarter of it. so who do you -- i guess, how do you expect to take market share otherwise domestically if you want to grow beyond that 100k? are there other projects [phonetic] currently planned or are you going to have to actually go out and take customers in competitive situations?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well, our focus is to be a long-term reliable supplier, no different than what we have with our integrated customers. if we make a quality product and we do so reliably and we're cost efficient, market share will naturally come to us. customers, whether it's steel customers, whether it's foundry coke customers, they look for diversity in their supply base for a variety of good reasons, and we'll stand ready to really be a preeminent supplier. we've made the investments. so we've got good balance sheet. we have the ability to commit ourselves through this market for the long-term, no different than the integrated blast furnace market. so we're going to earn our way by, again, producing a reliable high quality coke product in the cost-efficient manner.
matthew sandschafer -- mesirow financial -- analyst
okay. and then on the topic of the arcelormittal extensions, what does the cost structure look like at jewell and haverhill now with the new volume levels? are these levels -- can you make enough money that it makes sense to continue to invest in these assets given the high fixed costs -- well, high capital intensity of the business?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well, the answer -- the short answer is yes. we have the newest coke oven fleet in north america, that's an advantage for us. we're a low-cost producer. we're not going to starve ourselves out of that leading position. at typical year, r&m capital is in the $65 million, $70 million range. and we expect to be able to continue to invest and maintain the integrity of our assets even though volumes are off here this year, and we have some work to do to fully fill our facilities out ahead. we'll do that from a good asset position not a deteriorating asset position.
matthew sandschafer -- mesirow financial -- analyst
so the expectation is not -- the expectation is you're going to try to fill out the jewell and haverhill demand portfolio rather than reduce capacity?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
100% correct.
matthew sandschafer -- mesirow financial -- analyst
okay. and so i guess back to the same sort of question about the foundry coke. where does that demand come from do you think in the environment we're in currently? i know that you guys are -- have the best assets, but i also know that a large customer is choosing to not commit to buying coke from you guys at that kind of level three years from now.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
the foundry market like our markets in the u.s. is currently off a bit. we expect it to recover. foundry is -- it's not like blast furnaces. there is a lot of sub-markets within the foundry market. there's over 30 customers that we're currently working to develop relationships. and they're everything from ductile iron pipe producers to people who make manhole covers. frank shafts, engine blocks for trucks, there's just a variety of users, and we expect that industrial america will in time recover.
matthew sandschafer -- mesirow financial -- analyst
right. i guess, the second question, are you planning to sell -- are you planning to drive the volumes on the blast furnace coke back up beyond the 400,000 at jewell and haverhill? are you looking to fill out primarily with foundry?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well...
matthew sandschafer -- mesirow financial -- analyst
which the market doesn't seem they're going to support that. i guess, i'm just trying to figure out that the hole here created by the new contract is pretty large a couple of years out, i'm just trying to figure out what the components are to fill it up?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, it will be again both with our traditional blast furnace customers as well as our continued success in foundry. for example, you assumed 50% of the foundry market as 300,000 tons, which is 600,000 tons of our blast furnace coke.
matthew sandschafer -- mesirow financial -- analyst
okay. all right. thank you.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, matthew.

as we move into the second half of the year, we recognize that market conditions remain challenged. in response, we have taken significant steps to support our customers in the short-term, while simultaneously providing long-term stability for our stakeholders. additionally, we are making investments to expand our product capabilities and diversify into new markets. on the customer side, we have addressed the lower demand environment. all of our customers have idled or banked blast furnaces during the first half of 2020. while there has been modest recovery in demand, steel capacity utilization remains low at approximately 59%, and it is difficult to predict when demand will fully return to normal levels.
in response to these unprecedented and uncertain times, we have partnered with our customers to address their near-term coke needs. in 2020, we will reduce our production by approximately 550,000 tons and now expect to produce approximately 3,750,000 tons for the whole year. substantially, all of this reduction will occur in the second half of the year. in exchange for these near-term reductions, we have extended several of our coke contracts, as detailed on this slide.
our business model is built on long-term customer relationships. and the actions we have taken, not only address the near-term contracts that are approaching expiration, but also further strengthens our long-term customer relationships and adds meaningful certainty and stability to our business. as we temporarily ramped down production in 2020 and address market conditions and logistics services, we have taken several steps to reduce cost and optimize our operations. the impact of these actions coupled with lower volumes will result in a reduction of 2020 adjusted ebitda of $40 million to $50 million from our previous guidance. we now expect 2020 adjusted ebitda to be between $190 million and $200 million.
we are also evaluating our cost structure to ensure that we remain a low cost provider. we are taking meaningful actions, including a reduction in our workforce, which while difficult during these unprecedented times, will better position suncoke for the future. we anticipate that these initiatives will result in permanent annual savings of approximately $10 million beginning in 2021.
now before i turn it over to fay, i'm excited to talk about a new opportunity that suncoke is pursuing. turning to slide 4. as mentioned on prior calls, we have been looking at alternative coke products, one of which is foundry coke. we have been evaluating foundry coke market and developing our production capabilities over the past year. after significant testing and continued development, we have now determined that we can commercially produce and sell foundry coke. we have recently successfully completed foundry coke trials with a number of potential customers, and our efforts in this area are ongoing.
domestic demand for foundry coke is approximately 600,000 tons per year. and recent shutdowns of foundry coke producers have forced foundries to look to imports as an alternative to domestic supply. we therefore believe this is an opportune time to enter the market and establish suncoke as a long-term reliable supplier of high quality foundry product.
expansion into this market provides both industry and customer diversification. there are more than 30 foundry coke customers across the country and numerous related industrial coke customers. during the production of foundry coke, smaller-sized coke, known as egg, nut and stove coke is also produced and is utilized in other industrial applications such as sugar beet and rock wall [phonetic] production. the production of foundry and related industrial coke helps address the current blast furnace coke market imbalance. differences in the production process has the effect of replacing approximately two tons of blast furnace coke for each ton of foundry coke produced. our initial target is to produce approximately 100,000 tons of foundry coke in 2021.
importantly, our ovens are capable of producing this product with no direct investment or need for production downtime to transition into the foundry coke market. we're making capital investments of approximately $12 million on coal grinding, material handling, coke screening and laboratory equipment, all of which is necessary to meet market demands. given our cost efficient production process, we anticipate the payback period for these projects will be relatively short. we will provide additional details on foundry coke when we provide 2021 guidance early next year.
with that, i'll turn it over to fay to review our second quarter earnings in detail. fay?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks mike, and good morning, everyone. moving on to second quarter performance. as you can see on slide 5, diluted eps was $0.08 per share in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2019. the prior year period included costs associated with the simplification transaction, which is the main driver of the increase year-over-year.
looking at adjusted ebitda, this came in at $59 million in the second quarter of 2020 versus $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. adjusted ebitda from the coke operations increased $4.2 million compared to the prior year. domestic sales volumes were approximately 54,000 tons lower than the prior year due to customer turn downs. the volume shortfall was more than offset by lower operating costs and better cost recovery. the adjusted ebitda contribution from the logistics segment decreased approximately $9 million versus the second quarter of 2019. throughput volumes at cmt and the domestic terminals were approximately 2.7 million tons lower versus the prior year period.
slide 6 bridges second quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda to second quarter 2020 adjusted ebitda. once again, coke operations were favorable by $4.2 million, driven by strong cost control and favorable cost recovery. logistics operations were lower $8.8 million quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to foresight and mercury bankruptcies. corporate and other was better by $0.5 million.
moving on to the next slide, you can see in the chart that our cash balance at the end of the quarter was approximately $81 million, which is a more normalized cash balance. our cash at the beginning of the quarter was artificially high because the company increased its borrowing under its revolving credit facility by approximately $157 million in order to preserve financial flexibility. we no longer believe that enhanced cash position is necessary, and we have reduced the revolver borrowings.
in the quarter, cash flow from operations generated $21.8 million and we had capex of $14.1 million. additionally, we paid $0.06 per share dividend in the quarter, which was a use of cash of $5 million. today, we announced the declaration of the second quarter dividend. we established the dividend at a rate that we believe is sustainable even during challenging market conditions. and while this is a decision made quarterly by our board of directors, we believe we have ample liquidity to maintain this dividend.
at the end of the quarter, on an ltm basis, our gross leverage was 3.3 times and our net leverage was 2.96 times. using the midpoint of our new adjusted ebitda guidance range, our year end net leverage would be 3.65 times, which is well within our leverage covenant. over time as market stabilizes, we intend to resume executing on our long-term capital allocation priorities with the primary focus on reducing gross leverage to 3 times or lower.
slide 8 details domestic coke operating performance and 2020 outlook. we sold 977,000 tons of coke in the quarter. sales volumes for all facilities were impacted by the volume relief provided to our customers. despite these volume concessions, indiana harbor volumes were higher than the prior year period, which was expected given the increased volumes from the rebuilt ovens.
q2 2020 adjusted ebitda per ton was approximately $63 compared to $55 per ton in q2 of 2019 with the per ton increase driven by favorable cost recovery and strong cost management. looking at domestic coke on a full year basis, we now expect domestic coke to generate between $198 million and $202 million of adjusted ebitda in 2020 on 3,750,000 tons of production. this is approximately $45 million lower than our previous adjusted ebitda guidance, and production is estimated to be 550,000 tons lower. the decrease in volumes is offset partly by lower operating costs. our plans have been diligent to variablize costs where possible by managing supplies and services over time, contractor usage, optimizing capital work and various other efforts.
moving to slide 9, which summarizes the logistics business and 2020 outlook. the pandemic has impacted demand at our logistics facilities. the domestic terminal handle [technical issue] million tons in q2 2020 versus 3.6 million tons in q2 of 2019 and 2.9 million tons in q1 of 2020. cmt volume comparisons to the prior year impacted by the bankruptcy of foresight energy, but were also impacted by the global effects of the pandemic. cmt had throughput volumes of 704,000 tons, which is lower than the first quarter and lower than our original guidance. in [technical issue] logistics operations have also taken measures to reduce costs, including a sizable reduction in our workforce as well as lowering other variable costs. [technical issue]
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
fay, why don't i take it from here. and again, we'll look to be at the lower end of our original guidance in the logistics segment at $17 million.
the next slide, slide 10, summarizes our 2020 revised guidance. we now expect adjusted ebitda to be between $190 million and $200 million. this incorporates all of the volume changes we discussed as well as foundry development expenses and cost reduction activities. our capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $80 million, which now includes $12 million of capital for foundry coke. this amount was not contemplated in our original guidance. we have reduced our free cash flow guidance based on revised adjusted ebitda. we now anticipate that free cash flow will be between $36 million and $52 million in 2020.
wrapping up on slide 11, as we continue to operate in these extraordinary times, our first priority continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees and contractors. we will continue to do everything possible to ensure that they are well protected and able to perform their jobs with confidence. we remain focused on our core business and how to best optimize our operations, including our logistics assets.
as we discussed earlier, we have made significant progress in reducing our cost structure and adding stability by working collaboratively with our customers to address both current market challenges and longer term supply needs. we also continue to maintain our asset base to ensure that we are able to operate efficiently in the long-term even as operating levels may fluctuate in the near-term. we are proud of the investments we have made, creating the highest quality assets in the industry, which we are committed to fully utilizing and maintaining.
looking forward, we are developing a new business line in foundry coke and are confident that we will be successful and able to capture significant share in the domestic foundry market. finally, we are fully committed the revised financial targets we have put forward and we'll make every effort to ensure that they are achieved.
before we end our prepared remarks, i would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees, contractors and suppliers who are working diligently during these difficult times to keep our business operating safely.
with that, we can open up the call to q&a.

[operator instructions] your first question today comes from the line of matthew fields with bofa. please proceed with our question.
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
hey, everyone. i just want to ask-i know you're not giving 2021 guidance yet, but given the helpful information you've given on the contract renewals, i just want to kind of go over some of the puts and takes for 2021 to see if we can sort of get to the right direction. so based on the new-and i'm going to talk about arcelormittal and ak steel as different companies, even though we all know they're now kind of under one umbrella. but for the mg&a contract in 2021, it seems like it's going to be down 300,000 tons compared to 2020 and then in 2022, down another 400,000 tons. is that right? the way to think about it?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
so matt, just to level set-for arcelormittal between our jewell and our haverhill facility, in 2021, we will provide to our customer 800,000 tons. that's on a combined basis, ok?
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
right.
shantanu agrawal -- investor relations
this is shantanu. and that's 450,000 tons lower than what we would like or the previous contract was in 2021.
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
okay. and then 400,000 tons is the supply amount in 2022 through 2025, right?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
that's correct. and once again, that's on a combined basis.
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
okay. and then for haverhill ii, the ak contract, is it correct that 125,000 tons come back in 2021 after being taken out in 2020?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
that's correct. we'll be at full run rate production at haverhill ii for ak starting back in 2021 and that is the contract that was extended to june of 2025.
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
okay, great. and then the middletown contract down 75,000 tons, is that already reflected in 2020? so there's no change from 2020 to 2021 at middletown?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
so in 2020, in our guidance and our revised production numbers where we said we were going to decrease production by 550,000 tons, that included the reduction in middletown. beginning in january of 2021, they will be back at full run rate production.
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
okay. so middletown in 2021 should be plus 75,000 tons over 2020?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
correct.
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
okay, great. you talked about the foundry coke opportunity. i don't know if it's too early or some of the r&d you've done, but can you give us any sort of scope on kind of margins that you could think about for foundry coke and what kind of economic benefit you could see from that new expansion? and then will it be a new segment? will that be a new segment or.
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
no. it's simply a product. it's a new product for our company. and as we indicated on the last call, we're making an investment into this product category, and we expect it to be a profitable investment. and everything that we've learned to date through all of our development efforts and through now, our outreach into the foundry coke market, the success we've had with the cupola operators, we very much expect that, that will in fact, be the case. so we look forward to profitably entering this market next year.
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
okay. but too early to tell kind of what kind of margins we could be looking at?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
we're not going to discuss specific profitability for different products in different markets.
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
okay. and then you've talked in the past about sort of efforts to move to more types of products out of the marine terminal aggregates, anything else? can you have those efforts kind of taking a back seat to maybe the foundry coke to other options? i know that contract renegotiations have been busy. but is there any update to the logistics efforts to kind of expand the products that were getting shipped out of the terminal?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
no, no. there are activities we pursue with great vigor, independent of one another. the folks that are working on a repositioning cmt are not the people that are putting us into the foundry market with their excellent effort. so our cmt has been a bit of a slug for a long, long time. cmt was fully dedicated on a long-term contractual basis to a few customers. so there really wasn't much opportunity to move into new markets.
and now as we find ourselves by having to reposition that asset, the macroeconomic environment in which we're looking to compete is, as you well know very challenged. so it's a challenge for the team. we've had some minor success, but offsetting well-established supply chains during a period of significant economic weakness is now without a lot of challenge. but notwithstanding the challenge, we continue to be out there fighting every day to find new opportunities for cmt.
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
okay. that's a fair point. i appreciate that. i appreciate the comments on working capital in the fourth quarter, and i think that kind of dovetails with the free cash flow guidance, which implies you'll burn about $15 million to $30 million in the fourth quarter. one, is that the right sort of directional amount there? and two, do you anticipate having to redrop [phonetic] borrowings on the revolver in the fourth quarter?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
yes, matt. so i think if you just look at where we are on a free cash flow basis on a year-to-date through the first three quarters, we're at roughly $70 million of free cash flow, right? our guidance, when we revised our ebitda, we, of course, revised our free cash flow guidance as well is in a range of $36 million to $56 million. so there will be a burn in the fourth quarter. we will likely draw on our revolver again, but we are very closely monitoring our cash balances, our revolver draws to ensure that we're as efficient as possible.
but we will be building inventories like we normally do in the fourth quarter because you want to make sure you have the adequate supply because you don't want to be caught off guard by weather conditions. and then two, as you start ramping back up at the facilities, you need to have more coal on hand. so there will be a bit of a draw in the fourth quarter. but we're still within our guidance that we provided of $36 million to $56 million for free cash flow on a full year basis.
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. and then last one for me. i appreciate your consistent message about three times sort of gross leverage target. does that imply that whatever the sort of 2021 financials are going to be that we're going to continue to pay down dollar amounts of debt through '21 to kind of get to that target?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
yes. i mean, as i indicated in my prepared remarks, that is our-as we laid out our capital allocation priorities, that is our primary priority. and we've been pretty successful in paying down debt this year of close to $53 million when you take into consideration what we paid here in q4. there's no reason to believe that our capital allocation priorities will change in 2021.
and so we're targeting three times in order to get to that three times level, we're going to need to be paying down debt.
matthew fields -- bofa -- analyst
okay. and then the choice of revolver versus bonds, is that kind of a function of the trading liquidity of the issue and the price in the market that you can get open market purchases for? or just give us a trade-off between going after those 7.5, the discount versus revolver at par here?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
so we try to be as opportunistic as possible. and of course, we're evaluating what the trading price is. we were able to repurchase that debt this year on average at $0.87 on the dollar. so i think, of course, those are all factors that we take into consideration as we evaluate paying down the revolver or repurchasing debt.
operator
our next question comes from the line of nick jarmoszuk with stifel. your line is open.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
i wanted to get your thoughts on-with your customers generally looking to lower their carbon footprint. can you talk about how you position yourself as a coke supplier versus your customers sourcing coke from some of their some of the grandfathered coke batteries and how you position yourself as being the low-carbon alternative?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
nick, it's a good question. as many are well aware, our technology and our fleet is the newest and most modern set of coke batteries in the united states and for that matter, canada as well, utilizing what has been determined to be the mat standard, maximum achievable technology standard with regard to emissions. so not only are we the newest batteries in the u.s. and canadian markets, but we're also environmentally the most friendly. and of course, as people and as they should and need to look to reduce their environmental footprint, our coke plays very well into that kind of thinking.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
so in terms of discussions with your customers, have they indicated how they think about their coke facilities? and what sort of lifespan they were expecting to put on to a coke battery that was commissioned in the 1950s or so?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
nick, we don't discuss our ongoing dialogue with our customers. as we have been able to indicate this year, we were able to extend meaningfully our contracts with both arcelormittal and ak, but the specifics of those discussions we don't discuss. but we're in regular dialogue with our customers.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mark levin with benchmark. your line is open.
mark levin -- benchmark -- analyst
i think most of my questions have already been asked, but maybe i'll try another one. my memory may be failing me here. but fay, is there a minimum liquidity number that you target, something that you're comfortable with and as you try to manage paying down debt, that's where you'd like that number to be on an ongoing basis?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
yes. and so we have ample liquidity between our cash balance and our ability to draw on our revolver, which is a $400 million revolver. so i think we're well positioned from a liquidity perspective. we've historically said that we think we'd like to be around $75 million of cash, and that's on our balance sheet. and that's because of the way that our payments come in our customers' versus the way that we have to spend cash in order to procure coal and other things like that.
we're evaluating that as we evaluate everything on and looking at what that minimum cash balance is. as a more simplified structure, we may be able to reduce that a bit more going forward. and we've been very actively managing our revolver borrowings since we've simplified. and so there's an opportunity to actually reduce that slightly for our company. but we're very well positioned from a liquidity perspective, mark.
mark levin -- benchmark -- analyst
got it. and then my second question has to do with buybacks. i mean, obviously, it would appear and correctly so, in my opinion, that the first priority is deleveraging and looking at those 2025s. but i'm just curious, just given the free cash flow yield on the stock, which is pretty enormous, and we are hopefully coming out of the pandemic at some point, is there some thought to allocating at least some portion of excess cash to buying back stock as well?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
our current thinking is, as they indicated, to continue to pay our common dividend that we've established.
mark levin -- benchmark -- analyst
okay. so the inference there is that the buybacks are probably further well off the footprint right now. but final question, mike, for you. just more of a big picture question. as the u.s. blast furnace steel industry is consolidated or continues to consolidate, how will that or how do you expect that to impact suncoke going forward? does it change the way you think about the business and managing risk? just sort of your general thoughts on what's going on and how it affects you guys?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, it's obviously quite early and really premature to speculate the question. perhaps it's a good question. it's an excellent question, but better directed to our customers. but clearly, the market seems to appreciate and like the consolidation that's taking place between am and ak. we, of course, benefit when our customers are stronger. so we applaud anything that's a net positive for our customers and our markets, the blast furnace supplied market.
we have had historically good relationships with both am and ak, and we look forward to continuing with those good relationships. there's a mutuality here. we, of course, need our customers. all companies need customers. and we expect that our relationships will continue in the good positive way they have where our customers appreciate the need for high-quality coke supply at a good cost.
mark levin -- benchmark -- analyst
i appreciate that. one final question, goes back to the logistics segment. i know you guys have been working hard to diversify, particularly as the export coal business has come under pressure. mike, are you optimistic in 2021?
i realize we're sitting here in the middle of a pandemic, and it's difficult to get much done commercially. but just generally speaking, are you optimistic that we'll see some positive-some contract settlement, something on the logistics side in 2021?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
we're not providing 2021 guidance here today. and you phrase the question properly, it's almost impossible to predict day-to-day where markets might be. i'm modestly encouraged that more recently with higher natural gas prices in europe, there's greater thermal coal demand. and we factored that into our revised forecast for the balance of this year, and we'll hope that, that continues into next year. but it would be simply too early to speculate at this point.
mark levin -- benchmark -- analyst
yes. just beyond coal and some of the other commodities that you guys have targeted, i mean, are you feeling more confident that you might be able to get some new business in 2021 on the logistics side? again, very general, not asking for guidance.
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
it's just premature, and we'll provide an update. but generally speaking, i think the environment is showing modest improvement as we enter 2021. hopefully, some of our efforts in an improving environment can pay off.
mark levin -- benchmark -- analyst
great. okay, thank you, guys, for all the time.
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you

[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of lucas pipes with b. riley securities. please proceed with your question.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
he, good morning, everyone.
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
good morning, lucas.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
take a different approach to-i think it was matt's first question on 2021 volumes. obviously, some puts and takes there, as you discussed. but when you tally up all the minimums for blast furnace coke, where does this put you in 2021? and then obviously, we have the guidance for 2020, so it would be interesting to just ask this more pointedly.
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, again, we're not discussing the specifics of '21. we'll do that when we release the fourth quarter. we're entering the foundry market, as we've discussed. we expect to do so successfully. and we look at every opportunity to have our facilities run full next year. and that includes, as we have in the past, looking for export market opportunities. but we'll advise as to all that when we provide guidance with our fourth quarter results.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
and sorry, that would be export opportunities for coke, correct?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
correct.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
what export markets are kind of most attractive at this time? and what sort of volumes historically has the u.s. been able to export?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
we've modestly exported in the past. there's opportunities today in both europe and asia, particularly india.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
any sense for what volume-are we talking tens of thousands of tons or potentially hundreds of thousands of tons?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
we'll provide that in our 2021 guidance.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
but the goal is to be fully ramped, if i heard you correct.
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
that is 100% correct, lucas.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
that's very helpful. and kind of dovetailing on this prior question. obviously, steel utilization rates have been increasing quite nicely. and do you have a sense for kind of what-to what level steel utilization rates would have to rebound for there to be upside to your volumes in 2021 versus 2020?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
we like to see the u.s. markets operating in excess of 80% of capacity. and while there's been good recovery, actually quite good recovery from a low, i think, of 51% of capacity earlier this year to now at the level of 70%, we still have a ways to go before we can expect to see operating rates on a sustained basis above 80%. and most of the end-use markets are recovering quite nicely.
energy sits out there as a concern in terms of end-use markets. the offset to a prolonged extension of the downturn energy would be if we could simply pass an infrastructure bill, which our country desperately needs. and the infrastructure spending has been lacking and it's well past time. as we all travel the highways and roadways in the united states, it's abundantly clear and technical societies, civil engineers, radar infrastructure to b minus. so it's time for washington to get to work, come together and pass the bill. and that would help demand in the years ahead.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
completely agree with everything you said there. mike, one more for me just to kind of maybe tie my first and second question together. in order for you to fully utilize your coke capacity, do you need to be back-does the u.s. steel capacity utilization have be back at 80%? or would you say, given your entries into the foundry coke market, exports, etc. that even at a, call it, 70% current steel capacity utilization rate, you'd be able to ramp back up to full utilization rates at your furnaces?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. it's a good question, lucas. and again, we expect to run full next year even though we don't currently anticipate domestic operating rates being on a sustained basis above 80% right now.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
great, very helpful. mike and team, continued best of luck. i appreciate it.
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks, lucas.

your next question comes from the line of matthew sandschafer with mesirow financial. please proceed with your question.
matthew sandschafer -- mesirow financial -- analyst
good morning, everybody. i wanted to just ask briefly about the guidance. you are guiding for $190 million to $200 million of adjusted ebitda for the year. you are at $169 million year-to-date, which implies the midpoint of the guidance, ebitda dropping by about 50% in the fourth quarter.
is there-and the data works out similarly for the adjusted ebitda per ton calculation and guidance. is there something significant happening in the fourth quarter that should be substantially different from the third in terms of operating performance?
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes.
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
i'm sorry. go ahead, mike.
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
no. matthew, we said we're well-positioned to achieve that revised guidance of $190 million to $200 million. and you touched on it a little bit.
the operating plans and actions for the company change quarter-over-quarter. fourth-quarter is typically a weaker quarter. we've got a lot of outage work. and third quarter is typically a stronger quarter in the absence of outage work. and this year, of course, with the pandemic and all the disruptive nature of our turn-downs, makes that even more so. so there is an occasion where we expect now and plan to do more work, more maintenance work in the fourth and third. so you have that phenomenon taking place. it's really not totally unusual, but we will be doing work on a planned basis that way.
matthew sandschafer -- mesirow financial -- analyst
i understand the step-down last year was about $15 million from 3q to 4q and now you're talking about like $20 or $25. is the outage work that much more dramatic than it was last year?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
so the outages are different year-over-year, depending on what needs to be done. and so we have outages at two of our facilities, one of which is we characterize as major. as mike mentioned as well, we're also bringing forward some of just regular kind of maintenance expenses and maintenance work that we're going to take advantage of the outage and the time that it's down. the other thing that should be noted, too, so you've got-the scope is different in q4 of 2020 versus 2019. we mentioned that we're going to have a reduction on a full year basis of 550,000 tons of production. most of that is going to be in the second half of the year.
we saw that come through here in the third quarter. the impact at jewell specifically will be greater in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter. so when you couple the increase in costs related to outages, the increases in maintenance costs, add kind of the reduced production and the impact at jewell that is large-that is greater in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter as well as some incremental expenses that we know were going to occur in the fourth quarter to be prepared to run full out starting january 1, 2021, you have a drop in the fourth quarter ebitda.
matthew sandschafer -- mesirow financial -- analyst
okay. i guess, one other way to try to phrase this, is there-is the third quarter performance, given at least the contracts call for lower volume next year and the third quarter was the first quarter where we really saw lower volume, is the third quarter cost and ebitda performance sustainable at these level of volumes more or less over the long term, knowing that we'll see some quarterly fluctuations? or should i expect the ebitda per ton number to fall substantially even beyond the fourth quarter? you understand the question. i know you guys did some stuff on the cost side here in 3q. i'm just trying to figure out if it was short term and heroic or if it was sustainable over a longer period.
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
so a couple of things. one, we give guidance on ebitda and ebitda per ton on a full year basis and we do it on a full year basis because there's quarterly variability because of outage schedules and the timing of maintenance work as well as the timing of capital work and so on and so forth. that's why we give it on a full year basis. and we were at $56 to $57 adjusted ebitda per ton on a full year basis was our guidance. we came in at $56 per ton here in the third quarter. we're very pleased with the performance.
the cost reductions that we made here in 2020, while i say were heroic, many of those are going-you're going to continue to see play out in the future. we talked about it at the second quarter, a reduction on a full year basis of $10 million of cost. that's pretty meaningful to our company of our size. they're not onetime. we're going to have sustained cost savings going into the future. i think those things, hopefully, will give you some additional insight as to the way that we're looking at our cost structure as well as kind of ebitda.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the suncoke energy, inc. q3 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to mr. shantanu agrawal. please begin.
shantanu agrawal -- investor relations
hello. good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss suncoke energy's third quarter 2020 earnings. with me today are mike rippey, president and chief executive officer; and fay west, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
following management's prepared remarks, we'll open the call for q&a. this conference call is being webcast live on the investor relations section of our website, and a replay will be available later today. if we don't get to your questions on the call today, please feel free to reach out to our investor relations team. before i turn things over to mike, let me remind you that the various remarks we make on today's call regarding future expectations constitute forward-looking statements. the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in our sec filings apply to the remarks we make today. these documents are available on our website, as our reconciliations to non-gaap financial measures discussed on today's call.
with that, i'll now turn things over to mike.
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks, shantanu. good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. let me start with an update on our ongoing response to the covid-19 pandemic. we continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the health and safety of our workforce and have implemented policies and procedures that follow the guidelines established by the cdc, osha, and local health and governmental authorities to protect our workforce and contractors. our covid-19 task force continually monitors and evaluates the evolving situation and responds and adjusts as the environment develops.
turning to our third quarter performance. cokemaking operations performed well despite operating at turndown levels. all of our facilities demonstrated excellent cost discipline and delivered results in line with our expectations despite the challenging macro environment. another significant achievement for suncoke during the quarter was the extension of the haverhill ii contract with ak steel for an additional two years. that contract now expires on june 30, 2025. this extension further illustrates the strength and long-term nature of our relationships with our customers.
during our previous quarter's earnings call, we announced that suncoke would enter the foundry coke market. the testing, development and capital deployment activities necessary for profitable foundry coke market production are going well, and we are excited to enter this new market with a high-quality product. we have tested our foundry coke in cupolas with a number of potential customers, and the results have been very encouraging. we are now well positioned to profitably enter the foundry coke market in 2021. we continue to execute on our revised 2020 objectives and are well positioned to achieve our full year adjusted ebitda guidance.
with that, i'll turn it over to fay to review our third quarter earnings in detail. fay?
fay west -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good morning, everyone. moving on to third quarter performance. as you could see on slide four, diluted eps was a loss of $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared to a loss of $1.81 per share in the third quarter of 2019. the prior year period included $1.94 per share impairment charge related to our logistics goodwill and long-lived assets at cmt. excluding this noncash charge, eps was down quarter-over-quarter by $0.16, mainly due to lower volumes across the segments.
looking at adjusted ebitda, this came in at $47.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $66.7 million in the third quarter of 2019. adjusted ebitda from the coke operations decreased $11.8 million compared to the prior year period. domestic sales volumes were approximately 190,000 tons lower than the prior year due to customer turndowns. the volume shortfall was partially offset by lower operating costs. adjusted ebitda from the logistics segment decreased by $5.3 million versus third quarter of 2019. the throughput volumes at cmt and the domestic terminals were lower by approximately 1.4 million tons versus the prior year.
slide five bridges the third quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda to the third quarter 2020 adjusted ebitda. as we discussed on our second quarter conference call, in response to a challenging and unprecedented environment, we partnered with our coke customers to address their near-term coke needs. in exchange for the extension of several coke contracts, we agreed to reduce our coke production in 2020 by approximately 550,000 tons. substantially all of this reduction will occur in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. this volume decrease contributed to lower adjusted ebitda from coke operations in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the prior year. strong cost control partially offset the impact of these lower volumes.
the logistics operations were $5.3 million lower quarter-over-quarter due to lower volumes and lower pricing, which was again offset by lower operating costs. corporate expenses in the quarter includes foundry-related research and development costs of approximately $1 million. and we're also impacted by period-over-period mark-to-market adjustments in deferred compensation, driven by changes in the company's share price.
slide six details the domestic coke operating performance. we sold 868,000 tons of coke in the quarter. sales volumes for all facilities were impacted by the volume relief provided to our customers. q3 2020 adjusted ebitda per ton was approximately $56 per ton compared to $57 per ton in q3 of 2019. the decrease in adjusted ebitda per ton was due to lower sales volume but was largely offset by favorable cost recovery and strong cost management. our plants have been diligent in lowering costs where possible by managing supplies and services, overtime, contractor usage, postponing capital work and various other efforts.
moving to slide seven. logistics adjusted ebitda was $4.3 million in q3 of 2020 versus $9.6 million in q3 of 2019. cmt contributed $1.7 million to q3 2020 adjusted ebitda as compared to $7.4 million in q3 2019 on comparable volume. the deterioration of adjusted ebitda at cmt is due largely to lower pricing. the domestic terminals handled approximately 2.2 million tons in q3 of 2020 versus 3.4 million tons in q3 of 2019. the lower volumes at domestic logistics terminals were more than offset by the measures taken to reduce costs, including a meaningful workforce reduction.
moving on to the next slide. you could see on the chart that our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $86 million. in the quarter, cash flow from operations generated $74.5 million, and we had capex of $16.5 million. we paid down a portion of the revolver borrowing as working capital charges were a source of cash this quarter. we expect working capital to reverse in the fourth quarter as we build coal inventories going into the winter and as we prepare for an increase in production for 2021. additionally, we paid a $0.06 per share dividend in the quarter, which was a use of cash of $5 million and today, announced the declaration of the third quarter dividend. we established the dividend at a rate that we believe is sustainable even during challenging market conditions. and while this is a decision made quarterly by our board of directors, we believe we have ample liquidity to maintain this dividend.
at the end of the quarter, on an ltm basis, our gross leverage was 3.37 times, and our net leverage was 2.98 times. we intend to continue executing on our long-term capital allocation priorities with the primary focus on reducing gross leverage to three times or lower. to that end, we repurchased $7.5 million face value of sxcp notes in the third quarter and an additional $33.2 million here in q4.
with that, i will turn it back to mike.
michael rippey -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you, fay. wrapping up on slide nine. as we continue to operate during these extraordinary times, our first priority continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees and contractors. we will continue to do everything possible to ensure that they are well-positioned, are well-protected and able to perform their jobs with confidence. we remain focused on our core businesses and how to best-optimize our operations, including our logistics assets.
as we announced in the previous quarter, we have made significant progress in reducing our cost structure and adding near-term stability by working collaboratively with our customers to address both current market challenges and longer-term supply requirements. we also continue to maintain our asset base to ensure that we are able to operate efficiently in the long term, even as operating levels may fluctuate in the near term.
we are proud of the investments we have made, creating the highest quality assets in the industry, which we are committed to fully utilizing and maintaining. finally, we are confident in the revised financial targets we have put forward and our entire organization is focused on achieving these results.before we end our prepared remarks, i would like to take the opportunity to again thank all of our employees, contractors and suppliers who are working diligently during these difficult times to ensure our business continues to perform well.
with that, we can open up for q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of matthew fields with bank of america.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, everyone. so last time we spoke, it was november 6, and you all were kind of holding to your full-year guidance, which implied a pretty negative fourth quarter in terms of ebitda and free cash flow. i think a pretty negative free cash flow to hit that $36 million to $56 million, obviously you'd be pretty handily on both fronts. so what was the reason for that strong out-performance in 4q? was it just a really, really conservative guide or was there something that kind of just fundamentally changed in the last six weeks of the quarter?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
nothing fundamentally changed matthew. sometimes the wind is a bit of your back and we found that to be the case in the fourth quarter. weather was quite mild. it's not been quite as mild here in the midwest recently, but the weather in the fourth quarter was mild. so, our operations performed at very good levels. the cost reduction initiatives, which we announced starting to come into full fruition in the fourth quarter, so i'm delighted with the ability of the company to simultaneously implement a cost reduction initiative and unfortunately that means fewer employees here at suncoke, but while in the process of reducing our cost, we didn't miss a beat as we began to ramp back up to full production here in 2021. so i think it was really a quite outstanding quarter for the company and its employees. again [technical issues] some good weather. there was perhaps and you see it in 2021 we have more capital work in 2021 than we had in '20. so we're doing a little bit catching up that we weren't able to accomplish in the fourth quarter which does have an impact on our o&m cost as well. so it was really just a good quarter.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then i wanted to sort of tie the puts and takes on the domestic coke side from '20 to '21. and then i think phase comments about foundry coke replacing 2 tons of blast furnace coke maybe some further explanation about that. i think and please correct me if i'm wrong here, but i think from '20 to '21, you have 125,000 tons coming back from the ak fuel contract. you have 200,000 tons going away in the mtna [phonetic] contracts. so maybe i'm wrong on those figures, but help me sort of tie that bridge 2020 to '21 and then the balance is 400,000 tons of blast furnace coke, but you're only going to be selling 260 -- 250 to 270 tons of foundry coke and the rest is export? is that the way to get to 4.1 million tons?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no, so, at blast furnace kind of equivalent, right, what we've always thought of and how we've always discussed kind of our tonnage. roughly 4.2 million tons of production at full utilization. when you look at our contracted volumes, as i mentioned we're at under long-term take-or-pay volumes, we're a little over 3.8 million tons. so when you're trying to just do that math, you have 4.2 million tons to 3.8 million tons you have 400,000 tons of uncontracted volumes under long-term take-or-pay contracts. and so those tons will then be deployed either into -- because we're going to run at full run rate, either into the export market or the foundry market. now, it's not a ton per ton comparison on the foundry front. and so when we look at what we're planning on selling in the foundry space and the export space, it is the differential of that amount.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
i [indecipherable] that really is the extended coking times for the production of the foundry coke.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. so you will essentially be producing 4.2 million tons. but you will be selling fewer than that?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no, no, no. what we...
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
we'll be utilizing the time fully. all the capacity of the facilities will be used. we will use every minute of available time to produce coke. we produce less foundry coke per unit of time because the coking cycle is longer. so you get less throughput.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. great. and then your overall margins guidance $53 to $55, isn't really down that much. so can you give us a little guidance on the margin sort of differential between foundry coke and you're sort of long-term contract to coke?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
we're not giving specific profit margin information. foundry is, i know you can appreciate, it's a small market and we don't really want to say anything that would competitively harm us, but it's appropriate to think that the relative profitability of our different product offerings are more or less the same. there is some internal opportunity on the foundry side to reduce our cost as we go fully commercial, look to optimize our production, get the yields ups on. so there is some internal opportunity to bring the profit of the foundry product up.[indecipherable] in line with the blast furnace margins.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then on the logistics side, congrats on that new javelin contract. just wanted to sort of dig in a little bit there. convent going from 5.1 up to 6.5 to 8, but with an additional 4 million tons from javelin, is there some coal that's going away. or was that 5.1 was a chunk of that not coal. like help me understand where that extra 4 million tons is fitting in?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so i think where your math isn't paying together is, it's not an incremental 4 million tons. we moved tons in 2020...
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
on a spot basis.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
for javelin.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
3.5 million. and so it's -- this is just a new contract, which it's not spot like it was in 2020, its take-or-pay for 4 million tons.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so the incremental, is only about 0.5 million tons in 2021 for javelin.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
'21. yes.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. okay, that's very helpful. and then are we going to start to see, i know we can sort of back into the margin, you'll get some logistics based on your ebitda guide, but you used to sort of generate $3 to $4 per ton on the revenue side in the coal logistics business. are we going to be trending back up toward there or is it going to be kind of on the revenue basis that same as '20 closer to '21?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
what we did not different in foundry as we're now entering new markets and finding ourselves in competitive situations. we're not really intending to say anything more than we have with regard to our throughputs and the ebitda of the segment.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, that's fair. and then lastly from me and thanks for the patience here. with the free cash flow expected in '21, if you kind of apply that you could pay down your entire revolver over the course of '21 which would put you in 0.3 or 0.4 of a turn below 3 times. you said continued debt reduction is important. and if you're going to be below 3 times, does that mean you can take the foot off the gas with that or and increased shareholder returns or do we think that 3 times might turn into 2.5 times as the target over time or even lower?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, if you're -- i think your math is correct. as we continue to make good progress next year and pay down debt that would drive us being a bit below 3 times and as we've said all along 3 times or lower. so i think our priority in 2021 will be to get that debt level down to 3 times or lower and that speaks pretty well to the excess cash flow we have next year.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, that's it from me. thanks very much and good luck.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks matthew.

our next question comes from the line of lucas pipes with b. riley securities.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
hey, good morning, mike and fay and team, and...
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
[speech overlap] 2020 and fourth quarter in particular. two primary questions on my mind. first on the contract minimums, you had previously outlined that this step downs here this year 2021 and then 2022. i wanted to ask what extent you have discussions with your domestic coke customers today about potential increases to that -- you noted, mike, the market -- steel market is very strong. so i just wondered if those conversations have started again? thank you.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's a good question, lucas. actually they really at the other end. it's not a matter of starting and stopping, as you're aware, as we supported our customers in 2020, we renegotiated and extended our existing contracts. we did that in a couple of different points during the year and those conversations are on a continuing basis. we also though and responsibly look to other opportunities for customer diversification and to ensure that our facilities run full. so, we're in discussions, both with our existing customers as well as potential customers.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
and you've noted the strength in the market or would you say those at this point as you spoke a little bit into those ongoing conversations yet?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
no. the market is strengthening where capacity utilization rates are back 77% i guess is the last number i saw. so we're approaching 80% and 80% plus is healthy market. so that's a good environment for us to find ourselves. as i indicated this need for infrastructure, the lack of one is really a [indecipherable], it needs to be addressed by our country, perhaps in a bipartisan way washington can get up and actually do something about it, instead talking about it. that's a catalyst for further demand development in the steel market. so we see the improvement continuing, industrial recovery continue. so there is a bit of environment to discuss. but we did extensions last year during the period of significant contraction. and the reason we're able to do that is, we believe our customers recognize us for the high quality product we make and for the investments we've made and the fact that we're going to be a long-term reliable supplier. so it's not necessarily only about where you sit in the steel cycle. we take the long view and we think our customers and potential customers take a long view. so this is, it's just, it's part of the -- just the ongoing dialog.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
very helpful. and couldn't agree more on the infrastructure side. mike another topic i wanted to touch on was the full potential for cmt. i believe in your prepared remarks, you mentioned, you use that vary [phonetic] and i wondered if you could speak to full potential in a quantitative way. i know this full potential doesn't seem like it's achievable here in 2021. if you look out two, three, maybe even four or five years, where do you see that facility in terms of potential ebitda through various initiatives you've taken? thank you.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
i don't want to start forecasting 2022 and beyond ebitda for either our logistics business or our coke business. but clearly there is underutilized capacity at the terminal today. we've demonstrated in the ability to 212 million tons through there in the past. so that's a first stop and beyond that there is opportunities to expand that terminal in a thoughtful and profitable way where it could handle substantially more volumes than the 12 million that is historically done. so it's a journey. but there is latent capacity there without investment and there is additional capacity in the presence of some modest investments.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. i will leave it here. i appreciate all the color and continued best of luck.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thank you lucas.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks lucas.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of phil gibbs with keybanc capital markets.
phil gibbs -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, mike and team. how are you?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
good. what's up?
phil gibbs -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
doing well. thanks for all the color on 2021 in terms of the composition in the domestic coke operations. can you give us any texture in terms of 2020 in terms of what that was, i think you shipped around 3.8 million tons. how much -- what was the split there between the domestic take-or-pays and your foundry export business?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
it was all domestic. there was no commercial volumes of either export or foundry.
phil gibbs -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. so the domestic take-or-pay is relatively flattish or modest growth this year?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
correct.
phil gibbs -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and i think in your prepared remarks you had made a comment about potential pig iron opportunities and just a question in terms of what you're hearing on that whether or not you think that's a 2021 reality or a 2022 potential. just, what's the volumes in terms of -- in terms of that comment.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
i think it starts to show up in '21. you've got about a canadian producer that's beginning to produce pig now, it's i think being actively explored by domestic blast furnace producers. there's approximately 5 million tons of pig is imported into this country every year and it's being imported frankly from places where the environmental concerns that we demonstrate every day aren't quite as great. so there is an economic opportunity and i think it's also an opportunity in terms of the global environment to do something in an environmentally more responsible way. so there is i think good opportunities. i think when and how much is a question better directed to the people who would actually produce the pig.
phil gibbs -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that makes sense. and then just one more from me. i know there's a lot of focus on emissions reductions obviously within the steel industry, but just from my perch, i think that evolution domestically has been going on. i think probably even before the obama administration and i think it accelerated in terms of the demands that were put on your -- some of your blast furnace customers and maybe if you could provide some color just in terms of where you think the industry is in terms of its evolution here domestically and how far ahead we are potentially versus the rest of the world given the fact that i think we've kind of been an early adopter to this view for a while. i just think there's a lot of misinformation. thanks.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
you're 100% right. so co2 reduction and environmental performance is not new to the domestic industry. it's actually decades old. so tremendous progress has already been made here in the united states and there's scope for continued improvement with regard to the environmental performance of the industry and we applaud our customers who look to improve their environmental footprint. as you know, we have a very small footprint, but even with our small footprint we look to continuously improve it. other players, and i think now we could get into a long discussion about trade and the fairness of trade and the subsidies that are present in imported steel, but clearly in other parts of the world and i'm not saying the entire world, by the way, there's environmentally responsible producers throughout the world, but certainly significant portions of the steel that's moved around the world is produced by people who don't take their environmental responsibility seriously as ours.
and i think that's something we need to continue to educate consumers, investors, particularly people in the washington who are responsible for trade laws and trade enforcement business' message needs to continue to ring out. it's all we do is continue to improve and we need to our environmental performance as an industry and others aren't required to do the same globally and co2 is a global issue, it's not a us issue. we are not accomplishing much. all we do is export pollution by allowing those who indiscriminately produce to import into our country, we haven't accomplished anything, in fact you could argue we encourage pollution if we don't have strong trade laws. so there is a body of work here and i applaud the industry for all that it's been able to do over the past couple of decades. and you're right it predates the obama administration and it will extend beyond the next administration too. this is a continuing journey. so we need to continue to work hard and we need to insist that that others do the same.
phil gibbs -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, mike.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
yes.

on slide 3, you can see the key initiatives that we set out and how we performed against these objectives. we delivered $205.9 million of adjusted ebitda in 2020, exceeding our revised guidance range of $190 million to $200 million. this reflects the strong performance of our coke operations despite running a sub-optimal utilization rates and strong cost control across the company. earlier this year, we announced the companywide cost savings initiative, which we anticipate will result in approximately $10 million of annualized savings. these cost savings initiatives provided benefits in 2020 and will continue in the years ahead. the domestic coke operations contributed $217 million to adjusted ebitda in 2020, which exceeded the revised guidance range for domestic coke.
i am pleased with the safe and efficient operation of our coke facilities all while following additional precautionary measures due to the pandemic. another significant achievement for suncoke in 2020 is the extension of existing contracts at jewell, haverhill 1 and haverhill 2. we helped our customers navigate through challenging market conditions earlier this year, by reducing current year production and exchange for contract extensions, which illustrates the strength and long-term nature of our customer relationships. we also signed a two-year take-or-pay coal handling agreement with javelin at cmt during the fourth quarter. this contract provides stability to the operations at cmt, while we actively pursue new business opportunities.
i also want to briefly touch on our foundry coke initiative. the testing, development and capital deployment necessary for profitable foundry coke production went well throughout 2020. we are now commercial in this new market with a high quality product. during the fourth quarter, we also explored export coke opportunities for 2021 and today have had good success. we plan on running at full capacity in 2021 and feel confident that demand from export and foundry markets will support this level of production.
looking at our capital structure and deployment of free cash flow in 2020, we reduced gross debt by $110 million and net debt by approximately $61 million. this includes the opportunistic open-market purchases of approximately $63 million face value senior notes. additionally, we paid a $0.24 per share annual dividend and repurchased 1.6 million shares during the first quarter.
as we reflect on our business, we are pleased with the strength of our core operations, which allowed us to drive robust cash flows for the year. this strong cash flow has provided us the ability to weather market challenges, while also aggressively pursuing a balanced yet opportunistic approach to capital allocation. fay will go into more detail on this, but on a high level, we made progress on our capital allocation initiatives for the year, reducing our debt, investing in our assets and returning meaningful capital to our shareholders.
with that, i'll turn it over to fay to review our third -- our fourth quarter earnings in detail.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good morning everyone. turning to slide 4. the fourth quarter net loss attributable to sxc was $0.06 per share, down $0.04 versus the fourth quarter of 2019. on a gaap basis, our full year 2020 net income attributable to sxc was $0.04 per share, up $2.02 versus the full year of 2019. as a reminder, full year 2019 results included a $2.27 per share impairment charge recorded to logistics goodwill and long-lived asset at cmt. after adjusting for these charges, 2020 diluted eps was $0.25 lower than the prior year, due primarily to lower volumes at both the domestic coke and logistics segments.
consolidated adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $37 million, down $13.8 million versus the fourth quarter of 2019. the decrease was mainly driven by lower volumes in our domestic coke segment. on a full year basis we delivered adjusted ebitda of $205.9 million, down $42 million versus the full year of 2019. coke operations were down $12.2 million due to lower volumes, which were partially offset by lower operating costs. year-over-year results were also impacted by the bankruptcy of our coal customer at our logistics segment.
turning to the next slide and looking further at our fourth quarter adjusted ebitda performance. slide 5 bridges fourth quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda to fourth quarter 2020 adjusted ebitda. as we have discussed in our previous conference calls in response to challenging and -- in response to a challenging and unprecedented environment we partnered with our coke customers to address their near-term coke needs. in exchange for the extension of several coke contracts, we agreed to reduce our coke production in 2020 by approximately 550,000 tons. this volume reduction contributed to the lower adjusted ebitda from coke operations in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the prior year. strong cost control and management partially offset the impact of lower volumes. logistics operations were $1.8 million lower quarter-over-quarter due to lower volumes as well as lower pricing, which was offset partially by lower operating costs. corporate and other expenses were higher by $2.9 million quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to higher non-cash legacy liability expense.
turning to slide 6. full year 2020 adjusted ebitda was $205.9 million down $42 million compared to the prior year. our domestic coke segment delivered strong operational performance despite running at reduced production level. lower sales volumes were partly offset by strong cost control and efficient operating procedures. the domestic coke segment delivered full-year adjusted ebitda of approximately $217 million, which was well above our full year revised domestic coke guidance. including brazil, our coke operations delivered adjusted ebitda of $230.5 million.
adjusted ebitda of the logistics segment decreased $25.3 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of the chapter 11 bankruptcy of foresight energy and the subsequent rejection of the contract with cmt. finally, our corporate and other segment was unfavorable by $4.5 million. lower employee-related costs were offset by higher non-cash legacy liability expense and foundry related r&d cost. in summary, we are very pleased with the performance across all our segments of the company especially during a very tough and challenging year.
turning to our capital deployment on slide 7. as mike highlighted, we generated very strong operating cash flow, approximately $158 million in the year, which was above our full year revised guidance range of $116 million to $136 million. this robust cash flow generation allowed us to make good progress on our capital deployment initiatives. capex of $74 million was spent during the year, which was below our guidance and included close to $11 million for foundry related expansion work. as we manage through the various constraints and challenges caused by the pandemic, we deferred certain capital projects in 2020. we expect maintenance capex will be higher in 2021 as our operations return to normal levels.
we continue to make good progress managing our balance sheet. during the year we spent approximately $104 million of cash to reduce debt outstanding by $110 million. this includes repurchasing $62.7 million face value sxcp notes at a discount. as we have consistently indicated our long-term goal is to reduce our gross leverage ratio down to 3 times or lower. we also returned capital to our shareholders in 2020. we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $7 million during the first quarter. we also paid a total of $0.24 per share dividend in 2020 which was the use of cash of approximately $20 million. in total, we ended 2020 with a cash balance of approximately $48 million and a strong liquidity position of approximately $348 million, setting the stage for continued progress against our capital allocation priorities in 2021.
at this time, i would like to turn the call back over to mike to share our views on the steel and coal market, before i run through our guidance expectations for 2021. mike?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, fay. before we -- pardon me. before we review our 2021 guidance, i wanted to provide a few brief thoughts on the overall market and where we see things as we enter the new year. 2020 proved to be a roller coaster ride for the steel industry. prior to the pandemic, utilization rates were stable at around 80%, reflecting good fundamental demand. as the coronavirus took hold, capacity utilization [indecipherable] dramatically to a low of 52% with all major integrated steel producers shutting down blast furnaces. as the economy started to reopen in the fall, steel demand and capital -- and capacity utilization began to recover slowly. as 2020 came to a close [indecipherable] prices reached levels not seen in many years. steel demand and capacity utilization rates largely recovered and were approaching pre-pandemic levels. we anticipate 2021 to be a year of continued recovery for the steel industry, potential for passage of a long overdue infrastructure bill, coupled with continued industrial recovery provides a good backdrop for the industry.
looking beyond 2021, we believe that suncoke is well positioned for long-term success. we have the youngest domestic coke making facilities in the nafta region and continue to invest in our facilities to ensure they operate safely and efficiently. we have leading technology with outstanding environmental performance and are recognized as the epa mact standard. our coke production process is the cleanest and least carbon intensive in the world. we believe some of the older coke supply is coming toward the end of their life cycle and will be retired in the future. in addition, recent developments in the steel market have created the potential to economically produced pig iron or [phonetic] consumption by the eas. the production of pig iron, the domestic blast furnaces will require coke, which could create opportunities for our company.
we are also entering new foundry and export markets, which provides on customer and market diversification. on the thermal coal export side, the market is showing signs of recovery. api2 prices increased by approximately 15% in the fourth quarter versus the prior quarter. and we have seen substantial increases in export coal shipments from the gulf coast and east coast ports. we recently signed a new two-year take-or-pay agreement with javelin to handle coal at cmt. we have also successfully handled iron ore at cmt and we expect that we will continue to handle this new product in 2021, fully repositioning cmt is a multi-year undertaking and it continues to be one of our top priorities.
now, i'll turn it over to fay to review our 2021 adjusted ebitda guidance.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike. turning to slide 10. we expect 2021 adjusted ebitda to be between $215 million and $230 million. domestic coke will contribute an incremental $2 million to $7 million in 2021 as we run our domestic coke fleet at full capacity with uncontracted capacity being sold into the export and foundry markets. we anticipate higher o&m spending as our operations and capital activities return to a more normal level in 2021.
turning to logistics segment, we expect logistics to contribute an additional $3 million to $8 million in 2021. as mike mentioned, we anticipate that market conditions for coal export will continue to improve, which we anticipate will result in higher volume. we also see opportunities for incremental volumes from non-coal throughput. lastly, we expect our corporate and other segment to be better by approximately $4 million to $8 million. the year-over-year favorability is driven by lower employee-related costs and the absence of certain discrete items such as foundry related r&d expense.
moving on to slide 11. in 2021, we expect our domestic coke adjusted ebitda will be between $219 million and $224 million with sales of approximately 4.1 million tons. once again, we expect to run the domestic fleet at full capacity. approximately 3.85 million tons are contracted under long-term take-or-pay agreements. we expect to sell the remaining volumes in the foundry and export markets. foundry and export tons do not replace blast furnace tons and a ton per ton basis. for example, due to the differences in the production price -- process, a single ton of foundry coke replaces approximately 2 tons of blast furnace coke. these differences are reflected in our sales estimates of 4.1 million tons. the total sales volume for foundry and export coke is expected to be between 250,000 tons and 270,000 tons, which is the blast furnace equivalent of approximately 400,000 tons.
our 2021 projections also include lower cost coal cost recovery at our jewell facility, which is exposed to commodity risk through 2021. additionally, lower coal prices in 2021 will drive lower yield gains across our domestic coke fleet. lastly, we also expect that operating and maintenance costs will be higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. certain maintenance and maintenance activities and capital projects were deferred due to constraints imposed by the pandemic as well as lower production. as production ramps up and the operating conditions normalize, we expect that maintenance spending will normalize as well.
looking at slide 12. 2021 logistics adjusted ebitda is expected to be between $20 million and $25 million, an increase of $3 million to $8 million versus 2020. as discussed earlier, we have a new contract with javelin, which included a 4 million ton take-or-pay volume agreement for 2021 and 3 million tons for 2022. given the current coal export market and looking at the api2 forward curve, we are projecting between 4 million tons and 5 million tons of coal to be exported from cmt in 2021. additionally, we have also tested iron ore handling at our facility and continue to look for other opportunities. our value estimates include between 2.5 million to 3 million tons of non-coke throughput such as pet coke, aggregates and iron ore.
we expect slightly higher volumes at our domestic coal terminals as well with our coke production facilities ramping back up to full production. but third-party volumes will remain tempered. we expect to handle 10.5 million tons through our domestic coal terminals in 2021 versus approximately 9.5 million tons handled in 2020. overall, we see some positive indication that the commodity market is improving and that the initial success at cmt has achieved in test products will result in potential upside, which is contemplated in the larger guidance range for logistics adjusted ebitda in 2021. we understand that this is a small step toward realizing the full potential of cmt and we will continue to pursue our initiatives to bring on new customers additional volume and new products at cmt.
moving to the 2021 guidance summary on slide 13. this slide provides a historical view of actual performance across many metrics as well as a summary of our 2021 guidance. once again, we expect adjusted ebitda to be between $215 million and $230 million in 2021. our coke operations are expected to ramp back up to full capacity and the logistics segment had some upside potential with new products and higher coal export volumes. we anticipate our capex requirement in 2021 will be around $80 million. this includes some deferred projects from 2020 and is in line with our long-term capital capex estimates on an annual basis. our free cash flow is expected to be between $80 million and $100 million after taking into account cash interest, cash taxes, capital expenditures and minimal working capital changes.
with that, i'll turn it back to mike.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, fay. so wrapping up on slide 14. 2021 will be a year to build on our strong foundation. as always safety and operational performance is top of mind for our organization. our efforts will focus on successfully executing against our operating and capital plan in 2021. we are entering into two new markets for 2021. we tested these opportunities on a limited basis, but this year will be the first where we participate on an industrial scale. our objective is to succeed in these markets by proving ourselves as a reliable supplier of high quality product. these sales are important for suncoke success in 2021 as well as in future years. we will continue to pursue opportunities to optimize our asset base, specifically as it relates to cmt, repositioning convent marine terminal from primarily a coal export terminal to a more diversified terminal will be an area of focus. suncoke will continue working toward further expanding our customers and products in 2021.
as we have demonstrated in the past, we will continue to execute our well established and well balanced capital allocation goals, continuing to bring our debt balance down is critical to stabilizing and strengthening our capital structure. we will continue to evaluate capital needs of our business, our capital structure and the need to reward shareholders on a continuous basis and we'll make capital allocation decisions accordingly. in total, we are excited and optimistic for the new year, after battling through an unprecedented 2020. we see great potential to build on the strength of our core coke making and logistics franchises to enter new markets, serve new customers, meet our financial targets and create value for our shareholders.
with that, let's go ahead and open it up for q&a.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of matthew fields from bank of america. your line is open.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, everyone. just wanted to ask a few here on the business. what was the foundry coke volumes in the first quarter?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
matthew, thanks for your question. but as we've indicated in the past, we don't intend to discuss specific volumes or price components of the foundry coke or export sales activities. as you can appreciate, i know, particularly the foundry coke market is a smaller market and to discuss in any detail our participation would not put us in a competitively good position. but i think it's worth noting matthew that, we set out on this foundry initiative going back a little over a year and as you can see in our first quarter results, we've exceeded in a very modest way. our expectations for the coke business, we came out of last year in a turned down position and we're fortunate enough to have good weather and great operations. we ran at full capacity in the first quarter. so the objective there was to allow us to continue to run full and to do so profitably and i hope you can agree that we had a very nice first quarter on our coke operations. so foundry has gone exactly as we'd expected it to.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
absolutely. and then previously you guys have -- in your slide deck you've given -- when you break down kind of the quarterly shipments and logistics, you've given the cmt ebitda, like an ebitda attributable to content specifically. and i think that's missing this quarter. is that a departure from policy? do you -- are you not going to provide that anymore or is it just an oversight and you can give that to us?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well it's not an oversight matthew. it's purposeful and some of the foundry as we're now repositioning cmt, we expect to be serving different customers, different markets over different time periods, different circumstances. so to discuss in any level of detail, the profitability of cmt again, given the competitive situation down there in the gulf, might disadvantage us in the commercial markets where we have to compete every day.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
all right, fair enough. i'm afraid of going over three here, but i guess it's enough.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
those were great questions and i hope you can appreciate the necessity to protect ourselves commercially and act smarter.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
understand. maybe i'll ask in a different way here. the iron ore take-or-pay contract, is that with a us customer or a foreign customer?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
it's with a us customer.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. investment grade rated customer?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
i said, i'm going to say no. i probably already said too much because all i did is invite the next question.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
all right, fair enough. that's helpful. and then just sort of just going on the back of the guidance for cash flow for the year $80 million to $100 million, maybe you're closer to the top end of that if you're sort of guide -- hitting the top end of everything else. that kind of implies close to $55 million of cash flow for the next three quarters, which gets you basically all the way paid off on the revolver by year-end. is that -- obviously things can happen and we don't know what the future holds, but is that kind of the plan, if that the cash you're generating for the rest of the year kind of whittle down that revolver balance over the next three quarters as low as you can get it?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
and here your thoughts were in [indecipherable] for three, you're exactly right. so now, you're going one for three and then all the same because you have added 333.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
perfect. i'll take it. all right. thanks and good luck with the rest of the year.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of lucas pipes from b. riley securities. your line is open.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
well, i'll try to do better than 333. but good job on the quarter. and first question mike, just to hone in a little bit on how the business is running versus your expectations. so you talked about an update three months from now. the meantime comfortably upper end of your previous guidance range. and what i'm looking for. in my first question is, is a little bit more color as to what's been driving the better than expected performance? is it foundry coke, is it export, is it domestic customers coming back looking for more volumes on the back of the strength in the steel market? just a little bit more color on that, i would appreciate it. thank you.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
yes, good question. thanks, lucas. the outperformance doesn't have to do with our volumes. we expected to run full and we did. so whether it's our domestic customers, our export customers or our foundry customers, we're meeting the expectations we've set out for ourselves with regard to all three of those markets. so outperformance really comes on the cost side. our teams did absolutely a wonderful job here in the first quarter and i very much appreciative of their hard work.
also you can appreciate, in the first quarter, we don't have a lot of outage work. we choose not to do outages in the first quarter, because weather can really -- havoc on those outages. sometimes new outage work necessary to reduce your production during that timeframe, reduce your electricity, your steam production during that timeframe and the work we do during the first quarter, albeit limited had no impact on our production. so the teams had a wide-open field from which to perform. and they took advantage of that opportunity. certainly winter can present challenges for manufacturers like ourselves and this winter with the exception of a few weeks was relatively a mild one. so we had a little bit of wind at our back there too, but i don't want to take anything away from the performance of the teams. they all performed at very, very high levels and they exceeded our expectations for performance on the cost side.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
very helpful. really appreciate that. i'll take this for a double. and then just kind of looking ahead, there is another step down in your domestic coke minimums in 2022 and just looking for an update here. are there ongoing negotiations? are you predominantly looking to the export market, more foundry coke business on -- as those minimum step down. just what's your plan for that? i am sure you can appreciate, this is an important question for investors. thank you.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
it's an excellent question and the answer is all three. it's premature to comment as to which one of those alternatives will ultimately win out for '22 and beyond, but we are in discussions with our domestic customers, we continue to look to grow our export and our foundry coke business. economics will drive that and obviously as we get closer to '22, we will be providing updates as to the [indecipherable] of those labors, but i think for now, we had a 400,000 ton hole to fill, if you will this year and the year is not over yet, but we are running full and expectations are for '21 we'll continue to do so. so we need to continue to build on those initiatives. that's where our future success lies.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
mike, just now you said for '21 expectations. was that '21 or '22?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
'21, we expect to run full in '21. we have 400,000 tons to fill and we expect to be able to fill those tons in '21.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
and for 2022, is there a concern that you may have to reduce utilization rates. if one of the three initiatives fall short, what would be the contingency plan for that?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well if those plans fall short, we obviously run it less than full capacity. it's not our intention or our desire or our goal to not run full next year. we believe quite strongly, but we produce a very high quality product, second to none in the market, whether it's the domestic market or the global market. our coke and its physical properties, its utilization in blast furnace is unrivaled. so we believe we've got a wonderful product. we believe we're a low-cost producer and it will be my dying belief that low-cost producers of quality products should be able to run their facilities fuller. so it's my strong belief and my intention to see our facilities run fuller, well maintained as you know, they are reliable and customers appreciate these things.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
very helpful. thank you, mike. not sure if this will count as a single or not. but i appreciate your perspective. last one from me. on the iron ore take-or-pay, probably strike out on this one, but can you give us a little bit more context around term volume? just a little bit more color for investors to appreciate the opportunity here. thank you.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
and you're going to strike out in this one lucas, but you're still going to go to hall of fame too. so don't feel badly, but we again for commercial reasons and i hope you can all appreciate the sensitivity, we're just not going to go into the specifics of these new agreements we're reaching as we revitalize cmt.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
understood. all right, well. continued best of luck. i hope we'll see each other in the hall of fame shortly. and i'll turn it over. all the best.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks lucas.

your next question comes from the line of brett hendrickson from nokomis capital. your line is open.
brett hendrickson -- nokomis capital -- analyst
hey mike. how is it going? thanks for all...,
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks brett.
brett hendrickson -- nokomis capital -- analyst
so you guys -- can you hear me ok mike?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
brett, pardon me, you're breaking up. we're not able to hear you.
brett hendrickson -- nokomis capital -- analyst
hey mike can you hear me now?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's loud and clear. thanks.
brett hendrickson -- nokomis capital -- analyst
good. the operator had trouble hearing me too. anyways, thanks for all the hard work. you said something to lucas that reminded me of some of those, i mean to ask you. you talked about the quality of your coking coal, there has been more of the steel manufacturers and even some of the car manufacturers have been talking about -- call it an environmentally more friendly coal. and could you just talk about where you guys might have an advantage there as they become -- it seems like increasingly focused by the month on that. so could you talk about maybe where that creates advantage and maybe how that fits into some of the comments in '22?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's a good question. but it's actually quite a complex question, but i'll try to be brief in my answer. the question really revolves around environmental performance and more particularly greenhouse gas emissions. i think our environmental record speaks for itself over the mact standard, no one's built a coke battery in united states, utilizing technology other than ours since 1998 and that remains the case. we don't have water discharges and we combust the particulate matter in our coke production process and produce electricity and steel. so environmentally, our process is the standard and that's the broader, the more focus question around greenhouse gas goes to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the production of steel and the science is a bit complex here, but simply our product by its nature is a very high strength product. the csr is the term you hear tossed around and what that allows steel makers to do is reduce the amount of coke in the furnace, and remain able to support the burden inside of the blast furnace and substitute it in other materials, whether it'd be natural gas or bhpi. so our products specifically allows for less greenhouse gases to be thrown off in the production of iron. so we believe that we offer an environmentally friendly product, both in the production of the product itself, that's the coke making as well as it allows steel makers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the iron making process.
operator
there are no further questions at this time. i'd turn the call back over to mike rippey.

before i turn things over to mike, let me remind you that the various remarks we make on today's call regarding future expectations constitute forward-looking statements. the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in our sec filings apply to the remarks we make today. these documents are available on our website, as our reconcilations to non-gaap financial measures discussed on today's call.
with that, i'll now turn things over to mike.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks shantanu. good morning and thank you all for joining us this morning. today we announced suncoke's first quarter results and before i turn it over to allison, who will review the results in detail, i want to discuss a few highlights. first on safety. i would like to thank all of my fellow suncoke teammates as well as congratulate them for their continued commitment and contributions. the dedication of our team is clearly visible through our excellent safety performance, where we achieved zero recordable injuries during the first quarter, a record for our company. in the -- from the coronavirus front, we continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the health and safety of our workforce and have implemented policies and procedures that follow the guidelines established by the cdc, osha and local health and governmental authorities to protect our workforce and contractors.
turning to our results. in the quarter, we were extremely pleased with the operational performance that our team delivered across both our coke and logistics segments. our coke making operations returned to running at full capacity and our logistics operations saw a significant uptick in volume. we achieved record-setting first quarter results with adjusted ebitda of $70.6 million, a 14% improvement over q1 2020. we are also pleased with our initial performance in the foundry and export coke markets. our products are well received and we are excited about the possibilities in these markets in the future. we will continue to work on optimizing our production and growing our market participation for these products.
a very encouraging development for our logistics segment this quarter was the signing of a new take or pay agreement to handle iron ore pellets at cmt. as we discussed in our last call, we successfully tested this product during the fourth quarter of last year, which has resulted in a take or pay agreement and a new product for our logistics business. looking at our capital structure and deployment of cash in the first quarter, we reduced debt by $33 million during the quarter and continued to execute on our deleveraging initiative, while also maintaining our $0.06 per share quarterly dividend. we are well on our way to achieving our long-term gross leverage target of 3 times or lower by the end of this year.
overall, very strong operational and financial performance in the first quarter provides a solid foundation to build on for the rest of the year. we now expect results at the top end of our 2021 guidance of $215 million to $230 million.
with that, i'll turn it over to allison to review our first quarter earnings in detail. allison?
allison s. lausas -- interim senior vice president, chief financial officer and controller
thanks, mike, and good morning everyone. turning to slide 4. our first quarter net income attributable to sxc was $0.20 per share, up $0.14 versus the prior-year period, mainly driven by our logistics segment performance. adjusted ebitda came in at $70.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, up $8.5 million versus the first quarter of 2020. the increase was primarily due to approximately 1.1 million tons of higher throughput volumes at our logistics segment.
turning to the detailed adjusted ebitda bridge on slide 5. first quarter 2021 adjusted ebitda was higher by $8.5 million or 14% over the prior year period. our coke operations performed well this quarter and results were reasonably consistent with the first quarter of 2020. the majority of the period over period increase in adjusted ebitda was driven by our logistics segment and cmt saw a significant increase in coal export volumes driven by strong global demand and supported api2 pricing. when adding in slightly favorable results in corporate and other, we ended first quarter at $70.6 million of adjusted ebitda.
turning to slide 6 to discuss our domestic coke business performance in detail. first quarter adjusted ebitda per ton was $61 on 1,038,000 sales ton. our domestic coke fleet ramps back up to full capacity utilization during the first quarter of 2021 after the volume turned down in the second half of 2020. foundry and export sales complemented our long-term take-or-pay contracted sales and are expected to continue to do so for the rest of 2021. as a reminder, foundry tons do not replace blast furnace tons on a ton per ton basis. for example, due to differences in the production process, a single ton of foundry coke replaces approximately 2 tons of blast furnace coke leading to lower coke production in sales in the current quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2020. our coke plants continued their strong operational performance and disciplined cost management during the quarter, while producing and selling new products. on the back of strong first quarter '21 -- 2021 performance, we are on track to achieve our full year domestic coke adjusted ebitda per ton and production guidance.
moving to slide 7 to discuss our logistics business. the logistics business generated $10.9 million of adjusted ebitda during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to $3.3 million in the prior year period. the increase in adjusted ebitda is primarily due to higher throughput volumes at cmt. our logistics business handled 5.3 million tons of throughput volumes during the quarter as compared to 4.2 million tons during the prior-year period. cmt handled 1.6 million more tons versus the prior-year period, mainly driven by higher coal exports and iron ore. increased global demand, strong api2 index pricing and increasing natural gas prices have resulted in higher thermal coal exports from the us. we expect export volumes to remain strong in the second quarter. although our domestic terminals volumes were lower compared to the first quarter of 2020, it was more than offset by lower operating costs resulting from the cost savings initiatives implemented last year.
given our very strong first quarter 2021 results and looking at the api2 forward curve, we now expect to deliver at the higher end or possibly even exceed our logistics adjusted ebitda guidance range of $20 million to $25 million. we expect to handle approximately 5 million tons of coal at cmt as compared to our original guidance of 4 million to 5 million tons, along with 2.5 million to 3 million tons of other products for which the guidance remains unchanged. the volume guidance for our domestic coal terminals also remains unchanged at approximately 10.5 million ton.
turning to slide 8 and our liquidity position for q1. as you can see from the chart, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of approximately $54 million. cash flow from operating activities, generated close to $65 million due to strong operating performance and the timing of cash payments. we spent $20.1 million on capex during the quarter, which included some carryover payments from last year. we lowered our debt by $33 million during the quarter, with the majority of the reduction coming in the form of pay downs on our revolving credit facility. we expect additional deleveraging to continue over the balance of the year as we continue to make good progress managing our balance sheet. we also paid dividends worth $5.1 million at the rate of $0.06 per share during the quarter. in total, we ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position of approximately $386 million.
with that i will turn it back to mike.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, allison. wrapping up on slide 9. as always, safety and operational performance is top of mind for our organization. we want to continue our exceptional safety performance demonstrated in the first quarter, while focusing on successfully executing against our operating and capital plan in 2021.
as i mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the progress we have made during the first quarter on our foundry and export coke growth initiatives. these additional sales, enable our coke fleet to run optimally at full capacity and we will continue to focus on further developing our customer base and participation in these markets. from our logistics business perspective, the new iron ore take-or-pay agreement is another step in the direction of revitalizing cmt as we continue our efforts to bring new products and customers. the uptick in coal exports underpinned by the revised take-or-pay contract provides a strong foundation to further build upon at cmt. we again made good progress on our well established and well balanced capital allocation goals, continuing to bring down our debt balance is critical to stabilizing and strengthening our capital structure. we will continue to evaluate capital needs of the business, our capital structure and the need to reward shareholders on a continuous basis and we'll make capital allocation decisions accordingly.
finally, as i stated earlier, continued strength in steel and coal export markets combined with our excellent first quarter results leads us to comfortably project full-year results at the high end of our adjusted ebitda guidance. we will provide further updates to the guidance as we have more clarity about the second half of the year in our next earnings call.
with that, let's go ahead and open up the call for q&a.

[operator instructions] and your first question is from matthew fields of bank of america.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, everyone. congrats on great execution in the foundry coke market and the logistics market and with the successful refinancing. just wanted to sort of touch on the debt reduction comments you made toward the end of your prepared remarks. given the free cash flow guidance of $85 million to $100 million, i think we've had already about $70 million in the free cash flow this year. so $15 million to $30 million left, after dividends it's about $5 million to $20 million, perhaps for kind of debt paydown. is that with [indecipherable] revolver pay down that we can expect to see over the back half or is there something more that you kind of have in the hopper? what's the kind of gross debt number that we can look to see reduced from june 30 to the end of the year?
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
well, i think matthew your math is usual as pretty spot on given the guidance that we've laid out.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then, gradually that we're not going to be at so much debt reduction from here to the end of the year, you've obviously got a good amount in the first half. but that guidance the newly revised higher guidance you're kind of well below your historical leverage target. so i guess the question is kind of what changes first capital allocation or the leverage target?
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
well, here we might disagree a bit. our long articulated and perhaps not well-articulated target was three times or less. and perhaps not emphasize fully enough or less part, we're delighted to be just below three times as we finished the second quarter. but the -- or less part becomes something that i need to emphasize more. so for the time being our focus is, as we've said is to continue to pay down debt, get below that three times. and in the years ahead we'll talk more about capital allocation recognizing fully the need to reward shareholders, to continue to invest in our facilities to maintain them at the high level that they are today, and have a prudent debt level as well.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
all right. thanks very much for that answer. we appreciate the emphasis on the or less part. very helpful and good luck on the rest of the year.
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
thanks. appreciate it.
operator
the next question is from lucas pipes of b. riley securities.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
thank you very much and good morning, everyone. and congrats on the strong quarter and strong outlook for the year.
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, lucas.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
mike, i want to touch a bit on the minimum customer commitments for next year. i mean this is something we've been talking about for really the past 12 months, i think it was last august that you disclosed additional information there. so i wondered, kind of what's your outlook here, there continues to be a lot of talk about carbon reduction goals in the industry and i would appreciate if you could share your thoughts about one, on -- 2022 minimum commitments? but then also longer term, how do you see suncoke positioned on that front? thank you very much.
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
lucas, it's also great questions. and we're really not prepared today to talk about 2022. but you're correct in talking about august of last year and we started to discuss the fact that we would enter the foundry and the export markets with around 400,000 to 450,000 tons to sell. and we have indeed accomplished that, this year we're running full and we're selling those quantities into the export and foundry markets. that 450,000 grows to approximately 800,000 next year given the renewals that we did with what was then arcelormittal. given the strength of our markets we see today, we feel we're well-received in the markets and should be able to continue to sell successfully into those markets notwithstanding the fact that things may change. so that's kind of when you think about '21 and '22 and what was required of us to sell into the foundry and export markets that's where that [indecipherable]. you mentioned carbon and that's a much longer-term question, people committed themselves to -- in the extreme be carbon-neutral by 2050. we of course, support initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint, it's associated with making the steel. i'd remind you that the us carbon footprint compared to the rest of the world is very, very favorable [phonetic] comparing against european steel makers or asian steel makers we clearly as a country have the best carbon footprint today.
and i look to see that continue to improve. we play a role in that of course and through all we play is and we emphasis this, we reliably produce a very high-quality coke. and the nature of our coke, the quality of our coke, the strength of our coke allows for better support and you might find in lesser cokes, and when you can support the burden in the blast furnace, that allows for the increased usage of substitute fuels whether it'd be natural gas or hpi. so as our customers look to reduce their carbon footprint and increase the use of other fuels in their furnace as we stand ready to support them again with our high-quality coke, so which we believe to be unmatched here domestically and perhaps globally. and as well, we look to maintain our leading environmental technology, which in the coke making process itself is the best in class. so we encourage the reduction in the carbon footprint and all those discussions that are taking place today. we think we're well positioned to participate.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
terrific, really helpful. thank you, mike, for that detail. second question, turning over to your logistics business, obviously a remarkable recovery and seaborne coal prices in particular and kind of as you look at how this business is positioned today, you raised guidance. is there interest for longer-term arrangements again? there were discussions in the past about possibly selling cmt, is that something that you'd consider here and make them more interested parties as well? so i appreciate kind of a more comprehensive discussion of the market and then also the strategic outlook for cmt. thank you very much.
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
good question, lucas. obviously, we're very pleased with the performance. at cmt it's -- i know you'll remember only a few years ago cmt was more or less a captive facility to two customers. and those customers went through bankruptcy and that was a blow to cmt. and the challenge then for our team was to reposition that asset into a merchant facility and had we been unable to successfully reposition the asset, we would have considered a sale of the asset perhaps to someone better positioned to bring about that revitalization. and that was a challenge for our teams. and as you can see in our results they responded beautifully. they've been out working hard, knocking on doors and looking to enter new supply chains which aren't easy, it's not easy to disrupt a supply chain that's working well, so you have to have some patience. notwithstanding migrations; they have exceeded our expectation, part of that of course goes to the strength in the global commodity markets and a little wind at the back never hurt anybody, api2 prices are quite elevated today by historic measures and if you look at the forward api2 curve, it remains elevated.
so we're quite encouraged with the prospects for cmt and the thermal side as well as other commodities that we look to handle through the facility, and with good success with iron ore and pet coke and we're going to look to continue with those initiatives. so our singular focus now is to continue to build on the good success the team has had. like i said, i couldn't be more pleased with the work that they've done over the last 18 months to get this facility turned around and repositioned.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
very helpful mike. and a quick follow-up on that. when i think about 7.5 million tons of coal, 3.5 million tons of other materials. how does that compare to the nameplate capacity, and so is there kind of little room to the cart to maybe increase volumes further given the strong market backdrop?
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
there is a little more room, lucas. so it's a great question. i'd like to see us perhaps a little longer-term handling 15 million tons through there. we've made some debottlenecking investments at the facility who allow for that to happen. we were going to be happy with 11 million this year and maybe 12 million, there is an all-time record for us. i don't go back that far because i recall some of the folks that were around the media talking about 12 million tons years. and we get to 12 million, we're not going to be satisfied, we'll look to debottleneck and get to 15 million.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
very good. i will leave it here. thank you very much for all the color and best of luck.
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
your next question is from karl blunden of goldman sachs.
karl blunden -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for the time. we've definitely built some flexibility on the balance sheet with the recent transaction and looks like cash flow is coming in a bit stronger than your prior expectations. when you take a look at the m&a environment, is there opportunity for you to play a role in that?
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
we'd like to so, karl, it's good question, i appreciate it. we have and we continue to look for opportunities, adjacent opportunities where we can provide value to our shareholders by delighting customers. and when i'm talking about consumer products of this year, we're talking about steel companies and related industries. so we'll look for opportunities to build on our foundation and serving our customers and markets we know, what products that we know, we've got a very nice technology portfolio of the company that we'd like to expand. you see the success of the foundry coke market while that's not m&a, it's organic growth. but those are the kind of undertakings we look for organic obviously, first because returns with organic growth are typically higher because the capex requirement is typically not large compared to the acquisition cost of an asset. but we're looking for good assets with good managements that are complementary to what we do. we're quite disciplined, we haven't done anything in my 3.5 years, not for lack of trying. but we're very disciplined in our approach. and unless we see returns that are well in excess of our cost of capital, we simply won't grow for the sake of growth. so we got a very disciplined approach here, we're looking -- we just haven't found anything as of this date that needs all of our criteria.
karl blunden -- goldman sachs -- analyst
but when you look at valuations available in the market today. could m&a deleveraging after synergies?
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
could be a lot of things. well, i'll just leave it at that [indecipherable], start to predict the future.
karl blunden -- goldman sachs -- analyst
it sounds good. we've spoken about success on kind of the commercial and revenue side. when you think about cost inflation and managing that through the footprint, are there areas of concern? or how are you managing the business today?
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
well, we're seeing some inflation. as shantanu indicated in his remarks on the capital side, clearly labors tighter than what it has been historically in the way you track labor in a tight market as you pay, it's more or less it's a simple math of supply and demand. and there is material cost inflation. we see hot bands at $1,800 a ton, we're not so long ago, there were $500 a ton. so, there is material cost inflation as well. we have to manage that by being as efficient as we can with the utilization of those inputs. on the operating front, we only really have two components, coal which is a pass-through to our customers and the labor that we use to convert that coal to coke, and the labor that we used to maintain our facilities, it's been remarkable inflation there yet. as you know the take or pay nature of our contracts allows for some of that increase to be passed on to our customers. but we don't -- just because we can pass it on take that as a reason not to continue to look to be ever more efficient.
so in all of our activities we're doing maintenance, for example, we look to extend the time between outages, so there's less need for outages and therefore less need for our labor and materials. we look to deploy automation to the extent we can, we look to increase our yields, we look to increase our throughputs we guided 50,000 tones up for the balance of the year on coke and there is no requirement for additional labor with that 50,000 tones, so to the extent we can be more efficient with our output, there is no labor component. so, you're offsetting the cost those inflationary cost increases by generating more throughputs. so there's lots of levers and industrial company can pull to try to offset what may be some structural changes in the inflationary environment, there's a lot of debate out there about whether this is transitory inflation or if it's structural, i don't want to second-guess the economists from the fed. but it certainly feels to me anyway that there is a little bit of structural inflation in the economy now.
karl blunden -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. thanks a lot, mike. appreciate it.
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
yes.

nathan martin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
yes. thanks, good morning, everybody. and congrats on the quarter and the debt refinancing.
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, nathan.
nathan martin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
yes. my bigger picture questions have -- most have been addressed at this point. so just really a quick modeling question. you may be -- understand the release but can you guys give us the breakdown in volumes at cmt between coal and other products? you mean the --
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
7.5 for coal and 3.5 for other.
nathan martin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
no. in the quarter, michael. i'm sorry. i think, shantanu, you guys did about maybe was 2.1 million tons of coal in the first quarter and of other [phonetic]. i was just curious what that might look like in q2?
shantanu agrawal -- director of fp&a, investor relations and treasurer
it's similar in the second quarter as well.
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
that's right.
nathan martin -- the benchmark company -- analyst

and your next question is from josh taykowski of credit suisse.
josh taykowski -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking the question. just had one for me, most of mine have been answered. but i was wondering if you could maybe just talk through the sequential slight margin pressures that you saw in 2q versus 1q. i guess more specifically the sequential decline in ebitda per ton on the domestic side as well as the margin differential in your brazil coke?
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
josh, it's really kind of what i would think of on the one hand, is noise. we have a little more outage work going on in the second quarter than the first. as we discussed in the first it was really an exceptional quarter were almost nothing went wrong. so it's relatively quarter-over-quarter the same results, you got some seasonality, some outage work, so timing for lack of a better word. and then in brazil, i think we earned the bonus in the second quarter and a little more throughput there. is that right, shantanu?
shantanu agrawal -- director of fp&a, investor relations and treasurer
yes. i mean it's really not a margin question. i think it's more of a denominator that coke tons produced and sold. i mean i think that the numerator -- the ebitda was more or less the same it's just the timing of the tons being sold and that leads to the dollar per ton being higher in q1 versus q2. it's really not of a margin question.
josh taykowski -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thanks, guys. appreciate it. congrats again.

and there are no further questions at this time. i'd turn the call back over to shantanu.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the suncoke energy second quarter 2021 earnings call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker shantanu agrawal. please go ahead.
shantanu agrawal -- director of fp&a, investor relations and treasurer
thanks, kathy. good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning to discuss suncoke energy's second quarter 2021 results. with me today is mike rippey, president and chief executive officer. following management's prepared remarks, we'll open the call for q&a. this conference call is being webcast live on the investor relations section of our website and a replay will be available later today. if we don't get to your questions on the call today, please feel free to reach out to our investor relations team.
before i turn things over to mike, let me remind you that the various remarks we make on today's call regarding future expectations constitute forward-looking statements. the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in our scc filings apply to the remarks we make today. these documents are available on our website as our reconciliations to non-gaap financial measures discussed on today's call.
with that, i'll now turn things over to mike.
mike rippey -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, shantanu. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i want to discuss a few highlights of our second quarter results before turning it back to shantanu who will review them in detail. first, i would like to thank all of our suncoke teammates for their continued commitment to our shared goals of working safely and efficiently to deliver high-quality products and services to our customers.
on the coronavirus front, we continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the health and safety of our workforce. we continue to strongly encourage all employees to get the covid-19 vaccination as it gives the best protection against the virus, while also protecting families and coworkers.
turning to our financial performance in the quarter, we are pleased with how our teams delivered across both the coke and logistics segments. coke making operations continued to operate at full capacity, while our logistics segment saw significant increases in volume. for the second quarter of 2021, we delivered adjusted ebitda of $68 million, a 15% improvement over q2 2020. during the second quarter, we also significantly strengthened our balance sheet with the execution of our debt refinancing transactions. we retired the existing 7.5% [phonetic] senior unsecured notes due in 2025 and issued 4.875% [phonetic] senior secured notes due in 2029. additionally, we extended our revolving credit facilities maturity to june 2026, from august 2024. these refinancings both extend our maturity profile and lowers our debt cost significantly. we will save an excess of $17 million in interest on an annual basis as a result of these refinancing activities.
operationally, our export and foundry coke initiatives continue to perform well and we are seeing a positive impact in our financial results. our products are being well received as we demonstrate our ability to reliably deliver quality products during a time when supply chain disruptions and delays have become all too common. we remain committed to future growth in these markets and we continue to see solid prospects in the years ahead. cmt's revitalization is also well underway aided by global strength in commodity markets. we see continued improvement in both volumes and product mix handle the cmt contributing meaningfully to our financial results. based on our record first half performance and the expectation of continued strength in steel and coal markets for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full-year 2021 adjusted ebitda guidance to $255 million to $265 million from the original guidance of $215 million to $230 million.
with that, i'll turn it over to shantanu to review our second quarter earnings in detail. shantanu?
shantanu agrawal -- director of fp&a, investor relations and treasurer
thanks, mike. turning to slide 4, our second-quarter net loss attributable to sxc was $0.11 per share, down $0.19 versus the prior-year period. current quarter earnings per share reflects a $0.27 impact of debt extinguishment-related charges in connection with the refinancings. adjusted ebitda came in at $68 million for the quarter. the increase was primarily due to approximately 2.2 million tons of higher throughput volumes at our logistics segment.
turning to the adjusted ebitda bridge on slide 5, second quarter 2021 adjusted ebitda was higher by $9 million or 15% over the prior-year period. our coke operations again performed well this quarter and results were reasonably consistent with the second quarter of 2020. the majority of the period-over-period increase in adjusted ebitda was driven by our logistics segment as cmt continues to see significant increases in the coal export and iron ore volumes. with little change in corporate and other, we ended second quarter at $68 million of adjusted ebitda.
turning to slide 6 to discuss our liquidity position in q2. as you can see from the chart, we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $51.7 million. the highlight of the quarter was our debt refinancing transactions as mentioned by mike earlier. along with the meaningful expansions on debt maturities we'll also benefit from significant cash interest savings in excess of $17 million on an annual basis. in the second quarter cash flow from operating activities generated close to $40 million. we spent $13.6 million on capex during the quarter and paid dividends of $5 million at the rate of $0.06 per share. we paid $10.5 million as transaction fees for issuance of the new senior secured notes and extension of the revolver. we also paid $22 million as premium to call the 2025 senior notes as part of the refinancing transaction.
our total debt balance increased by $9 million over the quarter and stood at approximately $667 million at the end of second quarter. on an ltm adjusted ebitda basis, our gross leverage ratio is just under three times and we expect additional deleveraging to continue over the balance of the year. in total we ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position of approximately $237 million.
now moving to slide 7 to discuss our domestic coke business performance and revised full-year outlook. second year adjusted ebitda per ton -- second quarter adjusted ebitda per ton was $58 on 1,063,000 sales ton. our domestic coke fleet continues to run at full capacity and our products in both export and foundry coke markets are well received. based on the performance during the first half of the year and the expectations for the remainder of 2021, we are increasing the domestic coke adjusted ebitda guidance to $234 million to $238 million from original guidance of $219 million to $224 million. we are also projecting coke production to be higher by 50,000 tons from the original guidance. as a reminder, the coke production guidance includes all three products contracting blast furnace coke, export coke, and foundry coke.
moving to slide 8 to discuss our logistics business. the logistics business generated $11.4 million of adjusted ebitda during the second quarter of 2021, as compared to $3 million in prior-year period. the increase adjusted ebitda is primarily due to higher throughput volumes at cmt. the segment as a whole handled $5.1 million tons of throughput volumes during the quarter as compared to 2.9 million tons during the prior-year period. cmt handled 1.9 million more tons versus the prior-year period mainly driven by higher coal exports and the addition of iron ore as a new product.
increased global demand, strong api2 index pricing and elevated natural gas pricing in europe continue to spur us thermal coal exports. given our strong first half 2021 results and looking at the api2 forward curve, we now expect to deliver full year logistics adjusted ebitda in the range of $45 million to $48 million, as compared to original guidance of $20 million to $25 million. we anticipate handling approximately 7.5 million tons of coal along with approximately 3.5 million tons of other products at cmt for the full-year 2021. the volume guidance for our domestic coal terminals remains unchanged at approximately 10.5 million tons.
turning to slide 9, which summarizes our revised 2021 guidance. we now expect consolidated adjusted ebitda to be between $255 million and $265 million as compared to original guidance of $215 million to $230 million. this incorporates increased profitability expectation from export foundry sales in the coke segment and higher volumes at cmt in the logistics segment.
our capital expenditures are now estimated to be approximately $90 million as compared to the original guidance of $80 million with inflationary pressures being the main driver for the increase. our revised free cash flow guidance stands at $85 million to $100 million with the increase in adjusted ebitda mostly offset by the 2025 senior notes call premium and debt issuance cost.
with that, i'll turn it over to mike.

thank you, shantanu. wrapping up on slide 10, as always safety and operational performance is top of mind for our organization. we work to continue to perform safely while successfully executing against our operating and capital plan for the remainder of the year. as we end the second quarter, we are fully sold out for 2021 and are running at capacity. our order book is full for this year, we will continue to focus on further developing our customer base and participation in export and foundry coke markets for future years. we've made good progress on revitalizing cmt during the first half of the year.
based on our projections, the second half should surpass the first. we will continue to build on this foundation for cmt's long-term success. as i mentioned earlier, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter with the execution of the debt refinancings. to revise debt structure aligns well with our business model and capital allocation priorities. for the remainder of the year, we will continue to work toward reducing our debt balance. in the longer term, we will continually evaluate the capital needs of our business, our capital structure, and the need to reward shareholders and we'll make capital allocation decisions accordingly.
finally based on the reliability and performance of our operating segments, we look to achieve our adjusted ebitda guidance of $255 million to $265 million for 2021.
with that, let's go ahead and open the call for q&a.

(operator instructions) and your first question comes from matthew fields of bank of america. matthew, your line is now open.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
hi everyone, congratulations on the announcement of the simplification transaction. i guess one extra benefit you didn't list is you don't have to do two conference calls anymore.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that's right.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
just -- is there any reason that we can think of that this deal won't go through whether that's the independent board of directors that you've had issues with the last time or any regulatory reason that things will get blocked?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
no, we don't foresee any issues. the sxcp conflicts committee voted unanimously to approve the transaction. the sxcp board took that recommendation and unanimously approved the transaction from the sxcp perspective. as well the sxc board unanimously approved the transaction. we laid out a timeline for you where we will go through all of the customary activities that you can go through, including filings with the sec and we expect the news with the sec to go without issue. so as we've indicated, we expect to close either later second or third quarter after we obtain those filings. we'll have a proxy filing, we'll be asking sxc common shareholders to approve the transaction as well. but no, we don't foresee any issues at all.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
so the only thing that's not locked down so to speak is the sxc shareholder vote at this point?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. great. thank you. and then just sort of looking on the -- at a pro forma kind of consolidated transaction, please let me know if i'm wrong here, but it looks like for the bonds, you know, leverage goes from about 3.8 times or 3.9 times depending on how you calculate it to about to 3.2 times on a consolidated basis, right, when you collapse this, is that correct?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
it's about right.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. so, probably about half a ton there then. just help me please if i'm understanding this, only the public units will get exchanged into sxc shares, is that right?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that's correct.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
the 17.7 million sxcp units held by the public. so pro forma share count should be about 90 million sxc shares, is that right?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
right.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
correct. we're going to issue right around 24 million shares.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
so the pro forma future dividend at $0.24 per year will be about $21 million, $22 million.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
your math is spot on.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. versus before sxcp was distributing about $80 million on a run-rate basis. obviously you were getting that -- some of that at the parent, but i think about $30 million was leaving the complex, is that the right way think about it?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
matt, you're thinking about it exactly right.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thanks. moving on to indiana harbor, is the rebuild project done at the end of 2019?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we have 57 b ovens remaining to be rebuilt in 2019 after which the entire complex (inaudible).
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
so all else being equal, given your guidance about $22 million of ebitda up to $50 million and then the capex you are spending on this, is the right way to think about 2019 to 2020, if nothing else changes, $25 million to $30 million of extra ebitda from indiana harbor and then $40 million to $45 million less capex for the whole complex from all else being equal?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's right.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
so if you add that together that's about $65 (ph) million to $75 million of extra free cash flow. what's the sort of earmarked or what's your thinking about using this free cash flow once you get to the 3x leverage target which you're pretty much almost at right now?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well, you're correct. our focus this year will be of course on completing the transaction. we indicated we'll begin the payment of a common dividend in the first quarter post close of the transaction and we'll be focused on de-levering. at the same time we'll be, as you touched on, one significant organic growth opportunity that's to rebuild the b. our focus this year will be on that successful rebuild. beyond which time we'll begin to develop a very rich list, if you will, of opportunities to trigger our business either organically or through a variety of m&a transactions. so we're building that pipeline. we're going to do so in a thoughtful way.
our company has -- we like to believe, this may sound not fully modest, but we believe that we have a good reputation with our customers for producing high-quality products and delivering them in a very reliable manner. we'll begin to look for opportunities in areas where we'll have operation and technological expertise to grow. but we will be selective toward buying assets that are high-quality assets which fits nicely with repetition that we believe we earn today. and we're not going to act in a hasty way where we might overpay. so we'll be very, very disciplined in our approach. but with this simplification we're unlocking the opportunity to do that because some of the limitations that were present prior will be eliminated post simplification.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. well, a bigger picture, your first bullet on slide 10 of your -- which is your strategic focus says growing market share in the north american coke market. it seems like most, if not all, of the blast furnace steel producers have their kind of coke supply pretty well shored up. where do you see opportunity to grow share? and is us steel's problems are creating one of those opportunities that you see?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
no, you've read what we have publicly about the very current issues (inaudible). but we see continued good market for our customers. so if end used demand for steel products rose, naturally there is opportunities for suppliers, we being here talking about coke, for coke demand to increase we would expect to satisfy that demand as well as there are opportunities and harbor's one of them, we're organically our business in a meaningful way. only a year ago we were making 825,000 tons annually at the harbor. post completion rebuild we'll at a 1.2 million tons. so there's organic growth. and we expect as a high-quality low-cost producer to capture the growth available to us in the market.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thanks. and then on other side of that, given ak steel's decision to permanently shut down ashland, your haverhill contract is at the end of the 2021. so even if they cancel, you are kind of dovetailing with the end of that contract anyway. but given that they down to essentially middletown and dearborn at this point, how do you fit into their sort of overall coke needs beyond 2021? is -- do you see yourself as -- do they need all 550,000 tons that you make at haverhill, do they need less, do they need more, can you talk about that contract extension for us?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
well, the extension is (inaudible) but they're taking the full output of haverhill. today we need to remind ourselves while they announced their intent to permanently close later this year, the ashland furnace has been down now for a number of years. my memory may be wrong and somebody correct me, i think it's been down since 2015. so that capacity's been out of the market. so when we talk about our believe that there's roughly a good balance between coke supply and demand in the market, ashland hasn't been part of that equation for some time. so that announcement of a permanent closure doesn't impact the amount of demand that's present in the marketplace.
i think perhaps more importantly if you look at the restart of coke blast furnace at granite city this year in terms of demand in the marketplace, but that renewal is three years out, we're taking the coke today. there's no reason that i think they wouldn't want to continue that relationship going forward.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. i guess we'll just stay tuned for how that contract negotiation plays out. thanks very much for all the questions.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from lucas pipes of b. riley fbr. lucas, your line is open.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
yes, thank you very much and good morning everyone, and i'd like to add my congratulations not only on the simplification transaction but the strong results out of indiana harbor. mike, say i wanted to follow up on the capex side. so, ongoing guidance for 2019, $64 million to $66 million, is that kind of a number that we should continue to incur our expectations on for 2020, 2021 et cetera? is there maybe some upward pressure, be it like more things on the gas sharing side, for example? or are there maybe even opportunities to know that further? thank you.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, lucas. so when we gave our guidance for 2019 on capex, our range is between $110 million $120 million, this obviously includes the last phase of indiana harbor which is between $40 million and $48 million and some residual spend on the granite city gas sharing. it also includes, as i mentioned on the call, some upgrades to our hrsg and fgd assets, and we'll perform those upgrades during our regulatory scheduled outages in 2019. i think our focus is long term and on the long-term performance of the assets and with any capital-intensive heavy manufacturing business like ours, maintenance events, repair work capex is required to maintain the health and integrity of our assets.
so i just -- i think when you are looking at kind of a run rate, this work that we're planning on doing here in 2019, the piggyback off of the work that we did in 2018 and we've always planned to do this work in the future over some time horizon. but based on our very extensive review that we did of our assets here, looking at of our longer horizon of about 10 years, we've concluded that it was important to pull some of that work forward so you're seeing an elevation in our capex spend in 2019 to accommodate that incremental work that we want to do that we've pulled forward.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. so -- but outside of indiana harbor and gas sharing, that $64 million versus $66 million could be a good run rate number to use going forward?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i think that's a good number to use.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
okay. very helpful. thank you. and then i wanted to follow up on the tax synergies of $40 million. would it be possible to provide a breakdown of that tax yield to sxcp unitholders and then the deposition benefit from the basis step up? and then, should we be thinking about that being all-cash taxes or is there a non-cash component to this as well?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so, the tax synergies are made up of two items, the first is the step up in basis. because this is a taxable transaction, sxc will receive a step up in its tax basis. and so that's the first component. the second is, sxc as an entity will no longer receive certain tax allocations that increased our taxable income on a stand-alone basis. that's something that we referred to in the tax as remedial income and we will no longer receive that remedial income that resulted from the formation of sxcp. and so this would've -- this is based on kind of partnership tax rules and it'd continue until 2029. and so those our the two components. and when we're talking about this from a cash basis. and i think you could say that probably over the time period, about 50-50, some year it's more, some year it's less depending on kind of the specifics. but it's roughly $40 million over the time period, roughly 50% of it from step-up and 50% of it from the elimination of remedial income.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. and maybe one last question to sneak in. and mike, this is to be out of curiosity and to your long experience in the steel industry, what do think has been driving the weakness in hse prices as of late?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
you're dating me now. it's been a while since i was involved in directly buying and selling steel products. but prices they might've gone a little ahead of themselves (technical difficulty) come back off a little bit. lead times are shorter than what they have been. the distributors or inventories are in good positions as now. big inventory overhang. there's some weakness in scrap pricing. but more recently you've heard i'm sure that most of the mills have announced round a increase i think $40. and that's being implemented as we speak. so perhaps we found a bottom (inaudible) years there's cyclically some weakness going into the fourth quarter. i think we probably saw some of that again this year.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
i appreciate all the color and again, congratulations on a very strong year and a great outlook. thank you.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, lucas.
operator
and your final question comes from derek hernandez of seaport global securities. derek, your line is open.
derek hernandez -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hi, thank you and good morning to everyone. i also would like to give you my congratulations on the results for the fourth quarter and the transaction announcement today. very good job moving that forward. i just want to ask if you had concerns regarding support from sxc shareholders for the transaction. i know you said that the indications have been overall positive. but is that any risk in your view to the transition going forward?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
no, we believe that this transaction is very good for sxc shareholders and it'll be very supportive, that's why we believe it's fair to the sxcp unitholders. so, no, we don't see any issue at all.
derek hernandez -- seaport global securities -- analyst
i see. thank you. and since it was noted earlier in the call that the target of consolidated leverage is potentially a more near-term event, do you have any idea how you would measure this priority against potentially levering up to pursue organic or inorganic growth opportunities that may come in the near term?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
our priority will be to strive to that 3.0 ratio, not to lever up pursue growth. we believe that we can accomplish the leverage target as well with the free cash flow will we generate, pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. so leveraging up to pursue growth is not in our current list of things to do.
derek hernandez -- seaport global securities -- analyst
thank you. and then with the same target, what should be consider as kind of a normalized cash minimum for suncoke's balance sheet following the transaction?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i think we're targeting right around $100 million (inaudible) cash balance, right around there. it could be slightly lower, but just right around there, derek.
derek hernandez -- seaport global securities -- analyst
excellent. and in your presentation you mentioned potential market opportunities for your brazil model. do you have an idea of what the scale of these opportunities may be and potential timeline for implementation there?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
scale will be consistent with other plants that we've built off here in the us and as well brazil. our technology is scalable. but we are very much of the mind that brazilian model works well for us and we would look to implement that model as constructor, operator and technology supplier throughout the world. other parts of the world, energy costs are quite considerably higher than they are in the united states. and (inaudible) stream electricity is available as a byproduct of our process is quite valuable. so we believe there is good applicability of our technology there in other parts of the world. the brazilian model is one that we would look to pursue as we look more global through applying our technologies (inaudible).
derek hernandez -- seaport global securities -- analyst
excellent. and then switching over to indiana harbor, do you anticipate the timeline for the rebuild of the last 57 ovens to follow kind of the schedule of your last few years, which would be completion around november of 2019? and then as a quick follow-up there, with the completion of the rebuild and your view on the a-, c- and d-batteries, would there be any potential risk to normalize production at indiana harbor following this or are you basically expecting a run rate of 1.2 million tons going forward beyond 2019?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
no, we very much expect to achieve and sustain a run rate of 1.2 million tons post-rebuild. b, and your timing is correct. we expect to complete those rebuilds in the fourth quarter of 2019, the end of november is as good as any. one thing though that you should keep in mind is that the rebuilds -- rebatteries are more expensive and what was the case in a. so while we'll be fully back up at the end of november, we'll have those ovens out of service for a longer period this year which (technical difficulty) and that's reflected fully in the guidance we provided you.
derek hernandez -- seaport global securities -- analyst
i see. thanks. and then you also mentioned production outages across the fleet. i was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of guidance as to kind of how the weighing may be from quarter-to-quarter across the year to reach your 4.1 million ton target for 2019?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, derek, we don't give quarterly guidance. and therefore it's -- the scope and timing of outage work varies quarter-over-quarter, plant-by-plant, year-over-year. but when i look at kind of 2019, the majority of your outage work is going to be, you know, second quarter and slightly in the third quarter with some outage work at middletown in the fourth quarter. but they've consistently done that work in the fourth quarter. so i think you'll see it kind of in second and third quarter. that's when you'll see the kind of impact on kind of operations as well as production, inclusive of energy production. we won't have anything in the first quarter. there's nothing planned versus last year we did have some more work in the first quarter.
derek hernandez -- seaport global securities -- analyst
appreciate that. it's very, very helpful. well, thank you very much for taking the time for all my questions today and great call and great announcement today. thanks, again.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

with that, i'll now turn things over to mike.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, andy. good morning and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. we have quite a few exciting developments to talk about today, not only did we post strong financial and operating results for the quarter and full-year 2018, but this morning we also announced a transformational merger that will create value for all suncoke stakeholders going forward.
suncoke energy has signed a merger agreement to acquire all of the suncoke energy partners common units that are now currently owned by sxc. the transaction was approved by the sxcp conflicts committee and the boards of both sxc and sxcp. we are pleased to announce this transaction today and believe it'll simplify the structured benefit to all stakeholders. healthy market as a whole has remained challenge for a number of years, a problem even more pronounced for sxcp.
by continued stable operational performance and material improvement in broader market conditions, sxcp's yield and effective cost of equity has remained elevated and no longer provides an advantage to cost of capital. with a simplified and consolidated ownership structure, we will be able to unlock the full potential of the enterprise which provides numerous benefits to sxc and sxcp investors.
importantly, the merger streamlines our corporate structure, creates a larger stand-alone operating company with increased float and trading liquidity (technical difficulty) generates immediate accretion to both sxc shareholders and sxcp unitholders, lowers our cost of funding and better positions us to execute strategic growth initiatives.
in addition we have been listening to shareholders, many of whom have expressed interest in suncoke's completing the simplification transaction. this transaction optimizes suncoke's significant free cash flow, will strengthen the balance sheet and pursue growth opportunities and return capital to shareholders.
moving to slide 5, as part of the terms of the agreement, sxcp's unaffiliated common unitholders will receive 1.4 sxc shares for each sxcp common unit, which represents a 9.3% premium to sxcp's february 4th, 2019 closing price, a 12.7% premium to sxcp utilizing sxcp's and sxc's 30-day volume weighted average price. following the completion of this all-equity transaction, sxcp will no longer be publicly traded and it's incentive distribution rights will be terminated.
provided in the merger agreement, we expect to continue to pay a $0.40 per unit quarterly distribution rate while the transaction closes. the transaction will not trigger any change in control provision and we expect sxcp's current debt structure to remain unchanged at the time of closing. additionally, following the close of the transaction sxc intends to return capital to shareholders by initiating a $0.06 per share regular common quarterly dividend or $0.24 per share on an annual basis. we expect to initiate the quarterly dividend in the first full quarter following the successful close of the simplification transaction.
from a timing perspective, we expect the transaction will close late second quarter or early third quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions as well as the approval of both sxc shareholders and sxcp unitholders, although sxc's majority ownership sxcp is sufficient to approve this transaction on behalf of the sxcp unitholders.
turning to slide 6, we'll now discuss the benefits of the transaction in detail. we believe this transaction will provide significant value to suncoke energy stakeholders and will position suncoke for long-term success. benefits are anchored on four key drivers. first, the transaction simplifies suncoke by eliminating unnecessary complexity created by the dual-company structure. the mlp no longer serves its original purposes of providing a more advantage cost of capital and access to mlp equity markets. the transaction also more closely aligns sxc shareholders and sxcp unitholder interests.
second, the simplification transaction is accretive to sxc shareholders and meaningfully increases suncoke's free cash flow, largely due to elimination of the sxcp quarterly distribution. suncoke also benefits from approximately $8 million per year of favorable tax impacts from the transaction as well as estimated public company cost savings of $2 million per year. the increase in available cash flow provides us with significant flexibility to maximize shareholder value. we intend to utilize the incremental sxc cash flow to establish an attractive and sustainable dividend.
(technical difficulty) rate are ongoing objective of reducing leverage, pursue both organic growth projects and m&a opportunities, and return excess capital to shareholders in a measured way. consolidating the two public companies better positions us to opportunistically allocate capital in most value-enhancing activities for our investors.
third, we remain focused leveraging our existing assets, strong customer relationships and unique capabilities to pursue growth. the simplified structure allows suncoke to retain more internally generated cash flow that can then be used to fund organic growth projects and pursue attractive acquisitions. additionally, eliminating the mlp qualifying income limitation expands our company's opportunity set, attractive growth projects and potential acquisition targets (technical difficulty) include areas in which we have existing technological expertise and/or customer adjacencies.
fourth, this transaction creates a single c-corp. structure that we believe will attract the broader universe investors. with a larger equity market capitalization, increased equity float and greater trading liquidity, we believe the combined company will appeal to a broader institutional investor base, potentially resulting in more stable trading performance.
turning now to slide 7, the transaction materially improves the free cash flow to sxc shareholders. full-year 2019 basis, the simplification increases adjusted free cash flow by approximately $0.35 per share or a 27% increase. this accretion results from two primary drivers; acquisition of sxcp cash flow and synergies, which combined materially increase cash flow for sxc shareholders. the acquired cash flow includes both the public unitholder distribution and the excess undistributed cash known as coverage generated at the partnership level; synergies total approximately $10 million per year and reflect both company cost savings and tax benefits. for further information, we have provided a detailed reconciliation in the appendix which is based on our 2019 guidance.
moving on to slide 8 to our capital allocation priorities, previously discussed, one of the key benefits resulting from the simplification is the consolidation of sxc and sxcp cash flows and the increase in cash flow that i just highlighted. while our business has historically benefit from strong cash generation, with simplification, suncoke will be able to retain incrementally more cash flow, management is committed to deploying that additional cash flow in the most advantageous and value-enhancing manner for our shareholders.
once again, following the close of the transaction sxc intends to initiate a common dividend what we believe is sustainable and provides an attractive return to our long-term investors. additionally, strengthening the balance sheet by reducing debt continues to be one of our top priorities. the simplified structure allows the suncoke complex to reduce leverage at an accelerated rate. we remain committed to reducing debt and are now targeting a consolidated leverage ratio of 3 times gross debt-to-ebitda.
finally, the simplified structure improves sxc's ability to execute on our goal to grow and diversify our business. while we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to the capital deployment, a single c-corp. structure enables us to be more flexible and competitive in our pursuit of attractive m&a opportunities and organic growth projects.
moving to slide 9, there are several key milestones ahead as we work to finalize this transaction. regarding timing, we are targeting filing a registration statement in march. we expect to hold an sxc shareholder meeting after the registration statement is declared effective. we anticipate the transaction will close in late second quarter or early third quarter of 2019.
slide 10, we will be working over the coming months to close the transaction and are very excited about the numerous strategic and financial benefits of simplification. we firmly believe that simplifying suncoke structure will enable us to pursue an expanded universe of growth opportunities and enable suncoke to be more competitive as we execute on our growth strategy which is largely focused on four business initiatives. first, coke production, it is and continues to be core to our operations. our world-class portfolio of cokemaking facilities positions us as a premier low-cost coke producer. to the extent that there are opportunities, we will look to further build upon our strong position and potentially expand our platform. this is evidenced by our commitment to fully rebuild indiana harbor. it has generated significant organic growth due to dramatically improved operating performance at the plant.
second, we will continue to concentrate on fully maximizing our logistics capabilities. cmt is a state-of-the-art terminal with unique capabilities located to provide strategic access for the seaborne markets for our customers. we are actively pursuing opportunities to handle additional bulk products as well as liquid products to fully realize cmt's potential. to date, we have diversified the product mix by handling petroleum coke and aggregates and liquids. we remain focused on adding additional bulk products to grow the terminal. to complement our strong logistics platform, we will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions while maintaining price discipline.
third, it will leverage our position as an integral member of the steel value chain to develop additional opportunities. we produce (inaudible) and ship carbon products. that's what we do and what we do well. by removing the qualifying income constrain, we'll have greater flexibility to evaluate additional product offerings and customer adjacencies within the domestic steel and carbon markets. these are our customers with whom we have strong relationships, markets we understand and businesses which given our operating and technological expertise should enable us to create meaningful value for our customers and shareholders.
finally, we will explore our opportunities to maximize our technology and engineering capabilities by expanding our international coke licensing arrangements (technical difficulty) select global markets. our industry-leading cokemaking technology converts waste heat into steam or electricity. inexpensive energy production is highly desirable in many high cost energy countries around the globe. we will look to use our successful brazil licensing model as a template for future international opportunity.
these areas closely align with our core competencies and allow us to enhance long-term value for our shareholders. as i have highlighted, we continue to be encouraged about the fundamentals of our business. the simplification transaction will streamline our corporate structure, significantly improve our financial flexibility, reduce our cost of funding and help us to capitalize on strong business fundamentals and our unique capabilities.
turning now to 2018 performance, today we also announced sxc's strong fourth quarter and full year results. before i turn it over to fay who will review the results in detail, i want to hit a few highlights. first, i'll start by thanking all of our suncoke employees for their contributions throughout the year. (inaudible) and dedication of our merchant team drove the strong operational and financial results that you see today.
on slide 12, you can see the key initiatives that we set out at the beginning of the year (technical difficulty) how we performed against these objectives. third, i'm pleased with the company's performance as we have met or exceeded our full year goals. in 2018, we delivered our strongest annual financial performance in the last six years. this success was largely due to the safe and efficient operations of our facility.
if we look at our two primary financial measures, adjusted ebitda and operating cash flow, we delivered very strong results. both measures materially exceeded our guidance range. adjusted ebitda for the year was $263.2 million versus our guidance range of $240 million to $255 million. operating cash flow of $185.8 million also beat the top end of our guidance range by over $20 million.
from an operations perspective, i'm extremely pleased with what we've accomplished at our indiana harbor facility. we successfully completed the rebuild of 67 a-battery ovens ahead of schedule and these rebuilt ovens are performing as expected. indiana harbor finished the year at over $15 million of adjusted ebitda and realized an increase of over 130,000 tons of production. we look to achieve optimal performance across our entire fleet and we expect to realize significant operational and financial improvement at our granite city facility in 2019.
turning to the balance sheet, we achieved our target to pay down $25 million on sxcp's revolving credit facility. we look to further strengthen the balance sheet by paying down additional debt in 2019.
finally, we continue to make progress toward diversifying and growing our customer base and product mix in our logistics business as we increased petcoke and aggregate volumes this year and expect the business to continue to grow in 2019. all-in all, we are pleased with our team's success in achieving our 2018 initiatives. we are well positioned to achieve our goals in 2019.
with that, i'll turn things over to fay to review our fourth quarter and full year financials. fay?
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good morning everyone. turning to slide 13. our fourth quarter and full year eps was $0.03 and $0.40 per share, respectively. variability between periods was impacted by the tax reform legislation that was enacted in 2017 as well as higher depreciation expense in the current period. the impact of these two items on a full year basis was $1.91 per share and $0.13 per share, respectively. the current year also reflects the strong operating performance across our business, which increased full year eps by $0.32 per share.
consolidated adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was $65.9 million. this reflects a significant year-over-year contribution from our indiana harbor facility. it also reflects that we did not recognize any deferred revenue in the quarter from our coal export customers. in 2018, cmt achieved record volumes and our coal export customers shift over their 10 million ton contractual obligation. this resulted in the recognition of higher revenues throughout the year and therefore we did not recognize any deferred revenue on take-or-pay volume shortfalls in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the $16.4 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.
while this impacts quarterly comparisons, there is no impact on a full year basis. on a full year basis we delivered adjusted ebitda of $263.2 million which, as mike referenced, was significantly above our 2018 guidance range of $240 million to $255 million and up over 12% as compared with 2017 adjusted ebitda of $234.7 million.
turning to slide 14 and looking further at our fourth quarter performance, fourth quarter 2018 adjusted ebitda was $65.9 million compared to $69.5 million in q4 of 2017. indiana harbor's fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of $3.5 million is up $12.3 million versus the prior year. we successfully completed the rebuild of 67 a-battery ovens ahead of schedule and these rebuilt ovens are performing as expected. this significantly improved financial performance was driven by an increase in production, higher yields and increased o&m reimbursement, as well as lower overall o&m costs.
excluding indiana harbor, our domestic coke business was down slightly in the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2017. the extended outage at granite city which we discussed on our third quarter call, impacted results by approximately $4 million. this was partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expense which we achieved at haverhill and middletown.
turning to our logistics segment and excluding the impact of revenue recognition, you can see that we were in line with the fourth quarter of 2017. cmt realized its third consecutive quarter of more than 3 million tons of throughput volumes as we continued to see strong demand from our customers to move a variety of bulk products through the terminal. in total, core operating adjusted ebitda for the quarter was up approximately $13 million. finally, we had $16.4 million of lower deferred revenue recognized in q4 2018 compared with q4 2017. once again, since our coal export customers shipped above the contractual obligations in 2018, we incurred no take-or-pay volume shortfall throughout the year and instead recognized higher gaap revenue on actual volumes during the year.
turning now to our full year adjusted ebitda performance on slide 15, full year adjusted ebitda was $263.2 million, up approximately $29 million compared to the prior year. our year-over-year adjusted ebitda growth was primarily driven by indiana harbor's exceptional improvement. indiana harbor production increased over 130,000 tons and adjusted ebitda was up approximately $34 million compared to the prior year. this improvement is driven by both an increase in production and higher yields, which resulted in roughly a $22 million increase in adjusted ebitda.
additionally, indiana harbor received approximately $11 million in higher o&m reimbursement due to the contractual reset of the o&m cost sharing mechanism with our customer. as highlighted on the chart, our domestic coke business, excluding indiana harbor, was down $14.5 million in 2018 versus 2017. the most significant driver was lowered adjusted ebitda by over $8 million was the impact of increased outage work across our fleet, most notably the previously communicated extended granite city outage that occurred in the third and fourth quarters of this year. in total, across our entire domestic coke fleet, adjusted ebitda was up 10% or approximately $19 million to nearly $208 million, which was above our full year domestic coke guidance.
moving on to our logistics business, adjusted ebitda was up approximately $2 million due to record cmt throughput volume. the favorable volume benefit was partially offset by approximately $4 million of high water costs and increased operating maintenance costs incurred in the year. our total logistics business increased throughput by 5 million tons including an increase of 4 million tons at cmt.
in 2018, cmt handled over 11 million tons worth coal export customers who benefited from very attractive netback economics. additionally, we continue to make progress to further diversify our customer and product mix as we moved approximately 1 million merchant tons of bulk products through cmt. finally, our corporate and other segment was favorable by $7.5 million. we have realized significant year-over-year improvement through streamlining our organization and remaining cost disciplined. we also benefited from the absence of one-time expenses in 2018. in summary, we are very pleased with the financial results and the year-over-year growth that we achieved in 2018.
turning to our capital deployment on slide 16, we generated very strong operating cash flow of approximately $186 million which was above our full year guidance range of $150 million to $165 million. this increase was driven primarily by our strong operating performance this year. capex of $97 million during the year was in line with our guidance and included approximately $34 million related to our indiana harbor oven rebuild initiative and $27 million related to our granite city gas sharing project.
during the year we reduced debt outstanding by approximately $28 million. this includes achieving our 2018 objective to pay down debt by $25 million on sxcp's revolving credit facility. we remain focused on strengthening the balance sheet and expect to continue to reduce debt in 2019. in total, we ended 2018 with a cash balance of $146 million and strong liquidity of $400 million.
at this time i would like to turn the call back over to mike to share our views on the steel and coal markets for 2019. mike?
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, fay. before we get into our 2019 guidance, i wanted to provide a few brief thoughts on the overall market and where we see things as we enter the new year. on steel, the balance of 2018 we saw material improvements in the domestic market. api2 (ph) benchmark price increased from approximately $650 per short ton at the beginning of the year to an average price of approximately $830 per short ton in 2018. utilization averaged approximately 78% in 2018, up from 71% at the beginning of the year. import market shares decreased to approximately 23% in 2018 from 27% in 2017.
as we stand today we see stable demand with utilization rates around 80%. while generally we anticipate slow growth across the sector, we expect to continue to see solid steel demand from industrial, construction, consumer and energy sectors, with auto slightly lower. looking at the current state of the coke market, we believe the market is generally imbalance and any meaningful pick up in demand or reduction in supply may result in a coke short market. we continue to see strong demand from our customers for our high-quality, low-cost products.
on the thermal coal export side, export volumes were robust in 2018 on the back of strong api2 and newcastle prices, with a strong demand for europe asia and the mediterranean regions. while we expect the us to continue to be a significant participant in the seaborne coal trade, we do anticipate volumes to be slightly lower in 2019 versus 2018. illinois basin customers are expected to continue to benefit from attractive netback economics. they have a material advantage due to their low cost structure.
in summary, we believe we are in a stable macro environment for both our coke and logistics businesses. while the macro environment does not have a material impact to our 2019 outlook due to the nature of our long-term take-or-pay contracts, continued improvement to our customers health will be a long-term benefit to us. in 2019, we expect our business to produce solid growth on the back of increased production at indiana harbor.
now i'll turn it over to fay to review our 2019 adjusted ebitda guidance.
fay west -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike. the detailed 2019 guidance slides are presented on an as-is basis and do not reflect the simplification transaction that we announced today. the impact of the simplification transaction is not material to 2019 adjusted ebitda and i will provide some additional information on that impact later in the presentation. on slide 19 you could see that we expect adjusted ebitda to grow in 2019 and are guiding to a consolidated adjusted ebitda range of $265 million to $275 million. our guidance range is a bit tighter than what we have historically provided, but given the continued improvement at indiana harbor and the stability of the balance of our operations, we feel comfortable providing guidance within this range.
domestic coke operations will fuel the majority of the year-over-year increase, which will contribute in the incremental $9 million to $15 million of adjusted ebitda in 2019. improved performance at our granite city facility coupled with an increase in production at indiana harbor are the main drivers of this increase. looking at our brazil operations, we expect that they will return to a normalized run rate after a record production year in 2018, which will result in a slight reduction to adjusted ebitda in 2019.
turning to our logistics business, we expect modest growth in adjusted ebitda in 2019 primarily due to higher annual per ton rate on our base take-or-pay volume. and finally, we expect our corporate and other segment will be down slightly in 2019 due to higher employee-related costs and incremental legacy costs as compared to 2018.
moving on to slide 20, in 2019 we expect our domestic coke adjusted ebitda will be between $217 million and $223 million. the domestic coke business has delivered adjusted ebitda growth over the last few years, which is the result of the successful oven rebuild program at indiana harbor. the increase in our 2019 domestic coke adjusted ebitda is due to improved operational performance at our indiana harbor and granite city facilities, generating an increase in production and higher energy revenues, as well as lower operating and maintenance costs. while a pcm fire and a major outage significantly affected our granite city operations during 2018, we expect our 2019 operations to benefit from the absence of these events. i will discuss indiana harbor's operational improvements on the next slide. our 2019 guidance includes a plan to perform extensive work on our heat recovery steam generators and flue-gas desulfurization systems at both haverhill and middletown.
we will apply the lessons learned from the work performed at granite city in 2018 and we will deploy that knowledge and implement best practices as part of a multiyear program to improve the long-term reliability and operational performance of our hrsg and fgd assets across the fleet. additionally, we plan to finish the one-time replacement of the outer shelf of our existing spray dryer absorber equipment or sdas in middletown and haverhill in 2019. overall, the impact of outages to adjusted ebitda is expected to be slightly favorable in 2019, but will impact our capex outlook for the year. our 2019 projections also include higher-yield gains across our domestic coke fleet from higher met coal prices.
as a reminder, while we do pass through the cost of coal to our customers, we generate incremental adjusted ebitda from higher coal prices due to improved yield gain calculations. lastly, we expect production to be approximately 4.1 million tons, which is approximately 85,000 tons higher than 2018 results.
flipping to the next page to look at indiana harbor, as we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we will complete the last phase of multiyear indiana harbor oven rebuild initiative by the end of 2019. to date, we have successfully rebuilt 211 of the 268 ovens at indiana harbor. we have learned a great deal through this multiyear process and have refined our rebuild approach over time which has yielded a dramatic improvement in operating performance at the plant.
we expect to complete comprehensive rebuilds on the remaining 57 b-battery ovens in 2019 and we fully expect to achieve the same level of success on those b-battery ovens. based on our experience and current understanding of b-battery conditions, we anticipate that we can execute these rebuilds for approximately $875,000 to $1 million per oven or approximately $50 million to $60 million in total.
consistent with current experience, approximately 80% of our estimated 2019 spend will be capital and the remaining 20% will be expense. this equates to between $40 million and $48 million of capex. the remaining expense amount of between $10 million to $12 million is included in our 2019 adjusted ebitda guidance. in 2019, we expect indiana harbor adjusted ebitda to be approximately $22 million on a $1,025,000 tons of coal production.
the year-over-year improvement is the result of a full year benefit from rebuilt a-, c- and d-batteries which continue to demonstrate sustained performance and meet our expectations. after the final ovens have been rebuilt, we expect that the plant will operate at nameplate capacity of 1.22 million tons. the increased production and improved operating performance will position indiana harbor to achieve adjusted ebitda of approximately $50 million on an annual run-rate basis.
turning now to our logistics outlook on the next slide. 2019 logistics adjusted ebitda is expected to be between $73 million and $75 million with expected tonnage in line with 2018. at cmt, we are coming off of a very strong year with record volumes in 2018. in 2019, we think demand will remain stable and we expect to handle 10.5 million tons for our thermal coal export customers. while we are projecting 10.5 million tons of throughput for our coal export customers, continued attractive coal export dynamics could provide some potential upside in 2019 beyond our stated guidance. despite slightly lower projected coal export volumes, we expect that cmt will generate incremental adjusted ebitda in 2019 due to higher annual transloading rates on our base take-or-pay contracts.
at krt, we expect 2019 volumes to be in line with 2018 results as end market demand for both the met and thermal coal business remains stable. at lake terminal, we anticipate higher volumes due to an increase in production from indiana harbor. as mike mentioned, we continue to actively pursue opportunities to generate the incremental adjusted ebitda across our logistics fleet. at cmt, we remain focused on exploring opportunities to diversify our customer and product mix.
on slide 23 we have highlighted our 2019 capital plan. we expect to spend between $110 million and $120 million in 2019. a significant portion of this capital spend will go toward completing the final phase of the indiana harbor oven rebuild project. as i just discussed, we expect the capital component of this project to be approximately $40 million to $48 million and once completed the plant will produce at nameplate capacity. we also expect to complete the final phase of the granite city gas sharing project by june of 2019 and we estimate that we will spend approximately $6 million this year.
lastly, our maintenance capex plan include certain upgrades in order to improve the long-term reliability and operational performance of our assets. we plan to perform upgrades to our hrsg and fgd assets at haverhill and middletown while finishing the one-time replacement work on the fdas in 2019. we will complete these upgrades during normally scheduled outages throughout the year.
turning to slide 24, the slides provides historical review of actual performance across many metrics as well as the summary of our 2019 guidance. before turning it back over to mike, i would like to highlight that we have successfully increased consolidated adjusted ebitda, domestic coke production and domestic coke adjusted ebitda per ton materially since 2016. we expect adjusted ebitda to be between $265 million and $275 million in 2019, which is approximately a 24% increase over 2016 results. this increase highlights the significant improvement and contribution of indiana harbor as well as the long-term stability of our other operations.
this steady growth is a validation of thoughtful approach we have taken to improve operations and represents our ongoing commitment to creating long-term value for shareholders. the last column on this slide provides 2019 guidance assuming the simplification transaction closes on july 1st of 2019. while the simplification transaction does not have a material impact on consolidated operations, there will be a significant increase to adjusted ebitda attributable to sxc once the transaction is complete.
with that, i will hand it back to mike.
michael g. rippey -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, fay. wrapping up on slide 25. as always, operational excellence is top of mind for our organization, focused on executing against our capital plans and further improving operational performance across both coke and logistics businesses, while successfully executing the final phase of our indiana harbor rebuild initiative. additionally, we are keenly focused on successfully completing the simplification transaction.
as i laid out earlier on the call, it's an important and transformational merger for suncoke which we believe will create value for all suncoke stakeholders. we will also work to pursue our organic and m&a growth strategies as outlined earlier on the call, strategy focuses on business verticals that closely align with our core competencies where our knowledge and expertise can create additional value for our shareholders. finally, we'll again be focused on executing on our commitments to shareholders by achieving our full year financial targets that we laid out today.
with that, let's go ahead and open up the call for q&a.
