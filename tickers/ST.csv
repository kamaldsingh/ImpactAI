we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question is from the line of mark delaney with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
mark delaney -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. to start, i was hoping to better understand the reason sensata as being more conservative than ihs for north american and european auto production in the third quarter. is this conservatism on the part of sensata in case there's covid-related factory shutdowns that are anticipated or in case retail demand were softened? or is this more about what your customers are telling you their production build rates are going to be?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes. thanks for the question, mark. so let me just frame it. we are lower than ihs in terms of expectations in north america and europe and were slightly higher in china. the net difference is about 1.7 million vehicles across that range, which is substantial in terms of the impact that, that would have on sensata's revenue. there are really four key factors that weighed into our decision around this. the first is clearly regarding caution associated with potential resurgence and lockdowns and impact on demand that, that would result in. there are also some differences between us and what we believe ihs is forecasting regarding the shutdown schedule with our customers, which we're tracking on a customer-by-customer basis. and then the other factors are relating to just generally understanding our customer order patterns. we're coming off a period of time where the volatility and customer order patterns have been substantial. and until we get a better feel for the orders and how they will materialize into revenue, we're taking some caution on that. you'll note that, historically, the order patterns going into the quarter is our best indicator of performance in the quarter. but certainly, we're coming off a period where that isn't as much the case. and then the last factor, which is a smaller one, is just the general automotive supply chain and the risk that we wouldn't or our customer wouldn't have a disruption in demand or orders, but there might be some other implication in the broader supply chain, and so we're cautioning for all of the factors which we've outlined. obviously, if things turn out better, we're prepared to be able to deliver, but it's based upon all of that input.
mark delaney -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's really helpful, jeff. thank you. and for my follow-up question, the company mentioned in the prepared remarks about the good wins in electrification and even being an acceleration compared to what the company was realizing in new wins than a year ago despite the pandemic. what do you think is leading to that acceleration in bookings? and maybe you can level set investors about where sensata's content per car stands now for an ev compared to internal combustion engine vehicles? thank you.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
sure. so that and the old quote was across the company. so it's not just automotive, and there's a substantial portion of that, that is outside of the automotive market. my view is to why that's accelerating is that every customer around the world as the electrification trend is continuing, is accelerating their internal programs. we knew that there was going to be eventual escalation as they prepare to launch new platforms that will be more driven toward electrification trends. and so that's what we're seeing. we had talked about the order book that or the -- not the order book, but the opportunity book that we have with our customers, which is very substantial as well. and so it is the material -- it's basically that opportunity set materializing. in terms of content per vehicle, in the us and europe, i'll speak generally, it's in the high-30s to low-40s in terms of content per vehicle. when we look at a battery electric vehicle, it's higher than that in the 50% range. so the trend associated with conversion from internal combustion engine to electrification is a positive trend in terms of content per vehicle and therefore, revenue for sensata.
jacob sayer -- vice president finance
thank you, mark. constantinos, can we have the next question please.
operator
the next question is from the line of deepa raghavan with wells fargo. please go ahead.
deepa raghavan -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, good morning, all. this question is for jeff. just tagging on that comment where you mentioned accelerating internal programs just based on those electrification trends in triangulating to your business wins. in the past, the business wins that were awarded converted over a three-year to five-year time frame, roughly. is that still the same? or does that push to electrification change that time line?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so it's pretty much the same where it's variable. remember, the $108 million is across dozens of programs. so there are lots of factors to consider, but the general development time line associated with electric vehicles is equivalent to that of a combustion engine. when we start to talk about wins in some of the other markets, it may be a shorter period than what we might be normally accustomed for automotive or heavy vehicle off-road, especially when you go into the industrial markets, but the electrification wins in those markets are consistent with those markets, which may tend to be a little bit shorter in terms of the development cycles.
deepa raghavan -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks. my follow-up is on your thoughts. it's a little bit of a longer question, but jeff, can you talk through how the summer production schedule is shaping up? and if i -- let's just say, if we assume stable macros here, when can we expect to return to a more normalized level of production? by that, i don't necessarily being back to pre-covid, but more from an equilibrium perspective. i'm assuming the summer production was skewed to the upside a little bit. but -- and if you can focus -- and if you can just talk through the key regions, us, europe and china on how that normalized production expectations would be from your end, that would be helpful? thank you very much.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
sure. so let me speak to the summer shutdown question first, and then i can go to the comment around normalized demand profile globally. so as i mentioned, we are tracking customer shutdowns at the customer level. what i would tell you is that the observation i would make based upon reviewing that is that for the most part, when you get into the tier level below the oem, there's a general theme of canceling summer shutdowns. and my expectation is that, that is to catch up to make sure that they're ready to be able to deliver to the broader supply chain. when you get to the oem level, whether it be in automotive or in heavy vehicle or in other markets, it tends to be a little bit more variable. some are continuing the same shutdown schedules, some are shortening it, and some are canceling it altogether. and again, i suspect that, that's largely driven based upon the demand they see, their inventory positions, how stable their manufacturing operations are. and so it's a wide range across those. but the point of their -- at the tier level, they tend to be stopping summer shutdowns to try to catch up on demand. and we're seeing signals of that in terms of all of us in our everyday lives in terms of availability of product that we want and the supply chain disruptions that have occurred. and as demand is snapped back, that's created some issues in terms of availability of product.
in terms of returning to more of a normalized level, that is obviously a very difficult question to answer. but let me break it down a little bit geographically to give you a little bit of insight. so from a china standpoint, things have rebounded quite quickly, right. so in the second quarter, china actually saw a 10% growth in q2 versus q2 of the prior year. and we're forecasting growth in the third quarter as well. lower growth than what we saw year-over-year in the first quarter, but nonetheless growth. so china has snapped back pretty strongly. when you go to the other markets, it's obviously not back to those levels yet, but it's significantly better in the third quarter, and we would expect that trend to continue into the third quarter -- or excuse me, into the fourth quarter as well. and so let me give you some data points, right. so the heavy vehicle off-road market was down q2 to q2, about 39%. this is market data, not our revenue, but market data. and then when you go into the third quarter, we're expecting that to be quarter-over-quarter down only 23% to 24%. so an improvement from the second quarter, but still pretty significantly off where we were last year at the same time. and you see similar trends across the other end markets, where we're serving automotive second quarter versus second quarter of last year is down 50% from a market standpoint. when you think of q3 last year versus q3 this year, about 22%. so an improvement sequentially but not back to those levels. and we're watching it very closely. things are coming back. but again, we're looking at it with an eye of caution given the disruptions that could cause that demand profile to deteriorate.
jacob sayer -- vice president finance
thanks, deepa. constantinos, can we have the next question, please.
operator
the next question is from the line of samik chatterjee with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
bharat daryani -- jpmorgan -- anayst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my question. this is bharat on for samik. so if i could just start with industrial end market, and you highlighted in your prepared remarks that you expect the outlook to improve through the year. so if i could just ask what are some of the pieces of business or subsegments that are maybe stronger versus the other? and if you could also help us think about how big a exposure you have within the medical end market within industrial? thanks.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so the medical end market is not a huge portion of our overall industrial business, but it is an important one. and we took it, obviously, very seriously as these customers started to come to us to look for help associated with temperature or pressure sensors in the market. across the significant parts of industrial, we have some big segments associated with material handling that we serve major home appliances, lighting, industrial lighting. so there are a variety of end markets. it's truly a diversified industrial segment. but it's important to note in the second quarter, the impact associated with medical devices was about a $10 million impact associated with the revenue related to that initiative that we had. so it felt good to get the revenue. it felt good to serve the community in terms of being able to deliver on that.
bharat daryani -- jpmorgan -- anayst
got it. thanks for that. and if i could just ask on the acquisition you made in the quarter of preco electronics. you noted that's primarily for hvor end market right now. so if you could talk about any synergies that you see in terms of leveraging that technology for end markets such as automotive as well in the long term? thanks.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, absolutely. so i think that it's -- today, preco is largely serving the on-road and off-road heavy vehicle markets. again, where there is regulation forthcoming associated with vulnerable road users, pedestrians and cyclists on the road, as you can imagine, with a large vehicle, the risk that the driver doesn't observe those pedestrians or bicyclists is significant. and so there is regulation associated with that. it's a very difficult application because the radar applications need to work with a wide range of truck configurations. and equipment configurations articulating vehicles, and so the radar required -- the radar solution requires a lot of application-specific knowledge, and software development to make it work in a way that their aren't false positives or negatives that would make the application unusable on the road. beyond the heavy vehicle off-road market, we see opportunities in other industrial applications as well. less so in the light vehicle market, but it's certainly something that we would be exploring in terms of going there, but it's more around the industrial airport equipment and heavy vehicle off-road markets.
bharat daryani -- jpmorgan -- anayst
got it. thank you so much.
operator
next question is from the line of matt sheerin with stifel. please go ahead.
matt sheerin -- stifel -- analyst
yes. thank you. good morning. jeff, just wanted to follow-up on your commentary. near-term demand trends in auto, particularly relative to inventory in the supply chain. you did talk earlier about some headwind there, particularly in north america and europe. how much does that play into your near-term forecast?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. thanks, matt. it's not a big number. we had talked about the first quarter there being about a $25 million inventory build. specifically, as it relates to china customers, we think that migrated away from china into north america and europe during the second quarter, so an equivalent amount. but we're getting to the level where it's a little bit difficult to distinguish the exact amount, to be honest with you, matt, in terms of the impact. but it's not a huge number, and we would expect it to unwind by the end of the year. my sense is it's -- the volatility of our customer order patterns in terms of what they're seeing from demand is causing them to build a tiny bit of inventory and also just generally making sure that they have stock available as they build vehicles for the market. so it's not a big number relative to the overall business, but it's something that we thought worthy of calling out.
matt sheerin -- stifel -- analyst
okay. thanks. and then just a question regarding the guidance for margins, backing into gross margin based on your operating profit and sg&a guide. it looks really like a very significant quarter-to-quarter contribution margin. and i know there's some cost cutting. i think you talked about $7 million in savings from the cost-cutting initiatives. but what are the other drivers of that? and as we look to december based on expectations of sequential growth, should we expect a similar margin contribution or not?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
paul, would you like to take that? please.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so in the remarks, revenue certainly is going to drive a lot of the margin expansion. so as revenues coming down, we were seeing a significant level of decremental margins because we were not able to adjusted our semi-variable and fixed cost to that volume decline quickly. but we did have significant savings in q2 around furlough and pay cuts of $22 million. so as you go forward into q3, as the revenues rise, you see a similar improvement in decremental -- in incremental margins in the high 40% range. we're going to see the $7 million come through from those cost actions that we're taking that are permanent. but we're not going to see the temporary cost saves because we're not putting those pay cuts and furloughs in place for q3. so that's the $15 million headwind there. $7 million of savings coming on and the $22 million, the temporary cost structure is not continuing. and then the volume ramping up is really what's driving the significant improvement in operating profit and contribution from that higher revenue.
matt sheerin -- stifel -- analyst
thank you.

the next question is from the line of wamsi mohan with bank of america. please go ahead.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, yes, thank you. i have one for jeff and one for paul. jeff, your expectations for market outgrowth, you've alluded to those getting a little more subdued in the second half given some product launch push-outs. i was hoping you can share some more color on that? i mean, you are expecting sequential volume improvement. so is it the case that you're anticipating some large program roll offs? or what are the puts and takes here that's driving that in the second half? and i have a follow-up for paul.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. great. wamsi, thanks for the question. so just to make sure that the message you got across, we're still confident that for the full year and beyond, we'll be within the ranges that we've quoted. we had a very strong first half year in terms of content growth or outgrowth. for the first half, we were at 750 basis points year-to-date in automotive and heavy vehicle we were at 840 basis points through six months. so that's above where the normal range was and confidence continues to be there. in terms of what we're seeing, that will impact the second half, it's largely time phasing, in terms of the ns vi regulation, the deadline was july. so there was some pull ahead associated with that. and then there's another impact associated with just time out at our customers in terms of the covid period. so some of the launch activity that would normally have occurred, that was a little disrupted associated with time out-of-office during this very difficult time, has resulted in some temporary delays in terms of launches that were going to happen in the third and fourth quarter of this year. they are temporary. nothing is canceling to any meaningful amount. obviously, there are always some small amounts of movement associated with cancellations as customers refine this, but we're not seeing any major impact associated with cancellation. there are delays in the order of magnitude of, call it, three months to six months, and they're pushed through the following quarters. so we'll see that coming in later, first part of 2021.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thanks, jeff. and paul, you called out $60 million to $65 million in savings in 2021. can you clarify if these are gross or net savings? and will they be pretty consistent across the quarters? and should we think of these savings as proportional to your revenue exposure by market? or are they more concentrated in auto and aerospace? thank you.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, there -- i would say they're spread evenly across the company in terms of the business that are being impacted by the cost reduction programs. the $60 million, $65 million, it's mostly people. it's mostly related to the workforce reduction. there are other cost actions that we have in place around third-party spend and productivity improvements that are going to drive the $60 million to $65 million. a lot of it will be implemented this year in the second half. so when we get into the first quarter, we should be at that run rate per quarter. so we should get the full $60 million, $65 million in the year, and with it being at that full run rate, pretty much by the end of the first quarter. so that's -- and that aligns to the demand that we're expecting over the coming quarters.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. great. thank you.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, wamsi.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, wamsi.

the next question is from the line of brian johnson with barclays. please go ahead.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
yes. just want to follow-up on decrementals then talk a bit about the adas opportunity. so when we think about the decrementals for 3q on a year-over-year basis, i think i got the answer, which is the roll-off sequentially of the temporary cost reduction is what's going to take your decrementals back to the higher end of the range, is that correct?
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, the way i would think about it is that we laid this out that, right now our profit impact from volume is moving in line with our variable cost and our variable contribution. you can see in that pie chart, about half of our cost is variable. so when we lose $1 or gain a $1, it's about a 45% to 50% impact. now we weren't able to get at the semi-variable cost in q2, so we took temporary actions around furloughs and pay cuts. now in q3 and going to q4, we're getting at those semi-variable costs. and that's where the $60 million, $65 million highlighted in the chart, about 10%. the semi-variable costs running the $600 million range. so we're taking about 10% of those costs out. now that's what's driving improvement in cost. and so we're getting a combination of volumes are going higher, we're getting a variable contribution. and now we're getting at that sticky semi-variable costs that we weren't able to action in the first half of 2020. does that makes sense?
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
yeah. yeah. my second question is really around your new acquisition and the role of adas in commercial vehicles. we've been aware, of course, of wabco and others with vision-based systems, and that this is -- seems a little bit different. but it gets to my question, which is, when you think of an adas solution, in addition to the sensors, whether it's camera, radar, ultrasonic there's, of course, a fair amount of algorithms around object identification, detection, left laning [phonetic]. are you moving into that space? or will you be working with tier 1s who are already acting as cv adas integrators?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so we're not -- a great question. we're not going fully off the stack on this, but it is a more complicated system than you would normally see in a pressure sensor or a high-temperature sensor for an application. so we're providing more information. there is more embedded software associated with it. and we're working both with oems and with tier 1s depending on their choice on how they want to develop, those overall system architectures. some oems choose to leverage a tier 1 in the development of that. others want to hold it more closely to what they're bringing to the market in terms of the differentiation there. so it does depend on where we are -- the ultimate customer approach on how they're doing it. but we're part of that overall system, both with tiers and oems.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
and a follow-on, there's lot of discussion around lidar coming down in costs. is that a market that you have relationships with? do you see that coming into either commercial vehicle? certainly, we've seen the luminar trucks at cs? or would you want to play a role either there in light vehicle?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so this is a radar solution. preco does not have a lidar capability. you know that we have a partnership with quanergy on solid-state lidar. that is not at the stage where it's available to bring to market. so right now, it's largely the radar solutions that we're working on with preco to bring to market in this space that we're referring to.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
okay. and is your relationship with quanergy exclusive? or if you see better or different solutions can you take advantage of those?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. it's not exclusive. but again, right now, given that we've made the investment in preco and that there are opportunities that are growing very rapidly associated, which is the radar dimension, that's our focus area. we continue to look at other object detection technologies to enable to -- us to continue to build on this platform. but what we're announcing today is the small acquisition, but an important acquisition of preco associated with radar capability.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thank you.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
thank you.
operator
the next question is from the line of joseph spak with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
joseph spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much. just wanted to go back to the outgrowth. and you talked about that taking a step back in the back half even with the impressive 890 bps in the second quarter in automotive. but you compare that in the quarter versus the overall automotive industry. and when you look at your exposure, you're actually overweight versus the industry in north america and europe versus china. so like on a sensata weighted basis, it actually suggest you did even better than that. so as we go forward and north america and europe come back, why wouldn't the outgrowth continue and remain strong and sort of the geographic weighting work in your favor?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so you're right. there is -- outgrowth is not equal across all markets. we do tend to see both from new business opportunity standpoint and ultimately, in the form of content growth or outgrowth, which new business turns into outgrowth several years later that there is more concentration in china than there is in other markets. and hey, you look at the content per vehicle, china is half of what it is around the rest of the world. so that fact is absolutely true. but all oems have had challenges associated with product launches. and so that aspect of that associated with the disruption that has occurred is not specific to north america and china. it's a global challenge that has been -- we're all dealing with. so that's the reason for the change going into the second half.
joseph spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just on the inventory. i know you said it's small, and we agree. but i just want to be clear, like when you talk about it unwinding by the -- by year-end, is that to your below ihs view of the industry? meaning if ihs is correct, there's a little bit of extra conservatism in there?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
well, i'm not sure, honestly, if some of the difference between us and ihs relates to inventory unwinding to these. to be true, that might be a factor of it. so again, if you're talking $25 million, maybe it's $10 million, $12 million of the $60 million difference that we would have in the third quarter. so there may be some of that that's not factored in as well. that's an accurate statement.
joseph spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, joe.
operator
the next question is from the line of craig hettenbach with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
craig hettenbach -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, thank you. a question for jeff. just thinking through the cost savings actions, the $60 million to $65 million, obviously, this has been a very unique cycle to say the least. but just how do you think through kind of this environment? and as you looked at the business, some changes that you can make just kind of more on a structural basis to improve margins?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. thanks for the question, craig. so let me first start by saying this was a -- taking these actions was an incredibly difficult thing to do. we're talking about our people who are driving the business. and so i don't want to minimize it. it's necessary. we need to take action to respond to the unprecedented market changes. but i want to sort of formally thank the people who are impacted by this for their contributions over the years. these are very, very tough decisions. having said that, we take lemons and turn them into lemonades in terms of what we do going forward. and so as we think about where we're going, as we hire back, as the growth resumes in the business and markets recover, we'll hire in different locations, we'll hire skill sets that are about the future for the company. we do a lot of work to train and tool people that work with the company for that as well. but clearly, we'll take the opportunity with this market disruption to plan for the future in terms of where we're going as a business. we do that across people, we do that across where we need to manufacture as well, where our engineering needs to be to make sure it's closer to where our customers are. so there is no question that when we get faced with these very difficult times, that we accelerate things that we've considered that we are now able to do in an environment that's very challenging in terms of the markets that we serve. so your point is valid. we have done that as part of this program.
craig hettenbach -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i appreciate that context. and then just as a follow-up for automotive production, just thinking for the full year. i know it sounds like you guys are a little bit more positive on china and just maybe cautious on north america and europe relative to ihs. but on a blended basis, i think ihs is down around 23% for the year. are you close to that blended? or how do you think about that for globally?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so we're not providing full year guidance at this point. but that range is consistent with what we're looking at. and our view is, let's get through the view of the third quarter. and as the order book develops, as we get a best feel for the markets in the fourth quarter, and as we have continued conversations with our customers, we'll forecast out into the fourth quarter and therefore, what the full year impact is. but as we had mentioned, we do expect a sequential improvement from q2 to q3 into q4. so what the numbers you're talking are directionally accurate, but refining them will come with time as we get a better view as to what we're seeing.
craig hettenbach -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thanks.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, craig.
operator
the next question is from the line of tim yang with citi. please go ahead.
tim yang -- citi -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my question. on pricing, you mentioned better pricing in q2 in automotive market. can you talk about what's driving the better pricing, and how sustainable it is?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so what we mentioned is that a portion of the outgrowth is due to better pricing. most of our contracts with our customers provide for volumes associated with the market. obviously, when our customers engage with us and we contract with them, there's an expectation around what that volume will look like. and when you have major disruption like this, the volume is lower. and so the recovery of that impact could be either in the form of better pricing or it could be in the form of new awards on new business. when we're given that choice, we always take new business, long-term growth for the company, but there are some instances where we've seen some better pricing across our end markets, not just in automotive, when you have significant dips in volume in terms of what we're expecting in a quarter or in a year.
tim yang -- citi -- analyst
got it. my next question is on the outgrowth that you mentioned would decelerate a little bit in the second half. can you talk about how much of that moderation is due to customer inventory destocking? and how much of that is due to the content mix? thanks.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so it's a combination of those. it's another good point. the -- is it -- we put the inventory stocking in there as well. that was in there in the first half of the year, the $25 million, we talked about that being part of the automotive outgrowth in the first quarter. so if that unwinds, which we are forecasting that it will, that will come out of content. tough to judge exactly how much is due to that versus program launch, temporary deferrals or program launch. but certainly, the $25 million unwinding would be an element of that content decline going into the balance of the year. but it's -- but that's quantifiable. we know that's $25 million of the overall impact.
tim yang -- citi -- analyst
great. appreciate the color. thank you.

good day, and welcome to the sensata technologies second quarter 2020 earnings call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. jacob sayer, vice president of finance. please go ahead.
jacob sayer -- vice president finance
thank you, constantinos, and good morning, everyone. i'd like to welcome you to sensata's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. joining me on today's call are jeff cote, sensata's ceo and president; and paul vasington, sensata's chief financial officer. in addition to the financial results, press release that we issued earlier today, we will be referencing a slide presentation during today's conference call. a pdf of this presentation can be downloaded from sensata's investor relations website. we'll post a replay of today's webcast shortly after the conclusion of today's call.
as we begin, i would like to reference sensata's safe harbor statement on slide 2. during the course of this conference call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the financial performance of the company that involve certain risks and uncertainties. the company's actual results may differ materially from the projections described in such statements. factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our forms 10-q and 10-k as well as other subsequent filings with the sec.
on slide 3, we show sensata's gaap results for the second quarter of 2020. we encourage you to review our gaap financial statements in addition to today's presentation. most of the subsequent information that we will discuss during today's call will relate to our non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations of our gaap to non-gaap financial measures are included in our earnings release and in our presentation material, the company provides details of its segment operating income on slides 10 and 11 of the presentation, which are the primary measures management uses to evaluate the business.
jeff will begin with a review of our overall business during the second quarter, including the impact from covid-19 and the strong financial position of the company. he will also discuss sensata's revenue growth relative to our end markets during the second quarter and first half of 2020. he will then provide an update on recent progress in some of our key megatrend growth areas, including the recent acquisition of preco electronics. paul will then cover our detailed financials for the second quarter, provide a description of changes in our financial model and liquidity position, provide insight into what we are expecting for our end markets for the balance of the year and then provide select financial guidance for the third quarter of 2020. we will then take your questions after our prepared remarks.
now i'd like to turn the call over to sensata's ceo and president, jeff cote.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, jacob, and welcome, everyone. i'd like to start with some summary thoughts on our performance as outlined on slide 4. sensata recognized the global impact of covid-19 early, and we took a wide range of actions designed to protect our employees and enable us to meet essential customer demand while enhancing our financial flexibility. our focus on these priorities and quick action helped us navigate through this unprecedented environment. these actions will help position sensata to emerge from this worldwide disruption stronger so that we can better serve our customers, employees and shareholders as well as the communities in which we operate.
the lockdowns and quarantines that were instituted by governments around the world in response to the spread of covid-19 caused the end markets we serve to decline almost 40% during the quarter. our strong market outgrowth during the quarter offset a portion of this market decline, which resulted in our net revenue contracting by 33.9% organically. for the first half, our net revenue decreased 22.3%. we delivered market outgrowth of 750 basis points in our heavy vehicle off-road business, and 890 basis points in our automotive business for the second quarter and 840 basis points and 750 basis points through the first half of 2020, respectively. certain customers have delayed some of their product launches for the second half of the year, which will impact our market outgrowth in q3 and q4. however, we continue to be confident that our market outgrowth for 2020 and beyond will be sustained in the range of 600 basis points to 800 basis points for heavy vehicle off-road and 400 basis points to 600 basis points for automotive, in part due to our continued new business wins.
during the quarter, we closed over $125 million of new business wins, as part of $225 million in new business wins for the first half of 2020. this pace is faster than our average new business wins over the past five years and included $108 million in electrification wins. we believe these new business wins demonstrate the mission-critical nature of sensata's products, as our customers have continued to award new business to us, even in the midst of covid-19-related shutdowns.
from a demand standpoint, we saw improvements month-to-month during the second quarter, as customer sites reopened in may and ramped up production in june. this trajectory has continued for the first half of july. and on that basis, we anticipate sequential improvements in the third and fourth quarters this year. however, we remain cautious regarding the impact that potential covid-19 surgeons-related shutdowns may have on this recovery trend. despite the challenges, we believe we are in a strong financial position and have taken the steps necessary to enhance our financial flexibility. for example, we generated $45 million in free cash flow in the second quarter and $114 million year-to-date. we reduced capital expenditures for the year and aggressively managed our working capital. we lowered our operating expenses in the second quarter through a number of temporary measures and have since implemented permanent cost actions that will align our cost structure to more normalized demand. paul will address these cost actions later. we are seeing enough stability in the markets we serve and our order book to provide financial guidance for the third quarter. finally, as i will discuss in more detail, we continue to invest in capabilities that will drive our future growth with our acquisition of preco electronics. it was a challenging quarter, but we are pleased with our accomplishments.
now i'd like to discuss our performance by end market in the second quarter of 2020, as outlined on slide 5. overall volume during the second quarter was lower than both the first quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2019. we reported revenues of $576.5 million which represents an organic revenue decline of 33.9% year-on-year against an overall end market decline of almost 40%.
our industrial business decreased 14.6% organically, driven by pandemic-related shutdowns and a global industrial market slowdown of approximately 15.2%. outperformance in the industrial business was primarily due to growth in our medical equipment business, in particular, providing sensors to ventilator manufacturers.
our aerospace business decreased 39.4% organically. reduced production drove 32% end market decline and grounding of planes impacted our aerospace aftermarket business. global air traffic is currently down 50% from the beginning of the year, which is better than the trough levels in april that were down 80%.
our heavy vehicle off-road business posted an organic revenue decrease of 31.5%, outperforming a 39% end market contraction, representing 750 basis points of market outgrowth. our china on-road truck business continued to post strong growth as a result of the adoption of ns vi emissions regulations. while our china business grew in the second quarter, we experienced substantial declines in both europe and the americas as production levels in these markets declined.
our automotive business posted an organic revenue decrease of 41.6%, outperforming a 50.5% global end market production contraction, representing 890 basis points of market outgrowth. this outgrowth continues to be led by emissions, electrification and safety-related launches as well as slightly better pricing.
the china automotive end market grew 4.3% in the second quarter versus the prior year, snapping back from the first quarter shutdown-related declines. we do expect the recovery in europe and the americas to be more measured where plants were shuttered for the average of six to seven weeks in the second quarter. ihs, and we expect that the global automotive market, will grow sequentially from the second quarter into the third and fourth quarters. during the first quarter, we attributed a portion of automotive revenue growth to supply chain inventory building, especially with chinese customers. automotive inventory movements in the second quarter were negligible, although we do believe that there was a shift from china to europe and north america. we expect global inventory at our customers to return to normalized levels by the end of the year.
moving to slide 6. i want to share some updates about important progress we are making in our key megatrend initiatives. we continue to believe investments in electrification, smart and connected and autonomous megatrends will further our end market diversification, increase our long-term growth rate and provide important competitive advantages as these trends transform our world. despite the impact of covid-19, we do not see evidence that customers are slowing their investments in these areas. to provide greater transparency into our megatrend spending and the operating performance of our segments, we are moving the cost of these investments from the reporting segments to corporate and other. paul will discuss this in more detail.
in electrification, we are expanding the solutions we provide for critical applications across all end markets we serve. during the second quarter, we closed another $50 million in electrification new business wins, now $108 million year-to-date. as electrification trends accelerate, driven by broad legislation, such as the european green new deal, they present increasing opportunities for our solutions, representing an expected $6.5 billion addressable market for sensata by 2030.
in smart & connected, we continue testing proof-of-concepts with several leading fleet managers and are working to turn these efforts into orders by the end of this year. as part of this initiative, we are also working with several telematics companies that will transmit data collected by sensata's vehicle area network to the cloud in order to provide valuable insights to fleet managers.
our smart & connected initiative opens up an expected $1 billion in oem and $7 billion in fleet management addressable market sensata by 2030. in addition, we are increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as industrial iot, smart manufacturing, buildings and infrastructure. these segments represent fast-growing opportunities that will benefit and drive new business and market outgrowth for our industrial business unit.
moving to slide 7. on the autonomy front, on july 1, we closed a small but important acquisition that represents an early step into advanced driver assistance applications. preco electronics based in boise, idaho, is a leader in developing radar object detection application for heavy vehicles, providing crucial blind spot detection and side turn assist functionality. their solutions improve efficiency and overall safety. we believe preco is well positioned to benefit from upcoming eu vulnerable road user and other object detection regulations and expands our addressable market by $600 million in 2030 with sticky, mission-critical content. while currently a small business with approximately $15 million in net revenue, preco's growth potential is substantial. and we believe its differentiated offering will drive strong margins.
we see substantial synergies between preco and sensata as well, including leveraging our strong oem relationships and supply chain. we are pleased with our progress against these megatrend initiatives and an intend to continue these efforts that expand the sensata's markets, provide strong growth and differentiation for our future.
i'd now like to turn the call over to paul.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jeff. key highlights for the second quarter, as shown on slide 9, include revenue of $576.5 million, a decrease of 34.8% for the second quarter of 2019. organic revenue decreased 33.9%, largely due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and change in the foreign currency decreased revenue by 0.9%.
adjusted operating income was $75 million, a decrease of 63.4% compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower revenues, productivity headwinds from our manufacturing facilities operating at significantly lower capacity, elevated costs to safeguard our employees and local government restrictions, which all together, impacted our ability to align our costs to contracting end markets. these items were partially offset by temporary cost reductions in the quarter, including salary reductions and furloughs as well as savings from repositioning actions taken last year. adjusted net income was $27.7 million, a decrease of 81.6% compared to the second quarter of 2019. adjusted eps was $0.18 in the second quarter, a decrease of 80.6% compared to the prior year quarter.
now i'd like to comment on the performance of our two business segments in the second quarter of 2020. i will start with performance sensing on slide 10. our performance sensing business reported revenues of $385.2 million, a decrease of 40.2% compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the negative impact from foreign currency of 0.9%, performance sensing reported an organic revenue decrease of 39.3%.
our automotive business reported an organic revenue decrease of 41.6% but outpaced its end market by 890 basis points. revenue outgrowth was strong in all major end markets, led by new sensor launches in mission-critical emissions, electrification and safety applications. pricing was favorable when compared to the prior year quarter.
our heavy vehicle off-road business reported an organic revenue decrease of 31.5% but outpaced its end market by 750 basis points, primarily from accelerated content growth in china on-road truck business, driven by the adoption of ns vi emission regulations. consequently, we expect our content growth related to china on-road truck to moderate in the second half of this year.
performance sensing operating income was $60.8 million, a decrease of 65% as compared to the same quarter last year. performance sensing profit as a percentage of revenue was 15.8%. the decrease in segment operating income is due primarily to lower revenues, manufacturing facilities operating at significantly lower capacity and elevated operating costs related to covid-19, somewhat offset by temporary cost reductions in the quarter as well as savings from restructuring actions taken last year.
as shown on slide 11, sensing solutions reported revenues of $191.3 million in the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 20% as compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the negative impact from foreign currency of 0.7%, sensing solutions organic revenue decreased 19.3%. in the second quarter, revenue in our industrial business decreased 14.6% organically as industrial end markets contracted 15.2%. and revenue in our aerospace business decreased 39.4% organically from reductions in commercial oem production and substantially weaker aftermarket.
sensing solutions operating income was $55.8 million, a decrease of 28.2% from the same quarter last year. sensing solutions profit as a percentage of revenue was 29.2%. the decrease in segment operating income was primarily due to lower revenues, manufacturing facilities operating at significantly lower capacity and elevated operating costs related to covid-19, somewhat offset by temporary cost reductions in the quarter and savings from restructuring actions taken last year.
as jeff mentioned earlier, we are moving costs related to growth investments in emerging megatrends that are impacting and shaping our end markets from our business segments to corporate and other. this change provides better insight into the underlying operating results of our business segments and increased visibility into our ongoing megatrend investments that are expected to increase from approximately $25 million in 2019 to approximately $35 million this year. the operating profit and operating margins on slide 10 and 11 reflect the reclassification of these costs. to help with your modeling, we have provided quarterly reconciliations of the segment results for fiscal year 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 in the appendix.
corporate and other costs not included in segment operating income were $47.5 million in the second quarter of 2020. excluding charges added back to our non-gaap results, corporate and other costs were $40.4 million, a decrease of $3.4 million from the prior year quarter due to lower incentive compensation, lower global support costs from temporary cost actions and favorable foreign currency, somewhat offset by higher megatrend investments.
slide 12 shows sensata's second quarter 2020 non-gaap results. adjusted gross profit decreased 47.2% as compared to the same quarter last year to $165.4 million, and gross margins decreased 670 basis points to 28.7%. the decrease in gross profit and gross margin reflects lower revenues, largely due to covid-19. productivity headwinds from our manufacturing facilities operating at significantly lower capacity, elevated cost of safeguarding our employees and local government restrictions, which all together impacted our ability to align our costs to contracting end markets.
r&d costs improved 17.6%, and sg&a costs improved 15.9% from the same quarter last year, with both benefiting from temporary salary reductions and furloughs this quarter, savings from repositioning actions taken last year and favorable foreign currency. as a result, adjusted operating income was down 63.4% compared to the prior year quarter.
our tax rate as a percent of adjusted profit before tax was 18.2% in the second quarter, up 950 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to jurisdictional profit mix. tax as a percentage of ebit was 8.4%, up 140 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. we expect tax as a percentage of ebit in the second half of this year to remain consistent with the second quarter. finally, adjusted eps was $0.18, down $0.75 or 80.6% as compared to the second quarter of 2019, as the decrease in adjusted net income was partially offset by the benefit of share repurchases in intervening periods.
on slide 13, we provide a breakdown of the types of spend that make up our cost structure in their relative size to net revenue. the majority of our costs are variable. these are followed by semi-variable costs, which are structural and scaled to some extent with revenue that requires specific management action to drive change and the remainder of fixed costs. in the second quarter, we incurred year-on-year decremental gross margins of 48%, a 500 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2020, despite a significant drop in customer demand in the second quarter due to the rapid spread of covid-19 to north america and europe.
during the second quarter, our manufacturing plants were running at significantly reduced levels. however, better alignment of our manufacturing costs to the lower volume moderated some of the impact related to this volume contraction.
manufacturing costs remain elevated during the second quarter to protect and safeguard our employees, to comply with government mandates to pay our direct labor despite not being needed due to our reduced production levels and from higher freight costs as logistics supply chains remain disrupted. to temporarily help mitigate these higher manufacturing costs during the quarter, we reduced salaries from management by 25% and implemented employee furloughs, thereby achieving savings of approximately $22 million, which exceeded our previous savings expectation of $15 million to $20 million.
recognizing the potential of an extended economic recovery, we have taken a series of actions to structurally reduce our semi-variable cost by about 10% to achieve an expected $60 million to $65 million in savings next year. we have rigorously analyzed our operations and expect that these changes will better align our cost structure, the demand levels that we anticipate over the coming quarters. these cost-saving actions will be largely implemented throughout the second half of 2020 and will generate increasing savings as we progress through the remainder of the year and into early 2021, with about $7 million of savings expected in the third quarter of 2020. the includes an action to reduce our workforce, affecting approximately 980 positions worldwide.
restructuring charges related to this workforce reduction include $35 million to $39 million in people-related charges and $8 million to $10 million in site-related closure costs. during the second quarter, we recognized $26 million of charges related to these actions.
slide 14 demonstrates sensata's strong liquidity position. we entered the second quarter with approximately $800 million in cash on the balance sheet. on april 1, we drew down $400 million from our revolving line of credit, provided additional financial flexibility. with $45 million in free cash flow generated during the second quarter, we exited the quarter with $1.24 billion in cash on hand. we have substantial buffers to our leverage covenants in our debt agreements, and the first outstanding maturity of our debt is not until october 2023, when a $500 million unsecured note becomes due. consequently, we are confident our liquidity position is sufficient to enable us to weather a severe downturn.
free cash flow during the second quarter of 2020 was 162% of adjusted net income, a dramatic improvement compared to 66% of adjusted net income in the same quarter last year. we managed working capital effectively during the quarter, reducing inventory by $25.5 million or 5% sequentially from the first quarter. our capital expenditure guidance for the full year 2020 remains $120 million to $130 million, and we are on track for the first half of 2020. lastly, our stock repurchase program remains on hold until end market conditions show greater improvement and stability.
on slide 15, i show a number of economic indicators that we track to help assess future demand for our products and solutions. ihs is our primary third-party source for information on future automotive production. in addition, we monitor key economic indicators such as consumer confidence, and we communicate routinely with our automotive customers to gain alignment on future demand expectations, which all strongly influence our view of the end market.
for our heavy vehicle and off-road business, we use various production forecasts from third-party firms such as lmc for on-road production levels and kgp for off-road production levels. we also evaluate economic indicators to gauge the health of our heavy vehicle off-road customers in the markets they serve, which we believe are strongly correlated to the demand for our products. these indicators include freight load factors, inventory sales ratios, building permits, industrial production, crop futures and farm machinery. public statements from our large customers in the construction and agriculture sectors also help to form our view of the market. for our industrial business, we evaluate regional pmi data and forecast for gdp and housing starts to develop a forward-looking view of industrial demand, given their strong correlation with our historical industrial revenue.
for aerospace, expectations for future oem, commercial and defense production and passenger miles flown are good indicators of future demand for our aerospace products and aftermarket services.
slide 16 provides details on end market performance year-on-year for the second quarter and expectations for the balance of the year. this data reflects our view of our end markets, leveraging information from third-party forecasters as well as customer order patterns and commercial engagements. the data on this page represents what we know today and is subject to change as customer and economic conditions change.
north american automotive production levels are expected to improve sequentially from the second quarter as a result of improving vehicle sales, which are currently at historically low levels and from oems ramping up production. within europe, customer and business confidence are expected to improve driving vehicle registrations and oem faction production levels well above the low levels in the second quarter. and in china, after a historic drop in gdp and auto production during the first quarter, vehicle production has snapped back in the second quarter and is expected to moderate through the third and fourth quarters.
while ihs is a primary data source for developing light vehicle production expectations by region, our market expectations for north america and europe, as shown on the page, are more conservative than ihs, reflecting our expectation for summer-related shutdowns in europe and a continued trend of lower customer product take rates relative to initial orders during the quarter.
the heavy vehicle end markets have been in decline globally since the second quarter of 2019. covid-19-related shutdowns caused a sharp drop in the first quarter in china, expecting north america and europe during the second quarter accelerating the already downward cycle. however, heavy vehicle off-road production declines year-on-year are expected to ease in the third and fourth quarters, with key economic indicators pointing to sequential growth from the second quarter.
industrial end markets fared better than other markets in the second quarter, and pmi in all areas of the world improved sequentially. percentage year-on-year declines for the balance of the year in the industrial space are expected to improve from the second quarter levels.
the defense portion of the aerospace end market is expected to remain steady this year, while commercial production is expected to improve from very low levels in the second quarter. as jeff mentioned earlier, we expect for the company a moderate decrease in market outgrowth in the second half of 2020 as compared to the first half of 2020. however, we are confident that full year and long-term outgrowth will remain in the expected ranges.
in summary, due to the improvements in end markets from the second quarter, we expect sensata's revenue performance to improve sequentially each quarter through the balance of the year. in april, we withdrew our full year guidance as the negative impact of the covid-19 pandemic created great uncertainty and unpredictability for our business.
during our first quarter call, we highlighted our intention to resume providing financial guidance as soon as practicable. as a result of improving economic conditions and better stability in both customer order patterns and global supply chains, we are providing financial guidance in the third quarter of 2020, as shown on slide 17.
our guidance assumes our customers and we are able to keep our manufacturing facilities open despite potential resurgence in the covid-19 pandemic and government responses to try to prevent the spread of the virus.
for the third quarter of 2020, we expect to report revenues between $675 million and $705 million, representing a reported year-over-year revenue decrease between 21% and 17%. at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect that foreign currency will decrease revenues year-over-year by approximately $4.4 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency, we expect to report an organic revenue decrease of 20% to 17% in the third quarter. our current flow rate is approximately 94% of the revenue guidance midpoint for the first quarter. we expect to report adjusted operating income between $110 million and $124 million. on the bottom line, we expect to report adjusted net income between $60 million and $74 million, which would represent a decline of 58% to 49% compared to q3 2019.
we expect operating margins will expand from q2 levels sequentially in q3, primarily due to higher revenue. this includes an expected increase of approximately $15 million in operating expenses sequentially in the third quarter as temporary cost reductions in the second quarter and as the financial benefits from our semi-variable cost reduction programs begin to ramp up. we expect to report adjusted eps between $0.38 and $0.46, which includes a $0.02 positive impact from foreign currency at the guidance midpoint. we are not currently providing full year financial guidance until longer-term visibility improves.
in closing, i will echo jeff's comments that while we are operating in unprecedented times, i'm very proud of our organization. we have made significant progress in strengthening our business during the quarter despite significant challenges. we are working diligently to ensure sensata emerges from this time as a stronger and more resilient company.
i will now turn the call back to jeff.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, paul. before turning over to q&a, i want to wrap up with a few key messages, as outlined on slide 18. we continue to monitor all of our end markets and customers to ensure that our resources are balanced against forecasts and prioritized against critical growth opportunities, and we have taken the necessary actions to align our cost with the market. we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive end market outgrowth for the full year 2020 and into the future. and this confidence is supported by strong new business wins.
we continue to deliver solid free cash flow, which demonstrates sensata's resilient financial model, and we ended the quarter with more than $1.2 billion in cash on hand. we continue to invest in our megatrends and other growth initiatives that are opening up significant new markets for sensata. and we are making excellent progress as evidenced by the $108 million in new business wins in electrification so far this year and the customer engagement on smart & connected. in addition, we continue to believe that the overall market environment may provide interesting opportunities to further strengthen our portfolio through strategically important value-creating acquisitions such as preco electronics.
now i'd like to turn the call back to jacob.
jacob sayer -- vice president finance
thank you, jeff. for participants, jeff and paul are in separate locations this morning, so feel free to direct your questions to one or the other of them. also, given the large number of listeners on the call, i'd ask each of you to limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. constantinos, if you would please assemble the q&a roster.

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from mark delaney from goldman sachs. please go ahead with your question.
mark delaney -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. good morning. thanks very much for taking the question. the revenue guidance for 4q is well above the street and trends a very good improvement. i'm hoping, the company can speak a bit more on some of the recent order trends that it has been witnessing. and i think the fill rate that's implied in that 4q outlook is 96% compared to about 88% last year. so hoping to understand, is there something that sensata has seen in its order book that is suggesting order rates are going to be slowing in the fourth quarter compared to what it experienced a year ago? or is that simply conservatism to account for some of the uncertainty for factors such as covid?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, mark, thanks for the question. this is jeff. and so there was a sequential recovery again into the fourth quarter about a 5% sequential that leads us to about 2% off for fourth quarter versus last year. obviously, auto continues to recover. hvor notably turned positive from a revenue standpoint quarter-over-quarter that's been an 18-month trend on hvor.
industrial tends to be a little seasonally lower in the fourth quarter. and obviously, the aero business as we know is still lagging, it's 23% down from last year. you noted the fill rate 96%. absolutely that's higher than it typically is. we do remain conscious regarding lockdowns. we all see the news about what's going on.
on the positive side, we feel as though all of our customers have done an amazing job of figuring out how to continue to stimulate demand with their end customers. we've also all done a tremendous job in terms of keeping our supply chains open. but given those concerns and also given that the last couple of quarters have seen some volatility in order rates from the time, we entered the quarter until when we exited the quarter we are remaining a little cautious. but i'm very optimistic about where things would go. october started off quite strong, which gives us a view that things will continue to be strong. but just watching the news and making sure that we're being cautious about where things could go, mark.
mark delaney -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that makes a lot of sense. thanks for that. and for my second question, i was hoping to better understand the ebit margins. and jeff, you made some comments about just being an industry leading margin but maybe not quite peak rates. maybe you can dive a little bit more into that topic. i mean, is there anything in the fourth quarter impacting margins that we should be aware of you're investing in some of these megatrends and talked about a lot of really exciting things there but any incremental investments or other factors influencing margins in the fourth quarter? and any kind of commentary about what you may consider to be industry-leading, but not peak margins as you're thinking about next year especially as you're starting to implement this more fully implement this cost reduction program? thanks.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, mark -- and mark, its paul. just thinking about the movement sequentially, we're going to see increased investment in megatrends. and we've got some integration spend related to the preco acquisition. we still have the covid sort of disruption that's happening in the supply chain. and then a little bit of higher incentive comp as our numbers continue to improve. so those would be the kind of headwinds against the stronger volume growth that we're seeing sequentially.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, mark.

our next question comes from joseph spak from rbc capital markets. please go ahead with your question.
joseph spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks very much. just wanted to talk about the restructuring to align to the demand and that is saving you $65 million. when you announced that, you talked about, meeting some lower end market demand. but now it does appear that, demand is recovering faster than expected at least in some end markets. so are those numbers still valid? or does some of that go away as you look forward?
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so jeff, i can take it. it's paul. the numbers are valid they're related to restructuring actions, a lot of savings is people-related service to continue to execute on those restructuring programs, but not all done as we said, we're implementing over the course of this year. and well into next year. but the plan is to continue to implement those programs. and generate that savings. some of that savings ultimately may get offset with a higher investment in our megatrend initiatives, but that's to be determined, as we develop our 2021 plan.
joseph spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just on the electrification, i was wondering, obviously some positive developments here with the awards and the higher cpv commentary. can you just remind us, how big the electrification business is today? and then aside from the higher cpv, what about the margin profile of that business? because i assume it doesn't have the scale of the ice business today. so where are they today? and where can they go in the future?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so when you think about the total company, that's the way we think about the current electrification business and the opportunity for the business, in terms of that $6.5 billion sam. electrification represents only about 5%, when i think of the new trend of electrification. obviously we've got a -- our legacy control business that serves, as a self-setting circuit breaker in the market. and i wouldn't necessarily include that in the broader electrification theme. but it's a small portion today. but it's very rapidly growing.
and it's a target area, that we're looking at around high-voltage components and broad grid infrastructure, which will be needed to really allow the megatrend to continue to move in this direction. we're seeing very positive signs from our customers. everybody has continued to invest in this trend regulation continues to support this trend. big nbo's almost half of our -- almost half of our nbo's thus far this year were in this area. and we're continuing to develop not only organic capabilities, but also look at m&a to focus on this as well.
joseph spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst

our next question comes from nik todorov from longbow research. please go ahead with your question.
nik todorov -- longbow research -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys. thank you and congrats on great results. i was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the -- you mentioned unfavorable mix in both performance and in sensing. maybe can you unpack that a little bit and talk about, the puts and takes into the fourth quarter gross margin? and maybe how much of covid costs expect into the fourth quarter? i think paul you mentioned about, $60 million or $65 million in the third q. thanks.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. the mix is -- we've got performance sensing business that's auto and hvor and that the industrial aerospace business the latter being more profitable. as we look for q3 to q4, you can see this is pretty significant decline which is seasonal and normal in nature in our industrial business. and our aerospace business still continues to be down, as jeff mentioned, almost 22%, 23% year-over-year. so those two parts of our business are driving down the unfavorable revenue mix to some extent.
it's also our automotive business is really recovering very quickly. and that is our lower-margin business when you think of the four segment business units that we have. so it's just a dynamic of, where they are in terms of recovery cycle. and the probability across the portfolio of businesses, so far that's driving that mix.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
covid cost was the second question.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so covid cost. they've been running somewhere, in the $5 million to $10 million a quarter. it's just depending on, just -- its labor inefficiencies, or logistics inefficiencies, the supply chains have been disrupted. and it's all the elevated costs related to protecting our place. so they're running $5 million to $10 million on average, in every quarter. some more -- some quarters were a bit higher than that, somewhere in the lower end of that range.

our next question comes from amit daryanani from evercore. please go ahead with your question.
amit daryanani -- evercore -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question guys. i guess first off just on the december quarter guide, i think the implied assumption is auto production is down 4%, 5% in december. could you just maybe talk about, what are the geographical assumptions, over there for auto production? and i'm curious, do you think this guide could prove to be as conservative as the one you had in september, because inventory in the auto ecosystem still seems to be fairly lean at this point.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so let me touch on, where we think automotive will be -- i think you got it right about 4%, 5% down year-on-year, in the fourth quarter. north america we're calling it about down 3% versus fourth quarter last year europe 2%, so a pretty significant snapback in terms of performance sequentially in europe. china is down right? so that's another big change, as china was in a growth mode and now is down 7% versus fourth quarter of last year. and then japan and korea are down 8%, 10% as well.
i note that, from an overall production rate, it is an improvement during the fourth quarter about 1.7 million units based upon sensata's mix. but still lower than where they were fourth quarter of last year.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and i would just add that we're pretty much on top of the ihs estimates for q4 that we adjust our business mix compared to the production that is in the ihs estimates you'll see a little bit more negativity on the market than what you would see on pure ihs numbers when you exclude tailwind.
amit daryanani -- evercore -- analyst
that's really helpful. and i guess as a follow-up, i mean, you guys have had a really impressive recovery i think from the bottoms of covid over here operationally. so i'd love to get your perspective on what do you think gets you to go back to the buyback program and reinitiate that? what triggers that? are you trying to wait for end market and demand to get better? or are you trying to wait for the debt pay down to happen? i guess, what triggers the buyback to come back would be helpful to understand?
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think, we tried to lay out for you how we're thinking about capital deployment going forward. really excited about the opportunities on the m&a side and continue to grow our businesses and into the megatrend issues either organically or inorganically. so that's probably -- if you think of the priority that's where the priority is right now.
the call of the 6.25% is a highly npv driven transaction. so we like the economics around doing that. but that will be determined like if assuming economic conditions remain good certainly would be interested in getting that value for the company. i think share repurchases are still an important part of our capital deployment strategy. you see them as a third leg in the third of the three options that we have right now, still important but probably deemphasizing that a bit from work from the other two.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, amit.

our next question comes from samik chatterjee from jpmorgan. please go ahead with your question.
bharat daryani -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah. hi, thanks for taking my question. this is bharat on for samik. so just one question from me. if i look at your 4q guidance. sensing solutions you expect the end market to decline 13% to 14%. so if you could just help us think about between industrial and aerospace what are you thinking about like each segment? how much improvement you're expecting in industrial? and within aerospace i mean defense continues to be strong like are you seeing any signs of hitting in the other sub-segments there within aerospace? thank you.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
sure. yeah, sure. so on the industrial side fourth quarter is still about 9% down from prior year on a revenue basis. that's seasonally usually the fourth quarter is a little bit lower for the industrial business. and then on the aerospace side it's still down pretty dramatically 26% versus prior year. so that's what we're seeing in terms of the end markets there.
so paul, do you want to add anything to that?
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, i think that covers it.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president

our next question comes from luke junk from baird. please go ahead with your question.
luke junk -- baird -- analyst
good morning guys. thanks for taking the question. first, just wanted to better understand the first commercial agreement for your heavy vehicle and off-road smart & connected fleet management offering. maybe if you could just comment on how the revenue breaks down from just a model standpoint between the more one-time aspects in terms of sort of front-end sales and the recurring piece? and then you also cite $90 million of smart & connected business wins in total year-to-date. and just wondering if you could provide a little more color on that as well. thanks.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. i'd be glad to. so it's a first commercial experience with this in terms of closing business. and as i'm sure you know fleets don't do a big bang in terms of how they roll this out. they start with a pilot, they roll it out to additional vehicles and then they continue to expand that over time. and that's what we would expect across not only this one fleet manager that we've engaged with but the others that we're in the process of having pilots with.
so it's a small start. that's a small revenue base to start with but it's a clear indication that the solution provides value and the fleet managers are engaging with us to roll it out. and as i mentioned a lot of these fleets in the aftermarket have tens of thousands of vehicles right. so the magnitude of the addressable market that we've talked about of $6 billion is real based upon a conservative view of fan-out across that market.
and so different fleet managers will choose different business models and contract structures on this. so this particular fleet manager wanted a full subscription basis. so in that environment, we buy the equipment or build the equipment. we work together to install it and then they pay us on a subscription basis over a six or seven-year time frame.
others will choose to buy equipment upfront and then just pay for data services. so every model will be slightly different and will tailor it to the interest and the desire of the individual fleet manager. i'm very excited about the opportunity, very excited about bringing it to commercialization in a very short period of time and looking forward to providing more updates as we continue to fan this out with other customers and with this particular customer.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
so, luke had mentioned as well the $90 million in mdos. it is important to note luke that's in the oem market rather than in the aftermarket. so those will be with the truck and trailer manufacturers rather than the fleet manager. so more traditional hardware sale from sensata.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
right, great point jacob. so it's important to note and we've talked about this in the past but the foundation of our smart & connected initiative here is around tire pressure and in an on-road truck environment there are unique requirements associated with enabling tire pressure which introduces the notion of a hub or a vehicle area network which is the foundation for collecting lots of additional sensor data to feed information and insight into the cloud. so that's the part that's being implemented in oem's and we're doing the same thing in aftermarket with a broader suite of offering.
luke junk -- baird -- analyst
okay. thank you. thanks for all of that. that's super helpful. and then maybe just as a follow-up maybe more of a hypothetical. so the us election coming next week, if of course there's a change of administration. biden has signaled that he would move to rise fuel economy standards fairly sharply above even the prior level contemplated under the obama administration. can you just talk about what that impact might look like in your business in terms of the clean and efficient driver? and ultimately how does sensata win the stricter fuel economy standards in the us potentially?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes. it's -- regulation and environmental policy is a long-term game. and it's not something that can change overnight. but the trends are very positive in terms of being favorable to what it is that we offer as a company what our value proposition is. and i would view that a tilt toward more environmentally friendly and more regulatory-driven policy would over time be quite positive for us as a company. and so hard to know exactly how that will fan-out. but certainly we feel as though even with the current administration the opportunities are significant if there's a shift toward more conservative policies from an environmental standpoint it could -- it has to help us in the long run.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, luke.

our next question comes from david kelley from jefferies. please go ahead with your question.
david kelley -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for taking my question. i guess first one starting with automotive. i believe in the prepared remarks you referenced challenges to support outsized customer demand ramp. just curious, if there were any onetime costs such as overtime in the quarter to meet the more aggressive industry snapback than we all expected?
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. no, david. it's just -- we run our business very lean managing our cost of demand as tightly as possible. and with the rapid improvement in the end market and we weren't able to serve all the demand that our customers were ordering for product. and so that had some of an impact on the amount of revenue we were able to generate in the quarter.
long-cycle business we've got some long lead-time items. it takes a little time to get caught up and we'll get caught up, but it did create a little bit of a bump in terms of our ability to generate all the demand that was out there.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes. and the only thing i'd add to that is that in the third quarter, you know, that the trend improved dramatically through the quarter. and so given the guide that we provided when we -- in july you could probably sense that july was strong, but not as strong as september. and so the growth of demand during the quarter was quite strong. we're going to approach that a little bit differently in the fourth quarter given that the demand is there. so october we're starting out strong to make sure that we don't have a december that has a high demand that creates challenges to deliver.
but again, you want to go back to the team's efforts on this managing through a very steep decline in the second quarter and managing costs and everything that needs to be done as a result of that and then the snapback managing that a real testament to the team's capabilities.
david kelley -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. great. thanks. that's super helpful. and maybe as a follow-up in line with that demand discussion. should we think about outgrowth in auto is beginning to normalize? you target 4% to 6% -- 4% to 6% range go forward or should we expect some ongoing variability as production slowly or perhaps continue to aggressively returns back to normal?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
we had called out that the third quarter would be a little bit lower for auto given covid-related launch delays right in the second quarter as customers were preparing for launch in the third and fourth quarter. they had some challenges in terms of people being able to do what they needed to in terms of testing products and so forth and preparing for launch. so we called that out. that became true 290 basis points of outgrowth in the third quarter for the automotive business.
fortunately, our other businesses offset it. so as a company we were at 520 basis points of outgrowth. there's always some level of variability by quarter, by business. but again, i would point to the fact that given that we are a long-cycle business for most of our end markets that we serve, we are able to see what that outgrowth is going to look like. they plan for these launches. and we know what the new business wins are. so we have a high degree of confidence in long-term being able to maintain in that range not necessarily in any given quarter but long-term for sure.

our next question comes from brian johnson from barclays. please go ahead with your question.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
yes. thank you. very quick housekeeping question and then the real question. the housekeeping question is there anything changing between operating income and eps in the fourth quarter? just my math i'm getting a little lighter eps than implied by the ebit upside versus consensus.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
brian, i think for all the lines you have three things that drive it. it's balance sheet hedging of currency exposures. obviously, interest expense is rising because of the new bond deal, which is a higher coupon than the revolver. and taxes are arising a little bit in terms of mix.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thanks. second question on the electrification offset that you outlined, are those in actual vehicles right now? or is it more the products on your shelves have those potential?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
i'm sorry, the potential for what? in terms of the...
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
for ppp offset.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
i got you. so the $50 of content you're referring to?
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
right. is that something that actually customers have filled on?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
or you just have a shelf in your store that they could if they wanted there to get back to?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
no, no, no. so these are designed in products for vehicles -- for battery electric vehicles that have 50 or greater of content in them. and it's not just we have a product for when and if they choose to buy it. so it's designed in it's sold business that generates that content per vehicle.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
okay. and if you were to think about the market share of these opportunities versus what in your sensors that go in the combustion engine equipment. do you see any meaningful difference more concentrated less concentrated spots?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes. well a little -- the wins on the electrification side tend to be a little more lumpy. and what i mean by that is they're bigger because the platforms that our customers are creating tend to be larger and panned out across a larger number of vehicles. so the wins are a little bit more lumpy. therefore, the product categories tend to be a little bit more lumpy as well in terms of the overall opportunity. but there are many opportunities in the electrified vehicle space that we're either serving today or pursuing that we believe will continue to allow us to -- that will benefit from this trend that we're seeing.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
yes. and just final follow-up question there. gm announced the ltm skateboard with wireless battery sensing. it was a different company though they highlighted publicly acquired by spring like that for the solution. does that mean that -- do you still have an opportunity on the gm platform? is that a competitor in a year? or did they just choose to highlight a different part of the platform that's not quite the same as what you're selling?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
for battery management, it's not us that's doing battery management, but we're certainly, we have an opportunity to serve other components within gm for that platform.

our next question comes from wamsi mohan from bank of america. please go ahead with your question.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
yes. thank you. can you maybe talk about how we should think about incremental margins heading into 2021, especially given that you have some material cost initiatives that you have under way going into next year? and i have a quick follow-up.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
wamsi, its paul. so we're not going to be obviously giving guidance yet for 2021, but i will say that with the growing volume, we do expect if the volume does continue at this pace that it would drive nice incremental margins from that incremental volume if we stay at these levels. obviously, the repositioning actions will help. we're going to continue to invest in the megatrends in our growth initiatives and as jeff talked about we are continuing to invest in our people. we have a paper performance model. so with greater profitability, greater incentives, compensation within the p&l next year. so i do think margins will expand next year, if revenues continue at these levels.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
so paul, just to clarify though the conversion rate itself -- the incremental margin conversion rate itself, the drop-through should be higher than historical on those incremental?
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
for a period of time, that's right. for a period of time maybe i would say it's got to look a lot like what we've seen on the way down. by the way, we'll see incremental margins higher than normal. at some point, we're going to have to put investment cross back into the business. so that will start eating into the incremental. but right now, we're working in an environment where we have the capacity margins dropped a lot because we weren't able to just get out our semi-variable and fixed costs kind of same phenomenon on the way back up. so more of a variable model rate.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
right. as a follow-up, i mean just sort of segues into this, but more on a 2020 basis. and if you look at the revenue guide that you gave at the start of the year pre-covid and where we're ending up. it's about $500 million lower on revenues and about $1.50 lower on eps roughly. would you say substantially all of that is covid for revenues? or do you think that there were other moving pieces in there?
and then what about on the decremental margin side, can you maybe parse that again into covid versus the restructuring versus the megatrend spends or anything else that you think is material? thank you.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
at a high level, i think we've done a good job delivering on our outgrowth targets. so i think we executed the things that were in our control and so the outgrowth has been strong. i think most of this is -- not all of this is market-related and i would suggest that it's all related or mostly related to covid-19.
in terms of our cost structure, we've talked about a few times that, in the first half of the year, we weren't really able to get at our semi-variable and fixed cost. so, we were seeing our cost structure moving in line with -- our volumes move more aligned with our variable costs. we took actions in q2 around temporary furlough. it generated $22 million in savings, so that was a temporary benefit. it didn't repeat in the second half. now, we're doing permanent cost actions because the demand levels are lower and they will be lower for some period of time.
i think those are the major drivers of profitability. we're adding -- we are investing more in megatrends because we see a lot of opportunity to grow and we want to pursue those opportunities for long-term sustainable growth. so, that is a lever as well. but for the most part, i mean i think we're just cycling through a much -- a very depressed end market that's now starting to recover and we're showing strong results because of it.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst

our next question comes from jim suva from citi investment research. please go ahead with your question.
jim suva -- citi investment research -- analyst
thank you. can you just talk a little bit about any visibility you have on channel inventory? or sometimes you sell into a middle harness maker or a middle aggregator whether it'd be delphi or other, both on the automotive side as well on the hvac side?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes. so the auto side is a lot more transparent to us. to be candid, auto, hvor, aerospace is a huge amount more transparent. we talked about the fact that we believe, we built about $25 million of inventory in the channel in automotive in the first half of the year. we believe that that has unwound in the third quarter. we had originally expected that to unwind over the balance of the year, so it unwound quicker than we had thought.
we don't see any evidence that in aerospace hvor and in auto that there's any significant inventory builds. and candidly jim, we judge that based upon discussions with our buyers, but also calls we get if something doesn't ship on a friday and it was supposed to. and that supply chain is fairly tight. we don't believe there's a lot of inventory.
on the industrial side, it's a little harder. you point out that's the one area where we do sell-through some distributors. the indications that we get is that, there's not a ton of inventory build there. i think, we all experienced this being consumers in terms of going to try to buy major home appliances or other goods. there is a backlog in terms of demand that has not been able to get fulfilled. and i would use that as a proxy for belief in terms of at least our products, whether or not there's any significant pent-up inventory in the system. we're not calling anything else that we're viewing will unwind in the near term.
jim suva -- citi investment research -- analyst
okay. and so unwinding, does it get you back to equilibrium? or is unwinding get you back to a little bit too lean than where you'd like to be?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
there isn't anything to unwind. and so, i would say that we're probably about an equilibrium now in terms of inventory in the supply chain. i would say that with the increased demand, you might see customers trying to build a little bit more inventory to make sure that they can serve end market demand rather than in a mode of cutting back on inventory. that would be where i think we are on the continuum.
jim suva -- citi investment research -- analyst
great. thanks so much for the details and clarifications.

our next question comes from michael filatov from berenberg capital. please go ahead with your question.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for taking my question. i was just wondering, if you could update us sort of on the revenue for gigavac and sort of how that performed in that business and the high-voltage contact has performed relative to the rest of the business? and then also, sort of broadly speaking, i know there's more high-voltage contactors on sort of higher performance electric vehicles. and i was wondering, how many contactors generally speaking on average do you guys have right now on evs or bevs and how that -- you see that trending over time for your business?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes. so, a couple of points in there. so, on the gigavac business although, we're not calling it out directly, i would say in a significantly down market gigavac has continued to grow quite nicely. and that's driven based upon the content growth that we're seeing for the offering that they have. and so, we had a -- when we bought this business, we knew what was going to be a very fast grower, very accretive growth rates to sensata overall and that's what we're targeting from an m&a standpoint. the businesses that can have differentiated margins but also be growers that grow at rates much faster than the core business. gigavac has fulfilled that.
in terms of the number of contactors, that's a platform system architecture question. there are a number of vehicles out there today that have four to six contactors in place others have two contractors in place. given the magnitude of the cost associated with contactors, i would expect that over time that will -- the architecture associated that will push down to fewer numbers.
but going in the other direction or pushing in the other direction for more protection and therefore more contactors is that, understanding what this application does. it protects the most valuable asset in the vehicle battery and it also protects the charging equipment and the person applying the charge. so, it performs an incredibly important function. oems will always look to take out cost to be more competitive, but we don't view that as being anything that would be unusual or a negative toward our investment case on this particular acquisition.

our next question comes from craig hettenbach from morgan stanley. please go ahead with your question.
craig hettenbach -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. thank you. jeff, looking at the industrial market beyond what looks to be kind of an industrial kind of recovery here. can you maybe just frame the growth expectations in that market? i know autos get a lot more attention given the significant size, but just across the portfolio you have kind of in the mid to longer term, what type of growth opportunities do you see in industrial?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes. great question. i appreciate the opportunity to talk about some of the other end markets that we serve. obviously, industrial is an enormous market, highly fragmented. we have a number of different products and end markets that we're serving there. you know that the third -- it's actually the market that's gone down the less, but it also has recovered the least amount during the year. so that different that -- market concentration in terms of a lot of different areas has been very helpful. so third quarter was a very strong quarter for our industrial business. it was only down about 2%, really driven based upon the demand for medical device, a small portion of that overall business, but had really helped it. it's a target area for us.
so when we start to talk about things like smart grid infrastructure that would fall more squarely in the industrial business, certainly we'll continue to explore all industrial iot-type applications within that business. so lots of opportunity. it's important also to note that the biggest component of that business is the -- our legacy controls business. and it's a very profitable business, a very sticky business, but a slower growing business. and so when you look at that business in total, our target areas will be on the faster-growing areas as opposed to the core businesses that we have in there that are gdp-like growers. hope that helps.

our next question comes from deepa raghavan from wells fargo securities. please go ahead with your question.
deepa raghavan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi, good morning all. jeff, can you talk about the megatrends investment in terms of autos versus hvor versus industrial? and i assume autos obviously investments are increasing, but can you also talk about any -- our spends -- our investments in industrial accelerating as well? how do you think about that megatrend investment portfolio?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes. so i apologize. i think i got the nature of the question, but let me repeat it just to make sure. so it's -- where the megatrend investment is being focused across end markets? is that the nature of the question?
deepa raghavan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes. i mean is that accelerating in the industrial portion and auto portion as well?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes. okay. okay. yes. so we're being very purposeful that our megatrend, our investments are companywide initiatives. and because we believe that these megatrends will impact all of the end markets that we serve. now it's critically important that we have a very strong position in electrification in auto. so as the trend from combustion engine to electrified platforms continues that we're well positioned for that. but make no mistake, we are targeting capabilities that can serve the broader market.
and so, clearly as we look at the organic development that we have ongoing that will serve auto industrial, the hvor market a little less so the aerospace for obvious reasons. i think electrification is a little further out, but it serves all of those end markets. and you'll see that both our organic and our m&a-related activity will be focused on all of the end markets as we pursue these megatrends.
and yes that applies to the smart & connected as well. more concentration in smart & connected around transport and logistics chains. but certainly, the focus would be to look at it pretty broadly across a number of market segments.
craig hettenbach -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. one on potential costs heading into 2021, i think since you were able to talk about, any early thoughts generally, but also how do you think about momentum exiting 2020 entering 2021? and if you can also focus a little bit on the inventory situation in hvor here in the us or elsewhere, do you think the oems would have replenished efficient inventory by end of the year? or should that continue to influence production into 2021 also and thereby benefits suppliers like yourself?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so, obviously, we're not going to provide specific guidance on 2021. but if you look at all of the third-party forecasts, it would suggest that the growth will continue from 2020 where we landed into 2021. if you look at all of our end markets even at the fourth quarter guide, they were down fairly dramatically from 2019, and candidly, nowhere near peak levels, right?
so, if we pick the automotive market specifically, we're forecasting, call it down, close to 20% year-over-year. the peak auto markets were back in 2016, 2017. so we're nowhere near peak automotive market. so, our view would be that 2020 is a fairly good little point in terms of to recover from. we're not taking that for granted.
everybody is watching signals to see whether or not there could be a double dip or other impact, but the feeling is that, from here there will be some nice growth potential over the next year or couple of years, depending on the rate of recovery. certainly, the recovery thus far this year has been stronger than, at least, i would have anticipated. thanks, deepa.

our next question comes from matt sheerin from stifel. please go ahead with your question.
matt sheerin -- stifel -- analyst
yes. thank you. just a couple of quick ones for me here. just regarding the commentary around m&a, jeff, and that being a priority for cash use, you've also talked about focusing on areas of growth emerging markets all the things that fit into your technology themes. but could you talk about a little bit more on that strategy, particularly, are we continuing to expect more tuck-in acquisitions versus the larger deals you did four or five years ago?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. i am glad you asked that to sort of clarify. so, we've kept the pipeline for m&a quite full during this time. although we've been for obvious reasons cautious in terms of capital deployment in the area of m&a other than the one small transaction that we did with preco. the near-term focus will be on more bolt-on byte sized type m&a.
so, nothing in our sort of target zone of that $1 million purchase price or $1 billion purchase price type range. the target areas will be around the electrification and smart & connected areas. so, electrified equipment, broadly, not just auto, electrified equipment and smart grid infrastructure. and also around smart & connected transport and logistics, so that is a focus.
we're also going to be focused on, not only high-growth segments, but businesses that will be highly accretive to sensata's growth rate, right? so, they're not value play where we're going to buy something, we're going to extract cost. we believe that the businesses that we're targeting can have differentiated margins, perhaps not at sensata's margin, but differentiated margin, but very high-growth rates and where we have the ability or the right to play, right? so, solutions or competency is that we have or end markets where we have specific knowledge regarding bringing mission-critical solutions. so, that's our target area. not big bang type transformational stuff more bolt-ons to further our strategy. thank you, matt.

exactly, more on the guidance specifically a lot of inbound emails, just asking about if we could even further define paul the step-up in the opex sequentially, i know you cited incentive comp and more investments and some other factors. but just is there a way to quantify the exact dollar amount, you're seeing step-up in opex into the fourth quarter to kind of level set us as we start to then think about 2021?
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'd say it's -- so we're up sequentially from q3, q4 around $13.5 million. and i would have said if without the incremental investment, we would have been up about $20 million with improved volume. so it's probably $7 million, $8 million, incremental that's when you consider the items i mentioned earlier, on the call.
shawn harrison -- loop capital -- analyst
very helpful, ok.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's a same question.
shawn harrison -- loop capital -- analyst
okay. and then as a brief follow-up, just on the electrification side of the color jeff. maybe if you could speak to three years out its $50 of content now. i think we all expect range to go up, charging time to come down. what would that potentially -- and maybe other items you can add into the vehicle, take your content up to from $50 on average now to say three years out?
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so i think it's a question of the item that you pointed out. how quickly, our customers migrate toward, these harder to do applications. i believe strongly, that it's the direction that everything will go. and that requires the types of capabilities that we have. given the fact that we believe, on those vehicles today we have $50 of content based upon where we're sold in. obviously we're not stopping there. and we'll have a number of organic initiatives under way that will continue to drive that north.
and we'll also without question target other m&a-related activity that we'll continue to move that north of that number. and so, its large portals out there, in terms of the target opportunity, don't want to make a specific call on what our target content per vehicle is. but there's ample space if you will for us to pursue, that can continue to drive that in a very positive direction for us as a company.

operator
good morning, everyone, and welcome to the sensata technologies q3 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please also note, today's event is being recorded.
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference call over to mr. jacob sayer, vp of finance. sir, please go ahead.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, jamie, and good morning, everyone. i would like to welcome you to sensata's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. joining me on today's call are jeff cote, sensata's ceo and president, and paul vasington, sensata's chief financial officer. in addition to the financial results, press release we issued earlier today, we will be referencing a slide presentation during today's conference call. the pdf of this presentation can be downloaded from sensata's investor relations website. we'll post a replay of today's webcast shortly after the conclusion of today's call.
as we begin, i would like to reference sensata's safe harbor statement on slide 2. during this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the financial performance of the company that involve certain risks and uncertainties. the company's actual results may differ materially from the projections described in such statements. factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our forms 10-q and 10-k, as well as other subsequent filings with the sec.
on slide 3, we show some side of the gaap results for the third quarter of 2020. we encourage you to review our gaap financial statements in addition to today's presentation. most of the subsequent information that we will discuss during today's call will relate to our non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations of our gaap to non-gaap financial measures are included in our earnings release and in our presentation materials. the company provides details of its segment operating income on slides 10 and 11 of the presentation, which are the primary measures management uses to evaluate the business.
jeff will begin with key highlights of our business during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020. he will then provide an update on recent progress in our key smart & connected and electrification megatrend growth areas. paul will cover our detailed financials for the third quarter of 2020, including organic and market outgrowth by business unit, describe our financial and balance sheet progress in the quarter, and then provide select financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020. we will then take your questions after our prepared remarks.
now, i would like to turn the call over to sensata's ceo and president, jeff cote. thank you, jacob, and welcome, everyone. i'd like to start with some summary thoughts on our performances outlined on slide 4. the rebound from lockdowns and quarantines instituted by governments around the world was dramatic in our end markets during the third quarter. our revenue grew 37% in the quarter sequentially to $788.3 million, even higher than the updated financial guidance that we provided on september 8. it is a strong testament to the flexibility and resiliency of our manufacturing model and supply chain that we were able to capitalize on improving markets and support our customers as they rapidly ramped up production during the quarter. i'd like to recognize the agility and hard work of our entire team in achieving these results. we continue to deliver a strong market outgrowth. for the first nine months of 2020, we delivered 840 basis points of outgrowth in our heavy vehicle off-road business and 610 basis points in our automotive business. we now believe that the inventory built by our automotive customers in the first half of the year was consumed in the third quarter. we continued to be confident that we will sustain our market outgrowth for 2020 in the range of 600 basis points to 800 basis points for our heavy vehicle off-road and 400 basis points to 600 basis points for automotive, consistent with our long-term goals and supported by our higher levels of new business wins. during the quarter, we closed over $95 million of new business wins, bringing us to more than $320 million year-to-date. this pace is tracking ahead of last year and we believe our ability to close new business despite the disruptions of the pandemic or caused by the pandemic. it demonstrates the mission-critical nature of sensata's products. sensata today is in a very strong financial position. we generated a $100 million in free cash flow in the third quarter and $213 million year-to-date. and we have taken several steps to enhance our financial position and flexibility. we are aligning our cost structure to demand levels through a restructuring program and cost controls, expected to generate savings of $60 million to $65 million next year. during the quarter, we raised $750 million in unsecured debt toward 10-year note issued at historically low interest rate of 3.75%, lowering our overall cost of capital and extending the maturity of our capital structure. and we repaid our revolving line of credit, lowering our interest cost, giving improving financial markets and customer stability. finally, as i will discuss in more detail momentarily, we continue to invest in our megatrend growth initiatives and achieved a meaningful milestone in smart & connected. we recently reached agreement with the first fleet manager to install and operate our smart & connected suite of hardware and data services within their heavy commercial vehicles on a subscription basis, enabling this effort to move from trials to commercialization. additionally, our progress in our electrification megatrend continues to advance, not just in automotive and other electrified equipment, but also in areas of smart grid infrastructure. year-to-date, we have closed $140 million in electrification business wins. on slide 5, i want to provide an update on the meaningful milestone we achieved in our smart & connected initiatives. as we've shared before, we have been testing proof-of-concepts of our full stack technology offering with several leading fleet managers for the past year. recently, we signed our first commercial agreement in the smart & connected space with a top 25 north american fleet manager, demonstrating our ability to move from selling hardware to providing data insight. the fleet manager has opted for a full subscription model, paying for the hardware, maintenance, and support, and ongoing data analytic services on a monthly subscription basis per vehicle over the life of the agreement. while this initial award is small, we are planning to demonstrate the value we bring before fanning out across the remainder of their fleet. several other proof-of-concept trials are also moving forward and toward commercialization. and we are confident that others will understand the value of our solution. on this basis, we continue to believe that our smart & connected fleet management initiative opens $6 billion in addressable markets for sensata by 2030. and we are very pleased that we've reached a new stage of initial commercialization with this exciting solution. in the new equipment space, we expect several leading oems to join this program, expanding the $90 million in new business wins announced to date for smart & connected solutions. additionally, we are investing and expanding our technological know-how in smart & connected, moving beyond heavy commercial vehicles into light duty vehicle prognostics through third party collaboration, adding to the long-term opportunities ahead of us with our differentiated solutions. moving to slide 6. in electrification, we are expanding the solutions we provide for critical applications across all end markets we serve. during the third quarter, we closed another $32 million in electrification new business wins, bringing our year-to-date total to $140 million. these business wins demonstrate important ongoing progress against our long-term target to transform the electrification megatrend from opportunity to material revenue for sensata. this pace of business wins so far this year is much faster than last year despite the pandemic. and these wins are expected to generate significant revenue growth for sensata in the coming years. for example, we are expanding our capabilities in charging infrastructure and smart grid applications through third party collaborations. as overall electrification trends accelerate, the increased opportunities for our solutions across all end markets represents an estimated $6.5 billion addressable market for sensata by 2030. to date, we have closed electrification new business wins with some of the largest and the most innovative automotive oems around the globe. in our core markets, the average content on battery electric vehicle now materially exceeds that of the average combustion -- internal combustion vehicle. sensata generates approximately $50 in content in these battery electric vehicles as compared to $38 to $40 on average in internal combustion engine vehicles, representing a significant growth opportunity for the company as electrified vehicles increase and become a larger portion of the vehicle fleet worldwide. sensata has the strongest offering in this segment for longer range and shorter charge time electric vehicles. all evidence indicates that this is where the industry is heading. while the automotive space will be a large beneficiary of electrified megatrends, the projected growth from widening electrification should benefit all of our end markets. we are pleased with our demonstrated progress against our megatrend initiatives, and intend to continue these efforts to expand sensata's applications for these areas organically through third party collaboration and through acquisition. we see numerous opportunities to utilize our strong financial position and significant cash flow to meaningfully expand our addressable markets through serial bolt-on acquisitions within the megatrend areas. these acquisitions should bring unique offerings that position us to grow quickly in large and fast growing markets. we continue to believe that investments in electrification and smart & connected will further our end market diversification, increase our long-term growth rate, and provide important competitive advantages, as these trends transform our world. i'd now like to turn the call over to paul.
paul vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jeff. key highlights for the third quarter as shown on slide 8 include revenue of $788.3 million, a decrease of 7.2% in the third quarter of 2019, organic revenue decreased 7.5% largely due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, changes in foreign currency increased revenue by 0.3%, and sequentially from the second quarter, reported revenue increased 36.7%, reflecting a substantial rebound in our markets.
adjusted operating income with $154.8 million, a decrease of 22.4% compared to the third quarter of 2019. primarily due to lower revenues, lower productivity in our manufacturing operations, revenue mix, and higher incentive compensation aligned to improved financial performance, partially offset by savings from cost reduction programs. adjusted net income was $103.6 million, a decrease of 28.3% compared to the third quarter of 2019. adjusted eps was $0.66 in the third quarter, a decrease of 26.7% compared to the prior year quarter.
on september 8, we updated our financial guidance for the third quarter based on shipments to-date, our order book, and market information available at that time. throughout the quarter, we saw continued strengthening, especially within our north american and european automotive end markets, which enabled us to exceed a higher revenue in earnings guidance that we provided in september.
now, i will discuss our performance by end market in the third quarter of 2020 as outlined on slide 9. overall, we reported an organic revenue decline of 7.5% year-on-year against an overall end market decline of approximately 12.3%, representing market outgrowth of 480 basis points for the company. our industrial business decreased 2.2% organically as global industrial end markets remain weak. strong growth in factory automation and medical equipment, which includes sensors, ventilator manufacturers, mitigated some of the market decline.
our aerospace business decreased 24.4% organically from reduced oem production and lower air traffic which has negatively impacted our aerospace aftermarket business. new product launches primarily in the defense market partially offset a significant aerospace market decline. our heavy vehicle off-road business posted an organic revenue decrease of 7.8%, represent an even 60 basis points of outgrowth as compared to 16.4% end market contraction. our china on-road truck business continued to post better than expected growth from accelerated adoption of ns6 emissions regulations. while our china on-road business grew in the third quarter, we experienced substantial declines in both europe and the america as production levels in these geographies decline year-over-year.
year-to-date, we have delivered 840 basis points of outgrowth in a heavy vehicle off-road business. our automotive business posted an organic revenue decrease of 7.9%. our automotive production was down 4.1% during the quarter, production ramp rapidly through the quarter creating challenges to serve all the demands that was presented to us. this drove customers to work down inventory from their supply chain which had a negative 6.7% impact on revenue.
against that backdrop, our automotive business market outgrowth of 290 basis points as expected, led by continued new product launches in emissions, electrification, and safety related applications and system. year-to-date, we have delivered automotive outgrowth of 610 basis points as compared with our long-term target range of 400 basis points to 600 basis points.
now, i'd like to comment on the performance of our two business segments in the third quarter of 2020. i'll start with performance sensing on slide 10. our performance sensing business reported revenues of $508.9 million, a decrease of 7.6% compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the positive impact from foreign currency of 0.3%, performance sensing organic revenue decreased 7.9%. on a sequential basis, performance sensing revenue grew a dramatic 51% in the second quarter as oem customers ramped up production through the quarter to replace production lost for the prior quarter shutdowns. sequentially from the second quarter, our automotive business reported an increase of 59% and our heavy vehicle and off-road business reported an increase of 26%, demonstrating the strength of the market rebound.
performance sensing operating income, with a $151.6 million, a decrease of 10.9% as compared to the same quarter last year with operating margin of 26.1%. the decrease in segment operating income was due primarily to lower revenues and also contributed to productivity headwinds and manufacturing, an unfavorable revenue mix, somewhat offset by savings from restructuring and other cost reduction actions. sequentially, performance sensing generated incremental margin of 46% on a higher revenue despite the profit and margin headwind caused by second quarter temporary cost reductions not continuing.
as shown on slide 11, sensing solutions reported revenues of $207.4 million in the third quarter of 2020, the decrease of 6.2% as compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the positive impact from foreign currency of 0.2%, sensing solutions organic revenue decreased 6.4%. on a sequential basis, sensing solutions' revenue grew 8% in the second quarter as oem customers ramped up production through the quarter. sequentially from the second quarter, our industrial business reported an increase of 7% and our aerospace business reported an increase of 17%.
sensing solutions operating income was $58.2 million, a decrease of 18.6% from the same quarter last year with operating margin of 28.1%. the decrease in segment operating income was primarily due to lower revenues and also contribute headwinds in manufacturing, an unfavorable revenue mix, somewhat offset by savings from restructuring and cost reduction actions. sequentially, sensing solutions generated incremental margins of 15% on the higher revenue which reflects the impact of second quarter temporary cost reductions not continuing, an unfavorable revenue mix within the segment.
corporate and other costs, not included in segment operating income, was $61 million in the third quarter of 2020. excluding charges added back to our non-gaap results, corporate and other costs were $53.4 million. an increase of $12.8 million from prior quarter, due to higher global incentive compensation costs aligned to our improving financial performance and higher megatrend investments, somewhat offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives.
items added back to our non-gaap corporate operating expenses include restructuring related and other costs and financing and other transaction costs. megatrend investments were $8.8 million during the third quarter, an increase of three million from the prior quarter. we currently expect approximately $33 million in megatrend related spent this year in order to design, develop differentiated solutions for our customers that should generate substantial long-term growth further our end market diversification. historic operating profit and operating margins on slide 10 and 11 reflect the reclassification of megatrend costs from the operating segments into corporate and other.
slide 13 shows sensata's third quarter 2020 non-gaap results. adjusted operating income was down 22.4% compared to the same quarter last year and adjusted operating margin decreased 390 basis points to 19.6% which is still near the top of our peer group and represents an attractive operating income margin profile, especially concerning how the pandemic has affected operating conditions.
the decrease in adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income largely reflect the lower revenues we have experienced during the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and the related operating and productivity challenges. we took action early during the pandemic to align our cost structure to a lower demand profile, while continuing to invest in megatrends that are shaping our markets to be able to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
incentive compensation costs are also rising and are aligned to increasing our income as our end markets continue to recover the low point in the second quarter of this year. adjusted net income declined 28.3% compared to the same quarter last year. the decrease reflects lower adjusted operating income, higher interest expense related to our bond issuance in the third quarter of this year, and higher taxes due to jurisdictional profit mix.
finally, adjusted eps was $0.66, down $0.24 or 26.7% as compared to the third quarter of 2019, as a decrease in adjusted net income was partially offset by the benefit of share repurchases and intervening periods.
on slide 14, we highlight the strong financial and balance sheet management of sensata during the pandemic that has resulted in improved liquidity. during the third quarter, we generated $100 million free cash flow, representing a 96% conversion rate of adjusted net income. this brings free cash generation of $213 million year-to-date representing a nearly 100% conversion rate. last quarter, we announced a series of actions to structurally reduce our semi-variable costs by about 10% to align our cost structure to expected lower demand levels and to achieve expected $60-65 million in savings from these actions.
we achieved the targeted seven million savings from these programs in the third quarter and expect to achieve $11 million to $12 million in savings during the fourth quarter. during the third quarter, we took advantage of historically low interest rates to raise $750 million 10-year unsecured notes offer, explains the majority of sensata's debt profile and lowering our cost for capital.
given improving end market conditions and strengthening the financial markets, we repaid our revolving line of credit we had drawn in april. sensata's net debt ebitda was 3.6 times at the end of september, slightly above our target operating range of 2.5 to 3.5 times.
our capital expenditure guidance for the full year 2020 is now a $110 million to $120 million, $10 million lower than prior guidance based on the benefits of continued capital controls. over the past nine months, we have taken significant actions to strengthen our financial position. with improving economic and business conditions, we are focusing on meaningfully expanding our addressable market to small, bolt-on acquisitions, and partnerships and strengthen our position within both our existing business segment and our growing megatrend initiatives.
these acquisitions as well as partnerships and third party collaborations should bring unique capabilities and offerings and position us well to intersect, large and fast growing markets, by way of example, building on the future electronics acquisition that we announced last quarter. during the third quarter, we signed a partnership agreement under digital radar object detection for heavy vehicles to expand our heavy vehicle safety offerings. in february 2021, we'll evaluate an early redemption of our 6.25% notes due 2026 depending on market financial conditions at that time, and our stock repurchase program remains on hold.
we are providing financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020 as shown on slide 15. our guidance assumes our customers and we keep our manufacturing facilities open despite resurgence in covid-19 pandemic and potential government responses to try and prevent the spread of the virus. as a result of improving economic condition and better stability and strength, the customer order patterns for the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect to generate revenue between $810 million and $815 million, representing a reported revenue decrease between 4% and flat year-on-year and reported revenue increase between 3% and 8% sequentially from the third quarter.
at the midpoint of guidance, we expect the foreign currency will increase revenues year-over-year by approximately $7.5 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency, we expect to report an organic revenue decrease of 5% to 1% in the fourth quarter. our current fill rate is approximately 96% of the revenue guidance midpoint for the fourth quarter. based on our third quarter experience, we see our fill as a more reliable indicator of revenue in the coming quarter. we also continue to monitor leading economic indicators in third party forecasts to help form our view of future market demand.
we expect to report adjusted operating income between $160 million and $176 million. on the bottom line, we expect to report adjusted net income between $100 million and $140 million, which would represent a decline of 29% to 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. we expect to report adjusted eps between $0.64 and $0.72 which includes a $0.01 positive impact foreign currency at the guidance midpoint.
in summary, sensata has delivered strong financial performance for the first nine months of 2020 despite the challenging environment, and we expect to continue this into the fourth quarter as demonstrated by the financial guidance we're providing today. driving this performance is our continuous ability to achieve our secular market outgrowth targets including 400 to 600 basis points for our automotive business, 600 to 800 basis points for heavy vehicle business.
now let me turn the call back to jeff for closing comments. jeff.
jeffrey cote -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, paul. i'll wrap up with a few key messages on slide 16 before we go to q&a. sensata has responded very well to the rapid upswing in many of our end markets, demonstrating the flexibility of our manufacturing base and the resiliency of our supply chain, enabling us to capitalize on the improving end markets. our ability to respond quickly to shifting demand positions us very well as a trusted source for our customers.
we are delivering attractive end market outgrowth, we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver this end market outgrowth for full year 2020 and expect to maintain this performance into the future based upon our strong new business wins. we continue to look to deliver strong free cash flow which demonstrates sensata's resilient financial model. we continue to invest in megatrends and other growth initiatives that are opening up large and rapidly growing opportunities for sensata across all of our end markets. and we are making excellent progress as evidenced by the first commercial fleet adoption for our smart & connected fleet initiative and by that $140 million in electrification new business wins so far this year.
in addition, we continue to believe that the overall market environment may provide interesting opportunities to further strengthen our portfolio through strategically important, value creating acquisitions. we are pursuing technology collaborations and partnerships with third parties to expand our technological capabilities and accelerate our megatrend commercialization. and finally, as we emerge from this recessionary period caused by the pandemic, while we may not return to peak margin rates in the short term, we do expect to deliver industry-leading margins for our shareholders, while increasing investments in our growth opportunities and in our people.
now, i'd like to turn the call back to jacob.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, jeff. given the large number of listeners on the call, please limit yourself to one question each and a follow-up. if we have time, we'll circle back to the group for further questions. jamie, please assemble the q&a roster.

yes, thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question is from scott davis from melius research. please go ahead.
scott davis -- melius research -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
hey, scott.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
hey, scott.
scott davis -- melius research -- analyst
good morning. the megatrends spend, the $50 million to $55 million, should we think about that as kind of the new normal as a long-term run rate? or is that more likely to grow with revenues over time? or is it more of kind of couple years, you got to catch-up and then it settles down a little bit or just how are you guys thinking about that number?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes, it's a great question, scott. it's going to be success-driven and opportunity-driven. and so given the progress that we experienced in 2020, we believe that that activity earned incremental investment. i would tell you that we will monitor it closely. we're not approaching this from a standpoint of we budgeted that money and that's how we're going to spend it. we'll monitor our progress very closely, quarter-to-quarter, against the initiatives and the objectives that we've set out. that allows for that spend, we understand our responsibility to make sure that we're looking after long-term growth of the company. and so, right now, that's what we're planning to spend in 2020. but we'll continue to provide huge amounts of transparency to that spend and the success that we're able to achieve based upon that spend to our shareholders and adjust accordingly.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, scott.
operator
the next question is from craig hettenbach from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
craig hettenbach -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks, jeff for all the color on the ev front. i guess just starting there, you mentioned a number of new components, specific to evs, be it around braking, e-motors, just curious kind of where do you think you have seen the most traction in some of these applications? and then, i can see through the breadth of the oems you announced that it's broad-based, but just any particular region right now, where you feel like you're seeing the best traction for evs?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yeah. craig, so just to set the context, obviously, i think everybody is feeling this, a trend associated with electrification driven by government regulation and consumer pull is a trend that's accelerating it. and we've observed that for several years here and made sure we've invested in it.
the point that we wanted to make very clear in our comments, is that a lot of the content we have on combustion vehicles ports over. so it isn't as though there is a discontinuity and complete loss of all of the opportunities that we see on the combustion side, a half or more of that content applies in an ev environment. but we've also invested organically in e-motor, positions and others -- position sensors and others, but we've invested inorganically gigavac, high-voltage contactors, lithium balance with battery management systems.
the trend in terms of evs, i think that we're seeing clearly is more pronounced in europe and in china. but again, you have to look at the segmentation of the electric vehicle. in china, they are more lower-end vehicles, in terms of the penetration, and we don't believe long-term. that's where the market will go -- will go toward longer range, shorter-charge time vehicles. that's the future of electric vehicles in our view, and that's the target market that we're going after.
and we're seeing the trend of nbo opportunities pretty globally. the slide that you saw in terms of the number of customers that we're engaging with is very broad. and we're doing that on purpose because candidly, we believe that our customers have an opportunity to really continue to grow here. but the true winners in terms of the market are unknown. so we're casting the net very wide to make sure that we're serving all of the customers that are making those products.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, craig.
operator
the next question is from wamsi mohan from bank of america. please go ahead.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, thank you. jeff, the drag from semi shortages on margin, is that a function of higher prices of components that you're alluding to in the first half? or is there a function of lower production that you anticipate? and is first half basically a reasonable way to think about this at the moment? why can't that sort of last longer? and if i could, jeff, just given the importance of this electrification trends that you have alluded to, if you could just maybe give us some sense of how you expect first sensata, the split of this to be in maybe a two-year or five-year timeframe between the opportunities from a heavy vehicle standpoint versus autos, that'll be great. thank you.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
sure. so, wamsi, first on the semi question, it's -- the cost is a combination of pricing and increased logistics costs, given the short supply chain. so everything's expedited freight, to make sure that we can keep things open and running for our customers. and again, this is a pretty broad-based industry trend.
i would note that although the semi shortage, electronic shortage is most acute, the reality is the supply chains across the world, not just with sensata, i think we're doing a great job managing through this, but very -- on a very global basis or very broad basis are stretched thing right now with the increased demand and the challenges associated with capacity, with keeping plants open, with labor shortages and covid-related risk. but i think that, we have as a company demonstrated really strong resilience there.
on your question associated with electrification, our view is that clearly near-term, the penetration of electrification will be more broad in light vehicle. but we're not stopping there. we noted in our prepared comments that lithium balance brought the opportunity to be able to go after heavy vehicle and bus applications as well. and our view is that, more in the bus, i think will become electrified, but in heavy vehicle, the power requirements will take a longer period of time to migrate toward evs. but we're focused on those markets, because we think that it although behind light vehicle, it will happen over time. and we want to make sure that we have an offering to be able to serve that.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, wamsi.
operator
the next question is from mark delaney from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
mark delaney -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, good morning. thanks very much for taking the questions. i was hoping if you could speak more on lithium balance? and i understand as a company you've known for some time, but maybe talk a little bit more on their technology. and after having worked with them, what led you to want to complete the acquisition. and if you could also maybe speak to the financial dimensions of lithium balance? what kind of revenue and earnings impact we should expect starting out and perhaps other margin profile, lithium balance may look longer-term compared to the corporate average?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
sure. so originally, about two years ago, we acquired 25% of this company. we saw the trend toward electrification accelerating. you know that we had an inorganic -- or excuse me, an organic effort around wireless battery management. so we reached out to them to build-out our capability more broadly on battery management, which obviously has a hardware component, but has a pretty significant software component as well. and so that -- that was the original view of the synergy between the two companies.
clearly, given where electrification has gone, as the content opportunity on wired battery management, we pursued the acquisition of the balance of this company, it's a small business, but it has great potential market size of over $500 million in -- by mid-2030. so it's an exciting opportunity for us in terms of expanding beyond just components into that space.
and as we've highlighted, we had early, strong success in terms of a win with our heavy vehicle customer, way beyond just a component but around battery management. so we're excited about that.
the margin profile is pretty consistent. we often talk about the fact that as we go beyond a central component into systems, it may not be at sensata margins, but it will be differentiated margin, and it will help growth for the company. and so yet to be determined as that business grows, it's a small business today, but as that business grows, we're very confident that we'll have differentiated margins and when it becomes a bigger part of the business we'll be more specific in terms of the margin profile that we're experiencing there.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
hopefully, that helps. thanks, mark.

the next question is from samik chatterjee from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
bharat daryani -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. this is bharat on for samik. so if i could just ask a question on the content gain, you're coming off europe very strong content in and outperformance in 2020. so as we look to 2021, how should we think about the trajectory of that? and in terms of key drivers as we look into 2021, i think in 2020, you were benefiting from china emission standards and that being a big part of the story. so in terms of drivers, is it going to be more toward ev story in 2021. how is that going to change? any color there would be helpful. thank you.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
sure. so just as a summary, i think we've quoted some of these statistics, but fourth quarter companywide 770 basis points of market outgrowth for the full-year of 600 basis points. so at or above what we've quoted as being the target range is, and that's four years running now, right. so the thing that's really important about the outgrowth is that because we're long-cycle business, we get a lot of visibility to do this. remember, during 2020, we called out third quarter that we're going to see a little bit of depth in our outgrowth. and that's exactly what happened. it tends to be a little lumpy, but we're confident in the long-term growth given the engagement we have with the customers, but most importantly, the mbo wins that we have and the pipeline of those which are driving engineering work for ultimate launches.
it's very broad-based, right. so it's no one thing that's creating incredible opportunity in terms of content growth. but as we've talked about it, it's the drive around regulation globally. it's the drive around consumer preference globally, which drives customer product portfolio roadmaps that we engage with them on to make sure that we're helping them, whether it be increased fuel efficiency on a combustion engine, or longer range on an electric vehicle, or safer application in an ag equipment. there are literally dozens, if not hundreds of drivers. but there are some chunky ones, implementation of tpms in different jurisdictions around the world or rollout of our exhaust gas recirculation applications. they tend to fan overtime, but there are dozens of trends that are allowing us to be confident in that trend long-term.

the next question is from matt sheerin from stifel. please go ahead.
matthew sheerin -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
yes, thanks. good morning, everyone. jeff, i just wanted to ask concerning your full-year guidance, which we certainly appreciate, and as you know, several of your peers have been reluctant to guide beyond q1, just because of lack of visibility and a lot of moving parts. so wanted to ask about your visibility, are you getting a better sense of order flow from your customers? and does your revenue guide contemplate hiccups in terms of production at your customers, any issues beyond the operating costs that you talked about, but in terms of topline being impacted by the chip shortages?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yeah. so we had pretty good discussions internally regarding full year guidance. you know that in our business, we have really good long-term visibility of revenue, certainly within a quarter, we quote our fill rate 93% higher than we normally are in terms of our fill rate in the quarter. but even beyond the quarter, we get a pretty good deal.
the supply chain shortages have resulted in a situation where we've really doubled down on the engagement with customers because in some instances, we've placed longer term orders on the supply chain and therefore we've gone to our customers and asked for longer-term visibility and commitment from them. so that adds to our confidence.
but overall, we've factored in some conservatism on the full year given that things may happen. you'll know -- i think you all know that ihs brought down some of the full year numbers from a light vehicle standpoint given supply chain shortages. and we're following along and using similar expectations on that. clearly if there's a major disruption, major lockdowns, we'll need to relook at it. but based upon what we're seeing right now, we feel very confident demand situation and you highlighted it. i think the bigger concern is broader supply chains, both at our customers, there's some other suppliers in within sensata. we're going to focus on what we can control within our own business to make sure that we deliver for them the extent there's demand.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance

the next question is from amit daryanani from evercore. please go ahead.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. i guess, jeff, you touched on seeing incrementally better, attractive m&a opportunities. so i was hoping you would perhaps just remind us how do you think about m&a in terms of the focus area deal sizes? and really how much leverage are we comfortable running with on our balance sheet?
and if you can also just touch on the second topic the megatrend initiatives, i appreciate the opex clarity you folks are providing, but is there any way to think about how much revenue contribution you get in calendar '21 from those?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
sure. let me try to hit on several topics. so let me get on m&a first and then i can come back to the megatrend net revenue contribution. so on the m&a front, we absolutely believe that there will be opportunities, the pipeline is quite full. our capital allocation process will continue to be very balanced, but [indecipherable] associated with m&a and buybacks. but right now, the focus is on m&a to drive the strategy which will drive accretive growth for the company as we pursue opportunities in these fast growing market segments that we've identified electrification and on smart & connected. and so we'll continue to keep you updated on that, but that is the focus area right now.
in terms of leverage, we're comfortable with the same range of leverage. we've talked about more bolt-on acquisition. and we're very comfortable with the leverage range that we've given, done a lot in terms of earnings growth that drives that leverage down, which we're pleased about, but that's the range that we're quoting right now.
in terms of the megatrend, we'll keep you posted. i mean, we talked about the revenue that's generated today in our automotive business associated with electrification of 5% of that revenue, but only 3% of the fleet is coming from electrified vehicles. so we were very confident in the tailwind, we'll experience as that trend occurs, and we will provide some more transparency in terms of the revenue that's being generated associated with both the electrification trend but also the smart and connected trend as they become bigger components of the overall business.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance

the next question is from steven fox from fox advisors. please go ahead.
steven fox -- fox advisor -- analyst
thanks. good morning. jeff, i'm just curious, you've talked a lot about electrification, can you just obviously, your ice programs aren't going away overnight. can you sort of talk about your outgrowth prospects there? and then how you manage sort of the shift in your business transferring from an ice-dominated business to electrification without that's hurting the overall revenues? thanks.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes. so you said it right. the combustion engine is not growing away right now. but many companies have made some very bold statements. gm's announcement that they won't make combustion engines beyond 2035. this trend has accelerated and we're prepared for it, it's a positive thing for us.
but having said that, you point out a very important point, there is continued content growth on combustion engines, because between now and 2035, there are mandates regarding fuel efficiency and other co2 emissions, and other safety-related requirements that will drive content, will continue to drive content. so we're thinking about that in terms of our reallocation, we're thinking about that in terms of which opportunities we pursue, but we'll kind of support our customers in terms of their roadmaps and help them migrate along this curve from combustion engines to electrified platforms.
so, again, not just in auto, in hvor, in industrial applications, we'll do the same thing. and they make up a big portion of the nbos that we won, a $180 million of our $465 million relate to electrification, but the balance relate to other application safety and missions-related application. so it's been still a meaningful part of the business and we're going to focus on it, manage through this transition in a very thoughtful way along with our customers.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance

the next question is from nik todorov from longbow. please go ahead.
nikolay todorov -- longbow research -- analyst
yes, thanks. good morning, everyone. guys, i think relatively last quarter it looks like megatrends investment outlook for 2021 have increased. if that is true, maybe can you talk what's changing there? are you may be seeing acceleration in the smart & connected, given the quicker turnaround of those programs. and i think, jeff, you talked about those quotes. and just related to the smart & connected, is that $45 million per year for five customers, that's about $9 million to $10 million per program for the customer. is that the average size and how should we think about smart & connected wins? thanks.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes. so the trend -- excuse me megatrend spend, we ended the fourth quarter at $8 million -- i think. $8.8 million of megatrend-related spend. so clearly an uptick supported by the progress that we're seeing both on smart & connected and on electrification. i think all of our callers and all of our investors would agree that if these trends are just inevitable, and we need to make sure that we're investing heavily and that's always an incredibly difficult balance for a long-cycle business and we take it very seriously.
we're investing shareholder dollars today in future revenue opportunities. and so we wanted to again provide the transparency on that. so you don't confuse the core business and the results of the core business, but it is an area that we believe makes sense to continue investing in. i mentioned to scott earlier, our spend will be successful in market opportunity driven, and we'll keep you updated in terms of the progress.
the specific question regarding the annual contract value. the $45 million, it clearly depends on size of fleet, right. not all fleets are similar in size. and when you're talking about building out the applications and serving up data across smaller fleets and larger fleets, the annual contract value could vary pretty dramatically across those. and you can imagine we're starting with top 25. so that makes sense in terms of focus for us. but it's a meaningful opportunity that we're excited about. we're looking forward to giving you additional updates in terms of our progress as we go forward.

the next question is from david williams from loop capital. please go ahead.
david williams -- loop capital -- analyst
hey, good morning, and congrats on the quarter and appreciate you letting me ask a question here. just wanted to kind of dig into the -- maybe the geographic trends in terms of the ev dollar content, and how that differs may be in china, where you have a lower end vehicle versus maybe an north american electric vehicle? any sense in terms of the 20% uplift, how that would maybe break down between geographies?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes, you've hit it perfectly. the reality is we're going to have lower content on vehicles that are lower range, longer charge time vehicles. so if you think of the class of vehicle that has an 80, 100 mile range, where we have less content on those versus the average of 50, right, which we've quoted 20% uplift from our average combustion engine environment.
but in china, for instance, where there are long-range vehicles, there's more content. so it tends to be less about the geographic location, it's more about the type of vehicles that were being designed into, and the content in them. obviously, when you go outside of light vehicle into heavy vehicle applications or other bus and on-road truck type applications, the content goes up much more dramatically.
and so -- and it's well on energy storage and other applications, when you start to think about components, but also battery -- wired battery management systems, the content opportunity really is significantly higher, not at the volumes of light vehicle clearly. but we are in a fortunate position to be able to leverage the scale capability we get in that high volume, light vehicle market to those other market segments that are growing very rapidly as well.

the next question is from christopher glynn from oppenheimer. please go ahead.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you. good morning. just going back to slide 9 again for a sec, the oem market of $1 billion got a pretty robust $100 million wins to-date, in terms of the fleet market opportunity of $6 billion, just curious to hear a little more about that bridge? is that a focus for further m&a and a focus -- a substantial part of the megatrend investment?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes, absolutely. clearly, there's a much bigger market in the retrofit world. but this was born out of our oem relationships, right. so as oem started to implement tire pressure monitoring, which was a legislated requirement, or regulated requirement, we realized and our oem customers realized that you needed a vehicle area network to capture that data, and also to allow for a seamless truck to trailer link.
and the smart & connected initiative, and then we went, started researching it and engaging with fleet managers, because there's a whole bunch of vehicles out there, whole bunch of logistics equipment out there that is in need of essentially becoming iot. you're getting it smarter to become safer and more efficient. so this is an area along with electrification that will continue to focus from a inorganic standpoint, but as well it's a big chunk of our megatrend spend from an organic standpoint as well.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, chris.
operator
the next question is from brian johnson from barclays. please go ahead.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
yes, thank you. i just want to talk a little bit more about slide 7, and if you kind of think about the content, obviously, the argument you'd be making there is 20% content. so if you put uplift, i assume that translates the -- whatever content is in the engine block and transmission itself going away. but i think as you kind of think about the ev specific components, what's your expectation for market share, and profit pool in those ev specific components, versus the ice components that are being carried over?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes, great. great question. so let me start by saying that the 20% uplift that we've quoted is not -- we're not done. so the story hasn't been written yet in terms of all the needs that oems will have as they rollout more of these vehicles. so we're clearly aiming for more than 20% uplift, i just want to start there, both through organic efforts, more success in terms of commercial activity, but also through inorganic efforts. so more to come on that, but we're going to keep at it.
in terms of market share, the competitors that we see in these markets, they're different, but they're -- the dynamics aren't different, right. so there tends to be, three to five capable competitors in each of these applications that we're talking about, high voltage contactors as an example. we don't see the typical competitors that we see in a pressure environment, but we see the same competitors, it's the panasonic's, it's the ge has a high voltage contactor offering. hongfa is a china opportunity or china company. lsis is a korean supplier of high voltage contactors. so the dynamics and the competitive nature are very similar. they're really hard to do mission-critical application. so you tend not to see hundreds of competitors.
so longwinded way of saying we would expect similar market shares. we always aim for number one or number two slot in the market. and i think that we're heading certainly in that direction. from a profit pool standpoint, commodity level very similar margin -- margins, higher asp, but similar margins that we would see in our other component business, which is different from what i quoted earlier, when you start to get higher in the stack, if you will, in battery management systems, we will continue to believe we'll see differentiated margins, but perhaps not at the same level of margin that we would see there in the content side of our product offerings.

the next question is from jim suva from citi. please go ahead.
jim suva -- citi -- analyst
thank you. just one question, jeff, the chip shortage how long do you think it will last? do you have visibility into that or like when the auto production slows down in july/august, will that allow a time for kind of raising to catch-up? or do you think it will be resolved before them?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
that's a tough question. right now, the expectation is that, depending on how demand from both, it's not just an auto phenomenon, it's broader demand for chips, right. so as that evolves during the year, the hope is that second half of the year will be less challenging than we're experiencing right now based upon that demand, the capacity profile that exists.
summer shutdowns, if they do have shutdowns in the automotive space always provide a little bit of breather for folks to catch-up a little bit. but, our expectation is similar to what i think you've quoted that second half of the year, we'll get a little bit of breather in terms of some of these shortages, lot of things driving that as well the expectation of vaccine rollout a little bit of flexibility on that front will help us well as the year progresses.

luke junk -- baird -- analyst
good morning. jeff, i was wondering if you could give us a rough breakdown as the $50 million to $55 million excuse me in megatrend spending in 2021. if i remember right, it was a little bit more weighted to smart & connected in 2020 as we look at the incremental spend here, can you just give some color on what you're leaning into?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes, it's still leaning in on the smart & connected from an investment and organic investment standpoint. it is a little bit higher in the electrification side than it was in 2020 though. so not quite at parity, but certainly the majority on the smart & connected side and the smaller portion on the electrification side.

the next question is from joseph spak from rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
joseph spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks very much. i know regarding free cash flow for '21 is 85% conversion, which i think is at the higher end of what you've historically targeted and capex is clearly going higher. my guess is, there's probably a little bit of working capital investment to support the sales snapback. so did something changed there, are there additional efficiencies? or do you have sort of a new target on conversion?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
paul, do you want to grab this one?
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think you described it well. we do expect to be more efficient on the working capital side, so big improvement on inventory this year. and we've been struggling with inventory days in the last couple of years and finally cracked the code here. and i think we're on a much better trajectory going forward. we're going to have to invest a little bit to support to grow. but all in all, i think we should expect conversion better than you saw in the last few years, which was in the high 70s, low 80s would be a good outcome and what we're just paying for 2021.

the next question is from david kelley from jefferies. please go ahead.
david kelley -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning, guys. i was hoping you could provide some more color on the 5% oem inventory impact in autos, just going back to the third quarter, there was a discussion of channel inventory normalization. and first, we were curious as to the drivers of the incremental work done in q4, but also how you see channel inventory today would be great?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes. so it was an interesting year, q1 inventory build in the supply chain given how quickly demand drops, they weren't able to shut the status off quick enough and they built inventory. and then clearly in the second half, there was a depletion of inventories. as a data point, north american automotive vehicle inventory was 48 days ending the year. i can't remember the last time we saw 48 days. data we experience and talked with folks who are buying vehicles or vehicles we're selling at less price.
so there's a higher demand than they can make vehicles right now. and that's having the impact of tightening up the supply chain. but then certainly the north american vehicle inventory is a very valid data point. and it's consistent with what we're hearing from customers in terms of what they're seeing in their inventory more broadly in the supply chain.

the next question is from michael filatov from berenberg capital markets. please go ahead.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. just a quick question on the vehicle area network. you guys say that, the first rollout on small number of trucks and trailers will use the tpms as the first sensing application. what can we see as the opportunity beyond tpms in that smart & connected universe? what other sensing applications do you see on those platforms, and maybe what the content opportunity to grow from on an annual basis since it is supposed to be the saas type business model?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes. so we've talked about two other parameters that are key care-abouts for fleet managers that we're focused on from an organic standpoint. and that includes load management. so understanding not only total load in the trailer, but also the distribution of that load for safe -- distribution of the load for safe travel.
and the second area is around wheel and sensing. so that's essentially monitoring wheel bearings to prevent downtime on the road. and so short of doing regularly scheduled maintenance on that in addition to doing regularly scheduled maintenance, understanding what's going on, on the wheel and to predict potential failure of a bearing is another area.
we announced last year that we had a product that we developed in conjunction with hendrickson to be able to bring that sensing parameter to market. those are the three that we're starting with. but as you can imagine, once you have a captive piece of equipment with your vehicle area network on it, with a connection to the cloud, with a network that can analyze data, the opportunity is pretty broad in terms of adding either other sensata sensors acquired capabilities, or third-party collaboration to bring more sensors to enrich the data profile of what we're offering here. so more and more to come, and obviously every time you add more data, right, you start with adding a sensor to collect that data. you bring it to the cloud, the value proposition increases for the fleet. so that the pricing would be commensurate with that expanded offer.

robert jamieson -- cowen -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is robert in for joe. thanks for taking my question. i just had a quick one on hvor, i just want to dig into your expectations for 2021. i see you have market of six now to growth of like 600 bps, 800 bps. just wondered what's going to be driving that outgrowth this year as you need change from like china vi emissions, do you see any other opportunities there, and then any sense of like geographic puts and takes that where you expect to outperform more?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes. so it feels really good to be in an hvor market that has turned the corner on growth, right. this has been a market that started declining way before covid hit. middle of 2019, it started to decline, and in terms of just market downturn. we've been dealing through that. in the first quarter of this year, we're starting to see a turnaround on many of those. certainly across the overall market, in the first quarter, we're expecting about 15% market growth. and as you look at the full year across the globe, where that tapers a little bit, a little bit less, but we should call it 6% plus market growth in across the world.
now where we're seeing geographic impact? clearly, in first quarter, we're seeing it everywhere other than european on-road. in the full year, interestingly, what has been a big driver of growth, which is china, will start to turn down and will start to get into more difficult comps. but all the other markets, north america and european on-road, ag, construction, all positive market comparisons 2021 versus '20 and china would be down a little bit versus 2020.

joseph meares -- truist -- analyst
hey, guys, good morning. this is joe on for will. thanks for taking my question. acknowledging that this is far from a normal demand environment, and just -- it looks like the q1 guide is roughly mid-single-digits below normal seasonal, is that just a pulling from q4? are there some conservatism baked in there? and then if you could just comment on inventory levels specifically at tier 1 customers? thanks.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes. it's a good question, but i'm little bit at a loss. i mean, things have been so volatile. it's hard to sort of look at normal seasonality. i would say that, clearly we're seeing some good growth in terms of first quarter versus first quarter of last year. but the seasonality aspects of it in terms of how that demand would normally play out is a little bit harder, honestly to be able to speak to. and as we sort of get to a little bit more consistent trend, perhaps we'll get back to that more normal seasonal trends that we would see in the business.

the next question is from rod lache from wolfe research. please go ahead.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi, everybody. i had another ev question. you mentioned that the ev specific content is on a longer range faster charge vehicles, which makes sense given the gigavac and other technologies you have. obviously a lot of those are higher-end luxury, like the tesla's and the taycan's of the world. i was just wondering if you're seeing a similar 20% uplift in content on the high volume mass market vehicles with longer range that are rolling out like the id3s of the world, are those that are being contemplated where do you see a similar content and margin opportunity for those mass market cars?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
yes. so i think we do right in. so i don't always attribute long range to luxury. i think that there is some segmentation that's occurring there where you're going to see more vehicles go to long-range, even though they may not be historically considered to be a luxury vehicle. but i understand your point on that. but we don't see any specific variation in terms of mass market, in terms of content. clearly, some of the companies that are producing larger vehicles or larger numbers of vehicles, you know that we are suppliers to them, right. you saw our list on there. and so we're -- that's the purpose of including the customer list is to accentuate the broad engagement that we have across the market with many of the, if not all of the oems that are producing electric vehicles.

as we begin, i would like to reference sensata's safe harbor statement on slide 2. during this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the financial performance of the company that involve certain risks and uncertainties. the company's actual results may differ materially from the projections described in such statements. factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our forms 10-q and 10-k as well as other subsequent filings with the sec.
on slides 3 and 4, we show sensata's gaap results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. we encourage you to review our gaap financial statements in addition to today's presentation. most of the subsequent information that we will discuss during today's call will relate to non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations of our gaap to non-gaap financial measures are included in our earnings release and in our presentation materials. the company provides details of its operating segment on slides 13 and 14 of the presentation, which are the primary measures management uses to evaluate the business.
jeff will begin today's call with key highlights of our business during the fourth quarter and full year 2020. he will then provide an update on recent progress in our key electrification and smart & connected, megatrend growth areas. paul will cover our detailed financials for the fourth quarter of 2020, including organic end-market outgrowth by business unit, our segment reporting, corporate expenses and balance sheet progress in the quarter, and provide financial guidance for the first quarter and full year 2021. we'll then take your questions after our prepared remarks.
now i'd like to turn the call over to sensata's ceo and president, jeff cote.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
thank you, jacob, and welcome to the call everyone.
i'd like to start with some summary thoughts on our performance as outlined on slide 5. the rebound from commercial lockdowns and quarantines, instituted by governments around the world as response to covid-19 earlier this year, continued in the fourth quarter. our response to that rebound enabled our revenue to grow 15% in the quarter sequentially to $906.5 million, consistent with the updated revenue guidance that we provided on january 8, and significantly higher than what we had anticipated during our third quarter earnings call. this growth is a testament to our leading positions and our strength and flexibility of our manufacturing model. i'm proud that we are able to capitalize quickly on improving markets and support our customers, as they return to higher levels of production during the quarter. i'd like to recognize the agility and hard work of our entire team in achieving these strong results.
looking at our performance year-over-year, we continued to deliver strong market outgrowth. for the fourth quarter of 2020, we produced 990 basis points of outgrowth in our heavy vehicle off-road business, and 970 basis points of outgrowth in our automotive business. continuing the trend we saw in the third quarter, inventory in the supply chain and in our customer's finished goods has continued to come down, a trend most pronounced in automotive. this sets us up very nicely for revenue growth of 2021.
for full year 2020, we delivered market outgrowth above our target ranges for both heavy vehicle off-road and automotive. we are confident that we will sustain our outgrowth for 2021 in the range of 600 basis points to 800 basis points for heavy vehicle off-road and 400 basis points to 600 basis points for automotive, consistent with our long-term goals and supported by our new business wins.
sensata today is in a strong financial position. we generated a record $240 million in free cash flow in the fourth quarter, a conversion rate of 178% of adjusted net income. at $453 million for the year, a conversion rate of 130%. and we are taking several steps to further enhance our financial position and flexibility.
we continue to benefit from incremental savings from the restructuring program announced last summer. these actions generated savings of $12 million in the fourth quarter, and we are expected to generate -- and they are expected to generate annualized savings of $60 million to $65 million starting in 2021.
while market uncertainties and supply chain risks remain, our business and customer visibility has improved significantly. and we have reinstated full year 2021 financial guidance today. later this quarter, we intend to redeem our $750 million 6.25% note due in 2026, which will lower our overall cost of capital.
during the fourth quarter, we closed more than $145 million in new business wins, bringing us to more than $465 million in new business wins for the year. this is higher than our five-year average of $440 million and solidifies our ability to continue to deliver market outgrowth in the coming years. we believe our success in closing a higher level of new business wins in 2020 despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic clearly demonstrates the mission critical nature of sensata's products.
finally, as i will discuss in more detail momentarily, we continued to invest in our megatrend growth initiatives and achieved a meaningful milestone and electrification by acquiring lithium balance. this brings lithium balance's battery management capabilities in-house, expanding important e-mobility system offerings in heavy vehicle and industrial applications, and enlarging our position with the -- within the evolving energy management solution space.
in the smart & connected, we began installing sensors and vehicle area network [technical issues] on our first fleet customers equipment and collecting revenue on a recurring subscription basis. we are pleased that this business is gaining significant momentum with quoting activity growing dramatically with future fleet customers.
moving to slide 6, sensata takes a holistic view of electrification and its impact on the markets we serve. we have expanded our capabilities in the e-mobility space, beyond components to deliver hardware and software systems. the acquisition of the gigavac positions sensata as a leading provider of high voltage protection on evs and charging infrastructure. we are broadening our focus beyond automotive to e-mobility applications and heavy vehicle and charging infrastructure, as well as into broader industrial and grid applications. this is because we see a great deal of customer need, which sensata is uniquely positioned to address.
during the fourth quarter, we closed another $40 million in electrification new business wins, bringing our annual total to $180 million, including four of our top five nbos in 2020. we are increasing our capabilities and charging infrastructure in smart grid applications, including our recent acquisition of lithium balance.
moving to slide 7, we are expanding the electrification solutions we provide for critical applications across all the end markets we serve, but especially in automotive, and it aligns well with the fast growing interest in production of electric vehicles around the world.
today, the rapid introduction of new energy -- new electric vehicles to the market provides a tailwind to sensata revenue growth. our content evs represents a 20% uplift in content value as compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. this content uplift is derived from a broad array of sensata sensors and other components that we designed into battery electric vehicles. some of these are carryover from internal combustion vehicles such as brake pressure and tire pressure sensors, while others are unique to evs, such as contactors and electric motor position sensors.
we have broadened and deepened our portfolio to support this expanding market segment. in 2020, our ev-related revenue represented approximately 5% of our automotive end market, as compared to evs representing approximately 3% of vehicles manufactured globally. so we feel confident we can grow along with the accelerated growth of evs.
to date we have closed new electrification business with many of the largest and most innovative automotive oems around the globe, whose logos are shown on this slide. we are proud to have existing business or design wins on future evs with nearly every automotive oem, with an announce ev launch. helping these oems launch the next generation of evs represents a significant growth factor for sensata, as electric vehicles increase in number and become a larger percentage of the total vehicles fleet worldwide.
as part of our holistic approach to electrification, sensata seeks to be a partner of choice for heavy vehicle and industrial oems transitioning to electrified solutions as well. we recently acquired lithium balance after a two-year collaboration that began when we acquired a minority stake in this company. over that time, we have jointly one business with new electric truck and bus designs with several oems, that bring over $250 of content per vehicle to sensata.
battery management solutions in heavy vehicle and industrial applications will represent an incremental $500 million of serviceable market for sensata by 2030. in addition to battery management systems for heavy vehicle and industrial applications, lithium balance also provides battery energy storage solutions under the xolta brand, that will establish sensata's total in this very fast growing space, which is estimated to exceed $6 billion in addressable market by 2030.
on slide 9, i want to provide an update on the meaningful milestones we achieved in our smart & connected megatrend initiative. during the quarter, we began to rollout our first smart & connected installation with a top 25 north american fleet manager, demonstrating our ability to move from selling hardware to providing data insight on a monthly recurring subscription model.
several additional fleet trials are also moving toward commercialization this year. we've gained significant momentum with more than $140 million in total contract value having been quoted, representing more than $45 million in potential annual contract value with five fleet managers. our expanded offering now includes the deployment of full-stack solutions that help unlock value for fleets, including functionalities such as a vehicle area network, cloud-based data analytics and insight delivery, web portals, mobile apps and integration with third-party telematics service providers.
we're pleased by the increasing interest and continue to believe that our smart & connected fleet management initiative open $6 billion in addressable market for sensata by 2030. reaching and then expanding commercialization with this exciting solution demonstrates its power to dramatically improve safety and reduce cost across commercial truck fleets.
in addition, in the new equipment space, we expect to close incremental new business with several leading heavy vehicle oems this year, building upon close to $100 million in new business wins closed to date for smart & connected solutions. as we capture more of this $1 billion addressable market in the oem space, we are confident that our new business wins will convert into revenue as oem production commences.
in closing, i'm pleased with the progress against the megatrend initiatives, and this progress supports our increased investment in this area as we pursue these large fast growing market trends. we intend to continue our efforts to expand sensata's solutions for these areas organically and through third-party collaboration and through acquisition as appropriate. as i've said before, we see numerous opportunities to utilize our strong financial position, our engineering capabilities, supply chain and customer relationships to meaningfully enlarge our addressable markets, through organic efforts as well as bolt-on acquisitions within these megatrends.
i'll now turn the call over to paul.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thank you, jeff. key highlights for the fourth quarter. as shown on slide 11, include revenue of $906.5 million, an increase of 7.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019. organic revenue increased 5.3%. changes in foreign currency increased revenue by 1.8%. and sequentially from the third quarter reported revenue increased 15%, reflecting our strong response to the continued rebound in our markets.
you'll recall that on january 8, we updated our revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. throughout the quarter, we saw continued strengthening, especially within our global automotive, heavy vehicle and industrial end markets, in addition to a revenue uplift from foreign exchange rate movements. and those contributed to the higher revenue performance in the quarter than we anticipated in late october.
adjusted operating income was $195.6 million, an increase of 1.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to higher revenues, savings from cost reduction programs and favorable foreign currency, partially offset by elevated costs resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, higher incentive compensation aligned to improved financial performance, and higher spend to support megatrend growth initiatives.
during the second quarter, you will recall that we announced a series of actions to structurally reduce our semi-variable costs by about 10%, to achieve an expected $60 million to $65 million in annual savings. we achieved the targeted $12 million savings from these programs in the fourth quarter and expect to achieve the full annualized savings starting in 2021.
adjusted net income was $134.7 million a decrease of 4.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to higher interest expense from our new bond issuance during the third quarter of this year. adjusted eps was $0.85 for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 4.5% compared to the prior year quarter.
now i will discuss our performance by end market in the fourth quarter of 2020 as outlined on slide 12. overall, we reported an organic revenue increase of 5.3% year-on-year, against an overall end market decrease of approximately 2.4% representing market outgrowth of 770 basis points for sensata.
our heavy vehicle off-road business posted organic revenue increase of 16.2%, representing 990 basis points of outgrowth as compared to 6.3% end market growth. our china on-road truck business continued to post better than expected growth from accelerated adoption of ns vi emissions regulations.
for the full year 2020, we delivered 880 basis points of outgrowth in the heavy vehicle off-road business, higher than our long-term targeted range of 600 basis points to 800 basis points. our automotive business posted an organic revenue increase of 4.4%. automotive production remained in high level during the quarter, creating broad supply chain challenges, while oem customers worked down their inventories which altogether created a 5.4% negative impact on revenue.
our automotive business produced market outgrowth of 970 basis points in the fourth quarter, led by continued new product launches in emissions, electrification and safety-related applications and systems. for the full year 2020, we delivered automotive outgrowth of 690 basis points, once again higher than our long-term target range of 400 basis points to 600 basis points.
looking ahead, lower inventory levels at our automotive customers especially in north america sets us up well for strong growth in 2021. our industrial business increased 7.7% organically with global industrial end markets return to growth in the quarter. strong growth in heating, ventilation and air conditioning and 5g applications in addition to supply chain restocking benefit our industrial business.
our aerospace business decreased 24.8% organically, reflecting reduced oem production and much lower air traffic, which has negatively impacted our aerospace aftermarket business for most of the year. new product launches primarily in the defense space, partially offset the significant aerospace market decline this quarter.
now i'd like to comment on the performance of our two business segments in the fourth quarter of 2020, starting with performance sensing on slide 13. our performance sensing business reported revenues of $689 million, an increase of 8.9% compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the positive impact from foreign currency of 2%, performance sensing organic revenue increased 6.9%.
on a sequential basis, performance sensing revenue grew 18.6% in the third quarter, as customers maintained a high order rate through the quarter. sequentially from the third quarter, our automotive business reported an increase of 17% and our heavy vehicle and off-road business reported increase of 23%, demonstrating the accelerated rebound of both of these markets.
performance sensing operating income was $185.1 million, an increase of 7.9% as compared to the same quarter last year, with operating margin of 26.9%. the increase in segment operating income was primarily due to higher revenue, savings and cost reduction actions and favorable foreign currency, somewhat offset by elevated costs caused by the covid-19 pandemic. sequentially performance sensing generate incremental margin of 31% on a higher revenue, underscoring sensata's profit potential associated with rebounding end-markets.
as shown on slide 14, sensing solutions reported revenues of $217.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 1.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the positive impact of foreign currency of 1.1%, sensing solutions organic revenue increased 0.6%. on a sequential basis, sensing solutions revenue grew 4.9% from the third quarter as customers ramped up production through the quarter. sequentially from the third quarter, our industrial business reported an increase of 4% and our aerospace business reported increase of 11%.
sensing solutions operating income was $70.7 million, an increase of 2.3% from the same quarter last year, with operating margin of 32.5%. the increase in segment operating income was primarily due to higher revenue, savings from cost reduction actions and favorable foreign currency, somewhat offset by elevated costs related to the covid-19 pandemic. sequentially, sensing solutions generate very strong incremental margins from a higher revenue and from productivity gains.
on slide 15, corporate and other costs not included in segment operating income were $69.6 million in the fourth quarter 2020. excluding charges added back to our non-gaap results, corporate and other costs were $58.5 million, an increase of $12 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to higher global incentive compensation costs aligned to our improving financial performance and higher design and business development spend to support our megatrend growth initiatives somewhat offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives.
items added back to our non-gaap corporate operating expenses include restructuring-related and other costs, and financing and other transaction costs.
megatrend investments were $8.8 million during the fourth quarter, an increase of $1.5 million from the prior year quarter. we currently expect approximately $50 million to $55 million in megatrend-related spend in 2021 to design and develop differentiated sensor rich and data insights solutions, venture new markets, develop new business models and design new product categories in fast growing and transformational megatrend vectors of electrification and smart & connected solutions.
slide 16 shows sensata's fourth quarter 2020 non-gaap results. adjusted operating income was up 1.6% compared to the same quarter last year. while adjusted operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 21.6% which is near the top of our peer group and represents an attractive operating income margin profile. the decrease in both adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin largely reflects the elevated costs we have experienced due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and the related operating and productivity challenges.
we acted early during the pandemic to reduce our cost structure, while continuing to invest in megatrends and are shaping our end-markets that we believe will enable us to deliver long-term sustainable growth. incentive compensation costs have also increased aligns with rising operating income as our end-markets recovered from a low point in the second quarter of 2020.
adjusted net income declined 4.9% compared to the same quarter last year. the decrease largely reflects higher interest expenses related to our bond issuance in the third quarter of this year and higher taxes due to jurisdictional profit mix. finally, adjusted eps was $0.85, down $0.04 to 4.5% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, as the decrease in adjusted net income was partially offset by the benefit in share repurchases in intervening periods.
and as shown on slide 17, we generated record $240 million in free cash flow during the fourth [phonetic] quarter, representing a 178% conversion rate of adjusted net income and finished the year with a 16-day reduction in inventory days on hand. this brings free cash flow generation of $453 million for the full year, representing 130% conversion rate. for 2021, we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 85%.
our capital expenditures for full year 2020 were $107 million in line with guidance. for full year 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million, a more normalized level as compared to 2020. sensata's net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 3.2 times at the end of december, which is within our target operating range of 2.5 times to 3.5 times.
during the first quarter of 2021, we have the opportunity to call-in $750 million of senior notes due in 2026, which pay 6.25% in annual interest. it is our intention to repay those notes later in the first quarter, reduce our interest expense and that assumption is built into the financial guidance we're providing today.
we're providing financial guidance for the first quarter of 2021, as shown on slide 18. as a result of our improving economic conditions, and greater stability in customer order patterns, we expect to generate revenues between $875 million and $915 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing a reported revenue increase between 13% and 18% compared to the first quarter of 2020.
at the mid-point of guidance, we expect that foreign currency will increase revenues year-over-year by approximately $17 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency, we expect an organic revenue increase of 11% to 16% in the first quarter. you'll recall that we called out approximately $20 million to $25 million inventory that was built by our customers largely automotive oems in the first quarter of 2020. that inventory build now reverses and acts as a headwind year-over-year growth comparisons to the first quarter of 2021.
our current flow rate is approximately 93% of the revenue guidance midpoint for the first quarter. we continue to monitor leading economic indicators and third-party forecasts to help form our view of future demand. one headwind affecting our outlook is the expected impact of a global microchip shortage if the entire auto supply chain is currently experiencing that we expect will add 25 basis points to 50 basis points to our operating costs in the first quarter. including this expense, we expect to report adjusted operating income between $166 million to $182 million. at the mid-point, operating income margin is expected to be 20.2% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
on the bottom line, we expect to report adjusted net income between $106 million and $122 million, which would represent an increase of 27% to 47% compared to the first quarter of 2020. we expect to report adjusted eps between $0.67 and $0.77, which includes a $0.01 negative impact from foreign currency at the guidance mid-point.
at the bottom of slide, we provided a margin walk from the first quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021. this includes expected impacts from the semiconductor shortage, increased covid-related costs, increased incentive compensation for employees, increase megatrend investments and the impact of foreign exchange.
sensata's core business is strong with 400 basis points of margin improvement expected from operating leverage on higher revenues and net productivity gains, including savings from cost reduction actions. operating income margin reflects a very strong 40% incremental profit on the incremental revenue from the same period a year-ago.
we're providing financial guidance for the full year 2021 as shown on slide 19. for the full year 2021, while our degree of market uncertainty remains, we're planning for a continuation of recent rebounding economic and business conditions. accordingly, we expect to generate revenues between $3.425 billion to $3.575 billion for the full year 2021 representing reported revenue increase between 12% and 17% year-on-year.
at the mid-point of guidance, we expect that foreign currency will increase revenue year-over-year by approximately $64 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency, we expect an organic revenue increase of 10% to 15% in 2021. we expect to report adjusted operating income between $695 million and $755 million, which includes the expected impact of a global microchip shortage and expected 25 basis points to 50 basis points cost from the first half of the year. at the mid-point, operating income margin is expected to be 20.9% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
on the bottom line, we expect to report adjusted net income between $488 million and $544 million which represented an increase of 40% to 56% compared to 2020. we expect to report adjusted eps between $3.06 to $3.42 which includes a negligible impact from foreign currency at the guidance mid-point.
at the bottom of the slide, we provided a margin walk from 2019 to 2021. we show a margin comparison to a pre-pandemic period, while fluctuating revenue has had the greatest impact on our operating income margins, covid-related costs, incentive compensation for employees, megatrends investments and foreign exchange have also had a meaningful impact on our operating income margin.
sensata's core business remain strong, and on a like-to-like basis, absent these additional costs, 2021 operating income margin would be higher than 2019 on similar revenue.
on slide 20, we provide our estimates for oem production growth for 2021 as compared to 2020. north america automotive production is expected to rebound sharply this year, as the industry seeks to address record low inventory levels at the end of 2020. global automotive production is expected to grow 13% on a revenue weighted basis. moreover, all of our end-markets are expected to grow in 2021. and these assumptions underpin our outlook for strong revenue and earnings growth in the coming year.
in sum, sensata delivered an excellent financial finish in 2020, despite an extremely challenging environment throughout the year. we expect this strong performance to continue into 2021, as demonstrated by the financial guidance we're providing today. driving this performance is our continued ability to achieve our growth targets, including a secular long-term market outgrowth target of 400 basis points to 600 basis points for our automotive business, and 600 basis points to 800 basis points for heavy vehicle business.
now let me turn the call back over to jeff for closing comments.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer & president
thanks, paul. i'll wrap up with a few key messages as outlined on slide 21. sensata has responded very well to the rapid improvements in many of the end markets that we serve, which demonstrates the strength, flexibility and reliability of our organizational model, which enabled us to capitalize on the end-market demand recovery. our ability to respond quickly to shifting demands, as well as will position us very well as a trusted resource for our customers.
we're delivering attractive end-market outgrowth. we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver this attractive end-market outgrowth into the future based upon our strong levels of new business wins. we continue to deliver solid free cash flow and drove our record cash generation of $140 million in the fourth quarter, which demonstrates sensata's resilient financial model and operating discipline.
we continue to invest in our megatrends and other growth initiatives that are opening large and rapidly growing opportunities for sensata across all of our end-markets. we're making excellent progress as evidenced by the rollout of our first commercial fleet adoption for smart & connected solutions, by the acquisition of lithium balance, which expands our electrification offerings, and by the $180 million in new electrification business wins in 2020.
we continue to believe that the overall market environment may provide interesting opportunities to further strengthen our portfolio through strategically important value-creating acquisitions. in addition, we're pursuing technology collaborations and partnerships with third-parties to expand our capabilities and accelerate our megatrend growth. we expect to continue to deliver industry-leading margins for our shareholders, while also investing in growth opportunities and our people.

and finally, i'm excited about sensata's long-standing mission to help create cleaner, safer and a more connected world, not just for our customers' products, but also for our own operations. we are incorporating esg areas into our strategy to help ensure the long-term sustainability and success of the company from all of its stakeholders. we look forward to reporting more on this topic in the future.
i'd now like to turn the call back to jacob.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, jeff. given the large number of listeners on the call, please limit yourself to just one question each. if we have time, we'll circle back for follow-up questions. as we're in different locations today, feel free to direct your questions to either jeff or paul directly. jason, would you please begin the q&a?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the first question comes from craig hettenbach of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
craig hettenbach -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, thanks. jeff, can you just talk about the design activity, how it's trending in evs compared to last year? and then also on the charging front, i don't think that gets as much attention, but you mentioned a couple of wins in activity there, if you can just expand on that?
jeff cote -- analyst
yes, i'd be glad to. so all of our customers are investing heavily in the electrification trends that are occurring. and the governments around the world as they put together plans for investment in these areas -- it just builds on the momentum that we're seeing. and so there is are lot of conversations going on with customers across all of our end markets on this front. it's a really exciting time as we build our capabilities and we have more to talk with our customers about. and so we see that trend continuing to accelerate. it is important to note, craig, and we talked about it in our comments that there are roadmaps -- product roadmaps associated with more products that our customers already have that will continue to provide opportunity for us that we're investing in and what i'm referring to is internal combustion engines as well, but we're really trying to do the best we can to balance the investments in the things we're serving for our customers that are already on the books, that will propel growth with the things that will generate growth in the future, and we think we're doing a good job balancing that.

the next question comes from samik chatterjee of jp morgan. please go ahead.
unidentified participant
good morning, guys. this is vignesh [phonetic] on for samik chatterjee. thanks for the update. can you hear me?
jeff cote -- analyst
we can. yes.
unidentified participant
yes. so, if you could give me some color on the churod electronics joint venture. is there be an incremental market you'd be looking to address for churod or this is step toward solidifying market share per gigawatt?
jeff cote -- analyst
yes, so let me touch on the churod joint venture. first, it's bringing to us a new aspect of high-voltage contactors, which have a high levitation feature that many of our customers are requesting as part of there are queues as we work with them. so it's a key product capability that they bring. and as i've mentioned, it adds this new voltage average 150 to 400, which is something we've talked about is not having addressed with the acquisition of gigavac. we were focused on the higher voltage applications, which we continue to believe will be the future for electric vehicles, but there is going to be a point in time here where the transition from internal combustion engines to electrified vehicles, there'll be a big market associated with this mid-voltage range. and this allows us to go after a broader segment of the market. if the jv will focus on china, and we have the right to use this technology outside of china and north america and europe, and as we mentioned, we will consolidate the results of this in our financials, and then we'll show a minority interest in the financial statements to transfer the portion of the profits associated with this. it's going to start building over time. we're already engaging with customers on selling this product portfolio, but it will build over time and we are excited about the future in terms of what this jv can bring to us as combined company for both us and for churod. thanks for the question.
operator
the next question comes from wamsi mohan with bank of america. please go ahead.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, thank you. congrats on the strong execution. i was wondering if you could comment on the semi shortages, you clearly are baking in some cost headwind here that you're seeing from that. are you baking in any revenue headwinds as well? and related to that, when i look at your guidance, you obviously have very strong performance both in 1q and guiding very strongly for 2q. when i think about the full year, the organic revenue be it seems to be about -- upside seems to be about $80 million for the second half, but earnings seem to be somewhat down on an organic basis for the second half -- the incremental earnings associated with that. so i was just wondering if you could help us think through what are the incremental costs that you're baking in, in the second half of the year? thank you.
jeff cote -- analyst
yes. great, vamsi. i'm going to address the semi shortage and then paul can address the guidance and profitability related questions. so on the semi side obviously, at this point instance an industry challenge, not a sensata specific one, i would say that. i think there were many that we're hoping that this would dissipate a little bit in terms of concern been part of this year. i think my view would be that this is going to be something that's going to be around until at least mind-next year rather than going away. we've taken many steps as we've talked about in terms of extending our orders with our suppliers to make sure that we have surety of supply. and one of the thing i would mention is that, there is a bigger impact associated with standard basics. and given, it's -- we're not immune to this, right? we were impacted by the shortage. but because of the large proportion of our products are specific designs, we have customized a6 [phonetic]. and so, when there is customized [indecipherable] there is very specific manufacturing capacity that setup for business. so i think that because of that high level of design in customization, we may be feeling a little bit less of this been some maybe is associated with those that pull on more standard [phonetic]. part of the business model, it's not something we plan to do, but it's a fortunate benefit associated with a very designed in nature of our product categories. paul, why don't you hit on that?
paul vasington -- chief financial officer
yes, wamsi, just try and keep it simple, we laid out what the impact which absorbed would be for the year. it was about a 1%. and it's mostly around logistics effect today. its supply chain and it's compressed; so expedite inbound and outbound to serve our customers. when you look at the margin profile for the year, first half and second half were pretty flat. and if you look at year-over-year, when you start on fuel there and you look at the conversion of [indecipherable] incremental revenue year-on-year, you adjust for the acquisitions, currency and chip shortage, we're running an incremental margins in the mid-40. so i think it's very strong performance. i think it's good for activity, good operating leverage, good cost management in the midst of a very disruptive semiconductor supply chain shortfall.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, wamsi. great questions.

the questions the next question comes from mark delaney with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
mark delaney -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. good morning. thanks for taking the question. there were many of details you can provide and whether the higher outgrowth that sensata reported in the other segment and being sold through relevance in inventory. yes. and i think investors are asking about the potential for inventory being built up of electronic components because, perhaps auto oems were stuck waiting for semi-chips to arrive, but there are still buying products like sensors and contactors, or maybe they just want to be building up buffer of electronic products more broadly, given some of the uncertainties related to the global supply chain? thanks.
jeff cote -- analyst
mark, great question. we're spending a fair amount of time understanding whether or not ultimately the demand that we're seeing from our customers is raw demand. i think that's the crux of your question. we're looking at third-party indications regarding overall demand an look at things like ihs estimates of vehicles, production and sold, we look at pmi indicators, which are record high in europe 62, us is 59, china is still in a positive territory. so there are a lot of indications associated with one would drive raw demand for our customers' products. so those are all quite strong. we're seeing no indication that there is any meaningful supply chain even replenishment or build up. other than maybe in the industrial segment, we see a tiny bit, but the indication i would give you is if you look at north america's automotive vehicle days, we were at 39 days at the end of the first quarter, we were at 48 at the end of the year. this is extraordinarily low. and i think we're all seeing the impact of this as consumers in terms of lead times to get products, not just vehicles, but other electronics and so forth. we're watching this very closely because we obviously don't want to be whipsawed by this. we're having extensive conversations with our customers to make sure that we understand raw demand as we prioritize where the manufacturing these two be emphasized that make sure we serve our customers, and we'll continue to report on that. but the shorthand and short story is we're not seeing any meaningful build up in the supply chain at this point.

the next question comes from luke junk with baird. please go ahead.
luke junk -- baird -- analyst
good morning, jeff. hoping you could talk about the xirgo deals, especially any initial feedback that you've gotten with fleet customers? i know it's still early, but i'm wondering about the thesis around channels to market playing out thus far as you start to engage with those customers?
jeff cote -- analyst
yes. so we just closed on april 1st. obviously, we had some engagement with them, but we are very careful during that period where we were waiting for regulatory clearance. but, you know that we've worked with them for the past year and a half, so we know the management team, we know we're working on some joint customers. it's been received very well. this is an acquisition that is very tightly aligned to our strategy. we've been talking about our initiative associate with smart & connected for the last 18 months to two years. and this is squarely in that point. there is a lot of complimentary aspects of what this brings to us, opens up a much bigger market in terms of not only the offering, but the market segments that we'll be able to go after. and it's -- as we've talked about, it's a very attractive business in terms of the growth trajectory. and the data points that we see now that we have a couple of three weeks in and we're able to look more closely at how that the rest of the year is panning out. i mentioned that more than 80% of the 2021 revenue is already in orders from customers. so we're seeing very positive feedback. we're having a lot of engagement with customers who are their customers, or our customers, or joint customers. and excited about doing this teach-in the next couple of months, so that we can have that management team spend some more time with our investor base to explain more in detail what we're seeing.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance

the next question comes from matt sheerin with stifel. please go ahead.
matt sheerin -- stifel -- analyst
yes. thanks, and good morning. i just wanted to ask another question regarding the strengths you're seeing in the heavy truck and hvor market. you talked about some catalysts and drivers in china. but could you talk about what you're seeing in other markets? and i know that '19 and into '20 was in the down cycle, and there were just talk about an up cycle investment cycle. is that what you're seeing or is it just a rebound off of the bottom here?
jeff cote -- analyst
yes. i think it's a combination of all of the above to be honest with you. so let me touch on q1 first and let me first touch on the market for heavy vehicle. across our segments within heavy vehicle, we saw first quarter expansion, pretty meaningful expansion at all markets other than european on-road, which was still down about 14% versus more of the first quarter of last year, but broadly, 22% market recovery across the hvor market. and then coupled with what is just really, really strong outgrowth, over 1,000 basis points of outgrowth given acceleration and continued investment or roll-out on a variety of programs that our customers have. ns vi in china has obviously an impact. but paul mentioned in the prepared comments also the continued migration from mechanical controls to electronic controls. so all these investments that we've made over the past three, four and five years, and the trends that were occurring in hvor are benefiting us in addition to the market recovery that we're seeing. ultimately driving, what is a 35%, 36% growth year-over-year and obviously q2 was even greater 110% growth with about 56% market growth. as we go into q2, the only markets segment within hvor that we see declining quarter-over-quarter is china, and it's down a tiny, maybe 1% versus q2 of last year. and similarly on the full year, we see growth across -- market growth across all the segments with the exception of china, which is not new. we had forecasted that ultimately, that would be down a little bit for 2021 versus '20.

the next question comes from jim suva with citi. please go ahead.
jim suva -- citi -- analyst
thank you. and great results and outlook. when you mentioned your fill rate was like in the 90% is quite high. does that impact pricing for your company products in margins? what i mean by that is, do customers actually pay the same amount, or pay a little bit more, or little less if they have more visibility and secured supply in a time of uncertainty? and can you actually get above 100% like by running an extra over time shift or does it just simply not work in that way? thank you.
paul vasington -- chief financial officer
so, i think -- this is paul. i'll take it jim. it does not affect pricing specifically. we're not charging what people get in the front of the line. we're operating under our purchase orders or contracts that we have with our customers. definitely stronger or see on the industrial side, a faster fill rate in the learning there that our customers are ordering sooner in the process to ensure that they get securities probably they are looking for. for the matter, really, it's really an ordering behavior more than pricing or any other economic behavior. we serve all the demand that we can for our customers that recently ordered. we're going to serve it. and so it would -- it could get 100% if everything was ordered by the time we have this earnings release, specifically not the case and we're normally in the -- have been running in the low '90s. so this is a little bit higher, but it's been identified as to why based on our interactions to our customers.

the next question comes from michael filatov with berenberg capital. please go ahead.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
thanks for taking my question guys. just a quick one on churod. i understand that that your content per vehicle for evs in china is obviously a lot lower than it is in north america and europe, and that's mainly due to the sort of lower voltage evs you have in that market. so i'm wondering how does this churod acquisition change that content outlook for you guys in china, and what that will look like going forward?
jeff cote -- analyst
yes. you're hitting on one of the major necessities why we did this joint venture. it's about expanding the product capabilities and it's a capability set that candidly is just -- and higher demand in china right now when i would expect it would be for the next 10 years or 15 years as that market continues to evolve. and so, and that's why the jv is focused on that end market, right. so, i mentioned the jv itself is going to focus on the china end market, but we were able to negotiate the ability to bring that capability into the other market that we serve and clearly we're having those conversations as well. but just -- listen when every automaker out there has a different product strategy in terms of how they're going to go about this and more capability we can bring both in the form of products and engineering capability is going to make it a better environment for us to be able to participate. and this definitely has the potential to drive the content per vehicle in china. it's a very positive direction. so that's where we are on that one.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst

the next question comes from joe giordano with cowen. please go ahead.
robert jamieson -- cowen & company -- analyst
hi guys. it's rob on for joe. thanks for taking my questions. and just two quick ones from me. first, given the strong 1q and full-year guidance, i just wanted to see, given that production excellence little bit handicapped, just curious if there's anything incremental that we should be aware of that gives you a little bit more caution for the rest of the year than you had coming into q1? and then just on backlog, how much backlog you have from orders to see in the last few quarters that you've been unable to ship, i believe you've all been under shipping relative to production the last few quarters. thank you.
jeff cote -- analyst
this quarter, we actually don't see much inventory dislocation. it was pretty balanced. so when we look at our revenue and we try to unpack it, depend on automotive, which i mean [indecipherable] look at production, we look at our outgrowth, which is our content growth which we tracked by partner with -- plus launching a new platform. and again pricing has been in. and so the math worked out quite well, where we were serving the market and we're also outgrowing the market base in our business plan while launching the new business plan in quarter. so pretty balanced quarter. in the past, we've seen some inventory impact that affected our revenue, but it was muted in q2. in terms of serving demand, we're serving, i think the team has done an unbelievable job in the current condition to serve the demand without [phonetic] -- and our fill rate is the best indicator we can provide in terms of what's the demand is and our ability to serve that demand at the point in time.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, joe.
operator
the next question comes from amit daryanani with evercore isi. please go ahead.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. i just -- i want to go back to the calendar '21 eps guide. and i guess, as i think about it versus 90 days ago, where you picking up the guide about $0.11 or so. but the q1 will be at low loss $0.14. and then i think fx reserve goal in my math will add about $0.10 or $0.11 versus 90 days ago. so it is -- in my head, i would have thought, jeff, you would raise the eps guide by $0.25, not $0.11. maybe just touch on what are some of the offsets that are not enabling that expansion? and then on the semiconductor shortages, i know you talked a fair bit about this -- i feel like if i walk into auto dealership prices are going up. so i'm curious what is your ability to pass price increases to your customer to offset some of these challenges over here?
jeff cote -- analyst
so amit, i mean, the bigger fault is the chipper shortage around some of the $30 million. and it certainly adds somewhere in that $75 million revenue, about 20% i think currency is a little bit favorable. but -- and you call those out. but the biggest issue is the chip shortage, right. so that's impacting our costs you called it out. we had about $8 million to $10 million or so in the first quarter and have another $30 million in the rest of the nine months. and it's also impacting our ability to hit some of the productivity goals that we are looking for because we're dealing with a very compressed supply chain and amount in many cases. and so we're not able to get at some of the things we wanted to work on that. we saw a clear line of sight by saving. so those things will get deferred into 2022. but, again i go back and look at the year-over-year. if you look at incremental revenue, the incremental profit, it's very strong. like we adjust for acquisition and the chip shortage and investment in megatrend and fx, we're in the megatrend were in the mid-40s, conversion of revenue, on top of revenue. i think it's a really strong performance. and we tried to lay it out in the [indecipherable] due to commercial provisions to [phonetic] let you understand how the margins progressing to 2021.
paul vasington -- chief financial officer
and i think that's the new information from the last time we provided the guide. i think the general view was that the chip shortage was going to dissipate by mid this year. that's clear that it's not happening given the lot of things, including high levels of demand that those companies you're seeing right now, and so now we're factoring in that longer-term impact associated with it.
jeff cote -- analyst
i mean that's 20 basis points to 50 basis points in the first quarter. and so in the second quarter and obviously it's much higher than that, more than -- in the percent and --
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks for the question amit.
operator
and is there time for an additional question?
jeff cote -- analyst
one more, i think, andrew. thank you.
operator
okay. and that question will come from david williams with loop capital. please go ahead.
david williams -- loop capital -- analyst
hey, thanks for squeezing me and fairly appreciate it. and just wanted to ask on the heavy vehicle side, if there is any dynamics there that you think maybe is driving that, is there any of the infrastructures maybe spending from a north american perspective? or how do you think about that in terms of potential upside as we kind of move through some of these stimulus packages that we're seeing throughout the global economy?
jeff cote -- analyst
yes. so you cut out at the end there. but i think the question was regarding the significant change that we're seeing in the hvor market expectations versus even three months ago. and i do believe that infrastructure spend and a variety of factors are driving there. we mentioned -- paul mentioned in the opening comments, the automotive demand actually is going down a little bit from what we thought it was going to be three months ago. the aerospace is down, a little bit from what we expected three months ago. industrial is up a tiny bit. but the big mover here is hvor. we had anticipated about 6% market growth, now it's 15%, 17% market growth. and i do believe that infrastructure spends and other factors are driving that comp, just in general confidence. so that's certainly what we're hearing from our customers and what we're seeing in the news and reading about. thanks for the question.
operator

operator
good morning and welcome to the sensata technologies first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. all participants will be in listen-only mode. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to jacob sayer, vice president, finance. please go ahead.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, andrew, and good morning, everyone. i'd like to welcome you to sensata's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. joining me on today's call are jeff cote, sensata's ceo and president; and paul vasington, sensata's chief financial officer.
in addition to the financial results, press release we issued earlier today and will be referencing a slide presentation during today's conference call. the pdf of this presentation can be downloaded from sensata's investor relations website. we'll post a replay of today's webcast shortly after the conclusion of today's call.
as we begin, i'd like to reference sensata's safe harbor statement on slide 2. during this conference call there will be forward-looking statements regarding future events or the financial performance of the company that involve certain risks and uncertainties. the company's actual results may differ materially from the projections described in such statements. factors that might cause differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our forms 10-q and 10-k, as well as other subsequent filings with the sec.
on slide 3, we showed sensata's gaap results for the first quarter 2021. we encourage you to review our gaap financial statements in addition to today's presentation. most of the subsequent information that we will discuss during today's call will relate to non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations of our gaap to non-gaap financial measures are included in our earnings release and in our presentation materials. the company provides details of its segment operating income on slides 12 and 13 of the presentation, which are the primary measure management uses to evaluate the business.
jeff will begin today's call with highlights of our business during the first quarter of 2021. he will then provide an update on our recent progress in our key electrification and smart & connected megatrend growth areas. paul will cover a detailed financials for the first quarter of 2021, including organic and market outgrowth by business units, our segment reporting, and provide financial guidance for the second quarter and updated guidance for the full year 2021. we'll then take your questions after our prepared remarks.
now i'd like to turn the call over to sensata's ceo and president, jeff cote.
jeff cote -- analyst
thank you, jacob, and welcome, everyone. i'd like to start with some summary thoughts on our performance during the first quarter of 2021 as outlined on slide 4. the business recovery we experienced during the second half of 2020 gain steam during the first quarter, our agile response to increased demand through 22% revenue growth from the prior year period, a record $942.5 million.
we delivered $198 million in operating income during the quarter, an increase of $61.4 billion and a 130-basis-point expansion in margin from the prior year period. this growth is a testament to our leading market positions, and the strength and flexibility of our manufacturing and commercial model. we continue to capitalize on improving markets that supported our customers as they return to higher levels of production during the quarter. the combination of more robust demand, our strong market outgrowth and the acquisition of xirgo has enabled us to raise our financial guidance for the full year. i'd like to recognize the innovation and hard work of our entire team in achieving these strong results.
looking at our performance year-over-year, we once again delivered strong market out growth. for the first quarter of 2021, we produced a 1,070 basis points of outgrowth in our heavy vehicle off-road business and 910 basis points of outgrowth in our automotive business.
sensata is in a strong financial position. we generated $77 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, and we took additional steps to further enhance our financial position and flexibility. during the first quarter, we redeemed our 6.25 notes that were due in 2026, and issued new notes due in 2029 at a historically low interest rate of 4%. these transactions extended the average maturity and lowered our total cost of fixed debt by 80 basis points to 4.5%. we are confident that our new business wins in 2021 will exceed last year's level of $465 million. this solidifies our ability to continue to deliver strong outgrowth in the coming years.
in smart & connected, we closed the previously announced acquisition of xirgo technologies on april 1st, greatly expanding our ability to provide data insights through transportation and logistics customers and adding a new customer base as well for these solutions. we continue to invest in our megatrend growth initiatives and increased our organic investment to $12 million in the first quarter from $6 million in the first quarter of last year. these investments will allow us to pursue significant market opportunities. we've also achieved a meaningful milestone in electrification through a joint venture with churod electronics, which i'll talk more about on the next slide.
moving to slide 5. sensata takes a holistic view of electrification, and its growing impact on the markets we serve. electrification is not just about electric light vehicles to us, but it includes heavy vehicles and charging infrastructure, necessary to support this ecosystem. we see additional opportunities in industrial and grid applications, some of which are more nascent today. sensata is already a leader -- a leading provider in high voltage protection on ev and charging infrastructure, and we intend to participate in areas of the evolving market that enable electrification to become more widespread. our joint venture with churod electronics extends our electrical protection capabilities to mass market evs and other electrified equipment worldwide. churod will contribute access to its ceramic, high-levitation contactor intellectual property. these contactors are optimized for medium voltage applications in the 150a to 400a range common in mass market vehicles. they will also dedicate engineering resources and contribute manufacturing equipment to the jv. sensata will contribute $9.5 billion and dedicated application engineers and sales people, and we plan to consolidate the financials of the jv in our p&l. the jv will provide medium voltage contactors to transportation oems in china, and sensata will sell the product line to customers elsewhere in the world. this jv expands our contactor capabilities in the automotive market to vehicles that have shorter ranges and longer charging times, which are more common in asia. this enables sensata to offer a broader electrification solution set for electric vehicle manufacturers globally and increases our total addressable market by more than $500 billion by 2030. we are enthusiastic about this new partnership and the opportunities it provides.
as i mentioned, electrification is -- to us is more than evs and sensata seeks to be a partner of choice for heavy vehicle and industrial oems transitioning to electrified solutions as well. sensata is a leading provider of electrification solutions for charging station oems, including those shown on slide 6. in addition, we recently signed an exciting business win with new commercial ev powertrain supplier, hyliion; an ev commercial truck manufacturer workhorse, extending our electrification efforts.
during the first quarter, as previously announced, we completed the acquisition of lithium balance to add battery management systems to our product capabilities. we are expanding our capabilities in the e-mobility space beyond components by developing hardware and software solutions, including battery management solutions for heavy vehicle and industrial applications. this also represents an incremental $500 billion in addressable market for sensata by 2030.
moving to slide 7, we are expanding the electrification solutions we provide for critical applications across all the end markets we serve, but especially in automotive. the rapid introduction of new electric vehicles provides a healthy tailwind for sensata's revenue growth. our content in evs represent a 20% uplift and content value, as compared to the internal combustion vehicles of similar class. its content uplift is derived from a broader array of sensata sensors and other components that we designed into battery electric vehicles, in many cases, using the same underlying technology product families that we use in internal combustion vehicles. additionally, certain sensors carryover directly from internal combustion vehicles such as brake pressure or tire pressure sensors. we also design additional sensors or devices unique to evs such as contactors and electric motor position sensors. we are broadening and deepening our portfolio, our product portfolio to support this expanding market. our automotive addressable market is large today and growing rapidly. applications in internal combustion vehicles make up most of our automotive addressable market today. and this space is expected to continue to grow over the next 10 years, even with the shift of type of vehicles produced.
in addition, while the electrification applications that we serve represent a smaller market today, they're expected to grow very rapidly until they become in even larger opportunity than internal combustion engines for sensata by 2030. as a result, we are expecting a doubling of our automotive addressable market by 2030.
on slide 8, i want to provide an update on another meaningful milestone we achieved in our smart & connected initiative. we closed the acquisition of xirgo technologies on april 1, and welcome the xirgo team, its capabilities and its customers to sensata. xirgo is a leading telematics and data insight provider for fleet management across the transportation and logistics segments. they bring a comprehensive suite of telematics asset tracking devices, cloud-based data insight solutions as well as emerging sensing applications and data services. xirgo is complementary to, and meaningfully extends sensata's organic smart & connected solution for commercial fleet managers. it is consistent with sensata's strategy to move beyond serving vehicle oems, and engaging with the broader transportation and logistics ecosystem. xirgo expands our smart & connected addressable markets to $15 billion by 2030 by adding cargo, container and light vehicle fleet management to our heavy vehicle oem as fleet focus.
xirgo is a fast growing business. it is expected to generate more than $100 million in annualized revenue in 2021 and grow in excess of 20% per year over the next several years. we already have committed orders for more than 80% of the revenue we expect xirgo to generate for the balance of 2021. xirgo is also very profitable, with approximately 50% gross margins and 25% ebitda margins and requires little capital expenditure. also during the quarter, we were pleased to sign up another top 25 north american fleet customer and began installation of our solution set, demonstrating our ability to move from selling hardware to providing data insight solutions on a monthly recurring subscription model. later in the quarter, we'll webcast a teach-in for investors covering our transportation and logistics data insight initiative. so listeners can better understand this offering, the evolving market and our go-to-market strategies.
i'm pleased with our progress against our megatrend initiatives, which supports our increased investment to pursue these large fast growing markets, driven by secular trends. we intend to continue our efforts to expand sensata solutions for these areas organically through third-party collaboration and through acquisitions. as i've said before, we see numerous opportunities to utilize our strong financial position, our engineering capabilities to supply chain and customer relationships, to meaningfully enlarge our addressable markets through organic efforts as well as bolt-on acquisitions, and partnerships within these megatrends.
i'll now like the turn the call over to paul. paul?
paul vasington -- chief financial officer
thank you, jeff. key highlights for the first quarter as shown on slide 10, include record revenue of $942.5 million, an increase of 21.7% from the first quarter of 2020. organic revenue increase 18.8% and changes in foreign currency increased revenue by 2.9%. adjusted operating income was $198.1 million, an increase of 44.9% compared to the first quarter 2020, primarily due to higher revenues, savings from cost reduction programs, and favorable foreign currency, partially offset by elevated costs related to the industry wide semiconductor chip shortage, higher spend support megatrend growth initiatives, higher incentive compensation aligned to improved financial performance. adjusted net income was $137.6 million, an increase of 65.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020, largely due to higher revenues, improved operating performance in the quarter. adjusted eps was $0.86 in the first quarter, an increase of 62.3% versus the prior year quarter.
now discuss our performance by end markets in the first quarter of 2021 as outlined on slide 11. as i mentioned a moment ago, we reported organic revenue increase of 18.8% year-on-year. this compares with overall end market growth of approximately 10.9%, representing market outgrowth of 790 basis points for sensata.
our heavy vehicle off-road business posted an organic revenue increase of 32.8%, representing end market growth of 22.1% and 1,070 basis points of market outgrowth. our china on road truck business continued to post better than expected growth from the adoption of ns vi emissions regulations. and we are also benefiting from a wave of larger mechanical operator controls be installed in new offered equipment. so past three years, basically has delivered an average 780 basis points of market outgrowth.
our automotive business posted organic revenue increase of 19.3%. automotive production rebounded in the year ago period, growing 10.2% our automotive business market outgrowth of 910 basis points in the first quarter led by continued new product launches and power chain emissions, safety, electrification related applications of business. for the past three years, automotive has delivered an average 560 basis points of market outgrowth.
our industrial business increased 16.8% organically as global industrial end markets continue to recover in the quarter. strong growth in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, new electrification launches and supply chain restocking benefited our industrial business.
our aerospace business decreased 22.4% organically reflecting reduced oem production and much lower air traffic, which continue to negatively impact our aerospace aftermarket business. new product launches for [phonetic] defense, partially offset a significant aerospace market decline this quarter.
now i'd like to comment on performance of our two business segments in the first quarter of 2021, starting with performance sensing on slide 12. our performance sensing business reported record revenue of $714.5 million, an increase of 25.6% compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the positive impact from foreign currency of 3.2%, performance sensing organic revenue increased 22.4%. performance sensing operating income was $195.8 million, an increase of 45% as compared to the same quarter last year with operating margin of 27.4%. the increase in segment operating income was primarily due to higher revenues, savings from cost reduction actions, and favorable foreign currency somewhat offset by elevated costs, related to the industry wide semiconductor chip shortage. performance sensing generated incremental margin of 42% in the first quarter on higher revenue as compared to the prior year period.
as shown on slide 13, sensing solutions reported revenues of $228 million in the first quarter versus 2021, an increase of 10.9% as compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the positive impact from foreign currency of 2.1%, sensing solutions' organic revenue increased 8.8%. sensing solutions operating income was $66.9 million, an increase of 18.4% the same quarter last year with operating margin of 29.3%. like performance sensing the entries, the segment operating income was primarily due to higher revenues and savings from cost reduction actions. somewhat offset by elevated cost from the industrywide semiconductor chips shortage, sensing solutions generated incremental margin of 46% in the first quarter of higher revenue, as compared to the prior-year period.
on slide 14, corporate and other costs not included in segment operating income were $68.6 million in the first quarter of 2021. excluding charges added back to our non-gaap results, corporate and other costs were $61.8 million, an increase of $8.6 million from prior year quarter, primarily due to higher research and development and business development spend to support our megatrend growth initiatives of higher global incentive compensation costs aligned to our improving financial performance. before we expected approximately $55 million, the megatrend related spent in 2021 to design, develop, differentiated sensor rich and data insight solutions for the fast-growing and transformational megatrend vectors electrification in smart & connected.
slide 15 shows sensata's first quarter 2021 non-gaap results. adjusted operating income was up 44.9% compared to the same quarter last year and adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points in 21%. the increase in both adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin largely reflects the rapid increase in revenue from depressed levels, experienced last year due to the impacts of covid-19 pandemic. we acted early during the epidemic to reduce our cost structure or continuing to invest in megatrends, or shaping our end market that we believe will enable us to deliver long term to found the growth. we've included an operating income margin walk for the first quarter of 2020 to first quarter of 2021 showing a margin benefit from increased volume in productivity as well as the impact of certain cost increases including costs associated with the global shortage of semiconductors, the covid-related costs, higher incentive compensation costs, and improved investments in our megatrend initiatives.
as shown on slide 16, we generated $77 million of free cash flow during the first quarter, representing a 56% conversion rate of adjusted net income, which was tempered by rising accounts receivable from higher revenues, and the timing of 2020 cash bonuses paid to employees during the first quarter of this year. for the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85% of adjusted net income. for the full year 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. sensata's net debt to ebitda ratio was 2.9 times at the end of march. so increasing earnings and free cash flow generation, we expect our net leverage ratio to be near the bottom of our target operating range of 2.5 times to 3.5 times by the end of the year asking further acquisition.
we are providing financial guidance for the second quarter of 2021 as shown on slide 17. as a result of improving economic conditions shown our outgrowth and the acquisition of xirgo, we expect to generate revenues between $960 million and $990 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing a reported revenue increase between 67% and 72% compared to the second quarter of 2020. at the midpoint of guidance, we expect that foreign currency will increase revenues year-over-year by approximately $23 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency, we expect an organic revenue increase of 58% and 63% in the second quarter. our current fill rate is approximately 96% of the revenue guidance midpoint for the second quarter. our fill rate appears stronger as compared to previous quarters. and some customers have extended their order lead time in order to better ensure supply.
we expect to report adjusted operating income between $195 million to $205 million. at the midpoint, operating income margin is expected to be 28.5%, which includes a 150-basis-point increase in our operating costs for the global semiconductor chips shortage, basically the entire auto supply chain toward other sectors.
on the bottom line, we expect to report adjusted net income between $134 million to $144 million and adjusted eps between $0.84 and $0.90, which includes a $0.01 increase of foreign currency at the guidance midpoint. at the bottom of the slide, we have provided an operating income margin walk on the second quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2021. this includes expected benefits from volume and productivity as well as higher costs associated with the semiconductor shortage, increased incentive compensation for our employees, increased megatrend investments, and unfavorable foreign exchange. as a reminder, the second quarter of 2020 included one-time savings of approximately $22 million from furloughs and temporary salary pay cuts.
we are increasing financial guidance for the full year 2021, as shown on slide 18. for the full year 2021, while a degree of market uncertainty remains and in particular the impact of the industrywide semiconductor shortage, we are anticipating a continuation of improved and stable economic and business conditions. we are also anticipating the return of normal seasonality, which included sequentially lower revenue in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and probably higher fourth quarter revenue, as compared to the third quarter. in addition, our financial guide now includes financial contribution of xirgo. accordingly we now expect to generate revenues between $3.675 billion and $3.865 billion for the full year 2021, representing reported revenue increase between 21% and 20.6% year-on-year.
at the midpoint of guidance, we expected foreign currency will increase revenues year-over-year by approximately $58 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency, we expect an organic revenue increase of 16% to 21% in 2021. we expect reported adjusted operating income between $755 million and $805 million, which includes the expected impact of the global semiconductor chips shortage now anticipated to continue throughout the year. at the midpoint, operating margin is expected to be 20.8%. on the bottom line, we expect reported adjusted net income between $509 million to $557 billion. we expect reported adjusted eps between $3.20 with $3.50, which includes a $0.03 increase from foreign currency at the midpoint guidance.
at the bottom of the slide we provided an operating income margin walk of 2020 to 2021 to show the moving pieces impacting margins, while improving and associate productivity have a great impact on our operating income margin, costs related to the semiconductor shortage, covid-related costs, incentive compensation for our employees, and megatrend investments also have a meaningful impact on our operating income margin.
on slide 19, we provided our revised estimates of oem production growth for 2021 as compared to our initial guide in early february. automotive production is expected to rebound sharply this year from last year, but slightly lower than expected in february, given further production slowdowns caused by the global semiconductor shortage. global automotive production is now expected to grow 12%. however, our heavy vehicle off-road and industrial end markets are now expected to grow faster in 2021 that we had communicated in february. these market assumptions are [phonetic] our current outlook for higher revenue in earnings this year.
in sum, sensata delivered an excellent first quarter despite broad supply chain disruptions. we expect a strong performance to continue through 2021 as demonstrated for the financial guidance we're providing today. driving this performance is our continued ability to achieve our growth targets, including the secular long market outgrowth targets, 400 basis points to 600 basis points for our automotive business, and 600 basis points to 800 basis points for heavy vehicle off-road business.
now let me turn the call back to jeff for closing comments.
jeff cote -- analyst
thank you, paul. let me wrap up with a few key messages, which are outlined on slide 20. sensata has responded very well through the rapid improvements in many of our markets demonstrating the strength, flexibility and reliability of our business in organizational model, which enabled us to capitalize on the recovery in end market demand. our ability to respond quickly to shifting demand positions us well as a trusted resource for our customers.
we are delivering attractive end market outgrowth. we remain confident in our ability to sustain this attractive end market outgrowth into the future based upon our strong levels of new business wins. we continue to invest in megatrends and other growth initiatives that are opening large and rapidly growing opportunities for sensata across all our end markets. we are making excellent progress in electrification, as evidenced by our new business wins as well as the acquisition of lithium balance in our joint venture with churod electronics, which extends our electrification offerings.
in smart & connected, we are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of xirgo technologies, and to welcome that team and that customer base to sensata. we continue to believe that the overall market environment may provide interesting opportunities to further strengthen our portfolio through strategically important, value-creating acquisitions and/or joint ventures. in addition, we are pursuing new technology collaborations and partnerships with third-parties to expand our capabilities and accelerate our megatrend growth. we expect to continue to continue to deliver industry-leading margins for our shareholders, while also investing in our growth and our people. and finally, i'm excited about sensata's on-standing mission to help create a clear, safer and more connected world, not just for our customers' products, but also through our own operations. we believe we are having a meaningful contribution to a better world. we are incorporating esg considerations into our strategy to help ensure the long-term sustainability and success of the company for all stakeholders. we look forward to report more on this topic in the future.
now, i'd like to turn the call back to jacob.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, jeff. given the large number of listeners on the call, let's try to limit yourselves to one question each please. andrew please assemble the q&a roster.
",2021-Q1,ST
1.0,1.0,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] and the first question comes from wamsi mohan with bank of america.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, thank you, and congrats on the solid results. i was wondering if you could delve a bit deeper into your inventory assessment that you have broken out, which is very helpful. where do you think this incremental inventory is building? and do you think that, that gets absorbed in calendar 3q, or does the guide include some further buildup of inventory?
and just a follow-up on that. you noted the sort of more conservative auto outlook versus ihs, is that just purely based on supply constraints? and does that set up for a better '22 given the fact that your auto production view has come down materially for the rest of '21? thank you.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, wamsi, and jeff and i'll both take that. in terms of the inventory estimate, how we do that is we have some centers that we ship that have very high market share. and based on the number of units we ship versus the production, we triangulate on a certain amount of our parts that are going into customer inventory versus going in to produce those vehicles. so it is an estimate, we think it's a pretty good estimate. and that's automotive.
and in the heavy vehicle, we do know that some of our customers are having initial provisioning for their ns vi-compliant platforms and that inventory will stick and stay in their inventory level. so we have a pretty good feel for it. it's not a perfect answer, but it's a good estimate.
in terms of what we're seeing around the second half of this year, we do think some of this inventory will unwind. we bring it back to last year in the third quarter, fourth quarter of 2020, we did see -- we did believe inventory levels were depleting at our customers. then they were building inventory, we think, in the first half. and then the second half of this year, we'll see some unwind. so it is having somewhat of an impact sequentially on our revenue in the automotive business.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
and on the second part of your question, wamsi, on the automotive outlook. i think you're right, that's the primary driver of our more conservative outlook, supply chain constraints. it's been well publicized. there are some significant challenges associated with it. you see it as consumers, in terms of lead times for vehicles, number of inventory days in north america at an all-time low. so having lived through that over the last year, experienced the challenges associated with it, we're taking a more conservative view for the balance of the year.
and your added comment regarding the outlook for next year, i think, is absolutely right. even with a recovery of 5% of -- in auto globally year-over-year, we see this substantially below where the peak markets for auto have been historically. so there's still a lot of tailwind for automotive growth of the markets that we're seeing in 2021.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, wamsi.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from samik chatterjee with jpmorgan.
samik chatterjee -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking the question. jeff, i just wanted to ask you kind of more on the acquisition comment that you had. and i think it sounds like given where the leverage is and given the kind of the success you're having, you sounded a lot more aggressive about full-swing acquisitions. can you give us some color about like the pipeline of opportunities you're looking at. what areas are you more focused on? and besides kind of insights and electrification, are you looking at any other kind of pillars of growth that you want to kind of also invest in? thank you.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes, great. so i'm not sure it's a more aggressive stance on m&a. we have a strong pipeline. we've had some good execution on m&a and joint venture-related activity already this year with lithium balance, xirgo, the churod joint venture. so we feel that we've got some really good momentum. we will stay very disciplined. the focus areas are around megatrends. so that's the exclusive focus of our m&a-related and joint venture-related activity. there'll be more bolt-on cereal. so the goal is to create more m&a growth every year rather than lumpy m&a growth.
and the criteria for m&a will be accretive revenue growth, differentiated margins. and again, we'll maintain our discipline in terms of evaluating opportunities and making sure we're highly confident we'll be able to generate returns for shareholders as well as expanding our presence in these markets that we're pursuing. hopefully, that's helpful.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, samik.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from luke junk with baird.
luke junk -- baird -- analyst
yeah, good morning, thanks for taking the question. jeff, just wondering if it would be possible to break out the $200 million in forecast 2021 electrification revenue that you had in the deck by these three major end markets, so auto, industrial and heavy vehicle. and maybe also if you could speak to the relative growth rates you're seeing this year between those as well at least qualitatively. thanks.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes, so it's going to be more disproportionately weighted toward auto given that's where the business is focused in terms of the ratio of our overall company revenue. so i would say broadly, apply the same end market exposure. we're seeing very substantial growth there. we've -- we quoted that last year, we had about $120 million of electrification business, so you can see it's substantial growth.
now some of that is coming as a result of the shift from internal combustion engines to electrified, but we see a lot of content growth there. we've talked in many other occasions regarding the fact that the transition to electrified platforms is a tailwind for us in terms of content per vehicle and also content per piece of equipment. and the opportunities, we see them as being even more significant outside of light vehicle auto, right?
so when you talk about power distribution units for commercial vehicles, the amount of opportunity we have to serve broad infrastructure plays in terms of charging stations, we've talked about that. so we see this as being a pretty broad-based play in terms of growth opportunity for us as a company.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, luke.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from joe spak with rbc capital markets.
joe spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, everyone. maybe just to get back to auto and the restock. i think last year you talked about maybe like $30 million to $35 million of restock and now it seems like another $35 million. so is the right way to think about that as the cumulative impact that -- of the inventory build? or did some of that stuff from last year already -- already get unwound?
and then i guess related, like when we talk to the automakers, it doesn't really sounds to us like they're going to stop taking product because they want to make sure they can complete the vehicles when they receive missing modules. so i'm wondering if this is, again, your unwind is just conservatism, if you think this can actually play out differently and maybe that inventory build unwinds slowly or bleeds out over time?
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and joe, last year, if i'm correct, i think we talked about inventories being depleted in the third and fourth quarter and then a rebuild of those inventories in the first half of this year. and like i said, we use -- we triangulate on that impact based on sensors with a very high market share that we're shipping into the marketplace that are at higher shipment levels in production. so it seems as if our parts are ending up in warehouses to possibly be there when they're actually able to get that last module to make sure they can release it to cars. we've been seeing a much stronger growth trajectory because of this inventory growth and we do think if some of it unwinds, unwinds in the second half. but again, this is our best forecast and we'll have to see how it plays in the third quarter.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
joe, want to add some color to what we're experiencing on this front, i think your observations are absolutely accurate, that our customers are going really deep on this. we're having multi-party conversations to make sure that we're being as coordinated as we possibly can regarding what we build to make sure that we can serve the customer. because at the end of the day, it doesn't help if there are parts that are not in inventory and the vehicle can't be produced because of another supplier. so there's a lot of coordinating activity that's occurring on that front to make sure that we can deliver what was a record revenue quarter. so a lot of work is being done to manage that process.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, joe.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from matt sheerin with stifel.
matt sheerin -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thanks. good morning. i wanted to ask about your commentary about the input costs, particularly semiconductor cost for you and your ability or inability to pass them along. have conditions maintained the same or worsened? and do you have any visibility into when your own supply picks up? and then in terms of passing through those costs, how are those discussions with customers going?
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the conversation with customers are going along as expected. it's a difficult conversation, but we're a strong partner and supplier to them. and so to the extent we can share those costs, they're willing to do that and we've had some success. so in the second half, the actual underlying gross costs are going up, but the recoveries are offsetting that. so good progress there, so that the net impact hasn't changed much from what we communicated back in april.
on the supplier side, jeff, i would say, you want to add in here, we continue to -- and particularly, we're being very aggressive here in second quarter to secure inventory to make sure that we have our strong position in terms of ensuring supply. we've gone into the spot markets to buy material and feel like we're pretty well positioned from an inventory perspective to be able to serve the demand that we're seeing in the second half. our inventory level is a little bit higher, but we're comfortable about it just given the disruption that is in the supply chain today.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
that's good.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, matt.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from amit daryanani from evercore isi.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my question. i guess my questions will be around the calendar '21 guide. and if i think about the auto production estimate that you have, i think you're taking it down by 700 basis points versus what you had 90 days ago. so i guess the two parts will be, a, what is driving such a big reduction in your estimate for auto production numbers, and i think the lowest number from any auto ecosystem company?
but secondly, you really haven't changed your overall top line assumption. so what is the offset to auto production coming down 700 basis points versus what you had 90 days ago, but the overall top line seems to hold up pretty well.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so we were trying to lay out for you that the auto production numbers that we see for q3 is flat with q2, because we don't see any real meaningful change in terms of the supply chain issues that the industry is dealing with. so it's flat q2 to q3. and then it improves in q4, moves up, but not as much as what the third-party forecasts are projecting. and i think the evidence would suggest that the third-party forecast, while coming down, are not coming down fast enough to reflect what actually happens in the quarter.
so we think at some point, we'll get aligned there. but we think our estimate and our projection of the automotive production is a good one. it's an appropriate level given what we're seeing in the supply chain and what we're hearing from customers about their struggles in terms of ramping up capacity. as it relates to what's offsetting, the heavy vehicle business continues to perform better as well as our industrial business. and so they are offsetting the decline that we're seeing -- actually more than offsetting the decline we're seeing, in the automotive.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, amit.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from brian johnson with barclays.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
yes, thanks. just want to get a sense, and thank you for the update on sensata insights, both on this deck and the teach-in on how you're going after the $800 million pipeline, kind of the timetable for translating that into bookings. and then given, as you pointed out at the teach-in, this is a fragmented market around telematics, kind of what are you finding is the winning formula to secure bids versus ones that go to competitors?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes, it's a great question. so let me start with -- the pipeline is what would be referred to as contract value rather than typical sales or value. so that is a little bit of a departure from how we would, as a company, normally refer to the opportunity pipeline that we see. so -- and that's the way that sort of those types of more subscription-based or recurring revenue-based aftermarket models tend to refer to things.
it's more than telematics, right? so at the core of the offering is an ability to take information off a vehicle and get it to the cloud in the form of a telematics device. but what we're experiencing in terms of engagement with customers, as we combine these, what was the xirgo and our internal smart & connected value proposition, is a much broader offering than just the telematics piece, right?
so sensata, if you remember from the teach-in, sensata brings the ability to get information off a piece of equipment through our very broad-based sensing capability. and then xirgo brought the ability to accumulate that, get it to the cloud and analyze and provide data insights or information that would be more valuable. and so that's really the value proposition.
clearly, they are leaders in terms of telematics, obd port translation and so forth. but the real longer-term value creation is around that sticky information that's provided once the information gets to the cloud and they can do something with it. and that's what we're experiencing, more pull from customers as we have a broader solution set. and it's building really nicely. the sort of thesis of the investment, combining it with the sensata portfolio is working out quite nicely. more to come, early days still, but we're excited about the opportunity there.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, brian.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from david kelley with jefferies.
david kelley -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, everyone. just hoping you could give us a sense of how you're thinking about outgrowth going forward and maybe specifically in autos, should we see a continued -- or do you expect to see a continued step-up in the second half outgrowth and specifically versus your longer-term targets of 400 to 600 basis points? and as we think about those outgrowth drivers, is there an opportunity that this kind of continued step-up in autos proves more structural?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes. so it's a great question. let me start with we're really excited about the fact that we're exceeding the targets. but you might note that in our prepared comments, we spoke to the outgrowth over the last 3.5 years, which in auto was just slightly above the 600 basis points. in hvor, it was considerably higher. so let me speak specifically to what's driving that in hvor. the auto one, we feel great about being at the high end of the range. we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to update guidance. but there's a lot of -- there are a lot of opportunities in the pipeline, those that we've won that give us confidence that we'll be -- we'll continue to be quite strong in auto.
the hvor requires a little bit more digging into because the outgrowth is being driven by a pretty broad range of opportunities, but there are two that are quite large in terms of driving it above the average of 600 to 800, and that relates to the ns vi rollout in china, which has about another six months to a year where until it's fully rolled out. so we would expect that to normalize a little bit. there are always other regulatory areas that will continue to drive, but ns vi was a big one driving that. so we're a little reluctant to change the 600 to 800 in hvor.
and the second is the conversion from mechanical hydraulic to electro hydraulic controls. we had seen a pretty significant spike and pull associated with north america and europe. and now we're seeing that in china as well. and so that's driving higher content than outgrowth values in the hvor business. so listen, at the end of the day, we're happy about being at or above the ranges. we'll continue to monitor it. and as we go forward and win the new business, we'll give updates as to what we're thinking.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, david.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from joe giordano with cowen.
joe giordano -- cowen -- analyst
good morning, guys. can you just talk about your relative positioning within evs like on the different types of platforms, like higher-end models versus lower-end models with different power requirements and how your -- how sensata's products are positioned in each of those?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
sure, so you'll recall that when we acquired gigavac back in 2018, we did that because they had premier positions in the highest and most premier vehicles. and by the way, just to make sure everybody understands, when we talk about those higher-end vehicles, they are vehicles that have longer ranges and shorter charge times. it's not necessarily luxury vehicles. in the ev space, when we're talking about the technology that we need to bring to bear to help the customer solve the challenge, it's around charge time and range, which is what consumers are pulling.
at the time of that acquisition, we had a belief that, that was going to be the direction where the market was going. we think that's still going to be the case. but there will be a lot of the middle market, sort of ev market that was underserved without having more broad capabilities. so we added the churod joint venture to the mix to allow us to be able to have a broader portfolio. so now i feel as though we're much better represented across all of those categories of electric vehicles.
and we're not done yet, right? so we continue to make organic investments and look for partnerships, jvs, acquisitions that will bring more capability to be able to serve these vehicle platforms as all of these customers adopt new models and they build out their next five, 10, 15-year strategy in terms of product portfolio. so really good success. we feel as though we're well covered now, not only across models, but geographically as well and we'll keep working on it.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance

operator
thank you. and our next question comes from william stein with truist securities.
william stein -- truist securities -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my question. one of the things we've recently learned from some of the semi suppliers and our industry contacts is that we're hearing about auto oe customers decontenting in sort of opportunistic fashion in order to complete kits and get cars shipped to customers, essentially rolling back some innovation in order to complete the builds. i'm wondering if you're observing this trend, whether it's affecting your business and if you're contemplating this in the guidance, thank you.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes, so it's an interesting one. obviously, oems are doing everything they possibly can to get more vehicles out. that is one of the tactics they're using. so let me give you an example. if we had migrated to a next-generation sensor with that oem due to cost reasons or whatever, tighter tolerances or faster response time, oems are willing to take a step back to go to the prior-generation sensor if the availability of the asic is there. it doesn't necessarily change the ability for them to meet the regulation, but there -- in some instances, there are cost implications associated with that. so as part of our product road mapping, we purposefully designed our new product to be able to give them a lower cost product going forward. and so sometimes we're taking a step back, we're having the commercial discussion regarding that. but at the end of the day, the goal is to help our customers get more vehicles produced so that they can sell more vehicles. and so that's one technique that they're using, and they're looking at a lot of different ways to try to figure out how to get a complete set -- chipset to be able to make the cars.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance

operator
thank you. and the next question comes from nik todorov with longbow research.
nik todorov -- longbow research -- analyst
thank you, guys. i understand that could be a hard-to-answer question, but what is your sense how much of your product could be sitting at partially built light vehicles or heavy vehicles right now? and how should that relate to the inventory destocking that you talked about?
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i don't think we have visibility to where it is in their supply chain, but we estimated about $25 million of build this quarter. things that we shipped that were in some -- it didn't go into a produced vehicle.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes. so that's all inclusive, right? it's hard for us to sort of really gauge where it sits. but when we do the math on our revenue growth and we back into the factors we know, including production numbers, we get about $25 million of inventory build in the quarter. hopefully, that's helpful.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, nick.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from rod lache with wolfe research.
shreyas patil -- wolfe research -- analyst
this is shreyas patil on for rod. just a question, how should we think about bridging from the first half to the second half of this year? end market production should be higher in automotive and you are raising industrial and hvor production and market expectations, but the guidance is implying about an 8% decline in revenue. and then just quickly, if you could help frame the content benefit from the conversion to electronic hydraulics that you mentioned for hvor?
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, on the revenue piece, it's -- like i said earlier, it's -- the reduction in automotive is being more than offset by improvements in both industrial and hvor. i mean the improvement in hvor and industrial are about the same in terms of the sequential step-up or at least relative to what we guided last time.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
on the second part of your question, just to make sure i understand it, are you looking for a little bit more visibility into what this conversion from mechanical hydraulic to electronic hydraulic is, is that the nature of your question?
shreyas patil -- wolfe research -- analyst
it was one of the reasons you're achieving the above your prior target in terms of outgrowth. i just want to understand what -- the benefit that is to sensata either on like a per vehicle basis or just some way to frame that.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes, got you. okay. so let me -- so the application is an electronic joystick or integrated armrest in an agriculture piece of agricultural equipment or construction equipment or material handling equipment. so it's not a $5 content item. joysticks or integrated armrest can have asps anywhere from $50 up to $600, depending on the complexity of the design. so it's significant content. the volumes, obviously, are considerably lower than what we would see in a light vehicle market, but the asps are quite high and they drive significant content as that pans out. hopefully, that's helpful.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, shreyas. and just to be crystal clear, i mean, in the second half versus the first half, we did talk about our industrial business coming back to its normal seasonal pattern, which is a weaker second half than the first half. and in the heavy vehicle business, while it's experiencing great outgrowth in the fourth quarter typically is a little bit lighter seasonally. so that kind of accounts for the first half and second half and then also the automotive business declining a bit due to the low production levels.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from michael filatov with berenberg capital markets.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
thanks, guys. just a quick question around aerospace. it looks like you're maintaining the market growth expectation for aerospace, but i think there are some indicators that suggest that the market backdrop is improving slightly. so just any commentary around aerospace market growth in the second half and if there's potential for upside, particularly because it's your highest-margin business?
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, it's a long-cycle business. it is largely -- demand is largely aligned to, as we said, oem production and the air traffic. it is getting better. but this is a business that's pretty small relative to the rest of sensata. so a few million of improved revenue, we'd expect to see in the second half versus the first half and it is very profitable. but it's not going to be a major needle mover this year, but it is showing signs of improvement, which is great news.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, mike.
operator
thank you. and at this time, as there are no more questions, i would like to return the floor to mr. jacob sayer for any closing comments.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, keith. i'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. sensata will be participating in upcoming virtual investor conferences this quarter, including jefferies technology conference and the rbc global industrial conference during the upcoming quarter. as jeff mentioned, we're also planning a teach-in about our electrification initiatives later in the year, and we'll share details of that event ahead of time.
we look forward to seeing you at one of those events or on our third quarter earnings call, which will happen in late october. thank you for joining us this morning and for your interest in sensata. keith, you may now end the call.

operator
good day, and welcome to sensata technologies second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions].
i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. jacob sayer, vice president of finance. please go ahead, sir.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, keith. good morning, everyone. i'd like to welcome you to sensata's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. joining me on today's call are jeff cote, sensata's ceo and president; and paul vasington, sensata's chief financial officer.
in addition to the financial results press release we issued earlier today, we will be referencing a slide presentation during today's call. the pdf of this presentation can be downloaded from sensata's investor relations website. this conference call is being recorded, and we'll post a replay webcast on our investor relations website shortly after the conclusion of today's call.
as we begin, i'd like to reference sensata's safe harbor statement on slide 2. during this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the financial performance of the company that involves risks and uncertainties. the company's actual results may differ materially from the projections described in such statements. factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our forms 10-q and 10-k, as well as other subsequent filings with the sec.
on slide 3, we show gaap -- sensata's gaap results for the second quarter of 2021. we encourage you to review our gaap financial statements in addition to today's presentation. most of the subsequent information that we will discuss during today's call will relate to non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations of our gaap to non-gaap financial measures are included in the earnings release and in our presentation materials. the company provides details of its segment operating income on slides 11 and 12 of the presentation, which are the primary measures management uses to evaluate the performance of the business.
jeff will begin today with highlights of our business during the second quarter of 2021. he will then provide an update on our recent progress in our key sensata's insights and electrification strategic growth areas. paul will cover our detailed financials for the second quarter of 2021, including organic and market outgrowth by business unit, our segment reporting and provide financial guidance for the third quarter and updated financial guidance for the full year 2021. we will then take your questions after our prepared remarks.
now i'd like to turn the call over to sensata's ceo and president, jeff cote.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, jacob, and welcome, everyone. i'd like to start with some summary comments on our strong performance during the second quarter of 2021, as outlined on slide 4. the business recovery we have experienced beginning in mid-year 2020 continued during the second quarter. we responded effectively to increased customer demand, which drove 72% revenue growth from the prior year to a record $993 million, slightly above the guidance range we provided in april. while automotive and heavy vehicle production for the period came in lower than expectations because of the semiconductor chip shortage, the industrial business was somewhat stronger. in addition, we benefited from -- during the second quarter from oem efforts to replenish channel inventories.
we delivered $209 million in adjusted operating income during the quarter, representing 21.1% operating margin, higher sequentially as well as substantially higher than prior year period. this underscores our leading industry positions, our success in pursuing strategic growth factors and the strength and flexibility of our manufacturing and commercial model. i'd like to recognize the innovation and hard work of the entire team in achieving these strong results during the second quarter.
looking at our performance year-over-year, we once again delivered strong market outgrowth, well above our target ranges. for the second quarter of 2021, we produced 2,850 basis points of outgrowth in our heavy vehicle off-road business and 990 basis points of outgrowth in our automotive business, excluding estimated inventory growth.
since the beginning of 2018, we have produced 950 basis points of outgrowth on average in our heavy vehicle off-road business and 615 basis points of outgrowth on average in our automotive business. paul will discuss our revenue outgrowth in more detail.
sensata today is in a substantially stronger financial position, in part because of our excellent performance over the past year. for example, we generated $127 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. our current cash balance of $1.9 billion positions sensata well to continue to acquire businesses that will expand our presence in the critical growth vectors of insights and electrification, where we have already shown important initial success.
based on our business wins in the first half of this year and the robust forward pipeline, we are confident that our new business wins in 2021 will exceed last year's strong level of $465 million. these new business wins demonstrates customer confidence in sensata and fuel our ability to deliver strong outgrowth in the coming years.
we continue to invest in our growth initiatives in areas driven by underlying megatrends and increased our organic investment to $14 million in the second quarter from $7 million in the second quarter of last year. these investments allow us to pursue significant opportunities and expand our product portfolio in high-growth areas.
on slide 5, i share an update on our meaningful progress in sensata insights. i'll remind you that we provided a teach-in on our strategy and positioning in this area in early june. a replay of that presentation remains on our website. the insights initiative addresses a market that is large and fast-growing and we are pleased by the traction we are gaining already with both current and new customers across various sectors.
our revenue is on pace to achieve $100 million annualized in 2021 and grow in excess of 20% per year over the next several years. we have a substantial pipeline of over $800 million of business opportunities that have been identified. and we are working diligently to close these opportunities to fuel growth. our efforts in this area enabled us to close $20 million of recent new business awards. at this point, we have a very strong backlog of committed orders, representing 100% of the revenue we expect to generate from insights for the balance of 2021. these accomplishments demonstrate the value we generate for our customers.
included in those new business wins is a large win with a global transportation services business to track their refrigerated containers. this win alone is worth over $10 million in revenue per year on average as it rolls out. in addition, we were awarded a $6 million order from a large insurance carrier to drive growth of their usage-based insurance offering. this important win represents an instance where we displaced an incumbent supplier.
in yet another example, sensata insights recently won wireless gateway and wheel-end sensor business from a leading north american heavy-duty trailer suspension manufacturer to enable tire inflation and monitoring in a contract worth over $9 million in annual revenue once that program launches. these wins will fan out over time, generating recurring revenue for our business as our customers adopt our solution set.
moving to slide 6. sensata is making excellent progress in winning new business in electrification, in part because we take a holistic view of electrification and its growing impact on all the segments we serve. while electric light vehicles capture a lot of attention, to us, electrification also includes electrified heavy vehicles and the charging infrastructure necessary to support this ecosystem.
sensata is already a leading provider of high-voltage protection on evs and charging infrastructure. as the underlying industries that enable electrification become more widespread, we intend to be a key participant, supporting our growing base of customers.
across our businesses, we have developed a substantial pipeline of over $600 million in electrification new business opportunities that our sales and engineering teams are cultivating. in the past two years, that pipeline has generated over $280 million in design wins that are in the development phase and in the coming years are expected to be incremental to our more than $200 million in estimated revenue from electrification solutions in 2021.
we continue to win new electrification business at an accelerated pace. during the quarter, a large, premier european heavy vehicle oem awarded sensata the design for a power distribution unit to help power their future electric commercial vehicles. power distribution units combine contactors, fuses and battery management systems, all provided by sensata. this strategically important business win is worth over $11 million in annualized revenue once it launches.
our joint venture with churod electronics announced last quarter extends our electrical protection capabilities to mass market vehicles and other electrified equipment requiring medium-voltage electrical protection. this jv is already being awarded new design wins, including the battery protection contactor business of a large european oem intending to produce evs for the china market worth over $6 million in annual revenue.
in addition, at the higher voltage end, we recently were awarded a contactor design from a north american oem, using these contactors for their electrified pickup trucks worth more than $18 million in annual revenue. this utilizes the gigavac robust solution. later in the year, we will webcast a teach-in covering our electrification initiatives so that listeners can gain a better understanding of our offerings in this space, the evolving market and our go-to-market strategies in this key growth vector for sensata.
in sum, i'm pleased with our progress against these initiatives which supports our increased investment to pursue these large, fast-growing markets driven by secular trends. as i've said before, we see numerous opportunities to utilize our strong financial position, our engineering capabilities, supply chain and customer relationships to meaningfully enlarge our addressable markets through organic efforts as well as bolt-on acquisitions and partnerships within these megatrends.
i'd now like to turn the call over to paul.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jeff. key highlights for the second quarter, as shown on slide 8, include record revenue of $992.7 million, an increase of 72.2% for the second quarter of 2020. organic revenue increased 62.9%. the acquisition of xirgo increased revenue by 4.4%. and changes in foreign currency increased revenue by 4.9%.
adjusted operating income was $209.3 million, an increase of 179% compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by elevated costs related to the industrywide semiconductor chip shortage, higher spend to support megatrend growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation aligned to improve financial performance.
second quarter of 2020, the prior year comparison quarter, included $21.6 million in savings related to temporary furloughs and salary reductions in response to the negative impact of covid-19 on our markets and business. adjusted net income was $151.4 million, an increase of 447% compared to the second quarter of 2020, largely due to the significant increase in operating income. adjusted eps was $0.95 in the second quarter, an increase of 428% compared to the prior year quarter.
now i will discuss our performance by end market in the second quarter of 2021, as outlined on slide 9. our organic revenue increase of 62.9% year-on-year is comprised of overall end market growth of approximately 45.4%, estimated customer inventory restocking of 6.1% and market outgrowth of 1,140 basis points for sensata.
our heavy vehicle off-road business posted an organic revenue increase of 95.7%, representing end market growth of 57.6%, estimated growth of 9.6% due to customer inventory restocking and 2,850 basis points of market outgrowth.
our china on-road truck business continued to post better-than-expected growth from the accelerated adoption of ns vi emissions regulations. and we are benefiting from both a wave of electromechanical operating controls being installed in new off-road equipment and early stages of radar installations on heavy vehicles as a safety feature. we do expect market outgrowth to remain high for the balance of the year for our heavy vehicle business as the ns vi regulations in china have led to substantially increased content per truck.
our automotive business posted an organic revenue increase of 74.9%, representing end market growth of 56.1%, estimated growth of 8.9% due to customer inventory restocking and 990 basis points of market outgrowth. our automotive business benefited from new product launches in powertrain and emissions, safety, in electrification-related applications and systems. vehicle inventories, especially in north america, remain in historic lows, signaling a tailwind to automotive market growth for the foreseeable future.
our industrial business increased 29.2% organically as global industrial end markets continued to recover in the quarter. strong growth in heating, ventilation and air conditioning, new electrification launches and supply chain restocking benefited our industrial business.
our aerospace business increased 20.6% organically, reflecting somewhat improved oem production in air traffic, which drives our aerospace aftermarket business. new product launches, primarily in defense, and improvements in aftermarket, enabled our aerospace business to grow faster than market this quarter.
one of the reasons our outgrowth to market is so high this quarter is that the comparison revenue in the second quarter of 2020 was unusually low, reflecting widespread plant closures in response to covid-19 outbreak. slide 10 deconstruct this dynamic for you, showing what would happen if we compare this quarter's outgrowth to our normalized quarterly revenue figure instead of the low point in 2020. the resulting adjusted outgrowth of 1,640 basis points for heavy vehicle off-road and 640 basis points for automotive are still well above our target ranges, and these numbers are more appropriate figures to compare to other quarters on a stand-alone basis.
now i'd like to comment on the performance of our two business segments in the second quarter of 2021, starting with performance sensing on slide 11. our performance sensing business reported record revenues of $741.9 million, an increase of 92.6% compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the positive impact from foreign currency of 5.8% and the positive impact on the xirgo acquisition of 6.6%, performance sensing delivered 80.2% organic revenue growth.
performance sensing operating income was $202.1 million, an increase of 232.6% as compared to the same quarter last year, with operating margins of 27.2%. the increase in segment operating income was primarily due to higher revenues, somewhat offset by elevated costs related to the industrywide semiconductor chip shortage. the prior year quarter included savings related to temporary furloughs and salary reductions. performance sensing generated incremental margin of 43% in the second quarter and higher organic revenue as compared to the prior year period.
as shown on slide 12, sensing solutions reported revenues of $250.8 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 31.1% as compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the positive impact from foreign currency of 3.1%, sensing solutions delivered 28% organic revenue growth.
sensing solutions operating income was $76.5 million, an increase of 37.1% in the same quarter last year, with operating margins of 30.5%. like performance sensing, the increase in segment operating income was primarily due to higher revenues somewhat offset by elevated costs from the industrywide semiconductor chip shortage. and again, the prior year quarter included savings related to temporary furloughs and salary reductions. sensing solutions generated incremental margin of 37% in the second quarter and higher organic revenue as compared to the prior year period.
on slide 13, corporate and other operating expenses not included in segment operating income were $74 million in the second quarter of 2021. excluding charges added back to our non-gaap results, corporate and other costs were $67.7 million, an increase of $27.8 million from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher research and development and business development spend to support our megatrend growth initiatives and higher global incentive compensation costs aligned to our improving financial performance. the prior year quarter included temporary savings from furloughs and salary reductions.
we currently expect approximately $50 million to $55 million in megatrend-related spend in 2021, up 70% in 2020, to design and develop differentiated, sensor-rich and connected data solutions for the fast-growing and transformational mega transactors of electrification and sensata insights.
slide 14 shows sensata's second quarter 2021 non-gaap results. adjusted operating income increased 179.1% and compared to the same quarter last year, and adjusted operating margin increased 810 basis points to 21.1%. the increase in both adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin largely reflects the rapid increase in revenue from depressed levels experienced last year due to covid-19 pandemic.
we acted early during the pandemic to reduce our cost structure while continuing to invest in megatrends that are shaping our end market that we believe will enable us to deliver long-term sustainable growth. we've included an adjusted operating income margin walk from the second quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2021 on the slide.
as shown on slide 15, we generated $127 million of free cash flow during the second quarter, representing an 84% conversion rate of adjusted net income. for the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85% of adjusted net income. for full year 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million.
sensata's net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 2.7 times at the end of june 2021. through increasing earnings and free cash flow generation, we expect our net leverage ratio to be near the bottom of our target operating range of 2.5 times to 3.5 times by the end of this year, absent further acquisitions.
we have provided financial guidance for the third quarter of 2021, as shown on slide 16. we expect to generate revenues between $920 million and $950 million for the third quarter of 2021, representing a reported revenue increase between 17% and 21% compared to the third quarter of 2020. excluding the impact of foreign currency in the xirgo acquisition, we expect an organic revenue increase of 12% to 16% in the third quarter.
our current fill rate is approximately 98% of the revenue guidance midpoint for the third quarter. our current fill rate appears stronger as compared to previous quarters and some customers in the industrial, in china transportation industries have extended their order lead times to better ensure supply. we estimate this extended ordering raises our fill by approximately 6% as compared to other periods.
we expect to report adjusted operating income between $189 million and $199 million. at the midpoint, adjusted operating income margin is expected to be 20.7%, which includes 140 basis points of increased operating costs associated with the global semiconductor chip shortage, net of customer recovery actions.
on the bottom line, we expect to report adjusted net income between $130 million and $140 million and adjusted eps between $0.82 and $0.88, which includes a $0.01 increase from foreign currency at the guidance midpoint. at the bottom of the slide, we have provided an adjusted operating income margin walk from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021.
we are tightening the range of financial guidance for the full year 2021 and raising the midpoint as shown on slide 17. for the full year 2021, while a degree of market uncertainty remains, in particular from the impact of the semiconductor chip shortage, we are anticipating a continuation of the improved and more stable economic and business conditions. we are also anticipating a return of normal seasonality, which includes sequentially lower revenue in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and roughly flat fourth quarter revenue as compared to the third quarter.
accordingly, we now expect to generate revenues between $3.77 billion and $3.84 billion for the full year 2021, representing a reported revenue increase between 24% and 26% year-on-year. excluding the impact of foreign currency and the xirgo acquisition, we expect an organic revenue increase of 19% to 21% in 2021.
we expect to report adjusted operating income between $782 million and $818 million, which reflects expectations for higher costs from the global semiconductor chip shortage and other inflationary impacts, somewhat offset by recovery actions we are pursuing with our customers. at the midpoint, our expectation for adjusted operating income margin is 21%.
on the bottom line, we expect to report adjusted net income between $544 million and $576 million and adjusted eps between $3.42 and $3.62, which includes a $0.05 benefit from foreign currency at the midpoint of guidance. at the bottom of the slide, we have provided an adjusted operating income margin walk from 2020 to '21 to show the moving pieces impacting margins.
on slide 18, we provide our revised estimates for oem production growth for 2021 as compared to the expectations we shared in late april. we currently expect automotive production to rebound this year from last year, but at a pace lower than expected in april given further production slowdowns caused by the global semiconductor chip shortage. we are diverging from ihs production estimates for the year with a forecast for auto production that is more conservative than ihs.
we currently expect global automotive production to grow 5% for the year as compared to ihs at 9% in their july update. in addition, we are expecting third quarter automotive production for our markets to be about flat with production reported in the second quarter of this year.
on the other hand, our heavy vehicle off-road and industrial end markets are now expected to grow faster in 2021 than we shared in april. and in line with its normal pattern, we expect our industrial business to be seasonally lower in the second half as compared to the first half of 2021. these assumptions underpin our current outlook for revenue and earnings this year.
in sum, sensata delivered an excellent second quarter with record revenue despite broad supply chain disruptions. we expect this solid performance to continue throughout 2021 as demonstrated by the financial guidance we're providing today.
now let me turn the call back over to jeff for closing comments.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, paul. let me wrap up quickly with a few key messages as outlined on slide 19. sensata has responded very well to the rapid improvements in many of our end markets, demonstrating the strength, flexibility and reliability of our business and organizational model. it's enabled us to capitalize on the recovery in the end market demand and deliver on customer orders. our quick response to shifting demand positions us well as a trusted resource for our customers.
we are delivering consistently robust end market outgrowth. we remain confident in our ability to sustain this attractive end market outgrowth into the future based upon our strong levels of new business awards and our large and expanding pipeline of new opportunities. we continue to invest in our megatrend-driven growth initiatives that are opening large and rapidly growing opportunities for sensata across all of our end markets. we are making excellent progress in sensata insights and electrification, as evidenced by the results so far this year as well as our new business wins in both areas.
we continue to believe that the overall business environment provides interesting opportunities to further strengthen our portfolio through strategically important, value-creating acquisitions or joint ventures. in addition, we are pursuing new technology collaborations and partnerships with third parties to expand our capabilities and accelerate our megatrend growth. we expect to continue to deliver industry-leading margins for our shareholders while also increasing investments in our growth opportunities and our people.
and finally, i'm excited about sensata's long-standing mission to help create a cleaner, safer and more connected world, not just for our customers' products, but also through our own operations. we believe we are meaningfully contributing to a better world. we are incorporating esg considerations into our strategy to bolster our long-term sustainability and success of the company for all of its stakeholders. we look forward to reporting more in the future on this topic.
now i'd like to turn the call back to jacob.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, jeff. given the large number of listeners on the call, let's try to limit yourselves to one question each. operator, please assemble the q&a roster.
",2021-Q2,ST
0.9993,1.0,-0.9989,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from wamsi mohan with bank of america. please go ahead.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, yes, thank you. i was wondering if you could maybe just give us some more color on the channel fill dynamics, how broad-based this is? if we use $30 to $40 of content per vehicle, we're talking about roughly 1 million units, but the production changes are quite large. and jeff, you noted that going into '22, it seems that ihs maybe is a bit too optimistic. so is the guide sort of 4q encapsulating all the channel inventory dynamics or do you think this persists into 2022? and if i could, could you also just maybe quickly talk about the china issues, both around power rationalization and resurgence of covid, if you're seeing any impact from that? thank you so much.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
sure. so let me touch on q4. so ihs forecast automotive production at about $16.5 million [phonetic], $16.6 million [phonetic], we've called it lower than that about $15 million. in addition, given that we know there has been some of our part -- parts built up in inventory, we are expecting a little bit of depletion on that. i think that's a little bit of a conservative guide, but we're watching it closely. we want -- we want to make sure that we're not going above and beyond to deliver for customers, so they could just have it sit in inventory. we'd rather address that as it occurs and serve other customers, because the shortage is impacting all of our customers and all of the end markets. as it relates to 2022, a couple of dynamics there. obviously, we're not providing guidance for '22, but we like to look ahead as everybody does.
specific as it relates to the automotive market, the call right now traditionally, ihs has been a little bit more aggressive in terms of their call. when we look at the supply chain challenges that we're facing, the bad news is, i think it will extend into 2022. the good news is that based upon the commit levels that we're seeing from our suppliers would suggest that fourth quarter may be the low point in terms of the ability to deliver. so as some of that capacity -- increased capacity comes online, we think there will be a mitigation from the fourth quarter level, so it will start to taper a little bit. so we'll keep monitoring that and give a perspective. but we're very mindful of that, we're mindful of the inventory that's been built, we're also mindful of the fact that north american vehicle inventory is at an all-time low, 24 days. so that's going to need to be replenished at some point. so there are a lot of moving parts in terms of the overall look, and obviously you have to look at the other end markets that we serve. automotive is a big one that we serve. when you look at the others, there is continued opportunity for growth in those markets as we go into q4 and also into 2022.
and i've lost the question on china, i think is just around what's happening there in terms of covid and so forth. the business is operating quite well there. it's amazing how resilient we have been, but everybody has been in terms of managing through this. we don't see any impact right now in terms of covid other than we're continuing with protocols. in the u.s., we're addressing the executive order associated with vaccine mandates. so there's still a lot of stuff that's happening in terms of engagement with our employees and making sure we keep them safe. but all-in, i feel as though it's become a little bit of the new norm for us and we're managing through that very well. hopefully, that answers your question, wamsi.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, wamsi.
operator
our next question comes from matt sheerin with stifel. please go ahead.
matt sheerin -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you and good morning. jeff, i just wanted to ask regarding your comment about doubling the ev content in light vehicles in the next five years from the base of about, i guess 20% incremental content today. where in that product portfolio would you see that coming? is that from your existing products and technologies or are there other incremental products or areas that you're looking at?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
a little of both, but candidly based upon my comments, i think the listeners probably can appreciate that we tend to be fairly digital in terms of what we've demonstrated. we got a lot of feedback that the 20% uplift was good, but not hugely exciting. we went back and realized that, that is demonstrated capability that we're experiencing right now. we've seen a very dramatic uplift in the wins that we've seen around electrified components with our automotive oems, but also with our other customers. we've talked about power distribution units and other major wins associated with electrification. and what we've now done is going back and said, ok, based upon the transition that we would expect, no one's going to get it perfectly right, but we know there is going to be a transition to migration more toward electrified vehicles. as we look at that and we also look at what we've sold with customers already, we see a line of sight to that doubling.
the thing is we quote net nbos. so when there is a -- there isn't a new socket, but it's the same socket in the new application that wouldn't count toward our nbo growth. and as we've said, there is a lot of content on vehicles that applies in battery electric vehicles, as well as internal combustion engines, so we don't have to rebuild that pipeline. but a further evaluation of that trend, continued wins, more investment that we're making, partnerships we're striking allow us to feel very confident in that trend in terms of being able to double the content per vehicle. hopefully, that's helpful.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, matt.
operator
our next question comes from amit daryanani with evercore. please go ahead.
amit daryanani -- evercore -- analyst
yes, thanks a lot and thanks for taking my question. i guess the question really, jeff, it's you, but i think when you talk about the december quarter guide, you're sort of implying that sensata's auto revenues will undergo auto production trend, assume that's due to depletion of your inventory that's sitting in the channel. is that's fair? is there a way to think about how much extra inventory sensata is out in the channel and how long does it take to normalize? and if i could just ask paul, could you just remind me how does free cash flow revert back to this 80% conversion, and does that happen in december or does that -- is it more a calendar '22 narrative?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yes, so i'll hit the q4 and then paul can hit the other topic. so we've already stated, we're expecting about 1.5 million units less than ihs in terms of actual production in the fourth quarter, but we also expect some of the inventory in the supply chain to deplete. so that's baked into the guide that we provided for the fourth quarter. in terms of the amount of inventory, call it $100 million to $125 million of inventory across the company that's been built, that's been largely for the last year, that's been largely focused in auto.
but i would also point out that if you also look at the north american vehicle inventory of 24 days just replenishing that back to a more normalized $50 million [phonetic] or $60 million [phonetic] would absorb a lot of that inventory in market. but as that production occurs, as that production is quoted, assuming our customers actually normalize their raw inventory, we will see production exceed our revenue. now i think it's a bit of a discussion that we're having with customers because they want all the parts we can make for them, right. they want to make sure that given the complexity of their bills, they are very willing to carry a little bit more raw material now, but we want to make sure again that we're serving all of our customers and it makes no sense for us to pay higher logistics cost and expedite fees to get customers product that sits in their inventory. so that's an ongoing dialog that we're having and we'll continue to manage it very closely and give you updates as we see it.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so the question i think is the 80% conversion relates to 2021, it's lower than we originally anticipated when we started the year and we made a conscious decision to build inventory, take on raw materials early to make sure that we were able to serve customers' needs, a conscious decision. for next year, i mean, we've been looking at a free cash conversion rate in the mid-80s, that's what we're going to continue to target as good performance versus 2020 [phonetic].

our next question comes from mark delaney with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
mark delaney -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, good morning and thanks very much for taking the question. so when you can elaborate on the supply chain dynamic that's underpinning some of the more cautious comments the company is providing as it thinks about the outlook for 4q and also into next year, what are some of the most difficult things as it relates to supply chain for sensata, any particular components that are most short for the company, and if you could talk about the shortages you're seeing not only for sensata, but what you think is maybe impacting some of your customers as well, and any added color on that i think would be helpful? thanks.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, sure. so first, obviously, it's an industry issue. i think everybody understands that it's not specific to sensata. it's most acute in electronics at the foundry level. so capacity at the foundry level, i think these are sort of pretty well-known facts and that capacity takes a while to get put in place. now over the last 18 months as that's been happening, obviously, our suppliers have been moving their capacity around to serve needs. i think we've done really well in terms of getting our fair share of that allocation. so that's a very positive thing. it's beyond electronics though, i mean, we all experience it in our everyday, everything is short today, right. supply chain issues, not only a capacity demand question, but just logistics in general is very challenged in terms of finding labor to unload container trucks and so forth.
so it continues to be a problem that everyone is experiencing. as we talked about in the past, many of our electronics are customized. so we feel as though we've been impacted less as a result of that, because in a lot of cases, those are areas that our suppliers would focus on as opposed to more standard off-the-shelf electronics. candidly, that's what's impacting our insights business a little more. the solution is differentiated and customized, but a lot of the electronics that go into it are more standard. so we're seeing a little bit more of a shortage and a crunch when there are standard asics that we're going after.
and then the last point i would make here is during 2021, first half of the year, we were being partners with our customers and we didn't go after a lot of this cost recovery, but the second half of '21, we've had more direct conversations with them. we've had some very good success. and given that this is going to continue both in terms of raw material costs and logistics costs, we're having those conversations with customers to make sure that sensata shareholders are not the ones that take the hit. we want to be good partners. we want to deliver, but we need to share in the costs associated with making sure we can continue to deliver.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, mark.
operator
our next question comes from luke junk with baird. please go ahead.
luke junk -- baird -- analyst
yeah, thanks and good morning. jeff, i was hoping you could comment further on the view that, that content here is on a path to double asics in the next five years. and i was hoping if we could specifically talk about some of the key levers and drivers that you're looking at, in particular, any products you see growing in importance for sensata? and maybe the best ones to look at this would be directionally, if we look at power-related products versus traditional sensing products, is there -- is there any additional color would be appreciated? thank you.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
sure, yeah. so if you were to rewind the clock three, five years, most of our components were obviously serving largely combustion engines. we've been very transparent about the activity that we've been undergoing in terms of m&a activity and additional engineering investment to make sure that we can serve our customers going forward. so that's the backdrop, right. we've always talked about the fact that although we have expertise in individual sensing parameters pressure, as an example, temperature position, we have thousands of products that we bring to our customers. we said -- we take modular technology and we package it in a way that serves the application with those traditional sensing parameters. it's not a lot different in the electrified world. so if you think of our contactor capability, we have the gigavac capability, we have the charade [phonetic] capability with higher levitation. we have e-motor position that we've transformed from position sensors that we have. we have building capability around current sensing. a lot of our pressure and temperature apply in terms of the environment for an electric platform.
so the goal is not to have one capability that we're relying on. it's to make sure that we're ubiquitous in terms of an ev platform. and the combination of the capabilities and product solutions that we have and poured over built on by the other applications like high-voltage, current sense -- sensing and also protection, we feel as though we've got a really good portfolio right now to be able to go to customers and help them solve the challenges that they're facing. we will continue to work at it, right. i mean, it's all -- a very small portion of the fleet yet, but there are a lot of wins that we're getting associated with solutions that we're bringing to our customers and it's been a very rapid growth of development around opportunities as we're working with those customers to bring things to market very quickly. and that trend has created more confidence in our ability to see this being a real significant tailwind to us as a company.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thank you, luke.
operator
our next question comes from brian johnson with barclays. please go ahead.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. just want to flesh out a little bit more the inventory question. i guess first question is, a lot of the pure auto suppliers have very severe decrementals to the stop-start nature production in the quarter. is most of the work you do in automotive from a catalog and therefore not customized to an oem, and does that allow you to have smoother decrementals when one model -- one factories up, one factories down on your customers' end?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, definitely not every one of our products. we have 15,000 different products that we bring to customers. they're not drop-in. they are very much customized to the application, many -- very frequently sole-sourced with them. i would just say that we've built inventory and we've -- i think we've managed through this better, we're not the bottleneck, right with our customers, which is a nice place to be. we're in escalation with a lot of customers, but i'll tell you i've talked with a lot of them and the feedback i get is, we're not the biggest problem, that's good.
i like not being the biggest problem and i'm ok with building a little bit of inventory to give a buffer, if you will, to our customers, but i do want to make sure that it doesn't get out of hand because eventually it's going to come around, right, they're going to take that inventory out at some point and then will lag the performance. so we don't want great performance during a tough time to result in a negative in the long-term. so we're keeping a close eye on it.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance

our next question comes from samik chatterjee with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
samik chatterjee -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yes, hi, it's samik chatterjee. hey, jeff. i guess when you outlined the content outperformance since 2018, and i think previously the narrative was about a 400 basis points to 600 basis points outperformance and you've consistently done better than that in both autos, as well as heavy vehicles. so i'm just thinking with the roadmap that you have on electrification and battery electric vehicles, when -- what are you thinking in terms of visibility in terms of raising that outperformance guide? and is it -- are there any concerns about hitting a air pocket as the transition happens in the industry or is it pretty much smooth sailing from here and that content outperformance should really start to continue to build from that level? thank you.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, thanks, samik. so historically, we've referenced outgrowth in automotive and hvor. i think to just make the story simpler, and by the way, we did that because of mix in the business and how it grows and so forth. we did it to create more transparency, but i fear that we might have complicated the story. at the end of the day, our goal is to make sure that as a company, we have outgrowth over market. we know markets will ebb and flow. that's the nature of the end markets that we serve. and that's why we've quoted the 570 basis points since '18 across the company. it's really driven by hvor and auto, but we do see outgrowth in industrial and aerospace as well, just not as pronounced.
the call for 400 basis points to 500 basis points go-forward and our confidence in that, again, it's what we have really strong confidence in. the more near-term outgrowth exceeding the targets, it has a lot to do with you're off a smaller base in 2020. so once we get into a more normalized environment, we would expect those outgrowth numbers to normalize a little bit. and so we just want more time where we've demonstrated beating the target before we raise. we're going to share what we have a high level of confidence in, but certainly, we've demonstrated the ability to do better than what we've said, and we're -- we'll aim to keep doing that, but we feel really comfortable with the 400 basis points to 500 basis points across the company, and then the other quotes of 400 basis points to 600 basis points in auto and 600 basis points to 800 basis points in hvor going forward. so hopefully that helps.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance

our next question comes from michael filatov with berenberg. please go ahead.
michael filatov -- berenberg -- analyst
hi, good morning guys. thanks for the time. just on the doubling of the ev content not to be the dead horse there, just the margin profile of that extra content you're seeing on electric vehicles, could you maybe talk about how that will impact on the business margin and maybe where that margin profile is more attractive within the actual electric vehicle content mix?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so we exclusively focus on really hard to do applications that will get -- that will achieve differentiated margins. so we steer very clear of commoditized applications that -- and use commoditized, that's probably unfair. applications that can be served with semiconductor packaging that don't require any sophisticated packaging and calibration, environmental control for harsh environments. they are valuable sockets, but others can serve them. where we do really well is in applications that are hard to do in harsh environments and that's where we bring a lot of capability, we always focus on them, right, and so we're not going to deviate, that generates the premier margins that we experience as a company.
now let me speak to how that will transition on new product launches. we've always seen new products that are at lower volumes have lower margins as they ramp, right. you're getting the kinks worked out of automated manufacturing, you're gaining scale on your raw materials, you're utilizing your factory capabilities in terms of absorption, your yields start to increase dramatically, but we are factoring that in. we don't see this transition as being hugely disruptive. the long-term margin profile of these products that we're engaging with our customers on will continue to have the differentiated margin profile that we have as an organization, as a company and we'll continue to make sure we do that. it's not -- it doesn't just happen, right. it's the building of the scale, it's making sure that we're constantly redesigning, sourcing differently to make sure that we can drive the margin profile and make sure that we're competitive from a cost standpoint.

our next question comes from william stein with truist securities. please go ahead.
william stein -- truist securities -- analyst
hi, thanks -- pardon me, thanks for taking my question. we've spoken quite a bit about inventory levels, but i still have a question about it. i'm looking to hopefully distill all of it into one comment. so can you remind us to what degree the inventory that you -- the excess inventory at your customers that you cited last quarter, do you believe was in raw form to them? in other words, they were holding your part versus in a car that was 99% complete, just waiting for one semiconductor to drop in. can you also remind us of the dollar inventory you believe was in excess last quarter, what that is this quarter again, because i've heard a couple of numbers, but i might have missed it? and then the timing that you expect that inventory to be depleted, and if that wasn't enough maybe also talk about the planned inventory builds that we've heard oems want to do for strategic components, does that affect you as part build planned? sorry for the long-winded question. thank you.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, well, i'll try to fill this down to something simple. so we -- we believe that our customers built about $25 million of inventory in q2 and $35 million this quarter, and so we're shipping to them above production. with that said, given the fact that we think we're very good supplier and we're not bottleneck, the assumption would be and there's no facts to support is that, that a lot of our parts are probably sitting in vehicles that are work-in-progress that will get released to the market at some point.
given the fact that we're shipping well, we're having lots of discussions to meet their order demand, there's a lot of anxiety in the supply chain. so that's how i would stack it up in terms of what's happening this year. hard to say when it's going to unwind, but to jeff's point, there's a lot of inventory levels in the dealerships are very low. so likely that's something that will need to get rebuilt, and so that's a positive. it's a positive tailwind to -- to what being seen right now. i don't think that's going to change much in the current supply chain constraints that we're seeing, but it's likely a long -- longer-term mitigating factor to some of this inventory that's been built in the channel today.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks for the question, will.

our next question comes from nick todorov with longbow. please go ahead.
nikolay todorov -- longbow research -- analyst
yeah, hi, thanks. good morning, everyone. jeff, i think i heard you talked about implementing a differentiated or different commercial approach to addressing the rising costs. maybe can you expand there, what are you doing differently, when you negotiate those with direct customers? and maybe can you talk about how much of the installation costs you've seen so far, you've been able to pass through to direct customers so far this year, and how should investors think about once we start the new calendar year in terms of passing through those? thanks.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
sure. so 2021, we've recovered about half of the costs that we've incurred, and given that we're expecting those costs to continue, we're going to aim to get all of that going forward. certainly, we've been able to achieve that in q3 and q4. so i'd mention that the first half of the year, we sort of held off on that until we determine whether or not it was going to be persistent. and it's not one size fits all. every customer is different, and the trade-offs are unique, and so -- but it's -- and it's very strategic in terms of how we're engaging with customers to optimize all of the levers that we have available. but we're committed to making sure that we serve our customers, but that we share in the costs associated with achieving that outcome.

our next question comes from rod lache with wolfe research. please go ahead.
shreyas patil -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks. this is shreyas on for rod. so just wanted to clarify a couple of points. so i think you had mentioned earlier there were about -- there was about $100 million to $125 million of inventory build that you've experienced so far this year. so should we be assuming that inventory basically unwinds as we go through q4 and then probably into next year? and is that embedded in that four points to five points of growth over market that you were kind of talking about before? and then you mentioned that you're starting to see a recovery in some of the supply chain costs that you've been incurring this year. so does that suggest that, all else equal, the headwind that you're experiencing this year would likely moderate if you continue to receive those recoveries?
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, it's paul. a couple of things. we talked -- there's a year-over-year impact that you have to take into consideration. last year, inventories were contracting, this year they're building. so we look at it on a year-over-year basis. it's bigger than whatever got built this year because we had inventory contracting last year.
as it relates to q4, we've been benefiting from this build, shipping above production. in q4, we're assuming we're going to be pretty much delivering to production, but last year there was a contraction. so it's how you want to think about year-over-year versus sequential, but just think of q4 as largely related to the production that's being estimated -- we're estimating 50 million [phonetic] is what we're going to serve, 50 million [phonetic] cars that's floated in the fourth quarter.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
and the only other thing i'd mention is, i think you commented about the outgrowth, we exclude inventory from the outgrowth that we quote.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah.
shreyas patil -- wolfe research -- analyst
right, it's a great market when its material.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, rod.
shreyas patil -- wolfe research -- analyst

our next question comes joseph spak with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
joseph spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much. and not to be the dead horse here, but i know you're sort of talking about your fourth quarter outlook below ihs and i know we got to make some adjustments there because you look at it on your mix basis and exclude xirgo, etc. but even if you do that, it seems like production is at least flattish, if not still higher than the third quarter, and then you're guiding the total revenues down sequentially. so it does seem like you're assuming a good amount of that inventory unwinds. and i'm just trying to understand that because going back paul to your comments, i mean, it seems like automakers might not really be in a position to have that happen in the near-term given the dealer inventory situation? so i just want to try to square those two sentiments.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
just trying to keep it really simple, i mean, our q3 revenue production was $14.4 million [phonetic], but we benefited from inventory build, right. in q4, production is $15 million [phonetic], so it's up about 4%. we're not assuming that inventory builds will continue, that's the difference, and our automotive business is slightly down. you're right, sequentially. those are the dynamics because we're not expecting to get that additional revenue from shipping more than what's being produced at the oem.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, and that's auto, right. so on hvor, q3 to q4, we're expecting the market to contract a little bit, industrial q3 to q4, we're expecting the market to contract a little bit.
joseph spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's seasonal.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, that's seasonal, right, but that's -- that -- it has to be factored into the q3, q4 transition as well. aero is the other one, that's up a tiny bit from q3 to q4. so when you look at the whole mix of the business, it's complicated, but when you look at the whole mix, the guide makes sense and it's just a lot of moving pieces.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and the fill is at 95%, a little bit less than last quarter, but last quarter, we're expecting more orders to drop out, given some of the shutdowns we're expecting a little less than that. so that's why the fill being a little lower, you think is appropriate given where we're forecasting the revenue to be at the midpoint of guide. it's largely consistent with what we saw in q3.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, joe.

our next question comes from david kelley with jefferies. please go ahead.
david kelley -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning guys and thanks for taking my question. maybe just a question on the fourth quarter margin guidance and the sequential view, the step-down from q3, i'm assuming in part related to this sequential guided revenue step-down. but could you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about some of the sequential input cost levers into the fourth quarter or if there's anything mix related we should be thinking through in modeling?
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you got it right. the difference from q3 to q4, the drop, we are dropping about $40 million-ish in revenue and about $16 million is coming out on the bottom line. so it's convert -- a lot of it is just volume conversion and leverage that we lose. there is a little bit of expectation of higher logistics costs as logistics rates continue to eke up just given the constraints are global logistics channels. those would be the two main drivers sequentially.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, david.
operator
our next question comes from chris snyder with ubs. please go ahead.
chris snyder -- ubs -- analyst
thanks for squeezing me in. also just kind of want to follow up on the commentary on the ev content per vehicle can be double ic within five years, because this is a really significant change from the recent plus 20% run rate. so just trying to unpack this more, as i guess it's not super clear to me, what is driving that 80% delta relative to expectations just three to six months ago? is it that the market opportunity is stronger than previously thought? are share gains accelerating kind of based on what you're seeing on orders? and i just want to confirm this does not include incremental m&a?
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, it does not include incremental m&a, and so the -- again, the 20% is a demonstrated capability. if you take in 2020 and 2021, total revenue from electric vehicles divided by electric vehicles produced, it's a 20% uplift from the balance of the automotive business, right. so it's a demonstrated. there's a lot that needs to happen in terms of seeing how those vehicle platforms roll out, but the business -- a lot of the business is one. we have a long cycle business, right. so the last several years, we've quoted the amount of new business wins that we've had that are really specifically focused on electric vehicles. we're getting a better feel for what capability or what products that we have will pour right over into the new electrified platforms as our customers start to put the finishing touches on their launch schedules associated with those.
and so we're just providing the visibility into the next three to five years what we see and how that will transition. it's -- no one knows that the final answer is to how many electric vehicles, but if you use 25%, 30% total electric vehicle park in five years, markets going to grow, contents going to continue to grow, and obviously in the electric vehicles, we're going to continue to see incremental content on those vehicles in the light vehicle market, but even more accentuated in some of the stationary equipment and heavy vehicle market, where we're providing more than just sensor content. so it continues to be a really exciting, fast moving area that will continue to provide data points and reference points, so that you can monitor our progress.

joseph giordano -- cowen -- analyst
hey, guys.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
hi.
joseph giordano -- cowen -- analyst
i think we've got the most of the things at this point, but just curious your -- when you scale your content, things like that, like what does that contemplate in terms of megatrend spend associated with that? and particularly as you do all these kind of bolt-on [technical issues], does that megatrend number ramp with that? how do you kind of see that going over the next several years?
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think for next year we're -- our current planning model is to staying at $50 million, $55 million range for megatrend spend. the composition of that spend may change. it may end up pivoting more toward where we think the greatest success will be in terms of scaling growth. so more to come on that as we develop our guide for next year, but the aggregate number, right now the target is about keeping at that $55 million level.

our next question comes from jim suva with citi. please go ahead.
jim suva -- citi -- analyst
thank you for all the details thus far. a question on the logistics and the supply chain issues. are you having to or starting to consider put into your contracts like additional riders or i guess indexing to raw materials or shipping or things like that, because i'm just wondering if these things are prolonged, so it could potentially protect your profitability. so i'm just kind of wondering how it's going because i know you have very long-term relationships with your customers and a long sight of visibility into the designs? thank you.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, so it's a great question, jim. our typical contracts, it was not unusual to have a rate of exchange riders or metal commodity riders in them. but inflation riders are something that i don't -- i haven't seen in a lot of commercial agreements, but we're clearly having those conversations. that's the legal side of it. the reality is, is that our customers want us to be able to serve them. we do have very long-standing decades, long relationships with our customers. and we'll get to the right answer with them in terms of navigating through this challenge. again, it's not -- it's never an easy conversation to have this type of discussion with customers, but they understand the world we're living in. they understand that the world that everybody is living in, and for the most part, we feel good. but we will drive more into the contractual element, but it's a dialog with them around how we partner.

operator
good day, and welcome to the sensata technologies q3 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. jacob sayer, vp, finance. please go ahead.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
thanks, sarah, and good morning, everyone. i would like to welcome you to sensata's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. joining me on today's call are jeff cote, sensata's ceo and president; and paul vasington, sensata's chief financial officer. in addition to the financial results press release we issued earlier today, we will be referencing a slide presentation during today's conference call. the pdf of this presentation can be downloaded from sensata's investor relations website. this conference call is being recorded and we will post a replay webcast on our investor relations website shortly after the conclusion of today's call.
as we begin, i would like to reference sensata's safe harbor statement on slide 2. during this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. the company's actual results may differ materially from the projections described in such statements. factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our forms 10-q and 10-k, as well as other subsequent filings with the sec.
on slide 3, we show sensata's gaap results for the third quarter of 2021. we encourage you to review our gaap financial statements in addition to today's presentation. most of the subsequent information that we will discuss during today's call will relate to our non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations of our gaap to non-gaap financial measures are included in the earnings release and in our presentation materials. the company provides details of its segment operating income on slides 12 and 13 of the presentation, which are the primary measures management uses to evaluate the performance of the business.
jeff will begin today's call with highlights of our business during the third quarter of 2021 followed by a quick review of our first sustainability report published recently. he will then provide an update on recent progress in our key electrification and sensata insights, strategic growth areas, paul will cover our detailed financials for the third quarter of 2021, including organic revenue growth and market outgrowth by business, as well as segment performance and he will also provide financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021. we'll then take your questions after our prepared remarks.
now i'd like to turn the call over to sensata's ceo and president, jeff cote.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, jacob, and welcome everyone. i'd like to start with some summary thoughts on our strong performance during the third quarter of 2021 as outlined on slide 4. the business recovery that began this time last year continued during the third quarter. we responded effectively to increase customer demand, which drove 20.6% revenue growth from the prior year period to $951 million, slightly above the guidance range we provided in july.
while automotive production was constrained during the quarter due to supply chain shortages, we were able to deliver our customers' orders and produced strong financial results for shareholders. looking at our performance year-over-year, we once again produced strong market outgrowth well above our target ranges. as a company, we delivered 1,190 basis points of outgrowth during the quarter. however, outgrowth is something that we monitor over a longer period of time than one quarter. and since 2018 on average, we have produced 570 basis points of outgrowth as a company, driven by a 1,050 basis points of outgrowth in our heavy vehicle, off-road business and 650 basis points of outgrowth in our automotive business. this demonstrates the vital role we provide for our customers in these key markets.
paul will discuss our strong revenue outgrowth in more detail. sensata's revenue outgrowth to market will increasingly be driven by our enhanced positioning in megatrend areas. we continue to invest in these growth initiatives, both organically and inorganically, with xirgo and now the pending acquisitions of spear power systems and smartwitness expanding not only our capabilities, but also our access to end markets and product portfolios in these pivotal areas. already, we have seen strong revenue growth coming from our electrification activities. with more than $220 million in estimated revenue this year, we expect continued significant growth in our megatrend areas over the coming years, driven by electrification trends, the infrastructure requirements to support electrification and the proliferation of iot on stationary and mobile equipment.
sensata today is in a very strong financial position, in part because of our excellent performance over the past year. we have generated more than $530 million in free cash flow over the past 12 months. and our current cash balance of $2 billion enables sensata to continue to acquire targeted innovative businesses that will expand our presence in our targeted growth vectors. during the third quarter, we benefited from a resilient, flexible and focused organization that continues to successfully navigate the ever-changing supply chain landscape and deliver on our customers' needs. not surprisingly, we continue to see elevated costs related to the worldwide material shortages and logistics costs. we are working diligently to limit those effects, including a different commercial approach with our customers. this is a challenging exercise, but very necessary under the current circumstances. despite these elevated costs, we delivered $201 million in adjusted operating income during the quarter, representing 21.1% in operating margin, substantially higher than the prior year period.
i'd like to recognize the innovation, agility and hard work of our entire team achieving these strong results during the third quarter. during the quarter, sensata published its first sustainability report and we're very proud of our progress in these areas. virtually every product sensata makes today results in a cleaner, safer and more efficient world. we also take our responsibility to reduce the carbon emissions from our own operations and our supply chain very seriously. to that end, we are targeting a 10% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2026, and we have established a goal to be carbon-neutral by 2050 in line with leading companies around the world.
in addition, our report addresses sustainability topics core to sensata's mission, including diversity, equity inclusion and responsible sourcing. we believe that diversity benefits our employees, customers and shareholders and that a diverse workforce provides or makes us a better company. we have established goals for our leadership team to improve female representation and management roles at sensata to 30% and to reach 25% racial diversity in u.s. management roles by 2026, while reducing turnover, improving internal development and promotion rates. we are serious about achieving meaningful progress against these goals and consequently are tying a portion of senior executive short-term incentive compensation to annual improvements. we look forward to keeping all our stakeholders updated on these and other important esg initiatives in the coming years.
moving to slide 6, sensata is making excellent progress in winning new business in electrification components, in part because we take a holistic view of electrification and its growing impact on all the segments we serve. electric light vehicles capture a lot of attention and sensata provides the manufacturers of these vehicles with not only new ev specific components, but also with many of our innovative and differentiated components from traditional vehicles, like braking, tire and environmental control. specific to evs, we also provide and are developing several components that enable safe and efficient operation of electrified platforms, such as high-voltage electrical protection, advanced temperature sensing, highly sensitive electric motor position and next-generation current sensing.
as an example, during the third quarter, we were awarded new e-motor position business with a large european oem, representing $2.6 million in annual revenue. in addition, we benefit from the upgrading of certain systems in evs. for example, when the climate control system is upgraded to a heat pump to manage the temperature of both the cabin, as well as the battery pack, the sensor package is operated and sensata benefits. in the important area of braking, sensata is a global leader. during the quarter, we won two new business opportunities that were significant, one with brake system leader, continental for new and electronic stability control systems, covering both traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, as well as a greater than $11 million in new business on electric vehicles that further extends our leadership position in that market.
we have described the revenue increase that we received from evs as compared to internal combustion vehicles in terms of an average 20% uplift in content per vehicle. this is a demonstrated figure based on actual revenues and vehicle production. our design win activity within electrification has been growing rapidly. we saw an 80% rise in electrification wins last year. and so far this year, approximately 50% of our automotive design wins are with electric vehicles, another dramatic uptick from the prior periods. looking forward based upon the business wins we're gaining and the products we are developing, we estimate that our battery electric vehicle content is on path to double that of an internal combustion engine vehicle on average within five years.
on slide 7, we show how sensata is expanding in clean energy solutions, moving up the stack from high-voltage components used by large customers with the resources to design these into their electrified offerings to subsystems and full battery energy storage systems for customers in a multitude of end markets. electrification is happening everywhere, not just in passenger vehicles, manufacturers or bikes, heavy trucks, material handling equipment, marine vessels and even aircraft and spacecraft are addressing ever tightening greenhouse gas emissions regulations and taking advantage of falling battery costs to provide electrified solutions to their customers.
however, not all of these customers can design all aspects of the electrified solution in-house. thanks to capabilities we have added via acquisition, sensata can now provide either the subsystem of assembled components to manage battery charging in the form of a power distribution unit or using technology from lithium balance and spear power, we can provide the full energy storage system, including battery management and a customized battery pack. by providing a full suite of offerings, our electrification and clean energy solutions, serviceable addressable market expands dramatically, reaching $15 billion by 2030.
as an example of the solutions we offer during the quarter, a large premier european heavy vehicle oem awarded sensata the design or a megawatt size charging unit to help power their future electric commercial vehicles. this strategically important business win is worth more than $20 million in annualized revenue once it reaches its expected production run rate. this pivotal development means we can increase our content per heavy truck from the current 100 to 200 on average to more than a 1,000 per electric heavy vehicle. in addition through the pending acquisition of spear power, we can provide full battery storage systems for a variety of specialty transportation markets. for example, spear is powering electric ferries, including the upgrading to electric of the washington state ferry system. these are highly demanding solutions that include very robust safety features proprietary to spear and we're excited about the role spear is playing in these and other land, sea and air transportation markets.
similar to what we did for our insights group back in june, in early 2022, we'll webcast a teach-in covering our electrification components and clean energy solutions initiatives, so listeners can gain a better understanding of our offerings, the evolving markets and our go-to-market strategies in these key growth vectors for sensata. we look forward to sharing more details about these rapidly growing and evolving areas then.
on slide 8, we share an update on our continued progress in sensata insights. the insights initiative addresses a fast and growing market and we're pleased by the traction we're gaining with both current and new customers across various sectors. the ongoing widespread semiconductor shortage is constraining our insights business and we are unable to deliver on all of that expanding demand. you'll recall that these solutions are designed into customers' fleets, the revenue is sticky and so our orders are billing -- building for future delivery once these shortages subside. our insights order book for delivery over the next 12 months now stands at more than $85 million. as evidenced by the value-added nature of our solutions, we were recently awarded new business with telematics service providers and large -- a large global shipping company together worth more than $9 million in revenue over the next 12 months.
i'm also pleased to announce the expansion of our insights offering with the pending acquisition of smartwitness, a privately held innovator of video telematics technology for heavy and light-duty fleets. smartwitness solutions comprise proprietary software and hardware, purpose-built for telematics service providers providing a complementary fit with our insights business. since its founding in 2007, smartwitness has been a pioneer in video telematics that expands on traditional offerings to include contextually aware data capture that enhances the monitoring of vehicles, their surrounding -- and their surroundings to increase safety and lower insurance costs for fleets. smartwitness systems are logging 50 million miles of information every day. in sum, we're really encouraged by our continued progress in our megatrend growth initiatives. as i've said before, we see numerous opportunities to utilize our strong financial position, our engineering capabilities, our supply chain and our customer relationships to meaningfully enlarge our addressable markets through organic efforts, as well as bolt-on acquisitions and partnerships within these megatrends.
i'd now like to turn the call over to paul.
paul s. vasington -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jeff. key highlights for the third quarter as shown on slide 10 include revenue of $951 million, an increase of 20.6% from the third quarter of 2020. organic revenue increased 16.6%. the acquisition xirgo increased revenue by 2.3% and changes in foreign currency increased revenue by 1.7%. adjusted operating income was $201 million, an increase of 29.8% compared to the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by elevated costs related to the industrywide supply chain shortages, higher spend to support megatrend growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation aligned to improve financial performance. adjusted net income was $138.6 million, an increase of 33.8% compared to the third quarter of 2020, largely due to the significant increase in operating income. adjusted eps was $0.87 in the third quarter, an increase of 31.8% compared to the prior year quarter.
now i'll discuss our performance by end market in the third quarter of 2021 as outlined on slide 11. organic revenue increase of 16.6% year-on-year includes market growth of 470 basis points and outgrowth of 1,190 basis points, again demonstrating sensata's ability to consistently outgrow its end markets. our heavy vehicle, off-road business posted organic revenue increase of 58.9%, representing end market growth of 31.4% and 2,400 basis points of market outgrowth in the third quarter. our china on-road truck business continued to post better than expected growth from the adoption of ns vi emission regulations. and we are also benefiting from a wave of electrical, mechanical operator controls being installed in new off-road equipment.
our automotive business posted an organic revenue increase of 5.2%, representing end market contraction of 21.6% and 1,150 basis points of market outgrowth. our automotive business benefited from new product launches and powertrain emissions, safety and electrification-related applications and systems. recall, we saw an approximate $35 million inventory contraction a year ago, as the automotive industry ramped up production from slowdowns -- shutdowns earlier in 2020.
in addition, we were able to fill customers' orders within the current quarter, even if those shipments exceeded the eventual production in the quarter due to other component delays. within the third quarter of 2021, we estimate an incremental build quarter-over-quarter of approximately $35 million of inventory at our customers. our industrial business revenue increased 17.9% organically, as global industrial end markets continued to recover in the quarter. strong growth in new electrification launches and heating, ventilation and air conditioning enabled our industrial business to grow faster than market this quarter. our aerospace business increased 8.3% organically, reflecting somewhat improved oem production and air traffic that later drives our aerospace aftermarket business. new product launches, primarily in defense and improvements in aftermarket enabled our aerospace business to grow faster than market this quarter.
now i'd like to comment on the performance of our two business segments in the third quarter of 2021, starting with performance sensing on slide 12. our performance sensing business reported revenues of $706.5 million, an increase of 21.6% compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the positive impact from foreign currency of 1.8% and the positive impact from the xirgo acquisition of 3.1%, performance sensing delivered 16.7% organic revenue growth. performance sensing operating income was $193.7 million, an increase of 27.8% as compared to the same quarter last year with operating margins of 27.4%. the increase in segment operating income was -- was primarily due to higher revenues, somewhat offset by elevated costs related to the industrywide supply chain shortage. performance sensing generated incremental margin of 37% in the quarter on higher organic revenue as compared to the prior year period.
as shown on slide 13, sensing solutions reported revenues of $244.6 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 17.9% as compared to the same quarter last year. excluding the positive impact from foreign currency of 1.5%, sensing solutions delivered 16.4% organic revenue growth. sensing solutions operating income was $75.3 million, an increase of 29.3% from the same quarter last year with operating margins of 30.8%. the increase in segment operating income was primarily due to higher revenues. sensing solutions generated incremental -- incremental margin of 46% in the third quarter on higher organic revenue as compared to the prior year period.
on slide 14, corporate and other operating expenses, not included in segment operating income were $72.7 million in the third quarter of 2021. excluding charges added back to our non-gaap results, corporate and other costs were $65.7 million, an increase of $12.3 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher research and development and business development spend to support our megatrend growth initiatives and higher global incentive compensation costs aligned to our improving financial performance.
slide 15 shows sensata's third quarter 2021 non-gaap results. adjusted operating income increased 29.8% compared to the same quarter last year and adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 21.1%. the increase in both adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin largely reflects the rapid increase in revenue from depressed levels experienced last year due to the covid-19 pandemic, offset somewhat by increased costs related to industrywide supply chain shortages net of recovery of some of these costs from customers. we've included on the slide an adjusted operating income margin walk from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021.
as shown on slide 16, we generated $88 million in free cash flow during the third quarter. free cash flow was impacted in the quarter by our decision to increase raw material purchases early in the quarter in order to maximize production flexibility, given the widespread part shortages in our supply chain. for the full-year, we currently expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 80% of adjusted net income as a result of higher inventory levels. for the full-year 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $145 million to $155 million. sensata's net debt to ebitda ratio was 2.5 times at the end of september, the bottom end of our target operating net leverage range. sensata's primary use of cash on hand is to acquire businesses that will extend our market position within our key growth vectors of electrification and insights. in addition, we intend to resume our share repurchase program within the fourth quarter, and as noted, we have $302 million available on our current repurchase authorization.
we are providing financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021 as shown on slide 17. our expectations are based upon the end market outlook that i will discuss momentarily. we expect to generate revenues between $895 million and $925 million in the fourth quarter 2021, representing reported revenue change between a 1% decline and 2% growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, with the impact of foreign currency increasing revenues at the midpoint of guidance by about $2.6 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency and the xirgo acquisition, we expect an organic revenue change ranging from a 3% decline flat in the fourth quarter.
our current fill rate is approximately 95% of the revenue guidance midpoint for the fourth quarter. we expect to report adjusted operating income between $180 million and $190 million. at the midpoint, adjusted operating income margin is expected to be 20.3%, which includes 100 basis points of increased operating costs associated with global supply chain shortages net of customer recovery actions. on the bottom line, we expect to report adjusted net income between $121 million, $131 million and adjusted eps between $0.76 and $0.82, which includes a $0.02 increase from foreign currency at the guidance midpoint. at the bottom of the slide, we have provided an adjusted -- an adjusted operating income margin walk for the fourth quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2021.
on slide 18, we provide our revised estimates for oem production growth for 2021 as compared to the expectations we shared in late july. we currently expect automotive production to be down approximately 3% this year from last year, given ongoing production slowdowns caused by global supply chain shortages. our outlook is more conservative than ihs automotive production estimates for the fourth quarter, as we do not see production constraints from the global supply chain shortages lifting in the near-term. while we are not sharing specifics yet, the current ihs global automotive production expectations of 10% growth in 2022 suggest that supply chain shortages will be considerably next year, a view we do not share given current trends.
we intend to provide detailed financial guidance for 2022 during our fourth quarter earnings call in early february. however, at a high level, we currently expect sensata's revenue growth in 2022 to align with the growth framework we have previously shared. sensata's revenue by end market should grow consistent with each market's production growth, plus our targeted outgrowth of approximately 400 basis points to 500 basis points across the whole company. in addition, we intend to continue our serial m&a approach to further expand our market position in our megatrend areas, we aim to have this activity add a material amount to revenue growth each year.
now, let me turn the call back to jeff for closing comments.
jeffrey j. cote -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, paul. let me wrap up with a few key messages as outlined on slide 19. sensata has responded very well to the rapid changes in many of our end markets, demonstrating the strength, resiliency and reliability of our business and organizational model, which enabled us to capitalize on this recovery and the end market demand and deliver for our customers. our quick response to shifting demand positions us well as a trusted resource for our customers. we are delivering consistently robust end market outgrowth. we remain confident in our ability to sustain this attractive end market outgrowth into the future based on our strong levels of new business awards and our large and expanding pipeline of new opportunities. we continue to invest in our megatrend-driven growth initiatives that are opening up large and rapidly growing opportunities for sensata across all of our end markets.
we are making excellent progress in electrified components, clean energy solutions and sensata insights, both through organically targeted areas around new business and through inorganic activity associated with bolt-on acquisitions. we continue to believe that the overall business environment provides interesting opportunities to further strengthen our portfolio through strategically important value-creating acquisitions and/or joint ventures. in addition, we are pursuing new technology collaborations and partnerships with third-parties to expand our capabilities and accelerate our megatrend-driven growth potential.
we expect to continue to deliver industry-leading margins for our shareholders, while also increasing investments in our growth opportunities and our people. and finally, i'm excited about sensata's long-standing mission to help create a cleaner, safer and more connected world, not just for our customers' products, but also through our own operations. we believe we are meaningfully contributing to a better world. we are incorporating esg considerations into our strategy as illustrated in our new sustainability report to bolster the long-term sustainability and success of the company for all of its stakeholders. we look forward to reporting more about our progress in these areas in future updates.
now, i'll turn the call back to jacob.
jacob sayer -- vice president, finance
