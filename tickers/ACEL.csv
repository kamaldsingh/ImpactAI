[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of a participant whose information was unable to be gathered. caller, please state your first and last name and your company. your line is open.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hello.
operator
yes. caller, please state your first and last name and your company.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
this is stephen grambling from goldman sachs. just wanted to get a little more color on the location commentary. so you mentioned that -- i think it was 90% will be open within three days. i guess what's the commentary on the other, call it, 10%? should we be expecting further delays in opening, or have you had any sense for how many might close permanently? and then also, is there any color that you're getting from interest from other restaurant bars that may be planning on adding vgts to improve cash flow of their business in a recovery scenario where fewer customers come through the door?
andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
so the first part of the question, the 10%, there will be some locations that will not open. we've seen probably about 15 to 20 of our locations that have indicated that they are not opening or will not be continuing with video gaming, so that number is a little less than 1%. and to give you an idea, on an annual basis, there's about 120 of our locations that discontinue gaming. so it's not really that disproportionate from the normal operation.
we do believe that there will be additional locations that will not open for one reason or another. you have to remember a lot of these locations are taking advantage of government subsidies during this time period. so if they're getting those subsidies, they're going to continue taking that subsidy until the latest possible date for them to make a decision. so we really don't have a great grasp on how many won't reopen.
there are a lot of locations that are taking this time to do remodeling, to redo their floors, and they may not be prepared to open up right out of the gate. and then there's other ones that are going to have a transition time where they've got to bring employees back. if they don't have enough time, they need to reorder supplies and such. so in our survey, 90% were ready to go right out of the gate.
those others, some of them will not open, but most of them, we have delayed opening due to time needed for preparations. remind me the second part of your question.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
it was just on any incremental thoughts around new business win potential as maybe some of these restaurants and bars may plan to add vgt to improve their cash flow in a recovery, especially where fewer customers come through the door.
andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
i think you see some of that. i don't think it will be a significant wave of demand. ironically, we have signed up locations during this time period and have a few of them where we've actually submitted their application to the gaming board. so there is that indication that people are still wanting vgts, and there will be that opportunity.
i think the bigger opportunity that we'll see is where locations that fail or don't reopen, whether it's our portfolio or other people's portfolio, will be identified as good opportunities for other entrepreneurs to go open up that place. and as we've indicated in the past, we are able to win a disproportionate amount of new locations or new organic locations. so we think we'll benefit somewhat from that situation as these new owners take over establishments, especially the ones that aren't ours. we'll win them over from our competitors.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
makes sense. and then one other follow-up. are there any steps to increase hygiene or the safe use of the machines once restaurants reopen? and how do you kind of assess those costs, whether it's on your end or the restaurant owner's end?
andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
as a company, we've made a significant investment in buying sanitizing products, whether it's the actual -- like hand sanitizer or sprays to help keep our employees clean, as well as when our employees go out to the establishments. we believe that the gaming board is going to give us direction on what their expectation is for keeping the equipment clean and safe because the establishments have an obligation to provide an atmosphere of safety for their customers. i think they'll participate in helping us execute on that program. we have also purchased a significant amount of masks for our own employees because, obviously, they're out in the field.
they're in establishments. we want to make sure there's a safe environment for them to work in. but we believe that it's probably the responsibility of each establishment owner to provide those types of protections for their employees as they're conscious and they're more aware of the safety needs in their given establishment.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks so much for taking the questions. thank you again.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of greg gibas. your line is open. please go ahead.
greg gibas -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions, and i hope you're staying safe in these tough times. first, if we think about the general weakening, i guess, of state budgets across the nation as a result of the pandemic, do you see this as a potential reason for accelerating the legalization of video gaming terminals in new states?
andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
as i've spoken in the past about the challenges related to passing legislation related to video gaming, that will continue to exist. but with that said, i think the ability to get legislation passed in this environment will be slightly easier or people will be more willing to consider it. we don't see legislation moving in this session in states that we thought had a good opportunity. it actually hurt us in the state of virginia when legislation was moving in the right direction and the governor decided to take a different direction because of covid-19.
but i do think the opportunity will be there. i do think that it will get larger consideration as we move forward. i don't think it will happen in the very near future. i think it will have to be down the road in other legislative sessions because most of the focus today is on the, like, absolute immediate needs of each state.
and the amount of collaboration that needs to occur to get video gaming legislation passed is significant, and it doesn't happen overnight. so i don't see it happening right away.
greg gibas -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. and now that several of the gaming board meetings have been canceled, is there any concern relating to the pace, i guess, of new license being issued? and do you expect the gaming board to maybe make up for that lack of new license approvals when they start to hold meetings again?
andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
so that's a good question. so i think what will occur is the work that was done prior to the shutdown will all get kind of pushed through. so you get a lot of licensing from there. what will happen and what unfortunately will happen is there'll be time lost outside of the obvious time that we haven't met and that in order for them to do licensing, they have to do an on-site investigation.
and the state agents are not visiting the locations because, obviously, they're closed. so i think you'll see a backlog that will occur sometime between -- next meeting's in june, we don't know if it's going to be scheduled, but until the first actual meeting, after they're able to go out to the location. so that will create a lot of locations that will be pushed into the queue that are not in the queue today. so the short answer is, yes, we're going to have a delay.
the second answer is i do think there'll be a catch-up, but i think it will be later than we think. it probably won't occur until like september. and then i think there's basically a bunch that will be lost because people that started the licensing process or intending to move forward with gaming may have decided this isn't the right environment for me to start a new business, and i'm going to hold off. so you'll see a little fallout from that as well.
greg gibas -- analyst
ok. got it. that's helpful. and then the last one for me was just relating to the installation of the six machines this year, which began january.
it looks like you're about halfway to your expectation of 1,000 installs from this. but i guess i was just wondering how the shutdown generally affected the installs if in any way at all. i mean, are you still able to make these installations even if the establishments are shut down? and i guess if you could just talk about the pace of those 1,000 new installs being roughly on track with your expectations.
andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
so when shutdown occurred, shutdown occurred. and in shutdown, the gaming board shut down our ability to deliver and install machines, so the last machine that we reported we installed is the last machine that has been installed. we would love to get out there and be able to go into locations and put out the six machines until the gaming board allows or the governor deems our business part of preparation for relaunch, we're not able to install machines. and so it will create a delay.
for the most part, we got a large percent of our best locations getting the six machines, so they'll have higher utilization than the second half. and i do anticipate us exceeding that 1,000-machine number by the end of the year. i just don't know based on how many locations come back and how many locations get licensing that will -- the actual number will be.
greg gibas -- analyst
ok. got it. thanks for clearing that up, and thanks for taking my question.
andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of john decree. your line is open.
john decree -- analyst
hi, andy. hi, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. i'd like to go back to an earlier question.
andy, and i'm sure you're probably still waiting on some additional guidance from the state. but wanted to get your thoughts on the reopening process, maybe a little bit more color on how you envision it. i guess the simple question is when you get the green light from the state, can you kind of flip the switch on right away? or will it take some time to get your teams out and get machines back on? i guess how quickly can you get up and running? and then a follow-up to that is how you envision other than kind of increased hygiene and cleanliness? i mean, the casinos are talking about spacing out of slot machines, etc., obviously, smaller locations that you're in. but curious if you expect any kind of changes to your configurations, social distancing, anything else that you might think you might be required to look at.
andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
so ideally, on the preparation needed to fully launch effectively or relaunch effectively, we'd need somewhere around seven to 10 days heads up from the state. we have begun all the preparatory planning to be ready. but the biggest thing that we'll have to do is actually go out to all these establishments and make sure the machines are in good operating order, reload cash that we've pulled from all of the redemption devices. that's going to take some time.
i mean there's really no way around it. at the absolute shortest amount of time, we could probably move within about, call it, four days, but we're going to need time from the state. based on conversations with the illinois gaming board, they think that we'll get about a week's notice. we are working actively with them to having to get them to allow us to do some of the work we need in the field prior to even knowing an exact relaunch date and we'll see they were receptive.
obviously, they need the governor's green light for that to happen. as far as the distancing and spreading of machines and sanitization, one of the things that we all need to realize is our presence inside a tavern or a convenience store or a restaurant is no different than a customer who's eating there. and so if you're going -- if the state is going to say that there's going to be six people allowed at a table, that's a smaller distance than the six people who are sitting on our slot machines. so at a typical table, tables maybe three feet by six feet or two feet by six feet, you could have six people sitting at that table.
the governor is not going to make you prove that you are quarantined with those six people. they're going to allow six friends from high school to all sit at that same table. at the same, we want to be treated exactly the same, where we actually have greater social distancing, where if you put six of our machines, it takes up almost 20 feet in length with about seven to eight feet in depth. so we're taking up 150 square feet where the people sitting at that table with chairs and everything are probably at somewhere around 50 square feet.
so we believe that we should be treated the same as everything else in the establishment. if the governor is willing to say only every other person, every other seat at the bar can be occupied, then we'll have every other slot machine occupied. but it has to be the same treatment for all patrons of that establishment. and we've tried to make that message very clear to the gaming board, as well as through our lobbyists that we believe in whatever the governor thinks is appropriate, but he has to apply it to every patron in the establishment.
not selectively say, ok, this group, you guys can be right next to each other and sit next to strangers. but this group, you have to be this distance apart. so that's been our philosophy. we believe that there needs to be appropriate social distancing.
and we're looking for the governor to give us that guidance, and we will follow.
john decree -- analyst
that makes sense, andy. i think that's helpful. and if i could, one more. on a quick update on the software updates to higher-bet limits, i think you've mentioned some of that can be done remotely.
not sure if you could kind of give us an update on progress for that and how many will need physical site visits to get that software upgraded once we open back up again. and that's all for me. thank you.
andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, john. so just for everyone's knowledge, the equipment, the software that's made by sci games at this point, the most current version, it will allow us to have the higher-bet limits and bigger jackpots. all the scientific games software needs to be loaded physically onto the machines.
their software was designed -- this latest version of software was not designed to be able to be sent remotely, so until the next version of their software, we're going to have to go out and do that on every machine. all the igt software can be sent throughout remotely. so we've got igt, that's a yes, we can do it remotely. and the sci games is a no.
they are about 50-50 of our portfolio. we have a small percentage of our machines from novomatic. they could be done remotely. i think most of them have already been done.
it's the sci games software that's the challenge. we haven't been -- it wasn't ready to be loaded onto the machines when the stay-at-home order was put in place, so we haven't done anything with it. we're hoping that they'll be ready as soon as we're able to go out to the machines. i mean, they've had plenty of time.
the question is we are not, the gaming board has given the approval for that software.
operator
there are no further questions at this time. i will turn the call back over to mr. rubenstein.
andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
thank you, everyone, for joining us today. we're hoping that the next time we're on the phone, we can let you know about some decent revenue toward the end of the second quarter. and we appreciate you taking your time out of your day. and hopefully, everyone stays healthy and safe.

andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
thank you, mat. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us for accel's first-quarter 2020 earnings call during these unprecedented times. accel had normal operations for the first 76 days of the first quarter with strong operational and financial performance prior to the shutdown.
gaming revenue increased 29% compared to the first 76 days of 2019. as a reminder, on march 16, the illinois gaming board shut downed all video gaming terminals across the state of illinois. and on march 20, illinois governor pritzker announced a stay-at-home order that has been subsequently extended to may 30. as soon as terminals were shut down, we immediately began collecting all field cash on an expedited basis.
we were able to collect and secure field cash within 72 hours with a vast majority collected within the first two days. this was a monumental logistical achievement, and i'm extremely proud of our team for their ability to execute on such short notice. with our video gaming machines shut down and all nonessential business in illinois temporarily suspended, we made the decision to significantly reduce our monthly cash expenses. this included furloughing the vast majority of our employees.
in addition, accel senior management, including myself; our cfo, brian carroll; our general counsel, derek harmer; and others are foregoing 100% of our respective base salaries until video gaming operations resume. by taking these measures, accel's projected monthly cash expenses have been reduced to the range of $2 million to $3 million monthly while operations are suspended. we have also been in frequent contact with our location partners to assist them during these surreal times. we've been working with our partners to make sure they are aware of, and in many cases, helping them apply for all federal, state and local government assistance programs, such as the paycheck protection program contained within the federal cares act.
we also conducted a survey of our location partners, of which 600 responded. based on these respondents, approximately 75% of the respondents indicated that they have applied for relief under cares act. also, more than 80% indicated that they expect to be open and operational immediately after the stay-at-home order is lifted, and 90% expect to be open and operational within three days of the stay-at-home order being lifted. last week, governor pritzker announced a regional and phased-based reopening plan for illinois.
we are waiting for more information on how and when each region will progress through the phases and its effect on the relaunch of video gaming. we are ready to resume normal operations as soon as the government states that is safe to do so. we continue to install the six machines up until the stay-at-home order went into effect and have installed more than 480 today. during this shutdown, new software and higher-bet limits have been remotely installed in almost half of our machines.
for the first quarter, we recorded $105 million in revenue and $15 million in adjusted ebitda. our balance sheet remains strong with net debt of approximately $207 million and total liquidity of $216 million. accel is extremely well-positioned to weather this crisis, and we fully expect to reopen as strong as ever. with that, i'm going to turn it over to brian carroll, our cfo, to walk you through the first-quarter results in more detail, and then we will open it up for questions.
brian carroll -- chief financial officer
thank you, andy. we had a very busy first quarter prior to the shutdown with large-scale rollout of the six vgt beginning in mid-january. as of march 31, we operated 11,164 vgt in 2,353 locations, year-over-year increase of 41% and 35%, respectively. our combined hold per day for the first 76 days we were operating in the first-quarter fy '20 was $124.
excluding grand river, our first-quarter hold per day was $132. at the end of march, our average residual contract length is approximately seven years. and on a stand-alone basis, excluding grand river, our residual contract length is approximately 7.2 years. we are in the process of upgrading grand river's equipment in operation and will continue once operations resume and expect these improvements will increase the hold per day of these locations.
we had total revenue for the first quarter of $105 million, an increase of 8% from 2019. gaming revenue for the first 76 days of the quarter totaled $101 million, which was 29% higher than the first 76 days of 2019. adjusted ebitda for the quarter totaled $15 million. capex remained limited with approximately $3.7 million cash spend in the first quarter, compared to $5.6 million in the first quarter 2019.
the majority of this capex was associated with purchases of new equipment for the sixth machine rollout. at the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $207 million of net debt and $216 million of liquidity, consisting of $167 million of unrestricted cash and $50 million of revolver availability. in mid-march, we drew down the remaining $65 million available to us on our delayed draw term loan. we are in full compliance with all of our bank covenants.
and given our substantial cash balance and expected cash expenses of $2 million to $3 million per month, we believe we have multiple years of liquidity without needing to raise any outside capital to run the business. back to you, andy.
andy rubenstein -- chief executive officer
thank you, brian. these are challenging times, but i've been extremely proud of how the accel team has responded to the current environment. i'm confident that accel will continue to provide the same great customer service we've been known for. the combination of our strong balance sheet and our asset-light business model means that we are well-positioned to successfully maintain our leadership position in the industry.
we will now take your questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of venkat from s&p global. our next question comes from the line of john g. decree from union. your line is now open.
john g. decree -- union -- analyst
good morning, good afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking the questions. i had a couple, i guess, kind of housekeeping items first, andy. so you mentioned by day three, about 90% of your locations were live. i was curious if you could talk about the balance in the other 10%. what your expectations are there? or are those eventually going to come back online, have some closed? and just broadly speaking, what's the outlook for those remaining locations?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, john. as far as the remaining balance, we have experienced a continual growth toward probably 90 the mid-90s, low to mid-90s, locations that are now open. there are some that have closed, and every day, we're one or two are trickling in as not reopening. our expectation is as some of the locations weren't quite ready to open initially or wanted to wait and see how the recovery in the hospitality industry would occur kind of postponed or open. we're seeing, at the same time, a couple open every day. so although we don't have a target number of where we think the ultimate percentage will be, i think we're slowly kind of migrating up into the mid-90s. and our expectation is that there will be some that don't ever open as we see these closures occurring every day.
john g. decree -- union -- analyst
as a follow up to that, andy, and it may be a little premature as everyone's still just getting reopening and under social distance and protocols. but have you had any conversations with locations that have previously not considered adding vgts to their location as an additional source of revenue and would say outlook for kind of new openings or new locations in the state that might come online as they look for maybe new revenue sources given the kind of dining business has been so disruptive?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
our sales team had some pretty good traction in july with new opportunities. and i think we'll continue to see that occur throughout the rest of the year. i would caveat by the caveat that there are the expectation is that there will not be as many new businesses opening up in the next six to nine months until we see some certainty or more certainty on how the pandemic is going to be controlled and whether there's a vaccine that will be implemented later in the year.
so there have been a few businesses that have decided to add vgts. we've seen a couple situations where one business closed and a new person takes over the business. and i think that will continue throughout the third and the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. but i don't expect a significant increase in the rate of new business openings occurring over the next six to nine months due to market uncertainty for those small business owners.
john g. decree -- union -- analyst
yes. that's great. and if i could sneak one last one in, on your view for revenue per day so far hold per day. it's early, but we've heard a lot of talks about the benefits of stimulus checks and expanded unemployment. wondering if you have a sense on how the trend of kind of coin into the machines is going, if it's been relatively consistent since you've reopened or if you've seen some volatility there? and that's it for me. i'll hop back into the queue.
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. thanks, john. the i would there has been some consistency. we haven't seen a lot of volatility. and the stimulus and the unemployment does provide a little bit of a lift, i think. the greater impact that we're seeing is that people are not using their disposable income for travel and other types of entertainment, and therefore, normally, july and august are months where there is a lot of travel and there is more of a kind of a drop in our business, i think that's making up for some of the shortfalls in the fact that there are people that are reluctant to go out into public.
a lot of our players are older, and they still are cautious. and the other thing that's as we stated earlier, there is not as many of the establishments in our portfolio that are open as opposed to what would be a normal time period. so i think the balance of the lack of options or alternative entertainment is balancing out some of the negatives. thanks for the additional color.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of stephen grambling from goldman sachs. your line is now open. hi, thanks for taking the questions. maybe looking toward georgia, what have you learned since the deal closed? and how do you think about the growth rate potential in that region?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks for the question, stephen. the it's really, really early for us to give any kind of real perspective on it. and i wouldn't anticipate any near-term growth as the current market has some challenges that we're trying to understand. so georgia is one that we have little near-term expectation, and we're in more of a learning phase and as well as an integration mode.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and then whether it's in illinois or otherwise, i guess, are you hearing or seeing any kind of operator distress that could create opportunities for their consolidation, either in illinois or otherwise?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
i would say that we haven't really seen distress. we've seen people interested in partnering with us, and that's always a theme in our business. as far as the operators that kind of are looking for kind of a transition, there's definitely interest, and i wouldn't put it any greater than normal, but we're continuing conversations with a lot of the different operators and opportunities that we've seen over the last year or so, and i think that will continue going forward into the fourth quarter and early next year. and as far as distress, i don't think we've seen that explicitly in the marketplace.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.

your next question comes from the line of venkat from s&p global. your line is now open.
greg gibas -- northland -- analyst
i'm guessing this is me. can you hear me, ok?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes.
greg gibas -- northland -- analyst
okay. this is greg gibas from northland. so must have had the wrong name in there at some point. so sorry about that. sorry about the confusion. but we're just hoping to follow-up on a few things. first, i guess, a little bit more color on how july has trended from a hold per day perspective, maybe relative to pre-covid times? is there anything you can share there?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. thanks, greg. the july numbers, as i mentioned earlier, were pretty strong considering what we were coming out of. and the fact that we didn't have as much of our inventory of locations operating. so the hold per day was consistent with where we thought our business would be in our projections pre-covid, maybe slightly below because of a lot of the locations not being open. but i think, like as i said, the lack of entertainment alternatives and people staying closer to home, were very advantageous for us in terms of performance.
greg gibas -- northland -- analyst
sure. that makes sense. and then, i guess, could you i think you already provided this on the call, but what percentage have been updated with the new betting limits? and then also the percentage of locations that had their six vgt installed at this point?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
so the as far as the betting limits are concerned, we have installed in the igt portfolio, the basic software upgrade that was provided through the system update pretty much throughout the portfolio. that was only a few games, not the entire portfolio of games on each machine. the rest of that portfolio has not been updated. as it was just recently released, we're in the process of doing that. so on a given machine only, call it, 10% to 15% of the games have the higher bet limits and the bigger jackpots. we'll see that on the igt portfolio increase pretty rapidly over the next six to eight weeks. the sci games software is very different.
and that needs to be loaded on to each individual machine by visiting location. you can't do it through the central system. so very, very few have experienced that upgrade. and the expectation is, it will take some time probably into the fourth quarter before those machines all get upgraded. so it's a process. i don't think we've gotten anywhere close to a critical mass on that upgrade and probably we'll give you better insight at the end of the third quarter. then what's the second part of your question?
greg gibas -- northland -- analyst
it was the percentage that have had their six vgt installed?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
so i think we're probably in a somewhere between 25% to 35% that will accomplish by the end of the third quarter. i mean it's a very dynamic number that obviously increases every day. and you'll see that lift as you monitor the amount of machines the monthly report that comes out from the igb, you'll see our numbers increase.
greg gibas -- northland -- analyst
okay. got it. that's helpful, andy. and i guess the last one from me. just to be a follow-up on the general health of your establishment partners, i know you already said that on day three, they were 90% open again, which is pretty good. i guess i would just ask, how many do you think will maybe permanently go out of business? i imagine you're pretty close with their health, maybe day-to-day or at least month-to-month. and then maybe with respect to the pace of new licenses being issued from the igb, i mean, how do you think that will be impacted by the shut down?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
the total amount of locations that won't come back is obviously a guess. what we saw during the pandemic was a lighter amount of business closures than normal. and i think that's attributed to the fact that a lot of the locations were receiving government support. so they stayed open while they were they refused they didn't declare their closure during that time in order to receive the government support. so on a normal basis, we lose, call it, seven to 10 locations that are closing every month, just in the course of our normal business.
that was a light we experienced a lighter number in the pandemic period of closure. we're now starting to see slightly accelerated as some of those locations are making declaration that they're not reopening. i think we'll see that impact probably through the first quarter of 2021 as locations will make the effort of trying to reopen and see how the business goes. usually, january is a high closure month as businesses want to get through the holidays kind of as a last draw. and so i think you'll see a higher-than-normal closure rate beginning, let's say, this month through probably the end of february.

there are no further questions at this time. i will turn the call back over to andy rubenstein.

okay. well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. we look forward to continuing to help our small business partners reopen their business. just in fact, just survive in this period because obviously, they are restrained in the ability to serve indoors. and fortunately, this is occurring during a warmer weather period that a lot of them are expanded their outdoor service. and so the gaming has helped supplement that revenue. and we look forward to updating you after the third quarter with kind of continual growth. and hopefully, everyone stays healthy and safe and wears their masks because that is essential to the support of a lot of these small businesses. so thank you for taking the time, and we look forward to talking to you in a few months.

andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, matt. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us for accel's second quarter 2020 earnings call. it was a very quiet quarter due to the statewide shutdown, but we have seen strong results since video gaming relaunched. as a reminder, on march 16, the illinois gaming board shut down all video gaming terminals across the state of illinois. in late june, the igb announced gaming would relaunch on july one and issued protocols requiring one of the following actions: vgts to be spaced six feet apart or dividers to be installed between vgts or if options one and two cannot be achieved, disable the vgt.
once again, the accel team went above and beyond preparing for relaunch, and we are pleased to report that we had a successful first month. we brought back most of our employees a little more than a week before our locations could reopen. and on day 1, more than 80% of locations were live and by day three, more than 90% of locations were live. in addition, less than 3% of our vgts were disabled due to the igb protocols. more importantly, our players were also excited for gaming to resume, and july gaming revenue was near our pre-covid-19 budget.
during the shutdown, our team did an excellent job in maintaining close contact with our business partners to not just understand how we would work with them to implement the new guidelines, but also to help support them in these unprecedented times. we are encouraged by both the recent performance and the limited number of our locations that have closed due to the pandemic. recent policy decisions in illinois have also given us confidence that we should be able to avoid a similar statewide shutdown. on july 15, governor pritzker further divided illinois from four regions to 11 regions. we have analyzed the regions and determined no region has more than 20% of accel's gaming revenue.
it's also important to note, chicago, a municipality that prohibits video gaming and has been more impacted by covid-19 than rest of the state, is a separate region. we will continue to work with the governor's office, the igb, local municipalities and our establishment partners to follow the latest covid-19 ordinances and guidance. during the second quarter, we also announced that we had agreed to acquire tom's amusements, a southeast amusement operator and master licensee in the state of georgia, led by emily dunn. the acquisition closed on july 22, and our teams have been busy integrating the company's and working with emily to grow her brand. this is an important milestone to our vision of expanding nationally.
the georgia market is large and underpenetrated, and we believe that the accel playbook will help us grow the market and allow us to take significant share. we're encouraged by other discussions that additional state expansion may occur even faster than we had previously anticipated. finally, on june 16, we announced the redemption of all public warrants to purchase shares of our common stock for a redemption exchange rate of 0.25 shares of common stock per public warrant. we followed this announcement several weeks later with an exchange offer to the private warrant holders with the same redemption exchange rate. 94% of the private warrant holders, including myself, and all members of our board of directors signed an agreement indicating they would participate in the exchange offer.
the redemption and exchange offers were made to simplify the company's capital structure and reduce the potential dilutive impact of the company's warrants. unfortunately, with operations suspended, we recorded minimal revenue and adjusted ebitda loss of $9 million for the second quarter. however, the strengths of our business model are reflected in these results as we were able to quickly adapt and ensure the long-term prosperity for accel. our balance sheet remains strong with net debt of approximately $220 million and total liquidity of $199 million. we emerged from the shutdown in a strong position and look to continue executing our growth plans. with that, i'm going to turn it over to brian carroll, our cfo, to walk you through the second quarter results in more detail.
and then we will open it up for questions.
brian m. carroll -- chief financial officer
thank you, andy. as of june 30, we had 11,108 vgts in 2,335 locations. year-over-year increases of 33% and 37%, respectively, and that is probably the right metric to focus on for our growth potential. the small decrease in locations in vgts from the prior quarter was primarily due to lower-performing locations closing their business due to the impact of covid-19 as well as the igb not having two meetings, thus delaying the normal addition of locations. at the end of june, our average residual contract length was approximately 6.8 years, and on a stand-alone basis, excluding grand river, our residual contract length was approximately seven years.
with relaunch, we've been able to resume upgrading grand river's equipment and expect that these improvements will increase the hold per day of these locations. we have installed more than 556 vgts and expect to install a total of 1,000 by year-end. to date, approximately 8% of our game titles have been updated to higher bet limits. the majority of our vgts will be receiving additional updates for the remaining game titles during the second half of this year. of the updates, approximately 50% of our vgts will acquire an on-site update, which we began this week and expect to complete by year-end.
we had total revenue for the second quarter of $0.4 million due to the statewide shutdown and an adjusted ebitda loss of $9 million. capex remained limited with approximately $0.3 million cash spend in the second quarter compared to $5 million in the second quarter of 2018. given the pandemic, we deferred purchases, and more importantly, we were able to work with major vendors to defer payments until operations resumed.
at the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $220 million of net debt, and $199 million of liquidity, consisting of $149 million unrestricted cash and $50 million of revolver availability. we are in full compliance with all our bank covenants. and earlier this week, we executed an amendment to our credit facility, which provides covenant relief through q1 of 2021 to ensure we have adequate flexibility in the current environment. while this was not necessarily needed, this amendment provides us with the flexibility to continue operating sensibly without the overhang of the shutdown.
back to you, andy.
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, brian. with one of the toughest quarters in our company's history behind us, i'm pleased to be focused on continuing our mission to be the leader in route gaming. i have been extremely proud of how the accel team has responded to the current environment and continue to provide the same great customer service that we have been known for.

[operator instructions] your first question is from omer sander from jpmorgan. your line is open.
omer sander -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, andy, brian, matt. congrats on the strong results. if i heard correctly, you're mostly done with the rollout of six vgts. as you look through your portfolio, does the focus now shift toward replacing some of the underperforming units, both at the existing and the acquired locations? i guess the question is, how do you think about that opportunity?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, omer. the -- we look at the opportunity to replace equipment on a constant basis. it's something that we do literally weekly evaluating underperforming equipments in specific locations where maybe in that particular micro market that certain pieces of equipment is desired, and we therefore look at where -- what is the demand in that market from the player and then we often shift equipment in there. so it's a constant process we do. we keep a significant inventory of equipment in our warehouse. so we're not having to wait to replace the equipments or update it. so it's an ongoing process, and it's something that we do as a company to optimize the performance for our establishment partners.
omer sander -- jpmorgan -- analyst
are there regions or a portion of the portfolio that may be underperforming or under indexing relative to the broader part of the portfolio?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. i mean the state of illinois is many different -- has many different demographics. and there's obviously stronger income levels and stronger demand in certain markets as opposed to others, and that may be because there's lack of alternative entertainment options. it's been one area versus other. as an example, the peoria area because there's a casino that's very close to a lot of the establishments performs at a lower level than some of the northern suburbs of chicago, where there's not quite some of the casino and then there's stronger income levels.
omer sander -- jpmorgan -- analyst
awesome. that's helpful. and then maybe just a follow-up question. you kind of touched on it in your prepared remarks in terms of the new license issuances, which also unsurprisingly dipped last year due to covid. do you get the sense that there is maybe a desire to catch up on your organic commission front and the need to generate tax revenues?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
to be honest, i don't know exactly their motives, but they have done their best to try to go through and authorize as many applications as possible. even in today's environment, they're somewhat restricted due to their workloads, and they've got a tremendous amount of workload with the new casinos that they're still trying to authorize or review the application. so our gaming board has done the best they can with the staffing that they currently have. they're not staffed to take on a bunch of new casinos plus a rapidly growing industry at once. they're on a normal staffing level. and the additional casino expansion is definitely putting strains on some of their resources.
omer sander -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks so much. appreciate the color.
operator
your next question is from greg gibas from northland securities. your line is open.
greg gibas -- northland securities -- analyst
hey, good morning, brian. congrats on the quarter. a couple of follow-ups. i guess, first, as we see new state markets legalize video gaming, what kind of gives you new confidence that accel can get early player operator in those markets?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
greg, as we look at these markets, a lot of them were pretty active in working with the legislators or working with the local business partners in those markets. we historically have been a great business partner to the local operators in markets. and we think that historical success and that reputation of being a good business partner, whether it's to the establishment or to the local operators, will continue to be our kind of secret to success. and as we've gone into some of these markets already, we've been able to establish great partnerships. and i think it will play out with a position of market leadership as the market opens up as we've demonstrated over the last 10 years that accel can continue to thrive in dynamic markets.
greg gibas -- northland securities -- analyst
great. appreciate that. and to follow-up, andy, you talked about seeing a good number of m&a opportunities that you mentioned. i wanted to ask, i guess, are those mostly illinois focused? or are they new markets focused? and then maybe how have those opportunities changed since the last couple of quarters? are you seeing more? or is it maybe a little harder to find opportunities now that we're a little bit more out of the pandemic? how are those trends?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
first part of the question is we continue to look at illinois opportunities, but we -- our focus has really broadened into new and legacy markets. and i think to the second part of your question, those opportunities are as good or better than they were a few quarters ago. the uncertainty during the heat of the pandemic created a pause for many of operators or potential business partners. and as there's greater visibility to their earnings or greater visibility to their potential, both parties are more easily able to come to an agreement on what a partnership would look like. so i think you'll see us continue to pursue opportunities in illinois and outside in these other states, and i think it will probably be an accelerating rate in the next few years.
greg gibas -- northland securities -- analyst
awesome. great. well, that's all i had. i just wanted to congratulate on your license wins, too. i mean, the 38% of the state, that's impressive, but i'll pass it on.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question is from steve pizzella from deutsche bank. your line is open.
steve pizzella -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. margins were pretty impressive for the quarter. can you talk about what you're doing on the cost side and the level of sustainability for these levels moving forward?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. thanks, steve. the -- a lot of the -- was due to the -- obviously, increased revenues. so the incremental revenues come at a much higher margin. on the cost side, we haven't been in a cost-cutting mode. we're more in a growth mode. and we are continuing to invest in systems, people to ensure that we can grow both same-store sales as well as future opportunities. and i think the margins will probably kind of move more toward the high 19, low 20s as we get into a more sustainable revenue performance. so i think you'll see that the investment with order growth will bring those margins kind of down a point or so and -- but it will also ensure that we will have the growth that we've demonstrated in the past and we expect to do in the future.
steve pizzella -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. great. that's helpful. and then now that you've been in georgia for about a year now, can you talk about what you've learned in the market and how big you view the opportunity to be there?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
so georgia has been an interesting year. we feel very strongly that it's -- that it can be a very successful market on a long-term basis. and we've invested in kind of building our infrastructure, working with the state on a pilot where there's -- where you can use a -- you cash out with a redemption part. and where we've seen that redemption card in the pilot, it's made significant improvement in performance or a play at those establishments. so we're very excited and hopeful of the expansion of the redemption card. and i think on a long-term basis, the market can be meaningful in the overall accel portfolio.
steve pizzella -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. i appreciate it. thanks guys.

[operator instructions] your next question is from jordan bender from macquarie. your line is open.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
good morning, afternoon guys, thanks for taking the question. with respect to your guidance, i guess, you have july in the books here. i was wondering if you could kind of give the puts and takes on what it might take to hit the bottom or the top half of your guidance range for revenue for the year?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. thank you, jordan. i'll ask brian take this one.
brian carroll -- chief financial officer
thanks, andy. well, basically, where our current run rates on revenue, we think will be on the higher side. so it's timing relative to the lower side, it all depends on how we're investing, as andy mentioned, whether it's internally for building out the illinois infrastructure and/or for the national platform. so based on current run rates, though, i think we mentioned in the -- a few minutes ago that we thought we were taking a higher -- or i'm sorry, a little conservative approach with those guidance and that there is upside. but it's -- i just want to take it month-by-month and see how it goes with everything.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
okay. and then as my follow-up here, you've mentioned it in your prepared remarks, the backlog is pretty strong right now. i was wondering if you could just give us color on kind of where it sits now versus maybe at the end of 1q or even faster levels like in 2019 or so?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. i would say that we're actually gaining momentum with our backlog. and part of that is due to the fact that we're seeing businesses start to reopen for new ownership in businesses that have closed as we've kind of -- people have kind of moved past the kind of concerns around long-term effects of the pandemic. so i think we have a good 12 months of building the backlog ahead of us. i think where you'll see strength in the increase of the locations that we have under contract. and in the past -- and i think we'll reach levels probably closer to '19.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
thanks guys.

all right. and i'm showing no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the call back over to mr. andrew rubenstein for any additional or closing remarks.

i will now turn the call over to mr. andy rubenstein.
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, matt. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us for accel's second quarter earnings call. i'm pleased to report the second quarter of 2021 was the best quarter in accel's history. we set new revenue and adjusted ebitda records. as discussed during our june investor day, the primary drivers of the higher revenue were the completion of higher bet limit software upgrades and the six vgt installations. the combination of these initiatives contributed to the increased location revenue on average between 30% and 35% versus 2019 levels. we also benefited from the third round of stimulus checks and higher demand due to the lack of other entertainment options as the economy was not fully open. but the improvements in our product offering were the critical drivers for this strong performance. as we enter the summer months and illinois fully reopened, we watch revenue closely to see where it would settle. february, march and april are traditionally the three best months of the year, while june and july are lower performing months. i'm pleased to share that our july gaming revenue was seasonally better than normal and above our previous expectations. this reinforces our belief that the elevated revenue we are seeing was driven by the initiatives and may be sustainable. due to q2's strong results and the strong start to q3, we are raising our guidance. i'll leave it to brian to walk you through the new numbers later in the call.
turning to growth. our sales teams continue to sign additional competitor and organic locations, including the most recent igb meeting on july 14, year-to-date, accel was awarded 168 or 38% of all new licenses. our ability to win more licenses than our current market share is a strong testament to our sales capabilities and is just one of many competitive advantages that differentiates us from other operators. there have been some questions about the relatively low number of licenses issued at the last gaming board meeting in july. however, when looking at the calendar, there was a short amount of time between meetings in addition to the july four holiday weekend. we will always push ourselves to win more than our share and help our local business partners generate incremental profits, which will lead to further location growth. it's too soon to determine what the new total number of annual license will be going forward, but we will see a significant amount of runway in illinois as illustrated in our june investor day presentation. looking at other states, we remain cautiously optimistic that several states will consider distributed gaming in the future.
for example, virginia recently banned unregulated devices, which could be a first step toward regulated gaming. we will continue to work with the various stakeholders in these states to educate them about the benefits of distributed gaming and the incremental revenues it generates for state and local governments as well as small businesses. should new states legalized gaming, we believe our growth playbook in illinois will enable us to be successful in any future market. on the m&a front, our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce more opportunities in the future in both existing and incremental states. in georgia, we completed another acquisition in may when we acquired island games, a southern georgia operator with 30 locations.
today, we have approximately 60 live locations in georgia and a backlog of over 100 locations. we expect both numbers to continue growing, and we remain excited about the long-term prospects for us in that market. switching to century, which operates in montana, nevada, south dakota, west virginia and louisiana. we have now submitted all our applications to the various regulators. due to the large backlog of applications in various states, we will likely not be approved until the first half of 2022, which will impact the timing of the closing versus our initial expectations. we are happy to report that century continues to perform better than our original estimates and both sides are excited to combine the best practices of both companies. overall, accel is in a strong position to capitalize on the future. we believe we will offer one of the best returns in gaming, combined with highly visible growth. to put our growth into context, illinois distributed gaming industries revenue grew 60% from q2 2019 to q2 2021 as compared to illinois casinos revenue, which decreased 7% over the same period. over that same period, accel's growth was 92% overall or 67% when normalized to the grand river acquisition.
with that, i'd like to turn it over to brian to walk you through the numbers in more detail.
brian carroll -- chief financial officer
thanks, andy, and good morning, everyone. please remember that we were shut down in the second quarter of 2020, so i will emit prior period comparisons where appropriate or make comparisons to the second quarter of 2019. for the second quarter, we had total revenue of $202 million and adjusted ebitda of $43 million. revenue per location per day for the second quarter was $855, an all-time high for accel and an increase of 35% compared to the second quarter of 2019. as andy discussed earlier, the primary drivers of the increase were the higher bet limit software and our six vgts initiative, in addition to some overall higher demand partially driven by the third round of stimulus checks. capex for the second quarter was $9 million cash spend. a portion of this was related to some deferred payments in the first quarter due to the partial shutdown. as of june 30, we had 13,177 vgts in 2,527 locations, year-over-year increases of 19% and 8%, respectively. location attrition continues to remain low and mirror the pre-covid historical averages. it is our belief that businesses with incremental gaming revenues had a lower failure rate as compared to businesses without. as of june 30, we have largely completed the installation of the higher bet limit software and the six vgts across our footprint.
we believe that second quarter results highlight the positive impact of both initiatives. to refresh everyone's memory, the rollout of the six vgts started in january 2020 and the rollout of the higher bet limit software started in july 2020. at the end of june, our average residual contract length was approximately 6.8 years, the same length as last year and a small increase as compared to last quarter. our ability to maintain and even raise the residual contract length is a true testimony to the hard work of all our teams, including service, collection, marketing and relationship management. we have always believed our people give us a competitive advantage, and we'll continue to invest in them to deliver the best-in-class experience for our customers, locations and players. at the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $167 million of net debt, down $20 million from q1 and $266 million of liquidity, consisting of $179 million of cash in our balance sheet and $87 million of revolver availability. as andy mentioned earlier, we are raising our outlook. however, due to the uncertainty of delta variant, we have decided to do so conservatively as follows.
we are now forecasting to end the year with 13,555 to 13,680 vgts and 2,590 to 2,615 locations. revenue for 2021 is now expected to be $700 million to $725 million, with adjusted ebitda of $133 million to $138 million. capex is still expected to be $20 million to $25 million cash spend. year-end net debt, excluding any acquisition financing, should be approximately $123 million to $128 million, implying a year-end trailing debt-to-ebitda multiple of only 0.9, giving us ample firepower to pursue additional inorganic and greenfield opportunities. remember, our annual guidance for 2021 includes the impact of a lower-than-normal q1 given the covid shutdowns in place to start the year.
back to you, andy.
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, brian. we're extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and even more excited for what the future holds. it is important to remember that our product today is substantially better than it was in 2019. and that is reflected in our recent results and outlook. we have newer cabinets, better software, higher jackpots and our locations continue to invest in natural gaming areas, given the strength and importance of the incremental revenues we help them generate. we are watching the delta variant closely, and hopeful it has a minimal impact, including on our players, customers and accel employees. we remain confident that our asset-light, hyperlocal business model creates a platform to outperform in difficult times and really drive under normal circumstances as demonstrated by our recent results. we aim to leverage our differentiated operating model and extremely strong financial position in order to continue our expansion, both in illinois and across the country. our success would not be possible without our dedicated employees and loyal customers. they are the true competitive advantage of our business that make accel the preferred choice in distributed gaming.

hey, good morning, brian. congrats on the quarter. a couple of follow-ups. i guess, first, as we see new state markets legalize video gaming, what kind of gives you new confidence that accel can get early player operator in those markets?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
greg, as we look at these markets, a lot of them were pretty active in working with the legislators or working with the local business partners in those markets. we historically have been a great business partner to the local operators in markets. and we think that historical success and that reputation of being a good business partner, whether it's to the establishment or to the local operators, will continue to be our kind of secret to success. and as we've gone into some of these markets already, we've been able to establish great partnerships. and i think it will play out with a position of market leadership as the market opens up as we've demonstrated over the last 10 years that accel can continue to thrive in dynamic markets.
greg gibas -- northland securities -- analyst
great. appreciate that. and to follow-up, andy, you talked about seeing a good number of m&a opportunities that you mentioned. i wanted to ask, i guess, are those mostly illinois focused? or are they new markets focused? and then maybe how have those opportunities changed since the last couple of quarters? are you seeing more? or is it maybe a little harder to find opportunities now that we're a little bit more out of the pandemic? how are those trends?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
first part of the question is we continue to look at illinois opportunities, but we -- our focus has really broadened into new and legacy markets. and i think to the second part of your question, those opportunities are as good or better than they were a few quarters ago. the uncertainty during the heat of the pandemic created a pause for many of operators or potential business partners. and as there's greater visibility to their earnings or greater visibility to their potential, both parties are more easily able to come to an agreement on what a partnership would look like. so i think you'll see us continue to pursue opportunities in illinois and outside in these other states, and i think it will probably be an accelerating rate in the next few years.
greg gibas -- northland securities -- analyst
awesome. great. well, that's all i had. i just wanted to congratulate on your license wins, too. i mean, the 38% of the state, that's impressive, but i'll pass it on.

[operator instructions] your next question is from steve pizzella from deutsche bank. your line is open.
steve pizzella -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. margins were pretty impressive for the quarter. can you talk about what you're doing on the cost side and the level of sustainability for these levels moving forward?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. thanks, steve. the -- a lot of the -- was due to the -- obviously, increased revenues. so the incremental revenues come at a much higher margin. on the cost side, we haven't been in a cost-cutting mode. we're more in a growth mode. and we are continuing to invest in systems, people to ensure that we can grow both same-store sales as well as future opportunities. and i think the margins will probably kind of move more toward the high 19, low 20s as we get into a more sustainable revenue performance. so i think you'll see that the investment with order growth will bring those margins kind of down a point or so and -- but it will also ensure that we will have the growth that we've demonstrated in the past and we expect to do in the future.
steve pizzella -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. great. that's helpful. and then now that you've been in georgia for about a year now, can you talk about what you've learned in the market and how big you view the opportunity to be there?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
so georgia has been an interesting year. we feel very strongly that it's -- that it can be a very successful market on a long-term basis. and we've invested in kind of building our infrastructure, working with the state on a pilot where there's -- where you can use a -- you cash out with a redemption part. and where we've seen that redemption card in the pilot, it's made significant improvement in performance or a play at those establishments. so we're very excited and hopeful of the expansion of the redemption card. and i think on a long-term basis, the market can be meaningful in the overall accel portfolio.
steve pizzella -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. i appreciate it. thanks guys.

[operator instructions] your next question is from jordan bender from macquarie. your line is open.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
good morning, afternoon guys, thanks for taking the question. with respect to your guidance, i guess, you have july in the books here. i was wondering if you could kind of give the puts and takes on what it might take to hit the bottom or the top half of your guidance range for revenue for the year?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. thank you, jordan. i'll ask brian take this one.
brian carroll -- chief financial officer
thanks, andy. well, basically, where our current run rates on revenue, we think will be on the higher side. so it's timing relative to the lower side, it all depends on how we're investing, as andy mentioned, whether it's internally for building out the illinois infrastructure and/or for the national platform. so based on current run rates, though, i think we mentioned in the -- a few minutes ago that we thought we were taking a higher -- or i'm sorry, a little conservative approach with those guidance and that there is upside. but it's -- i just want to take it month-by-month and see how it goes with everything.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
okay. and then as my follow-up here, you've mentioned it in your prepared remarks, the backlog is pretty strong right now. i was wondering if you could just give us color on kind of where it sits now versus maybe at the end of 1q or even faster levels like in 2019 or so?
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. i would say that we're actually gaining momentum with our backlog. and part of that is due to the fact that we're seeing businesses start to reopen for new ownership in businesses that have closed as we've kind of -- people have kind of moved past the kind of concerns around long-term effects of the pandemic. so i think we have a good 12 months of building the backlog ahead of us. i think where you'll see strength in the increase of the locations that we have under contract. and in the past -- and i think we'll reach levels probably closer to '19.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
thanks guys.
operator
all right. and i'm showing no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the call back over to mr. andrew rubenstein for any additional or closing remarks.
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. thank you, everyone, for joining us today. and as we look forward, we're absolute as to the continued growth of accel. obviously, from a personal and as well as for everyone, we're concerned about the delta variant and how it's going to affect the economy. and we have gone to continue to take precautions to make sure our employees are in best of health, and we hope that everyone does their best to make sure that the economy continues to move forward. so thank you again.

andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, matt. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us for accel's second quarter earnings call. i'm pleased to report the second quarter of 2021 was the best quarter in accel's history. we set new revenue and adjusted ebitda records. as discussed during our june investor day, the primary drivers of the higher revenue were the completion of higher bet limit software upgrades and the six vgt installations. the combination of these initiatives contributed to the increased location revenue on average between 30% and 35% versus 2019 levels. we also benefited from the third round of stimulus checks and higher demand due to the lack of other entertainment options as the economy was not fully open. but the improvements in our product offering were the critical drivers for this strong performance. as we enter the summer months and illinois fully reopened, we watch revenue closely to see where it would settle. february, march and april are traditionally the three best months of the year, while june and july are lower performing months. i'm pleased to share that our july gaming revenue was seasonally better than normal and above our previous expectations. this reinforces our belief that the elevated revenue we are seeing was driven by the initiatives and may be sustainable. due to q2's strong results and the strong start to q3, we are raising our guidance. i'll leave it to brian to walk you through the new numbers later in the call.
turning to growth. our sales teams continue to sign additional competitor and organic locations, including the most recent igb meeting on july 14, year-to-date, accel was awarded 168 or 38% of all new licenses. our ability to win more licenses than our current market share is a strong testament to our sales capabilities and is just one of many competitive advantages that differentiates us from other operators. there have been some questions about the relatively low number of licenses issued at the last gaming board meeting in july. however, when looking at the calendar, there was a short amount of time between meetings in addition to the july four holiday weekend. we will always push ourselves to win more than our share and help our local business partners generate incremental profits, which will lead to further location growth. it's too soon to determine what the new total number of annual license will be going forward, but we will see a significant amount of runway in illinois as illustrated in our june investor day presentation. looking at other states, we remain cautiously optimistic that several states will consider distributed gaming in the future.
for example, virginia recently banned unregulated devices, which could be a first step toward regulated gaming. we will continue to work with the various stakeholders in these states to educate them about the benefits of distributed gaming and the incremental revenues it generates for state and local governments as well as small businesses. should new states legalized gaming, we believe our growth playbook in illinois will enable us to be successful in any future market. on the m&a front, our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce more opportunities in the future in both existing and incremental states. in georgia, we completed another acquisition in may when we acquired island games, a southern georgia operator with 30 locations.
today, we have approximately 60 live locations in georgia and a backlog of over 100 locations. we expect both numbers to continue growing, and we remain excited about the long-term prospects for us in that market. switching to century, which operates in montana, nevada, south dakota, west virginia and louisiana. we have now submitted all our applications to the various regulators. due to the large backlog of applications in various states, we will likely not be approved until the first half of 2022, which will impact the timing of the closing versus our initial expectations. we are happy to report that century continues to perform better than our original estimates and both sides are excited to combine the best practices of both companies. overall, accel is in a strong position to capitalize on the future. we believe we will offer one of the best returns in gaming, combined with highly visible growth. to put our growth into context, illinois distributed gaming industries revenue grew 60% from q2 2019 to q2 2021 as compared to illinois casinos revenue, which decreased 7% over the same period. over that same period, accel's growth was 92% overall or 67% when normalized to the grand river acquisition.
with that, i'd like to turn it over to brian to walk you through the numbers in more detail.
brian carroll -- chief financial officer
thanks, andy, and good morning, everyone. please remember that we were shut down in the second quarter of 2020, so i will emit prior period comparisons where appropriate or make comparisons to the second quarter of 2019. for the second quarter, we had total revenue of $202 million and adjusted ebitda of $43 million. revenue per location per day for the second quarter was $855, an all-time high for accel and an increase of 35% compared to the second quarter of 2019. as andy discussed earlier, the primary drivers of the increase were the higher bet limit software and our six vgts initiative, in addition to some overall higher demand partially driven by the third round of stimulus checks. capex for the second quarter was $9 million cash spend. a portion of this was related to some deferred payments in the first quarter due to the partial shutdown. as of june 30, we had 13,177 vgts in 2,527 locations, year-over-year increases of 19% and 8%, respectively. location attrition continues to remain low and mirror the pre-covid historical averages. it is our belief that businesses with incremental gaming revenues had a lower failure rate as compared to businesses without. as of june 30, we have largely completed the installation of the higher bet limit software and the six vgts across our footprint.
we believe that second quarter results highlight the positive impact of both initiatives. to refresh everyone's memory, the rollout of the six vgts started in january 2020 and the rollout of the higher bet limit software started in july 2020. at the end of june, our average residual contract length was approximately 6.8 years, the same length as last year and a small increase as compared to last quarter. our ability to maintain and even raise the residual contract length is a true testimony to the hard work of all our teams, including service, collection, marketing and relationship management. we have always believed our people give us a competitive advantage, and we'll continue to invest in them to deliver the best-in-class experience for our customers, locations and players. at the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $167 million of net debt, down $20 million from q1 and $266 million of liquidity, consisting of $179 million of cash in our balance sheet and $87 million of revolver availability. as andy mentioned earlier, we are raising our outlook. however, due to the uncertainty of delta variant, we have decided to do so conservatively as follows.
we are now forecasting to end the year with 13,555 to 13,680 vgts and 2,590 to 2,615 locations. revenue for 2021 is now expected to be $700 million to $725 million, with adjusted ebitda of $133 million to $138 million. capex is still expected to be $20 million to $25 million cash spend. year-end net debt, excluding any acquisition financing, should be approximately $123 million to $128 million, implying a year-end trailing debt-to-ebitda multiple of only 0.9, giving us ample firepower to pursue additional inorganic and greenfield opportunities. remember, our annual guidance for 2021 includes the impact of a lower-than-normal q1 given the covid shutdowns in place to start the year.
back to you, andy.
andy rubenstein -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, brian. we're extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and even more excited for what the future holds. it is important to remember that our product today is substantially better than it was in 2019. and that is reflected in our recent results and outlook. we have newer cabinets, better software, higher jackpots and our locations continue to invest in natural gaming areas, given the strength and importance of the incremental revenues we help them generate. we are watching the delta variant closely, and hopeful it has a minimal impact, including on our players, customers and accel employees. we remain confident that our asset-light, hyperlocal business model creates a platform to outperform in difficult times and really drive under normal circumstances as demonstrated by our recent results. we aim to leverage our differentiated operating model and extremely strong financial position in order to continue our expansion, both in illinois and across the country. our success would not be possible without our dedicated employees and loyal customers. they are the true competitive advantage of our business that make accel the preferred choice in distributed gaming.
we will now take your questions.
