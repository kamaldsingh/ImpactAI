chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, james, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. a special thank you to all of our employees for an outstanding quarter to finish the year. i will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth-quarter 2020 results, then i will review some of our notable achievements in 2020 and also discuss our goals for 2021. following that, craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions.
2020 was a strong year for paycom. we innovated our sales processes and accelerated our new business sales during the global pandemic. these accomplishments have set the stage for a year of rapid growth that we believe will propel paycom to reach $1 billion in revenues in 2021. the digital transformation of the human capital management industry has reached a critical stage where the accepted practice of hr and payroll personnel and putting data for employees has come to an end.
the industry trend toward self-service has been leading to this point, and i believe the pandemic effectively sealed the faith of the old model. businesses must shift to provide employees direct access to the database because it's better for the business and the employees. the coming extinction of the old model has been our expectation for many years, and i'm very excited to see it happening. our differentiated solution positions paycom very well to accelerate this trend and deliver long-term sustainable growth.
we finished the year with strong results. our 2020 fourth-quarter revenue of $221 million came in very strong, thanks to elevated new business starts in the quarter. our full-year 2020 revenue of $841 million grew 14% compared to 2019. paycom maintained an annual revenue retention rate of 93%, even with the pandemic causing some businesses to close and a reduction in employee headcount-related revenue at existing clients.
our full-year 2020 adjusted ebitda was $331 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 39%. our focus on the sum of revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin has served us well in balancing both growth with profitability. and in 2020, we exceeded our recently stated goal of hitting the rule of 50. with q1 of 2021 expected to be the last quarter that the pandemic impacts our numbers from a year-over-year perspective, i believe we have an opportunity to reach the rule of 60 in 2021.
our marketing plan throughout 2020 worked very well, delivering strong demo leads throughout the year. in 2021, we plan to continue to spend aggressively on advertising to fuel future revenue growth and continue to expand our roughly 5% market share in a large and expanding hcm tam. we are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate hcm systems with the value proposition of paycom's single database solution that is stronger than ever for companies of all sizes, including companies well above our stated targeted range. we continue to be pulled well above our stated target range as larger companies look to leverage automated processes for their own employees.
at the same time, our small business ads continue to increase in 2020, thanks to the efforts of our expanded inside sales force. growing employee usage of the paycom system is generating a substantial return on investment for our clients, their employees and paycom. high employee usage rates, as measured by our direct data exchange, or ddx, remains strong across our client base. when combined with high adoption of manager on-the-go, these applications are creating new opportunities for product innovation and automation.
an example of such automation that we've deployed internally is fully automated payroll. it has been our goal to provide our clients with a better employee transaction interface for payroll. beti, or b-e-t-i, is that better employee transaction interface. beti guides individuals through an employee-specific payroll process in which they create and approve their own paycheck.
this means payroll is completed at period end, which has traditionally been the date in which the payroll department gets started. what used to take entire payroll teams days to aggregate is now fully automated and put directly into the employees' hands. this new approach leverages all of our solutions to produce what we call the perfect payroll and eliminates duplicative processes that can create confusion and inaccuracies when employees don't have visibility or control over their own payroll data. this level of employee controls the future of payroll, and i'm looking forward to being able to roll beti out to the market in 2021.
as of december 31, 2020, our headcount stood at approximately 4,200 employees, up 12% year over year, as we continue to hire high-quality talent throughout the pandemic to further bolster the foundation of our future growth. while greater than 95% of our employees continue working remotely across the country, we look forward to returning to our offices at some point this year, but only when it's safe to do so. paycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2020. we are in the top five ranking in best places to work in the u.s.
by top workplaces and the no. 1 spot in oklahoma. and we were named in the fortune 100 fastest-growing companies for the fourth consecutive year. these awards are very rewarding and a testament to our execution and thriving corporate culture.
additionally, i want to congratulate the 2020 paycom jim thorpe award winner, trevon moehrig of texas christian university. this award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes jim thorpe, who is one of the greatest all-around athletes in history. jim thorpe also happened to be an oklahoman. to sum up, we address the 2020 challenges with confident resolve which enabled our solutions to shine and expose the weaknesses of other disparate systems in the market.
the pandemic's impact on our pre-pandemic client revenue remained stable. and while it's unclear if or when those same clients will add to their employee counts, our continued growth relies on remaining focused on the three controllable activities that made 2020 so successful. that is providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. our commitment to investing through the pandemic generated elevated leads and sales.
once we get past q1 2021, we will have lapped the pandemic's impact on our comparable year-over-year numbers. finally, i'd like to thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and flexibility. as we said throughout 2020, the pandemic didn't build character, it revealed it. i was glad to see we were all who we thought we were.
your efforts have set us up great for 2021. with that, i'll turn the call over to craig for a review of our financials and guidance. craig?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and secretary
before i review our fourth quarter and full-year results for 2020 and also our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2021, i would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-gaap basis. as chad mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth-quarter results with total revenues of $220.9 million, representing growth of roughly 14% over the comparable prior-year period. our full-year 2020 revenue was $841.4 million, representing growth of 14% compared to 2019. our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins, including very strong new client revenue starts in the fourth quarter.
we ended 2020 with approximately 31,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 17% compared to 2019. on a parent-company-grouping basis, we ended the year with approximately 16,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 18% compared to 2019. within total revenues, recurring revenue was $216.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 14% from the comparable prior-year period. total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $188.9 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 85.5%, up 20 basis points compared to the prior-year period.
for the full-year 2020, our adjusted gross margin was 85.9%, also up 20 basis points compared to full-year 2019. for 2021, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%. adjusted total administrative expenses were $119.1 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $98.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $58.9 million or 26.7% of revenues.
we have been very pleased with our marketing strategy throughout 2020, which more than double the demo lead request compared to 2019, and we plan to continue to invest in marketing in q1 and throughout 2021. adjusted r&d expense was $23.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 10.5% of total revenues. adjusted total r&d costs, including the capitalized portion, were $33.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $25.1 million in the prior-year period. adjusted total r&d costs for the full-year 2020, including the capitalized portion, were $118.3 million or 14.1% of total revenues, compared to $93.3 million or 12.6% of total revenues in the prior year.
even through the pandemic, we aggressively recruited talent in r&d, and we plan to continue to invest in our future growth through innovation and new product development. adjusted ebitda was $84.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 38.1% of total revenues, compared to $78.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 or 40.6% of total revenues. for the full-year 2020, adjusted ebitda was $330.8 million or 39.3% of total revenues, compared to $317.9 million or 43.1% of total revenues in 2019. our gaap net income for the fourth quarter was $24.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share based on approximately $58 million shares versus $45.4 million or $0.78 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior-year period.
our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 33.4%. for the full-year 2020, our gaap net income was $143.5 million or $2.46 per diluted share. non-gaap net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $49.1 million or $0.84 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $50.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior-year period. we expect noncash stock-based compensation for the first quarter of 2021 to be approximately $26 million.
for the full year, we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $110 million. for 2021, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be 25% to 26% on a gaap basis. on a non-gaap basis, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be 27% to 28%. we anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 58 million shares in the first quarter of 2021.
turning to the balance sheet. we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $152 million and total debt of $30.9 million related to the construction at our corporate headquarters. cash from operations was $52.9 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. the average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020.
during 2020, we repurchased approximately 433,000 shares for a total of roughly $115 million, including 244,000 shares purchased in the open market. through december 31, 2020, paycom has repurchased 4.1 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $423 million, and we currently have $135 million remaining in our buyback program. now let me turn to guidance. with the continued stabilization of our current client revenue base, we are pleased to be able to provide q1 and full-year guidance that is consistent with our historical guidance approach of guiding to what we can see as of today.
as a reminder, the effect on our current client revenue of lower headcount at our pre-pandemic clients continues to represent a loss of approximately $1.9 million to $2 million in weekly recurring revenue. the impact of 150-basis-point interest rate cut that occurred in march of 2020 represents an additional loss of roughly $350,000 in weekly recurring revenue. also, the first quarter benefits from form-filing revenue related to employee tax forms for payrolls run in 2020. we estimate that in q1 2021, there will be fewer forms filed than normally would have been filed by our client base as a result of fewer employees working in industries hardest hit by the pandemic and lower overall turnover in those industries.
fewer forms filed represents a roughly $6 million to $7 million headwind to q1 2021 recurring revenue. with these factors in mind, our full year and first-quarter 2021 guidance is as follows: for the fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $1.009 billion to $1.011 billion or approximately 20% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of $396 million to $398 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 39.3% at the midpoint of the range. for the first quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $270 million to $272 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of approximately 12% at the midpoint of the range.
we expect adjusted ebitda for the first quarter in the range of $126 million to $128 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 47% at the midpoint of the range. q1 2021 is expected to be the last quarter that the pandemic will impact our year-over-year comparisons. after that, our achievement should be more reflective of the strong fundamental growth our business can generate. with that, we will open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from raimo lenschow from barclays.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great end to the year. you guys -- i mean, as you mentioned, after q1, the comps are getting significantly easier, and you must be looking forward to that as well. how do you think about the linearity as you think about q2, q3, q4? is there -- a lot of your comms have talked about, like, it's actually more the back half of the year, etc. like, how do i have to think about that from your perspective? and then i have one follow-up.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure, raimo. so i mean, our approach to guidance hadn't changed, as craig said in prepared remarks. i mean, we're focused on what we can see. if you compare our q2 through q4 guidance that we've given -- implied guidance that we've given for q2, q4 this year, you'll notice that it's not unlike guidance we've given in the past.
a matter of fact, it's within 0.5 point to 1.5 points of every guide we've started with going all the way back to 2018 for that same period. so we're not going to necessarily get into the linearity of it, but i would just say that we always guide to what we can see, and i believe that we are being consistent in how we provide this guide today.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and secretary
yeah. i would agree with that, raimo. i mean, in terms of linearity, we're not -- we don't have anything in the guidance related to a recovery toward the back half. it would be more level throughout the year on that as opposed to any sort of a back-half recovery that would be baked in.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
yeah. ok. and then this year was like, full year where you had like the inside sales model working. like what have you learned in terms of the pandemic in terms of people kind of selling remotely, inside sales being successful in terms of how you kind of translate it maybe into kind of planning the expansion going forward? i know it's a very broad open question, but i hope that works.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so we had inside sales. we've had it for a while, but we actually took the strategic position with inside sales toward the end of '19, which, really, that group had always been selling online or virtually. we were able to leverage a lot of those processes that we had put in place for inside sales as we made the shift for our outside sales staff.
as we sit here today, we are still 100% virtual selling right now, as well as conversion, as well as upsells to current clients. and so exactly what we would come back as, as far as would we do full selling on site, that's really going to be dictated by the client. i do believe that we've gained some efficiencies in this model, and i'm not just talking about cost. i'm talking about performance, and i believe we would look to maintain those as we look to open back up as a nation here in the coming year.

your next question comes from samad samana from jefferies.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good evening. thanks for taking my questions. chad, maybe first one for you.
just as i think about bookings in the context of that customer data, it looks like paycom added actually more customers in 2020 than it did in 2019, so it certainly kind of supports the strong bookings trends. but also, maybe could you help us understand how the mix of those new customer adds looked versus inside sales versus from the quota-carrying field sales that are now selling virtually versus maybe coming inbound online to some of your advertising campaigns. just trying to think what drove that nice acceleration in units.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so coming into the year, i would have expected, really, our -- because we are selling low market, small business market as well, which we've opened up. i mean, the percentage of small business units that we have, i mean, it's, i believe, mid-90s is the percent of our revenue that's represented by clients that have over 50 employees. so you're still low on the small business.
but in fact, we did accelerate that this year. and i would have expected our average amount per client to drop a little bit. based on that, what we actually saw is you're taking about 10% out, let's call it, just on client employees that you can already calculate through our revenue, so you've already got that hit. and then the fact that we're selling small business clients.
i was a little surprised to see that our average per client held very close to the same. it had been growing for the last several years. but even with the covid hit we took on our numbers, that average stayed really close to the same, and that came from us continuing to have success selling downmarket. but also, we're having a lot of success continuing to sell upmarket and continue to be pulled further up.
and so those are starting to average each other out. but obviously, you do have some higher unit growth as you look at the downmarket opportunities.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
definitely helpful. and then maybe just a follow-up. the total full-year headcount was up about 12%. i'm curious how the quota-carrying reps growth looked in 2020.
and how should we think about that embedded growth in quota-carrying headcount for 2021?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we don't break out that separate from overall. obviously, we had talked about earlier in the year as we were going through the pandemic, we did recoil a little bit and kind of held off on certain things. then once we kind of opened our eyes and saw what was going on, we started to accelerate that to get back to a normal level as we headed throughout the summer.
and so we have -- the number of teams that we have fully staffed, that's at eight per team, and then we look to add people. to the extent that we have any turnover, we would be looking to add people to replace those positions. so no real strong information to give you on exactly the number of quota-carrying employees we added for sales. but what i would say is that you did see us throughout 2020 expand our inside sales model quite a bit, and so that was a new focus that we had not really had until late 2019.
operator
your next question comes from yao chew from credit suisse.
yao chew -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my question. you guys had an amazing year, all things considered, retention, client adds, everything. but in some of our work, we've come across the general sentiment from shared owners that they're looking to do better and be more aggressive, given the lessons and the pain that they've seen over 2020.
so the question i have is do you think 2021 gets tougher, only because from a competitive viewpoint, some of these donors may be renewing or doubling down on the efforts to prevent similar churn or losses that they saw?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean, i believe that, with our product, it's fully differentiated, and it produces a return on investment for our clients, as well as prospective clients. so i don't believe we're going to be getting into the situation where we're doing a lot of price selling. now that said, there's a market for every product, and so you have to be in line with what product fees are. but really, it's an roi-driven strategy, and so we would expect people to uptake our product that want a differentiated strategy with a different roi.
i mean, we just talked about how we're going to be providing -- our products are going to be doing full-service payroll in the future. i mean, employees are going to be doing their own payroll, and we're starting with that right now internally. we've produced a better employee transaction interface through beti, and we're going to be rolling that out throughout the year. and so just as employees are used to applying for jobs online.
they're used to doing their banking online. they're just -- they're used to doing their shopping online. we're going to be bringing that to the payroll business. i mean, it just doesn't make sense that we're not already there, to be quite honest with you.
it's how businesses win. and when you think about the hours businesses save, i mean, why can't employers save more on these types of input activities. i mean, if you're with paycom, you could save 100,000 different key strokes. some of our clients save millions of key strokes every month.
so that's where it's going. i don't see us -- i don't see the market moving away from that. so all that's to say is i believe in order for people to compete with us that the value proposition is going to be more -- is going to have to more match the value proposition that we're delivering because, over time, you're going to be seeing more and more differentiation around what the employees do as it relates to data transfer versus what the employer does as it relates to that same topic.
yao chew -- credit suisse -- analyst
very clear. and i just have a quick follow-up. can you broadly speak to staffing levels of new business wins at this point in time? i'm just curious, as we've worked our way through this, are new guys coming onboard at 25%, 50%, 75% capacity is getting better? just broad strokes is fine.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i will tell you that past may, we've stopped trying to figure that out. i mean, we're out there. we're bringing on business.
they have what they have. if there's growth in that number, great. we're not expecting it. we haven't been forecasting it up to now.
i don't really know what happens next year. but for us, once we've lapped this first quarter, we don't really need the growth in the numbers now. that's not to be flippant about it. obviously, i would love for our clients and everybody to get back to normal.
i guess what i would say is we're very much focused on new business adds, and however many employees they have at that time is really irrelevant to us. we want to set them up correctly, and we need a certain number of new business adds to cover the losses that we experienced from a current client employee headcount attrition. we need a certain amount of revenue and new clients to cover that, and we've been well on our way to doing that, as i believe is reflected in both our numbers and guidance.
operator
your next question comes from mark marcon from baird.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
good afternoon. let me add my congratulations to the whole team. can you talk a little bit more about being pulled upmarket in terms of what you're seeing? what are the characteristics of the bigger-than-target market clients that are coming to you? what exactly are they looking for? who are they typically coming from? and do you see that accelerating? are you seeing more rfps in the large account side?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, we've continued to see it. i mean, i wouldn't say it's a whole lot different than it's been in the past, but we've continued to see acceleration of larger clients above our range coming to us. in fact, two years ago, we moved our range from 2,500, up to 5,000.
we continue to see clients well above the 5,000 range coming to us. i mean, the reason why is because they're working with the same employee. whether you're an employee and you work for a 25,000-employee company or whether you're an employee and you work for a 500-employee company, you really dislike manual processes that really become time suckers out of your day. and so all employees would prefer to use something that's extremely easy to use, comprehensive and has quite a bit of consistency.
and so -- and that's also better for the employer. and so i think that large businesses in the enterprise level have been trying very hard for a long time to provide a single-type solution to their employees because they do realize the importance of that. they've just done it through integration, and we do have a product that works for what they're trying to accomplish that's incredibly scalable. and so i do see us continuing to go upmarket as we're pulled, and i see us continuing to stay focused on the mid-market.
and then as we get leads below 50, we'll continue to sell them as well. but regardless of what size company you work for, you're still the same in person and you're still the same employee, and you value things of ease when it comes to task management and hcm. so all that's to say is enterprise products are overcomplicating the situation for the employee. and a lot of you guys on the call, you know that.
you work for companies with large organizations, and it's kind of a mess you have to work with in technology. it's oftentimes an eight-legged octopus with no head, so we're fixing that problem in mid-market. and i see us doing the same as we continue to be pulled upmarket.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
great. and can you talk a little bit about attach rates for new modules with the new clients? what are you seeing the strongest attach rates? and then also, to the extent that you're upselling existing clients, what are you seeing the strongest success on?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we are having strong attach rates across the board. i think that the new innovations that we've come out with, with both ddx and manager on-the-go, is really helping with that. as we look to go to a full-service payroll set, you're going to need all products.
i mean, you're going to need benefits administration. you're going to need expense management. you're going to need time and attendance. you're going to need paid time-off request.
you're going to obviously need payroll. and so the more full solution sets we're able to deploy, the stronger value proposition or higher the roi the client is going to be able to achieve. again, it's not purchasing the products that produces the roi. it's using the products that produces the roi.
and as we move to more self-service initiatives, which we're already there, we're going to be measuring that for a client which we believe drives a greater overall usage of the entire product.

your next question comes from daniel jester from citi.
daniel jester -- citi-analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. just on retention, looking backwards in 2020, can you just comment kind of how the year progressed? did you see the largest churn sort of in the desk of the challenges in the spring? or is it because the customer churn pretty stable as the year progressed?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, we don't necessarily disclose win. i will say that it's a revenue-retention number. and so, obviously, clients that went out of business would have impacted that number, and then clients who may have had reduction in force could have impacted that number to some extent.
so the fact that we remained strong at 93%, we were happy with that. the question becomes, would it have been higher had we not had the pandemic? and i think that's what 2021 puts in front of us to be able to prove that out. and so -- but we haven't changed the way we calculate our retention number since well before ipo. we were stuck at around 91% for about six years.
we moved that up to 92% a year ago -- or two years ago. we moved it up to 93% a year ago. and then this year, we held the line at that percentage as we went through the pandemic.
daniel jester -- citi-analyst
that's really helpful. and then maybe one for craig. in 2020, revenue was up 14%, but cash from operations was up only 1%. so as i think about sort of cash flow in 2021, can you help us think about how that could look relative to your guidance?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and secretary
yeah. in terms of cash flow, the things that are going to impact our cash flow, obviously, are tax rates, as well as our capex. and so i would expect our capex for 2021 as a percent of revenue to be fairly similar as a percent of revenue as what we saw in 2020. one thing to kind of keep in mind is that, capex, we're still completing the dallas operations.
and so that will be complete probably end of q2. we may still have some carryover costs on that on q3. so as you're kind of looking at capex, that would be the impact for 2021.

your next question comes from brian schwartz from oppenheimer.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
yeah, hi. thanks for taking my question. craig, i just had a follow-up question for you. you've mentioned a comment that you're anticipating some sort of a recovery in the second half of the year.
is it possible just to provide a little more color on how you're thinking about that? are you thinking that it could be a full recovery in the base exiting the year or a partial recovery? just wondering if you could share a little more color on that comment, how you're thinking about the pace of the recovery.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and secretary
no. brian, i indicated that we had not baked in any recovery in our guidance numbers. we're -- as we provide guidance for the full year, we have not included a recovery in those numbers.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
ok. and then i had one other question. just is it possible to quantify the impact or the headwind from lost w-2s in that q1 for us?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and secretary
yeah. we had -- in the prepared remarks, we talked about $6 million to $7 million that it will impact our q1 numbers, we feel like. obviously, that's an estimate based on the number of w-2s we would have expected to file. that would be w-2s, 1099s, 1095s for our clients and kind of what we would have expected in a normal year and then what we will file this year based on the fact that certain industries didn't have the -- obviously didn't have the headcount in the middle of the year or the turnover of those employees that would have generated a w-2.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. for example, on that, brian, it wouldn't be uncommon for a 250-employee restaurant to have 500 w-2s. now it's important to also note that our forms business isn't just w-2s. it's w-3 submittals.
it's 1099s. it also includes, in our case, aca forms that are also fee related and charged for in the first -- in the first quarter, and so there's more in there than just w-2s. but the short answer is those industries most impacted oftentimes would have higher turnover rates. and so again, it wouldn't be uncommon for a restaurant that might have 250 employees, you could see 450 or 500 w-2s on that in a full year.
and in this type of year, for someone that may have had 250 employees, we may have only seen 275 w-2s because of kind of when it happened and then we lack some growth on that. and so that's how it's calculated in expectation of what normally happens with our w-2s as it corresponds to the business that we have and their number of employees and then what didn't happen this year in regards to that. and so again, that's a first-quarter impact only that we're talking about.

our next question comes from robert simmons from rbc capital markets.
robert simmons -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. i was wondering if you could speak to what you're assuming in your guidance for retention rates this year.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
we don't guide to what we assume for retention. i can tell you that we're very bullish on our product and the return on investment that it uses. we're also bullish on watching how clients use the product and how they're actually achieving that, and we do believe that does impact retention in a positive way. and so i would say that we are bullish as we look toward retention this year, but that's not something we guide to as we sit here today.
robert simmons -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. ok. and then now that all the public payroll companies have reported their calendar 4q results, was there anything on any of them that you heard that surprised you positively, negatively or just kind of interesting?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
rob, i'm not going to comment on what our different competitors do out there. i would say our situation is different than theirs. i think our opportunities of what we're achieving has also been showed to be a little bit different, so i wouldn't want to use them as a proxy for what's going to happen to us. and i'm sure -- well, i mean, they may want to use us for a proxy what happens to them, but i don't think we want to go there right now.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and secretary
yeah. i would say we really had a strong q4, and we felt like it was a good q4 and really sets us up well for 2021.
operator
your next question comes from ryan macdonald from needham.
ryan macdonald -- needham & company -- analyst
yes. good evening, gentlemen. thanks for taking my questions. chad, first question for you.
would be curious to hear more about the beti offering and sort of what stage you're at in terms of the rollout there. are you starting to beta that with existing customers? and then naturally, i would think that given the usage component of that or self-usage component per employees that it might fit more naturally as a cross-sell or upsell, which is a bit different than, obviously, that traditional, really focused on hunting model that paycom has really mastered. can you talk about sort of the puts and takes there?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. throughout the year, we'll be rolling beti out. and at some point, it will be not only an upsell to current clients. it will be what we sell as we go to market, that will be the way to do payroll.
we came out with employee self-service in 2002. it was free, and i couldn't even hardly get anybody to look at the product for two years. a matter of fact, it wasn't even until we developed time and attendance online that people started using employee self-service to clock in at time and attendance. and so as we look at this today, i do believe beti is kind of the cherry on the top of the payroll cake.
even internally here, we've returned over 80% of our hours back to our own payroll department, just because of the way we do things now. beti has you doing the payroll throughout versus waiting to pay period end. so what does that do? well, it makes it a lot more efficient for every employee, as well as there's a lot of work now on the payroll side they're just not doing. and then you think of all the after-the-fact corrections, manuals, voids, things that were missed, basically that becomes liability and exposure to the business which is all going away.
and so this is going to happen. just as nobody gets up from their chair and goes and changes their channel on their tv, and we can all remember the days those that happened, that's what's going to happen here. employees are going to do their own payroll, and they're going to do their own payroll because that's the easiest way for them to do it. and they're going to do their own payroll because that's how business wins.
and a matter of fact, that's the only way business can win at payroll. and so that's what we're driving at. in answer to your question, we're using it internally right now. i would expect in second quarter, we'll have our first clients on it.
and then third and fourth quarter, i would see us really starting to roll it out as we move those usage patterns and really move the way people start thinking about payroll. instead of starting payroll when the period ends, you start it when it begins, and the payroll is over when pay period ends. so that's what we're driving at. i believe it's the most significant product that we've ever developed at paycom to be quite honest with you because it fully automates a very complicated task that there's little to 0 room actually for inaccuracies.
payroll has got to be perfect. if you're 99.99% accurate in payroll, you get an f. employees expect it to be perfect. they expect it to be in their bank account, and they're not even really going to thank you for it.
it's an expectation for the work they're doing, and so we're going to make sure that happens. and we're going to put that responsibility as well as confirmation ability in the hands of the employees, which is where it's already at right now. nobody, other than an employee, themselves, knows if they got paid everything that they should have been paid. and it's best to have them confirm that and be a part of that transaction.
so that's what we're going to do, and i would see us rolling this out throughout the year. as far as when does it become popular, when does it become the thing? like i said, took us a while to get people to use employee self-service when we first came out with it. i don't think this is going to take as long as that because we've been really focused on the usage patterns that drives us toward this, and we're real close to being there now. so you're going to have those early adopters, then you're going to have the middle group, and then we'll have everybody else after that, and we'll just kind of have to see how long that takes.
but very excited about it, and this will be a product that we're charging for.
ryan macdonald -- needham & company -- analyst
excellent. that's really helpful. as a follow-up, as you think about adding to sales capacity into the new year, you talked about that 95% of your employees are still working remote. does this change, in how effective you been, changed the way you're thinking about the traditional expansion model of opening a sales office in various regions or cities? are there areas where you can continue to expand with a virtual model in, say, smaller tier 2, tier-3 cities as you look into 2021?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. no. it hasn't changed my thoughts yet. now the go to market could be a little bit different.
what you're talking about, there's territory division and where we place an office and then how we work together. so do i see paycom individuals working together in an office setting moving forward? absolutely. do i know exactly when that would be or what that might look like as we gear back up to maybe be able to visit a client back in their office? i don't know exactly how that looks right now, but i am extremely confident that our employees will be back in their offices, only when it's safe to do so. and we'll continue the mission that we've set for today.
operator
your next question comes from sitik panigrahi from mizuho.
michael berg -- mizuho securities -- analyst
this is michael berg on for sitik. congrats again on a good quarter, and thanks for taking my question. i wanted to quickly follow up on the beti offering. what type of pricing outlook would that be to the core payroll you offer now?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we're not going to disclose pricing right now on this call. but i mean, eventually, it would be published, and you guys will be able to figure that out. but it's important, first, we go through that with our own salespeople individually and our own teams internally.
but again, it will be a price that -- it will be something that we're charging for because it produces an incredible amount of return on investment. and in order to use beti, you had to do everything else right. it's not like you can do everything else wrong and use beti. if you're going to use beti, you have 100% ddx score.
all your managers are using manager on-the-go correctly, and beti has completely automated your entire payroll process. i mean, it's almost the means to the end, if you will, beti as we roll it out. but it will be a product that we're charging for because it does create great value.
michael berg -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. and then it seems like you guys are making some pretty significant progress on the below-50 segment. and you mentioned it's less than 10% of revenues.
how can we think about that a year ago? was that same type of percentage or less than 5%? how can we think about how that's progressed?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
very similar. i believe at ipo, it was 6%. i don't think it's changed dramatically from year to year. i think we're real close to where we've been in the past on that.
now we have added small business teams, but we really just started adding them in earnest in 2019, and i -- and even though they've had a lot of success in 2020. we didn't really even see an incredible drag on our per-client fee, even with losses of certain employees at different clients and with selling small business. now i do believe we would have had more growth in that client revenue number, had we not been selling as many small businesses. but i don't really think the percentage is going to move drastically from where it's at today just because of all the success we're also having upmarket.
operator
your next question comes from bryan bergin from cowen.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thank you. wanted to clarify around bookings. did you see a notable acceleration in 4q demand versus 3q? just curious if there was any indication at all of extensions of sales cycles as covid cases spike in december.
and then how have you seen the pace of demand progress in january?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i can't really say that spikes in covid cases had impacted our sales from week to week. now we did see, again, the spike, how it impacted us in that march, april and may time period where things got really bad and then kind of started to stabilize. but throughout the year, a different spike in cases didn't impact our ability to sell and move products.
now that we've returned to guidance, i believe that our strong sales bookings are included in our guidance as well as our performance. so i'm not going to keep talking about bookings. but what i would say is this that, when we got into march and especially toward the end of march, i didn't have an expectation that 2020 would necessarily be a record for bookings and starts. it was.
and as we turn into 2021, when you're looking at our guidance and you're looking at the things that we have accomplished through the year, i believe we're going to need that also in 2021, which not -- is not unlike any other year we've had in the past, where we've always needed record sales and as well as record starts to hit our numbers and accomplish our goals. so as we head into 2021, there's no difference in that.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and then in the competitive environment, any changes to call out as far as the source of new client additions?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no.
operator
your next question comes from josh beck from keybanc.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i wanted to follow up on some of your early comments, chad, on digital transformation of hcm hitting a critical point. so i'm just curious, initially, obviously, in the pandemic, people were focused on things like collaboration, and they were very heads down. but i'm just curious, as we went through the year, did you see the conversation with clients change, their interest change in a meaningful way? and i'm just curious if that was a big contributor to the pipeline or if there's other factors you could call out there.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'm pretty sure that both employees and hr departments, as well as the c-suite alike, agree that removing middle layers of a data transfer process is the most efficient way to do it. and i think throughout 2020, you saw frustrations rise on both the side of the people doing the input, as well as on the side of the employees that lacked access. and then also, you kind of had to rush to deploy products.
i think 2021 was the year that people dusted off products that they really thought were -- they bought for a certain situation. and then they really tried to use them in 2020. and maybe it didn't work exactly like the brochure said. and so i see this happening more and more.
i think there's always been some reluctance to change. i've always said, waking up and change in acm -- hcm companies. i don't think that's something people look to do every day. it's kind of like waking up and going to the dentist.
so -- but i do think as we move through 2020, it became very obvious to people that you're either winning the game of hcm in your business or you're losing it. and we've identified the way that businesses win. and i think more and more people accept that as what will be the future. and more and more people are motivated to get there now versus waiting too much longer to do that.
and so we'll continue to drive that so that businesses can have a clear roi and a good choice for hcm.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
really helpful. and then on the gross margin guidance, you've discussed the forms headwind in q1. typically, i think q1 is a stronger gross margin period. so should we maybe make some adjustments to what would be a typical year? just anything you can share with us on the gross margin cadence throughout the year.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i think if you look at our -- like i've said before, i mean, ex first quarter, we're still lapping covid there. but once we get into second through fourth quarter, our guide for growth, and it's not, at least on the growth side, isn't incredibly dissimilar than what we've done in 2020, 2019 and 2018 guidance. again, i think it's 0.2% different than last year, and it's maybe a full point different than '18 and -- or than '19 and maybe 1.5 points from '18.
so we feel really good about that. our gross margins remain strong. and so as we've continued to spend in both r&d and sales and marketing, i'm sure you guys have seen our ads, we do believe that as we achieve success of that new business revenue coming in, as well as success of usage of the products that we've deployed, we do think that that's going to be accretive to our margin profile into the future. and i'm very happy with where we've guided right now.
we have set ourselves up well to achieve a, what we call, rule of 60, and so i feel really good about where we're at right now. but just like every year we enter into, there's a lot of work to be done between now and then. so i don't know, craig, if you'd add anything on the margin side.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and secretary
no. i mean, on the gross margin, we kind of gave the guide on -- for the full year at $95 million to $96 million. i mean, obviously, the first quarter is one of our largest gross margin quarter, so the $6 million to $7 million would have a slight impact first quarter. but we still think for the full year, we can finish in that 95% to 96% range.
operator
your next question comes from arvind ramnani from piper sandler.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. yeah. i just wanted to ask about your pipeline that was impacted by the pandemic.
when those clients recover, and i think they will at some point, demand for cloud-based hcm is likely to be very strong from that segment. and there'll be probably, like, pent-up demand from that particular segment. is there anything specific you're doing to make sure that you win your fair share of the demand in terms of hiring sales or delivery teams to be there when the demand does come in?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we never stopped selling those industries. i mean, my philosophy is if you're growing by 100 employees, well, it's a great time to add paycom. if you're reducing force by 100 employees, well, it's a great time to add paycom.
so that's my opinion. we never retreated from trying to sell those organizations. we would look forward to them being able to come back fully. we're not there yet.
but i do think at some point in time, that will happen. i don't really know that it's a light switch that will go on. i think it will more happen over time that we start to see things like that happen. we'll have to see.
haven't seen it yet. and then -- but again, we remain focused on all industries as we remain industry agnostic.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. and just a quick follow-up on that. operationally, there are probably some pretty good lessons that you learned over 2020. so are there any permanent changes or longer-term changes you're looking to kind of put in place, either in terms of sales or investment and sales offices or in terms of delivery teams? and any kind of longer-term changes in the operations of the business?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, there's a lot of changes that we're going to maintain as we head through this. i mean, i would honestly say, probably the only area in which we're kind of waiting to see what's going to be a more accepted practice is how we go to market in sales. we're not waiting on anything else.
i mean, when it comes to how we develop software, when it comes to how we're servicing clients, when it comes to how we're having those meetings, as far as that process, the efficiencies we've gained there, we'd be looking to keep those efficiencies. we've gained efficiencies in conversions and how we do conversions. we would be looking to maintain them. so i'm not -- i don't think there's a whole lot of things we're waiting to see what happens before we make decisions.
there's a few of them. we've talked about those as far as the go to market. but on the back end of efficiencies that we've gained through this process, some of them were forced. we had to gain certain efficiencies to be even able to work at home.
we even -- answer the phones at home. we had to gain certain efficiencies. and so there's things that we're going to maintain as we come back to work from the office, and most of those are already known to us.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and secretary
yeah. one thing i'd say, we are continuing to look for efficiencies throughout the model. i think i'd mentioned, i'd said 95% to 96% on the gross margin. i mean, 85% to 86% is what we're guiding to for full year on the gross margin.
but we're continuing to look for efficiencies throughout the model, and we'll continue to do that.

operator
hello. my name is philip, and i'll be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the paycom software first-quarter 2021 quarterly results conference call. [operator instructions] thank you.
i'd now like to turn the call over to your host, mr. james samford. please go ahead.
james samford -- head of investor relations
thank you, and welcome to paycom's first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. certain statements made on this call that are not historical facts, including those related to our future plans, objectives, and expected performance, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. while we believe any forward-looking statements made on this call are reasonable, actual results may differ materially because the statements are based on our current expectations and subject to risks and uncertainties.
these risks and uncertainties are discussed in our filings with the sec, including our most recent annual report on form 10-k and our most recent quarterly report on form 10-q. you should refer to and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking information. any forward-looking statements made speak only as of the date on which it is made. and we do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
also during today's call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures, including adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and certain adjusted expenses. we use these non-gaap financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. a reconciliation schedule showing gaap versus non-gaap results is included in the press release that we issued at the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. i will now turn the call over to chad richison, paycom's president and chief executive officer.
chad? 
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, james, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. i will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our first-quarter 2021 results, then i'll review the progress we are making on our goals for 2021. following that, craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. but first, i want to thank my colleague and good friend, jeff york, for his many years of service leading our sales organization over the last 14 years.
jeff has built a sustainable sales organization with a deep bench of like-minded professionals. i look forward to continuing to work with him in his strategic leadership role. one of those like-minded individuals is our new chief sales officer, holly faurot. holly is a true success story at paycom.
her 14-year career with us began with an internship in the sales organization. holly quickly progressed into a top sales rep, a top sales manager and a top regional sales manager earning many of the company's highest sales ranking awards along the way. in 2016, she was asked to further expand paycom's client relations department, which presents additional products to clients and focuses on creating value by increasing employee usage. holly has been instrumental in contributing to the success of paycom across the entire sales organization, and i'm confident she will continue to build on the momentum we are seeing.
we delivered strong first quarter results, even with a tough pre-covid year-over-year comparison. our 2021 first quarter revenue of $272.2 million grew 12.3% compared to the prior year period, and came in above the top end of our guidance range despite several previously identified headwinds. unsurprisingly, the first quarter revenue was impacted by lower forms, filings and adjustments due to lower hiring trends in industries most impacted by the pandemic in 2020. excluding forms, filings and adjustments revenue, our year-over-year recurring revenue growth accelerated again in q1.
as we go through 2021, we will have a cleaner comparison that will provide a truer reflection of our revenue growth profile since the arrival of the pandemic. turning to profitability. our first quarter adjusted ebitda was $133 million, representing adjusted ebitda margin of 48.9%. as reflected in our updated guidance, which craig will discuss, we believe the combination of revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin makes us well-positioned to exceed the rule of 60 in 2021.
our marketing plan continues to work very well, delivering strong demo leads in the first quarter. we continue to see success from our advertising spend, and we intend to continue to spend aggressively to fuel future revenue growth and expand a roughly 5% market share in a large and expanding hcm tam. we are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate hcm systems with the value proposition, the paycom single database solution that is stronger than ever. employees expect their hr software to be efficient and easy to use.
in fact, in a recent survey we commissioned with a third party, employees expressed frustration with complex and disparate hr software that lack the transparency and usability they've come to expect from consumer-oriented technologies. paycom's employee usage strategy and single database solutions squarely addresses these expectations. we had record high employee usage rates in q1, as measured by our direct data exchange or ddx. this is fueling new opportunities for product innovation and automation for products like beti, our better employee transaction interface for payroll, which we started rolling out to a select few clients during the quarter.
beti is already receiving high marks as it transforms the way payroll is done. i believe over the next 12 to 18 months, beti will become the standard for how payroll should be done. now that the first quarter is over, we have substantially lapped the pandemic's impact on our comparable year-over-year numbers. new client additions are driving our growth in q2 and beyond.
the negative revenue impact the pandemic had on our pre-pandemic client revenue remained stable. while we haven't seen any material improvement in employment trends at those same clients, our forecast and future growth initiatives are not dependent on any improvement. our strategy throughout the pandemic has remained unchanged. we will continue to focus on the three controllable activities of providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform.
we've done a great job and succeeded in these areas, which has kept us on track to achieve our growth initiatives. i'd like to thank our employees for their patience, flexibility and grit over these last 14 months. in summary, now that we've lapped q1's tough year-over-year comparison with the last pre-covid quarter, we expect that the strength of our growth profile will be reflected in our future results. the record new business revenue and record number of new clients added in 2020, combined with robust first quarter sales, is bolstering our long-term revenue growth opportunity.
as a reminder, we only have approximately 5% market share of a growing tam, so we have a long runway ahead of us. our strategy is working, and our products have never been more relevant. with that, i'll turn the call over to craig for a review of our financials and guidance. craig?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
before i review our first-quarter 2021 results and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021, i would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-gaap basis. as chad mentioned, we are pleased with our first-quarter results with total revenues of $272.2 million representing growth of roughly 12% over the comparable prior year period, which was primarily driven by new business wins, including very strong new client revenue starts in the first quarter. within total revenues, recurring revenue was $267.8 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 12% from the comparable prior year period. as expected, the effects of lower headcount on our pre-pandemic clients and the impact of 150 basis point interest rate cut that occurred in march 2020 remained relatively unchanged.
in addition, as we discussed on our q4 2020 earnings call, your employees working in industries hardest hit by the pandemic and lower overall turnover in those industries resulted in fewer annual forms, filings and adjustments. it is difficult for us to estimate the exact amount that those trends impacted us, but we don't believe it was dramatically different from our expectations. total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $236.9 million, representing adjusted gross margin of 87%. for 2021, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%.
adjusted total administrative expenses were $118.8 million for the first quarter as compared to $108.4 million in the first quarter of 2020. adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2021 was $59.3 million or 21.8% of revenues. we continue to be very pleased with our marketing strategy with another quarter of very strong demo leads, and we plan to continue to invest in marketing throughout the remainder of 2021. adjusted r&d expense was $23.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 8.5% of total revenue.
adjusted total r&d costs, including the capitalized portion, were $34 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $27.6 million in the prior year period. we have been aggressively recruiting talent in r&d to drive our future growth through innovation and new product development. adjusted ebitda was $133 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 48.9% of total revenues compared to $117.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 or 48.7% of total revenues. we benefited from cost efficiencies in g&a, which we expect to continue throughout the year.
we plan to continue to invest in the marketing and r&d. our gaap net income for the first quarter was $64.6 million or $1.11 per diluted share versus $63 million or $1.08 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. non-gaap net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $85.9 million or $1.47 per diluted share versus $77.9 million or $1.33 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. we expect noncash stock-based compensation for the second quarter of 2021 to be approximately $27 million to $28 million.
for the full year, we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $105 million to $110 million. turning to the balance sheet. we ended the first quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $215.1 million and total debt of $30.5 million related to construction at our corporate headquarters. cash from operations was $89.5 million for the first quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model.
the average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021. shifting to guidance. we have now substantially lapped the last pre-covid year-over-year comparison, and our guidance for strong second quarter revenue growth represents a true reflection of the strong performance we achieved throughout 2020. we are pleased to be able to provide the following q2 and full year guidance.
for the second quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $231 million to $233 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda for the second quarter in the range of $80 million to $82 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 35% at the midpoint of the range. for fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1.017 billion to $1.019 billion, up from $1.009 billion to $1.011 billion, or approximately 21% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of $400 million to $402 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 39.4% at the midpoint of the range.
to conclude, our strategy to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and grow the business has been working. and we will continue to focus on providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. we have a strong balance sheet, a profitable recurring business model and a long runway to deliver sustainable long-term revenue growth. with that, we will open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question is from the line of raimo lenschow with barclays.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
it's very close. thank you. congrats on a great quarter, and i'm sure you're looking forward to q2. chad, can you maybe remind us, because that's the question i get a lot from investors.
how can the 12% growth in q1 jump to like 28% growth in q2? like, obviously, the comps are getting into like, maybe talk about the puts and takes that are driving it because that makes it really exciting. and then one for craig. you mentioned that the cost efficiency efficiencies in d&a. can you just kind of elaborate a little bit on that one? thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, raimo. so i guess, first, i would say, as you know, q1 is typically one of our largest quarters for revenue in any given calendar year. and that's because of our annualized revenue billings of forms, filings and adjustments that come in throughout the year, which have to do with hiring and turnover trends throughout the year at different businesses.
well, 2020 reacted differently than any other year since i've been doing this since 1998, in which the hiring trends were different. it would be traditionally a restaurant that may have 100 employees could easily do 300 w-2s with forms, filings and what have you. this year, that same-restaurant may do 120 w-2. so we saw significant differences in hiring trends throughout 2020 than what we had seen in the past.
we did try to estimate what those would be. also, as a reminder, this q1, we are still lapping q1 of a previous year that did not have covid in it, which made for tougher comps. and as we move through second quarter, we've substantially lapped the pandemic. now you did still have recurring revenue still getting worse throughout the month of april, as we had mentioned it kind of got to its worst point beginning in may and then started to stabilize.
but we are excited about our next quarter guide. the guide that we're putting forth in q2 of this year is the largest q2 guide we've had since 2017 on a percentage basis for revenue growth. so you weren't necessarily wrong in your early take that we're getting back on the right track or [foreign language], raimo, as you might say in your native language.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
that's very good.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
my minor's paying off. my german minor is paying off. craig will answer your second one. his last name is boelte.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
in terms of the g&a line and the cost efficiencies we're seeing, as we're looking to hire additional people, those are primarily going to be in other areas of our income statement. so we're continuing to hire aggressively in the r&d area and in the sales and marketing, as well as in the operations area. so we're just not going to see the same level of hiring on the g&a line as what we would see in other areas of the business.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of samad samana with jefferies.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions, chad. maybe the first one for you. on the bookings side, as you mentioned, we're starting to kind of lap last year, and you guys had a great 2020. would you say was 1q 2020 from a bookings perspective, was it a record compared to other quarters? maybe just help us further triangulate on the in-quarter new bookings performance? and then just a follow-up question as well.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i mean since obviously, our bookings have been very strong. i mean last year, we did have record bookings, as well as that record new business revenue as well as a record number of clients to our platform, which was an increase from prior years. as we've returned to guidance, we've gotten away from talking about bookings.
obviously, our bookings are very strong as what's reflected in our second quarter guide.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
understood. and then maybe on beti, you mentioned a couple of customers have already been rolled out for them. could you maybe help us understand how pricing for that's working? and maybe how pervasive the use of that looks like at those customers?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean beti is really an all or nothing type usage product. i mean you do have to change your internal process in order to use beti because like we've said in the past, payrolls are traditionally started after pay period end. and beti contemplates all that happening at payroll beginning to where once pay period ends, the payroll is done.
and so we have had clients already submit using beti and their employees are actually able to use beti. as a matter of fact, one, within the first hour of release, we had like 65% employee approvals and by time of submission, they were over 85%. so employees are already engaging in it. we're getting feedback from employees that this is the first time i've really looked at my check and less understood it.
so we're having a lot of positive there. we expect to put on at least 100 more clients in the next couple of months on beti and then throughout the year, we'll continue to convert all over. and what i mean by convert, it's not a conversion of debt. it's more a conversion of their internal process and how you approach each payroll a little bit differently.
in our own environment, we've gone from over 55 clicks or processes within a payroll down to three. each person's experience is going to be differently depending on whether you're doing commissions, bonuses, labor distribution, job costing. so it is a little bit different for each company, but it does drive a lot of efficiencies. and as those payroll administrators submit payroll, they have a very high degree of confidence in the accuracies that have already been approved by those employees.
so it's going very well now. as far as billing, beti is not going to be billed unlike many of our other modules. it will be a per like per employee fee to use beti. and then as we move throughout this year, we'll continue to sell more and more clients on its value.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and i apologize in advance for squeezing a third one in, but i'll break the rules here. any other changes we should expect with holly's appointment in her new role? any other changes to either the go-to-market motion or the sales organization that we should anticipate in conjunction with that?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean we changed the sales organization every year. we changed about three or four years ago to really focus on employee usage as an organization. we focused on selling usage. we'd come out with the ddx, then we came out with manager on-the-go, now beti.
so obviously, as we settle into this year, there are some changes that we make to our selling motion, but that's not unlike what we've done in any given year. holly was our first intern on the sales side. and actually, she started interning for us when i was the sales manager. so holly has a deep knowledge of what we've been doing this entire time.
she's helped us build it up to now. and the reason why holly was chosen is it allows us to continue to increase the drive that we have throughout our sales organization with a consistent leader with also a consistent talk track that we've been driving throughout the sales organization for the last 20 years. so i wouldn't see any significant changes happening to the sales other than what we always have, which is improvements on our strategies as we deliver more value to the client.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
perfect. thanks again for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of brad reback with stifel.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. chad, the upside in the quarter wasn't as robust as we've come to expect with you guys. was there any sort of one or two items in the quarter that maybe weren't as strong? w-2s maybe a bit below original expectations or anything along those lines?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's related to year-end services. i mean we have pretty good visibility quarter to quarter based on our recurring revenue. and then what we believe we will be adding from a new client revenue perspective.
when you're looking at year end, which, as you guys have seen in the past, are typically our largest quarters because of those year-end service fees. it gets harder to put an exact number on how those negative trends impacted us. we did a pretty good job of estimating that. and we don't necessarily guide to have a certain level of beat.
we guide to what we can see and oftentimes with new business revenue, that can be impacted one way or the other. and as it relates to first quarter, though, we've always been heavy on annual forms, filings, adjustments. and also to note that it's not just our w-2 forms with us. we also have aca forms at the end of every year as well.
so i think we did a pretty good job estimating its impact. obviously, the fact that we continue to grow throughout the quarter, and we're coming out strong into q2, reflects that we did have strong adds throughout q1 and coming out of q4. but those numbers were impacted by our annual forms filing business.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of mark marcon with baird.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. i'm wondering, the commentary with regards to what you're seeing in terms of the number of employees within the client base. you mentioned it wasn't much of a help in terms of the first quarter, but as you look through the quarter and going into march and then april and now going into may, are you starting to see a rebuild? and how should we think about the sensitivity in terms of if there's a 1% increase in terms of the number of employees, how does that translate to revenue, broadly speaking?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean well, we'd like to think 1% equals 1%, but that 1% has to happen across our client base that we serve, which is less than 5% of the total addressable market. so in answer to your question, as far as those clients that were mostly impacted by the pandemic that we said really hit its worst for us in may and then started to stabilize for us, we haven't seen any meaningful changes in those same clients. so as we move forward, i don't know that, that number becomes an important bellwether for us as far as that $1.85 million to $2 million impact that we see from the recurring revenue negative impact from those clients.
so i don't know that it's a part of our story moving forward. obviously, we would hope that those clients are able to hire back and that they are able to come out of it in the same situation that they entered into it. but we'll have to see again. we're not seeing any meaningful improvement in those numbers.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
ok. is that because of certain industries, chad? or i mean when you take a look at the overall employment numbers, broadly speaking, it does seem like sequentially, on a seasonally adjusted basis, things are improving broadly speaking, and we'll get the april report here in a few days. is it just certain industries? or what would be the reason why we wouldn't start seeing some of the national trends come down to the paycom client base?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean our comments weren't really a wholesale about the united states as much as it is about these particular clients that work with us and were working with us prior to the pandemic that they had layoffs and different hiring trends throughout the year. a lot of them may have been kept afloat with the ppp that's been out there and what have you. but we haven't seen any significant movement with that group. like i said, i do believe that people took their hits early as it related to many of our clients.
they may not be as quick to add people back. potentially, some may have become a little bit more efficient. there may be some out there that are struggling. but again, we've been focused on adding new business to our pipeline, and focused on those.
so all that's to say, it's been stable with that group, and i don't know if or when the trends would impact that group because i believe it's going to be more of a client-by-client impact.
operator
your next question is from the line of daniel jester with citi.
daniel jester -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. kind of along the same line, chad. i mean i think many would project that we're going to see some historic levels of hiring here in the u.s.
in the next couple of quarters. so you've been through macro up cycles in the past. so maybe you can just remind us, how does sort of the hr, either the buying cycle or sort of the spending intention, how does that evolve as we get into a really brisk hiring environment? do you see hr officer trying to get ahead of that? or is there a bit of paralysis because they're focused on growth in the business and maybe don't want to make a change on their payroll module when the outlook looks so great?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean i think we're in a business where we make those departments more efficient. and so to the fact that you need to go hire many people using our onboarding product, using our applicant tracking or talent acquisition product, using our background checks products that we have out there. i mean i think that we can aid people in that.
so i also think you're really seeing a shift toward the employee user. i don't know that four years ago, you could even point to many employee users, especially in the mid-market. and today, that's really becoming the standard. and so i think there are a lot of business that are focused on leveraging employee usage trends of what they use in their daily lives working with consumer products.
i think there's a lot of businesses looking to leverage that to create value for themselves. so as businesses come back, and i'm not saying that we're not seeing positive hiring trends. my comments are related to those clients that represented the $1.85 million to $2 million weekly impact. we're not seeing those numbers move dramatically.
are we seeing impacts of businesses starting to come back and hotels starting to hire more and what have you? we're seeing some of that and where we can see that is in our talent acquisition as more requisitions are open, is in our background checks. so i do think things are getting better, but the question was more related to, how are those clients that were impacted, those clients that we said had that monthly weekly negative revenue impact of $1.90 million to $2 million. i think about a quarter or so ago, we called out, it may have improved $100,000 a week-ish. it kind of fluctuated week to week.
and then now we haven't seen any substantial sustainable change from that, which would be accurate as we sit here today. but we are bullish about employee trends beginning to get better for us. it's never something that we've been able to focus on, lay our hat on that or bet the farm on that, you've got to really do the work. and what we are doing, we are going out, and we are selling businesses right now.
and if they have 415 employees, then we're selling them at that, and we're bringing them on. now maybe they grow, maybe they don't. but we've just been focused on adding new business onto our platform, and that's worked well for us.
daniel jester -- citi -- analyst
great. thank you. and then just on beti quickly. now that you've announced that and you're starting to get customers on it, are you seeing some of your other customers kind of get more with some of the modules that they need to be able to use beti? so are you seeing more engagement on manager on-the-go? are you seeing more engagement on ddx as customers get ready to use beti in the future?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. both manager on-the-go and ddx are at the highest level of usage, no matter how you measure it. and i'm talking about at the highest level of usage right now. and so that's been getting better and better as we've gone throughout the, i would say, i think we've had the ddx for the last 18, 19 months.
we had manager on-the-go now for well over a year. and so we continue to see those trends tick up. now is that in anticipation for beti? or is that because of the value someone's receiving by using those things independently, whether you're setting up for beti or not? i would say it's probably the latter, but the fact that it's happening will set us up very well for beti. and i do believe that as people look and see the value that beti is going to deliver for both the business as well as the employees, i think you're going to even have more usage around the ddx and manager on-the-go, from a best practice perspective.

your next question is from the line of brian schwartz with oppenheimer.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
yes. hi. thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. chad, one question for you and then a follow-up for craig.
for you, on the new business that was coming in the quarter, can you share any color in regards to the linearity on how that business came in? it seemed like there was a possibly a different operating environment when we started in january versus kind of the end of the quarter. and then i have a follow-up for craig.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. no, i wouldn't say there's been any meaningful difference in how we brought in our revenue in first quarter this year than how we brought in revenue in first quarter of subsequent years. you're going to typically have your greatest number of starts in the first part of that as people look to start fresh at the beginning of a year. of course, in first quarter, your quarter-to-date and year-to-dates are the same.
so any time in the first quarter is not a bad time to convert and what have you. but no, i wouldn't say that we've seen trends meaningfully different than what we'd seen in the past as far as when someone chooses to start in the quarter.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
and then, craig, one follow-up i just have on the guidance, maybe underlying the annual guidance. i remember last quarter, when you reinstated the annual guidance, you set a target out there for a rule of 60. and at that time, that guidance had assumed no macro recovery. and you are raising your guidance here today, still targeting that rule of 60 for this year.
but i'm just wondering if there's any change in terms of your view on the timing behind a macro recovery or if it still assumes no big macro recovery this year? thanks.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean our annual guidance still assumes no macro recovery at this time. so consistent with how we guided last year as well.
operator
your next question is from the line of robert simmons with rbc.
robert simmons -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. can you talk to what you're seeing in terms of return to office and return to in person selling and also then what the expense and margin implications of that are or could be?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so is that question as it relates to us or clients from a return to office?
robert simmons -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
mostly for you, but whatever you're seeing.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, first, i'd say it's very regional and return-to-office strategy is depending on where you're located. for us internally, we've continued to be work from home for most everybody. we have put out a return-to-office plan for our employees, beginning with the supervisors and certain leaders coming in june.
we will then have team leaders start to come back in, in july. and then we will start alternating in our general population throughout the month of august in hopes of being back to the office full-time in september. now, when you're talking about ourselves opportunities as far as going to meet with clients, we're going to continue to meet clients where they live. you may have some clients that are wanting us to come in.
you may have some parts of our sales process in our steps of certain sales that continue to stay in more of a hybrid model, and then i would see us going in person for others. but i wouldn't say that we're back at that level or anywhere close yet. in fact, we don't have any salesperson that's gone out and called on a business in person yet. so we're kind of waiting to see how that develops.
i would say we're hopeful. but i think that's something that's going to just kind of happen throughout these next couple of quarters, and we'll just kind of see what happens.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes, on the expense related to kind of return to office. we wouldn't see that as significant increase in cost. we're already maintaining the buildings and all of those things. so even on the travel side, we wouldn't see a significant uptick.
and any of that's been already baked into our guidance.
robert simmons -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
your next question is from the line of ryan macdonald with needham and company.
josh reilly
hey guys. this is josh on for ryan. just one question from me. if you look at platform usage pre-covid versus today, do you think clients are deepening their understanding of productivity? and how software can affect their workflows that previously maybe they didn't understand in the same way versus managing their operations? and then do you think this results in a permanent shift of customers buying more modules upfront as we exit the pandemic? or could there be some reversion to pre-pandemic trends?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i mean it would be hard to think that we're going to go backwards in technology. it doesn't usually happen that way once you've made that jump. so i wouldn't think that we're going backwards. as far as your question about, i do believe that the farther an employee is away, maybe the more metrics you may have to look at.
the harder an employee is to touch, the more metrics you're left with that you really need to manage. and so i do think being able to engage with employees through technology makes it both easier for the employee as well as for the business to kind of really share in the same transparency there. so i don't see us going backwards in regards to that. it's something that was happening anyway.
i mean it wasn't that the pandemic created these opportunities. i think the pandemic more sealed the fate of the old way. in fact, we were already seeing trends with employees that are used to using consumer-based technology to do banking, get a plane ticket, order a coffee and then they came to work, and it was 1992 through email and what have you. and so we were already seeing the trends of that usage happening.
i think the pandemic just provided a stronger proof source for. the reason for that, it probably accelerated that for some people. but i don't see us going backwards in that because it was right before the pandemic, and the pandemic just produced another proof source for reasons why it's important for employees to have a direct relationship with the database.

your next question is from the line of siti panigrahi with mizuho.
unknown speaker -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hey guys. it's actually matt diamond on siti's behalf. congrats on the strong print. i've heard the questions about guidance but i want to phrase mine a little bit differently.
it looks like the magnitude of the 2q guide and the magnitude of the annual year, the full year guide, implies some strength in the back half of the year. i know you can only comment on what you see for sure right now, but i'd love to get your insight on how to disentangle the magnitude of the 2q guide and that of the annual guide. anything you're seeing in the second half of the year specifically would be helpful.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we've always guided to what we can see. we have not changed that approach. as we'd said, the q2 is our highest guide that we've had since 2017.
as we sit here today, i really don't know deals that are starting in october. but i know as we move throughout this quarter and especially as we move throughout future into the future quarters that we'll see more and more revenue that we're onboarding.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
no, that's what i would say as well. as we set up our guide, we guide to what we can see. and for the back half, we'll continue to take a look and update as appropriate.
unknown speaker -- mizuho securities -- analyst
and on the sales office side, i know there's been some commentary around a return to the office. i'm curious about your plans for sales office openings this calendar year. is there any light that could be shed there?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
it's still part of our strategy, opening sales offices, and we're going to continue to do that as it makes sense. as we talked about during the pandemic, every office was substantially open because our people could really sell a prospect anywhere. prior to the pandemic, it was all in person. so if we wanted to sell a deal in las vegas, we don't have an office in las vegas.
we had to fly someone there and go there in person. during the pandemic, we were able to do that virtually. and so as we shift back, there will be offices that we'll be looking to open. and then we'll have to do it in the right time as well because i'm not 100% sure when we will be going to full in-office selling again if ever from that perspective as it relates to the mid-market.
and i'm talking about where every appointment is in person. i mean before if we had five appointments with the prospect, every one of them were in person. i'm not 100% sure that's going to be the case on a go-forward basis. and that's not something we're trying to force.
that's something where we're going to meet the prospects where they live in a way that produces a successful communication for both us and the prospect.
operator
your next question is from the line of bryan bergin with cowen.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. thank you. i wanted to ask a question around client switching behavior. so the large incumbent providers have talked about a retention benefit for them that seems to be partly supported by a switch here from the pandemic uncertainty and some of the ppp reporting requirements.
has your sales team seeing any of that behavior in the pipeline? and if so, do you consider that an incremental opportunity as things normalize?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, our retention is directly reflected with usage. in fact, someone gave me a retention report the other day, and i thought it was a usage report because the trends are almost the exact same. you watch usage go up, you watch retention go up. and so that's really what we've been seeing as a reflection of strong retention, it's about usage.
are there things out there that make it to where somebody is less likely to switch? i mean i don't think so. i mean you're going to become more efficient if you switch to us. we have a very strong value proposition. your employees are going to like it more.
and we're going to create even more value. so i don't really think waiting is a good opportunity to wait on that. and so we've been focused on driving revenue prior to the pandemic. we've been focused driving it during the pandemic.
and once the pandemic ends, i mean it's not my job to say when that happens. but once the pandemic's over, i would expect us to continue to have strong sales regardless of what's out there as far as trends one way or the other with software because of the efficiencies that we're driving and the dramatic difference in experience that a client is going to have using our product today than what they would have four or five years ago.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and then just are you seeing any different behavior in what modules existing clients are attaching as the economy is reopening here? or seeing any new clients take on more at the point of purchase?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
look, background checks are doing better than they've done in the past or than they did last year because you're having more people hired. when i talk about hiring trends and improvement, i'm talking about those businesses that we had pre-pandemic that were hit. i'm not talking about all the new businesses that we've added since or businesses that weren't hit negatively by the pandemic last year. so i want to be able to separate the two of those.
when i'm talking about hiring trends where we're not seeing improvement, i'm talking about those clients that were most impacted by the pandemic last year, and they're in the industries you would think they would be in. but we still do see positive trends happening across the board with more people doing background checks, doing onboarding today more so than they were doing last year, but we're still not back to where we were at pre-pandemic levels.

your next question is from the line of josh beck with keybanc.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. chad, you made a pretty specific comment about beti becoming the standard for payroll in 12 to 18 months. so i'm just curious what you mean by that? would love to hear a little more on that topic.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i think all of our clients will be using beti within the next 12 to 18 months.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. that definitely clarifies it. what about with respect to marketing and advertising? how have you changed maybe the composition, the channels versus, say, pre-pandemic? is there any notable differences in how you want to invest across those areas?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, i would just say we've gotten better at it, as you continue to spend on it. and again, we measure this week after week, week over week, based off the number of leads that we get. and some weeks, leads are generated in areas, maybe a little bit stronger areas one week than what we may see in the next week.
meaning that you may have more come in digitally one week and the next week could be delivered through what we're doing from a targeted marketing perspective where we already know who you are, we're targeting you. all of that is a part of our marketing strategy. we're not just putting ads on tv and seeing who's calling us. we have many legs to our marketing department and as well as to our marketing strategy.
and so it's continued to evolve. and we've continued to measure it the same way. i mean our successful marketing campaign delivers demo leads for us. those are companies that request a demo.
we have leads that aren't demo leads of someone that may go in and download white papers or they're interested, but they have not yet requested a demo. from a demo lead perspective, we're still setting appointments with over 90% of those as they come in. so they're very strong leads for us, and we've been having a lot of success there.

your next question is from the line of arvind ramnani with piper sandler.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. congrats on a good quarter. i just want to go back to this topic of beti. you certainly provided a lot of color on beti, and it seems that it's getting really good traction.
and i know it's very different than ddx. but can you kind of help frame how impactful beti is as it pertains to win rates? i know ddx had like a big impact on win rates. i'm just trying to get an understanding of the business model impact of beti.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean well, beti is a unique product that comes with a unique strategy, and that is about having employees being able to visualize what their checks are, what the check is going to be, what components impact their check to where they're able to visualize and participate in that throughout the pay period and then at pay period end, they're able to approve that, that check is correct. and what that does is it eliminates manuals, voids, adjustments, all the things that payroll departments and accounting departments traditionally have to do after the fact once they found out that, that check didn't exactly include everything that it should have for that employee. and so by moving the process up to the beginning of the pay period versus at the end of the pay period, it's going to change the way people do that payroll.
as far as the win rate, do i think it's going to impact our win rate? absolutely, once people really start using it. the ddx we came out with, it started impacting our retention not long after we came out with it. and manager on-the-go, i would say, is a similar product as that. and all of that got more and more people engaged, employees, again, engaged in our software and interacting with the database on their own.
and the more people that interact with the database on their own, the more accurate the data is, the more confirmation that you have that the data is accurate, and it produces less liability and exposure for the businesses that deploy it. so i see that continuing with us as we move forward, and i do think it's going to impact both our win rates and our retention positively as it becomes prevalent within our platform.

your last question is from the line of alex zukin with wolfe research.
unknown speaker -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hey there. this is allan on for alex. i know we only get client counts on a quarterly basis. but can you talk about the momentum you're seeing up market that is driving improvement in revenues per client? and i got one follow-up.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we've continued to have success. we really started rolling out an inside sales group. i would say we had five or so people for several years.
and then about two years ago, we started building out that group. as we've done that, we've obviously seen more deals below our target market. and we continue to see deals above our target market. even as we rolled through last year, i was even a little bit surprised that our average billings per client wasn't down a little bit when you looked at the growth that we had in client units.
but it was pretty much the same, which just shows the fact that, yes, we are continuing to add small business clients, but they're also being bookended with the large business that we continue to bring on as well.
operator
and that does conclude the q&a portion. i would like to turn the call over to chad richison for closing remarks.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
all right. i want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. i'd like to send a special thanks to all the employees at paycom for their commitment and patience throughout the pandemic. over two-thirds of our staff are either fully vaccinated or in the process.
as i've stated in the past, i do believe that getting vaccinated saves lives, maybe your own, but likely a loved one. and as from an investor outreach front, this quarter, we'll be presenting at the cowen technology conference on june 1 and at the baird global consumer technology & services conference on june 10. paycom will also be hosting one-on-one meetings in may and in june at the needham, jpmorgan and stifel conferences. we look forward to speaking with many of you very soon, and i appreciate your continued interest in paycom.
thank you, operator. you may disconnect.

chad. 
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, james. and thank you to everyone joining our call. today i'll spend a few minutes on the highlights of our second-quarter 2021 results and the opportunities we are pursuing as we look ahead. following that, craig will review our financials and our guidance and then we will take questions.
we delivered very strong second-quarter 2021 results with revenue $242 million. that grew 33.3% our fastest quarterly growth rate compared to the prior-year period since q4 of 2016, and well above the top end of our guidance range. the upside from the quarter was primarily a result of broad-based demand strength from new client ads and consistent cross selling to existing clients. our second-quarter adjusted ebitda was $87 million representing an increase of 42% over the prior-year period.
with these strong results, we are once again raising our full-year guidance which craig will discuss in more detail. the investments we make in our products generate tremendous value for our clients and driver differentiated employee strategy. our newest employee innovation is beti, the industry's first self-service payroll technology, allowing employees to do their own payroll which we officially rolled out to the market in early july. beti, which stands for better employee transaction interface, is an employee driven payroll experience and represents one of the most important advances we've made today.
with beti, employees do their own payroll which allows our clients to benefit from increased payroll accuracy, while employees gain full insight to their paycheck including advanced knowledge of take home pay and how it's calculated. employees have a direct connection to their paycheck to resolve errors well before payday, so they don't have to wait on or contact anyone for assistance. the additional clarity on how their pay changes and is calculated combined with automatic alerts when items require their action gives employees and clients confidence in the accuracy of their payroll. i'm very pleased with the launch so far.
we are receiving tremendous feedback including a vp of hr who said beti is the most revolutionary payroll product i've ever seen. another comment from the chief hr officer noted that beti is giving ownership of payroll to employees and managers which is great because they know better than anyone what their paycheck should be. as we said during our q1 earnings call, we're planning to have 100 pilot clients on beti in the second quarter and we easily achieved that goal. on july 6, we opened up beti to all clients.
and through the end of july, we've already sold beti to over 1000 new and existing clients. i continue to expect that all paycom clients will eventually deploy beti, it's the only way payroll should be done. our marketing plan continues to deliver strong demo leads and we intend to spend aggressively in the coming quarters to fuel future revenue growth and further expand our market share in a large and expanding hcm camp. our messaging continues to resonate with prospects as we contrast the shortcomings of disparate hcm systems, with the value proposition of paycom's single database solution and self-service capabilities that are stronger than ever.
employees expect their hr software to be efficient and easy to use. and once again, we had record high employee usage rates in q2, as measured by direct data exchange or ddx. we continue to enjoy increasing traction with both smaller and larger companies. as a reminder, we added multiple inside sales teams as we've continued to have success below our target range.
due to the technological advances, we've made and the demand that's building around our employee self service initiatives, we've continued to be pulled further upmarket as well. as a result, we are pleased to announce that we are expanding our proactive outside sales efforts from targeting firms with 50 to 5,000 employees to targeting firms with 50 to 10,000 employees. we've had success selling organizations above our historic range driven by larger company demand. this change we are announcing today empowers our sales representatives to proactively target in this expanded segment.
and we're excited by this incremental opportunity. we have clients in the segment already, so we're confident that our solution will compete and serve these clients effectively. on the paycom branding front, we recently signed a 15-year naming rights partnership with the oklahoma city thunder that will transfer their downtown home into the paycom center. oklahoma city is home to 1000s of our employees and i'm happy that the paycom center will be home of the thunder.
we have now lapped the tough pre pandemic year over year comparison and q2, it is more reflective of our historical growth profile, record new client additions over this past year driving our growth. while we saw a very small headcount improvement in our pre pandemic client revenue base, our guidance and future growth initiatives are not reliant on any employment improvement. in summary, q2 is a very strong quarter that reflects the strength of our execution throughout the pandemic and the investments we've made to further distance ourselves from the competition. innovation, customer service and new client growth represent the foundation of our long-term revenue growth strategy.
and with only approximately 5% market share of a growing tam, we continue to have a long runway ahead of us. i want to thank all of our hard working and dedicated employees for their resilience and commitment to winning. with that, i'll turn the call over to craig for review of our financials and guidance. craig?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
before i review our second-quarter 2021 results in our outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2021, i would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-gaap basis. we're very pleased with our second-quarter results with total revenues of $242.1 million representing growth of 33.3% over the comparable prior-year period driven primarily by broad-based strength with new client wins and consistent cross selling to existing clients. within total revenues, recurring revenue was $237.6 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 33.5% from the comparable prior-year period. total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $206.9 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 85.4%.
for 2021, we remain on target for adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 85% to 86%. adjusted total administrative expenses were $136 million for the second quarter, as compared to $106 million in the second quarter of 2020. adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2021 was $64.3 million or 26.6% of revenues. our marketing strategy continues to generate strong demo leads both within and outside our historical target market range of 50 to 5,000 employees.
we plan to continue to invest in marketing throughout the remainder of 2021. and as chad mentioned, we have increased our target market range to 50 to 10,000, thus empowering our outside sales representatives to proactively target larger companies. adjusted r&d expense was $26.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 10.8% of total revenues. adjusted total r&d cost including the capitalized portion were $38 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $27.7 million in the prior-year period.
we continue to be very pleased with the high-quality innovation we're seeing from our investments in r&d and we'll continue to aggressively recruit talent in r&d to drive our future growth. adjusted ebitda was $87 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 35.9% of total revenues, compared to $61.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 or 33.7% of total revenues. our gaap net income for the second quarter was $52.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share, versus $28.6 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the prior-year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. non-gaap net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $56.5 million or $0.97 cents per diluted share, versus $35.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the prior-year period.
we expect non cash stock based compensation for the third quarter of 2021 to be approximately $25 million to $26 million. for the full year we anticipate non cash stock-based compensation will be approximately $95 million to $100 million. for 2021, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be 24% to 25% on a gaap basis. on a non-gaap basis, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be 26% to 27%.
turning to the balance sheet. we ended the second quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $202.4 million and total debt of $30 million related to construction at our corporate headquarters. cash from operations was $57 million for the second quarter reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. the average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2021.
during the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately 94,000 shares for a total of roughly $32 million. for june 30, 2021 paycom has repurchased over 4.2 million shares since 2016, for a total of approximately $455 million, while we currently have roughly $300 million remaining in our buyback program. shifting to guidance. we are pleased to provide strong third-quarter guidance that reflects the robust performance we achieved in the first half of 2021.
and we are raising our full-year 2021 outlook as a result. our q3 and full-year guidance are as follows. for the third quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $249 million to $251 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of approximately 27% at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda for the third quarter in the range of $87 million to $89 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 35.2% at the midpoint of the range.
for fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1.036 billion to $1.038 billion up from $1.017 billion to $1.019 billion or approximately 23.2% year over year growth at the midpoint of the range. we expect full-year adjusted ebitda in the range of $410 million to $412 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 39.6% at the midpoint of the range. when combined, we now expect revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin to easily exceed the rule of 60 this year. to conclude, we are very pleased with the performance in the quarter which gives us increasing confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year.
with the launch of beti and expanded target market and a deep product development pipeline, we have a long runway ahead of us to continue to deliver rapid growth for years to come. with that, we will open the line for questions. operator?

[operator instructions] your first question comes from line of raimo lenschow with barclays. please go ahead.
raimo lenschow -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
hey. first of all, congratulations. that was an amazing quarter end amazing return to high growth. chad, quick question on the decision to go toward like the 50 to 10,000 employee clients now.
historically, you were always a little bit hesitant because sales cycles seem to get more complex like longer, etc. how do you manage that process? and can you still do it with the same sales force? and then i had one follow up.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure, raimo and so if you remember, it was about three years ago, our range at that time was 50 to 2000 employees. we continue to be pulled up. and so, at that point in time, we made it official allowing our employees to target proactively target companies of that range, because again, we've been pulled more up market. same things happened here up to 10,000.
we continue to be pulled further up market, i would say that the buying criteria for companies of that size has changed. we're all working with the same type of employee, there's no such thing as a large market employee and a small market employee. you can work for a 300 employee one company and work for a 10,000 employee company the next. and so, we're providing a very easy to use standard way for employees to interact with their data.
and we're finding it easier to work with larger businesses as they look to displace multiple disparate systems with one.
raimo lenschow -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
yeah, ok. perfect. make sense. and then on beti, like, if you think about the 1000, the greater than 1000 clients already signed up, like what has been the feedback so far from those clients? were there some surprises, maybe that you've seen there and that you can utilize for the rest of the client base? thank you.
and congrats again.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
you bet. and so, employees, like i've been saying employees pretty much fly blind into every payroll. they do the work, they clock in, clock out, put in their expenses, manage benefits, manage time off, and everything else, and then they get blindfolded before payday. and then they get to find out on pay day what it meant.
i mean, it's similar to blinding the pilots right before they land. you know. and so, what we've done is taken that blindfold off to where employees understand how their checks are calculated, and they can help the payroll department have perfect payrolls, because there's not a payroll person out there, that doesn't have anxiety going into each payroll day, because they want it to be perfect. and so, what beti does is help everybody get to the right level of accuracy.
and it also eliminates a lot of the after fact, manual checks, voids and adjustments that oftentimes clients have to do after an employee's check is incorrect. and we know how important it is for employees' checks to be perfect. they expect it. so, we're having a lot of success with it.
and now would expect us to continue that.
raimo lenschow -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from a line of samad samana with jeffries. please go ahead.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good evening, and congrats on that 30% plus growth. it was great to see that come back. so chad, maybe first question for you just want to think about, it does a cross selling was much more mentioned more often on this call and i think historically, tend to say customers adopt a bit upfront.
so, can you help us understand why cross selling is becoming a bigger motion? and is that primarily beti or is it across the portfolio?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i couldn't say that our cross selling today as a percentage is more of our revenue than what it's been in the past. i would say on a percentage basis, still cross selling for the biggest percent of our revenue is during that year of the aca, where again, everybody had to take it. i do believe that we're going to be having three or four quarters here some pretty good cross selling, as we move everybody over to the better employee transaction interface which is beti. also, as we're selling new onboarding new clients now, beti is a part of that.
and so, our sales reps-beti comes with the payroll package now. it is an additional fee for that. but it is included on every quote moving forward for new businesses as we believe this is the way businesses win and achieve their return on investment with our product as it relates to the payroll side of what we do.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great, really helpful and maybe as a follow up to that, this was one of the biggest beats take i'm supposed to carve out the expectation. so, i'm curious if you could maybe help us maybe unpack how much how you think about it in terms of better new bookings versus this uplifted beti versus employment recovery in the install base, as we think about maybe the strength and the quarter?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well in regards to beat in beti, beti had very little bit zero impact on second quarter. i talked about on our may call that we would be looking to put 100 clients on it that quarter. we achieved that, i think within the first couple of weeks, and then we held we went through that.
and then on july 6, we actually released it to all other clients. so that was within this quarter. so beti would have played zero impact as it relates to last quarter. we do think it's going to be a part of our differentiated strategy moving forward.
so new logo ads, as usual, is what contributes to our growth, followed by upsells to current clients. as far as macro, we've been going through this now for a little bit. i've been talking a little bit about us having some improvement with the pre pandemic client base, as far as this quarter. i'd say we saw an improvement in hiring during this past quarter, and the impact that it had on our revenue for this quarter, from our pre pandemic client base was $1 million to $1.5 million for the quarter.
so that's about $100,000 worth of weekly improvement on that number that we had talked about prior.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. appreciate the questions, and congrats again on the strong results. great to say.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from line at brad reback with stifel. please go ahead.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. chad, as your sales people have the opportunity to move further up market, do you think that changes the sale cycle length? and if it does lengthen, how do you manage that?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no, i don't. i mean, a little bit, it's hard for me to say that, you know, a 5000, employee company sales cycle is going to be the same as a 150-employee company sale cycle. i will say the 5,000 employee's sale cycle is the same as a 10,000-employee sale cycle. so, i don't know that there's some major differences between the two of those as far as what their sales cycles would be.
we're still not looking to engage with long sales cycle that requires us to link up with multiple disparate systems. so, somebody has to be a fit for us to go into that something else. i would say as we continue to have strength the down market, we continue to aggressively achieve our lead volumes, and they continue to go up. and oftentimes those leads are also small business.
and so, first of this year, we had four sales teams, and that was up from one the previous year. throughout this year, we've added another six inside sales teams. and so, now we're 10 inside sales teams which sell the emerging business or that would be the below 50 market. so, we continue to do extremely well, below 50.
and we continue to be pulled up market because again, it's the same employee interface, whether you work for a 150 employee company or whether you work for a 10,000-employee company. those employees expect ease of use and easy access to their system. and so, we're seeing a lot of momentum being created based on employee usage, needs and how much it makes it easier for them.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. and then one quick follow up on beti, can you help us on the monetization of, sorry if i missed it. what type of lift you get from an existing customer that's adding beti and been on net new what type of work?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so we've added products in the past where we got 100% usage very quickly, and i'm thinking of ddx and manager on the go. and those were products that we just included in our pricing with beti, it is an additional priced product, even though it's now included on every single payroll deal. we believe our pricing is competitive.
so, i don't like to just put it out there. you may be able to find it out there. but all i would say is, it's reasonably priced like many of our other modules.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks very much.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

the next question comes from the line of mark marcon with baird. please go ahead.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
hey. good afternoon and let me add my congratulations. with regards to the rapid ramp in terms of the clients that are using beti, with the 100 that that first came on, can you talk a little bit about like, what sort of experiences they were seeing? did it really ease or increase the accuracy that they ended up experiencing or are you getting any feedback from clients about a, our payroll department doesn't need as many people? and how easy was it to lift, you opened it up on july 6, and now you've got over 1000 on beti, how easy was it to convert them to beti?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and so well with beti, we're already on it. it's something that we turn on for you. but what we have to work with you to convert your processes, we've got a lot of these processes that happened after the factor.
we need to have those happen at the beginning or during the payroll transaction. and once you do that, a lot of the processes you'd normally do after the factor are irrelevant. we're able to displace those. and so, we eliminate a lot of processes.
and then with some of the processes we move them into earlier in the processing phase. and so, but an answer to your question, we hadn't had anybody turn it off. once you turn it on, and that's what your employees are doing, you have a very high satisfaction rate with employees, and we have a very strong roi. beti itself 100% pays for itself.
and it actually helps even pay for the payroll the entire payroll module, because there's an incredible amount of roi, when you're not having to do manual checks, voids, adjustments, and wire money into employee's accounts to cover in sfbs, they may have because their payroll was wrong. and so it also gives employees visibility into what their check is going to be. a lot of people live check the check, i mean, over 80% 85% of the u.s. employee let's check the check.
and they need to know exactly what the pay is going to be. and if it's $30 off, that's a big difference for them. and so, beti gives them visibility long before check date, and gives them the ability to interact with their check to make sure it's accurate which again, increases roi for the business. it also lowers the business's exposure and certain risks associated with paying people.
there's some pretty specific laws on making sure you pay your employees correctly, and that you pay them on time. and with beti, that's easily achieved.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
that's great. and does all of those clients have time and attendance already set up or did some of them have to add that?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
you know, that's a great question raimo. i would expect that most of our first...
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
it's mark.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sorry, mark. sorry, mark. mark, i would expect that most of our clients already had time and attendance, because we'd like to go through there and get the ones using quickly that are already ready. now, i would say most of our clients at paycom already have time and attendance.
but you are right, there will be certain modules that as we go to move beti would be required for a client to implement.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
great. and then one last one, just on the increasing the target range from upper limit of 5,000 to 10,000 would be when you first expanded from 2000 to 5000, how many of those 5,000 and employee companies were kind of like inbound and kind of approaching you guys? obviously, you've got a great marketing campaign that's been very successful. imagine that's drawn a number of inquiries. but can you talk about, like how much of that is being pulled in as opposed to being pushed?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, we do not have a marketing strategy for companies above 5000. we do targeted prospecting. and our targeted prospecting strategies had been three years ago, they were companies below 2000. and then we move that to below 5,000 which we've experienced for the last three years.
and now we're moving into 10,000. and what that means is we'll start proactively targeting these. we have continued to have people call us of employee sizes in that range. and again, the more that we've had, we've continued to move up our market.
and so, what it allows us to do now is do targeted prospecting toward those. and as salespeople make calls, you know, they're able to proactively make those calls. now, sales reps have always been able to make a proactive call. sales rep can go out there right now, until a 50,000-employee company, i don't care.
but as far as what were our targeted prospecting efforts are toward those companies now that have between 50 and 10,000 employees, and then in our more small business or emerging type companies, it would be for those that are also below 50.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
great, congratulations.

hey, great afternoon. thanks for taking my question. it seems like every day there's a new story about how tight labor market is. so, i'm just wondering if you could talk about sort of how the tight labor market may be or may not be impacting inbound demand that you're seeing.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
inbound interest that we're seeing?
daniel jester -- citi -- analyst
yeah, that's right.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
ok. ok, got it. your last part there cut off? well, i mean, definitely, i think it plays a role. we've done a lot of surveys that employees like easy-to-use technology at work, i've said an employee shouldn't have to work to work.
and so, you definitely have a frustrated employee base, if you have multiple pieces of technology that are difficult to use. also, it's a hunt for talent out there. you want to retain your good employees, that's a must. good technology helps you do that.
you also need to deploy pretty good technology on the talent acquisition side, because everybody's in a dogfight for talent. right now, it's a very tight labor market. so, i do believe that there's some of that in there. but everything shifted to this digital transformation and the right way to do something, and it only makes sense that employees would be the ones engaging with their data.
and so, we're having success with that. but no, i think the labor market might be tight for a while here, we'll kind of see what happens after that. as far as our business, because of our new business ad, we've really what we've needed stability. and we've had that since the summer of last year, we just we needed some stability within the labor market.
and so, i don't think, even if there's different situations with the pandemic, as we go through the remainder of this year, i still believe we're dealing with somewhat of a tight labor market. so i don't feel like the macro on a go forward is going to impact us like it had, provided that we have some stability here. and it looks like we will from an employment perspective.
daniel jester -- citi -- analyst
that's great. and then just as a follow up, you've been selling virtually for, like 18 months. now you talk about adding inside sales team. i'm just wondering if you can kind of reflect on once you actually do get back to the normal environment, does this change your philosophy about adding new sales offices?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no, no i mean, its timing, we're just now our managers are getting back into the office. and throughout the rest of this year, people are going to be filtering back into our offices as we go back to the office to do our selling. as far as what type of model and hybrid model we're going to be using, we've been paying attention to why prospects buying, we've also been paying attention to how prospects buy. so we're going to be supporting the methods that best help both the prospect as well as us be able to, in our case, display what our product does, and in their case, have a clear understanding of what the roi is for them.
daniel jester -- citi -- analyst
great, thank you very much.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from line of brian schwartz with oppenheimer. please go ahead.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
yeah. hi, thanks for taking my questions. and congratulations on a great quarter. chad, maybe if i could just start there on the quarter.
can you shed any light on just how the bookings or the business activity trended in the quarter? just have a linearity was, we'll start from there.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, we've had really strong bookings since april of last year, things kind of took off, and we were doing well, anyway. but i mean, we've had very strong bookings, in fact, these last two weeks that we just had here in july, these last two weeks that's the largest number we've put up ever in bookings. and so, bookings have been strong as we've continued to push a differentiated strategy that's getting a lot of momentum here in the marketplace.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thank you. and then chad, one question i had just on the target expansion move here. i'm just wondering if there's any industry verticals that would have, i would think about fewer organizational complexities to them, and therefore would just be right for beti and more likely to switch to self-service when you target.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i really look at it as it's a product for everybody, from the employees' perspective, i would even say that the more complex it is, the more you need to deploy beti. the more data points you have on a check, the more important it is to deploy something like beti. so, i'm not going to say that any specific vertical or either easy or complex type of company that beti would be best for.
i think it's best for everybody. and it's 100% best for the american worker to have a product like this to where they can engage themselves with their data, and something that's going to significantly impact their ability to work their financial plan.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
and then last question for craig, just on the marketing and advertising campaigns. given the bookings momentum year in the business, the commentary, i wonder if you have any plans to increase your advertising spend here in the second half of the year, in support of the beti product cycle and in the current momentum in the business? thanks.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
we're going to continue to spend aggressively on sales and marketing. you've seen that in the past, the back half of the year where we've kind of ramped up sales and marketing. so, i would expect to kind of see the same for us through the rest of the year. obviously, in marketing plans we've currently baked into our third quarter and full-year guidance.
thank you.

your next question is from the line of ryan mcdonald with needham. please go ahead.
michael rackers -- needham & company -- analyst
this is michael rackers. i'm on for ryan mcdonald. thanks for taking my question. so, we've heard from multiple vendors that churn ticked up slightly on the quarter, as some of the customers that may have wanted to make a change last year couldn't do so because of the other pandemic driven priorities.
did you experience any similar uptick in churn within your customer base? and did you see any more opportunities to replace competitors during the quarter given this dynamic?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, what i would first say is it's a bad idea to use our competitors when in relation to churn as a proxy to us, but we do not report either gains or no gains as it relates to retention until the end of each year. what i would say though, is that we're having a lot of success, deploying differentiated product, both to new customers, as well as to current customers and those clients that are buying product are staying. and so, we're having a lot of success. it's a differentiated strategy.
and as we continue to have increased ddx usage, where more and more employees are the ones making the impressions on the database and not an intermediary through another department within the company, we would have an expectation that we would continue to have a strong retention rate with our clients.
michael rackers -- needham & company -- analyst
right, thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from the line of siti panigrahi with mizuho. please go ahead.
matt diamond -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hey, guys, this is matt diamond on the line for siti. i want to add my congrats for the solid results. one question that's come up. and i think we've alluded to it a little bit, is around beti.
it was mentioned that there are going to be three to four quarters of continued pretty above normal cross selling. we also know that beti necessitates all of the paycom modules in order to for clients to be eligible for beti. can you help us handicap really what size of the existing client base has all of those modules cna sounds like it's pretty widespread, so that we can get an idea of what the magnitude of that cross-sell opportunity looks like over the next three to four quarters?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. and so, i do want to say one thing, beti does not require you to have all of our modules. there's a lot of modules you don't need to utilize beti. now, it would make sense that someone would take the modules, but things like talent acquisition, as far as you know, recruiting cobra, a lot of our modules, you don't necessarily have to have to run beti.
but it's a good idea that you implement it within your business so that your employees can use one system. but there are modules that would be required to use beti like paid time, off time, and attendance, expense management, benefits administration, there are some of them, definitely that you're going to want to use them because without them, you wouldn't be able to use beti. a lot of those are fairly popular products to us. but we have several clients that don't have them.
and so, i would like to thank our sales reps who are probably out there right now, our crrs who're probably working with a lot of those clients that are already ready to go where we just go and click a button, eliminate most of your processes and shift a few to the beginning. but i'm sure that we will have our internal sales group our client relations group continuing to reach out to clients of all characteristics, whether they have all of the products currently required or just partial. so there is an opportunity there for us. as far as handicapping it again, we consider our pricing competitive in nature.
but there are opportunities sports out there. i do want to say this though our revenue gains are going to be primarily driven by new business wins just because of what in the end and i'm saying new logo wins exist because of the size of a new logo compared to the potential upsell of that same logo.
matt diamond -- mizuho securities -- analyst
that's a perfect segue to my next question, is there anything that's being done differently or that's been adjusted on the product side to address these 10k customers and above employees, the 10k employees and above. it doesn't seem to be the case. but anything that can be commented on in regards to the r&d spend, and what's being prioritized for that customer base would be helpful?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no. there's no debt. we're not doing anything different for a 10,000 employee company that we're doing for a 2,300 employee company.
matt diamond -- mizuho securities -- analyst
excellent. thanks so much, guys.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from the line of bryan bergin with cowen. please go ahead.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thank you. a question here on beti. can you comment on what level of client adoption you're anticipating by the end of 2021? and the clarification on the new sales.
i understand it's being included in each deal you bid. but are you sitting near 100% attach on it as well here the last several weeks?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well again yeah, we just like you said, i mean, we started selling it july 6, then, as it relates to new clients, a lot of them would be in conversion. it would be rare that we'd sell a client on july 6, then they would have started by now unless they're smaller business and on the smaller business side, then you definitely could have had some of that. yes, i mean, because it's the way we're training and setting them up. we're not training on the old model now.
i mean, we're going through conversion and training, we're training on how employees do their own payroll. we're not training you and you put your employees' data into our system. and so, yeah, it's part of the conversion. and so, it would be a logical for me to think that anybody even tried to do it the old way.
and also, it's included in the roi. i mean, now our roi cases include beti. and it's an important part of the roi. i mean, you can use beti and actually it'll pay, it can help pay for the entire system, depending upon how many true issues you've been having in payroll.
payroll is, it's a high risk, low reward activity. if you get it right, who cares employees expected. and if you get it wrong, you upset employees. they have nsf fees, and then you get to pay tax penalties.
and so, having perfect payroll is extremely important, and it just wouldn't make any sense to me that any client would buy our product without beti. and it wouldn't make any sense that they would, since they bought it, it wouldn't make any sense that they wouldn't use it, because their employees want to use it.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok, and then just another thought, a common question we're getting around beti, and the potential offsets of existing service revenue, can you help kind of frame the magnitude of that work within your business to begin with as far as error correction and things like that? and then clarify your view on the revenue accretion of beti versus those types of services that might automate away?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
you know, i mean, there's definitely going to be beti's going to replace some what i'm going to call bad revenue for the client. the client didn't have visibility. the employee didn't have visibility, so they have to void a check, and they have to do a manual, than they have to send a wire. and then, to the extent there's a tax event created, because it extends a different quarter a different tax period, you've got to deal with that.
and so, there are definitely some fees associated with that. that can be labor work on both our side and the client side which can carry maybe a higher or a lower, i should say, operating margin as it read in regards to that but-or a higher expense to both us and the client. from a beti perspective, there's not we're doing to it on our end, and there's not anything the clients having to do. and what i tell clients is, hey, our competitors got themselves out of doing your payroll, we get you out of doing your payroll.
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of alex zukin with wolf research. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
hey, this is alan on for alex zukin. i just wanted to drill in on the new business going forward obviously  sounds like you guys are seeing a lot of strength there. i was wondering if you can help kind of put the context what you're seeing at the lower end of your customer employee range and the top end and kind of how you're thinking about that for the second half. thanks.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, i would say more of this same. we don't really get to dictate what size companies coming in from our lead volume. as we use our advertising assets, you could have a three employee company clicking on it that has a pet store, and you could have a 10,000 employee company clicking on it. and, we're going to be going after those of all sizes and have been and so, i wouldn't see how we would expect it to be dramatically different than what we're seeing right now.
again, our move up market, we're already there, we just announced that. i mean, we're already there. we're getting the leads; we're already selling the deals. we've got deals larger than 10,000 that are already using our company.
so, we're just making it more official, and kind of flying the flag out there right now that we're open for business and we're going to be targeted prospecting those clients up to 10,000 as well.

over 70% of our staff are either fully vaccinated are in the process. i like to reiterate that i believe getting vaccinated that saves lives for every 100,000 fully vaccinated people that made it less than one will lose their life from the break through covid-19 case. please get your vaccinations and let's end this pandemic. on the investor outreach side, this quarter we'll be presenting at the oppenheimer conference on august 10, followed by the wolfe conference on september 8, and the citi conference on september 14.

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the paycom software third quarter 2021 quarterly results conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to mr.
james samford, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
james samford -- head of investor relations
thank you and welcome to paycom's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. certain statements made on this call that are not historical facts, including those related to our future plans, objectives, and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. while we believe any forward-looking statements made on this call are reasonable, actual results may differ materially because the statements are based on our current expectations and subject to risks and uncertainties.
these risks of uncertainties are discussed in our filings with the sec, including our most recent annual report on form 10-k and our most recent quarterly report on form 10-q. you should refer to and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking information. any forward-looking statement made speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. also, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures, including adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and certain adjusted expenses.
we use these non-gaap financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. the reconciliation schedule showing gaap versus non-gaap results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. i'll now turn the call over to chad richison, paycom's president and chief executive officer. chad. 
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, james, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. i will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our third quarter 2021 results and our progress on key initiatives. following that, craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. we delivered very strong third quarter 2021 results with revenue of $256 million, representing robust year-over-year revenue growth of 30.4 percent, which was above the top end of our guidance range.
we continue to see strong demand for our products across our target market and we are having great success attracting new clients. we have reinvested and will continue to reinvest revenue outside into the business while still delivering attractive adjusted ebitda margins. with these strong results, we are once again raising our full-year guidance, which craig will discuss in more detail. our innovative solutions continue to gain popularity and we are being recognized by industry organizations for their impact on the human capital management industry.
in september, paycom was once again awarded the 2021 top hr product honor at the hr technology conference for our newest innovation, beti. this marks the third consecutive year for paycom to receive such honors, which included the direct data exchange in 2019, manager on-the-go in 2020, and now, beti in 2021. it is precisely the combination of these three industry-first, coupled with our comprehensive single database that is transforming the human capital management industry and turning employee usage in easy-to-use solutions in the key buying criteria for clients. beti is a self-service payroll technology that allows employees to do their own payroll and we are having great success in the market.
as a reminder, with beti, employees submit their own time work and make their own benefits selections, schedule deductions, manage tax statuses, remit expenses, request time off, and do all the things that an employee does to calculate a check. beti does the rest and works with the employee to ensure a perfect payroll for them prior to the payroll. employees doing their own payroll is the only way payroll should be done. i am very pleased with the market response to beti and i continue to expect all clients to eventually deploy beti.
our advertising and marketing efforts continue to deliver strong demo leads that are fueling our revenue growth. and we will intend to continue to spend aggressively in the coming quarters to further expand our market share in the large and expanding hcm tam. our advertising strategy is working and we are deliberately reinvesting revenue upside into advertising, marketing, and product innovation. you've heard me say consistently that we are willing to trade a point of margin for a point of growth, but we are unwilling to trade a point of margin for a point of nothing.
and that philosophy has served us well over the years and you can see it in our results. on the sales front, we are seeing success with both smaller and larger companies. i'm particularly pleased with the traction we are having in our recently expanded target market range of companies with up to 10,000 employees, where our messaging around ease-of-use in the employee self-service is resonating. finally, it's great to see all the paycom faces back in the office even if behind masks.
we have successfully transitioned nearly all employees back to our offices around the country and it is great to see we are getting our office culture back. while we accomplished extraordinary things working remotely, i believe we're even better together. many of our new hires are experiencing for the first time the daily buzz and enthusiasm that makes paycom a unique place to work. while our sales teams are still selling virtually, we are already seeing the benefits of everyone being safely back in the office sharing best practices, and collaborating more closely.
in summary, q3 was a very strong quarter, driven by record new client revenue. the investments we've made throughout 2020 and to date in 2021 have made paycom more differentiated than ever and we are seeing the benefits across the sale, service, and product organizations. as a reminder, we have approximately five percent market share of a growing tam and a long runway ahead of us. i want to thank all of our hardworking and dedicated employees for their grit and commitment to success.
with that, i'll turn the call over to craig for a review of our financials and guidance. craig.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
before i review our third quarter 2021 results and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021, i would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-gaap basis. we are very pleased with our third quarter results with total revenues of $256.2 million, representing growth of 30.4 percent over the comparable prior-year period, driven primarily by strong new client revenue growth. within total revenues, recurring revenue was $251.3 million for the third quarter of 2021, representing 98 percent of total revenues for the quarter and growing 30.4 percent from the comparable prior-year period. total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $214.8 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 83.8 percent.
third quarter margins were impacted by both our return to office and our aggressive hiring of the individuals needed to service our current and future growth. for 2021, we expect to deliver a very strong adjusted gross margin of approximately 85 percent. adjusted total administrative expenses were $142.5 million for the third quarter, as compared to $113.3 million in the third quarter of 2020. adjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $66.3 million or 25.9 percent of revenues.
our marketing strategy continues to generate strong demo leads and we plan to continue to invest in advertising, given the strong return on our investment we're seeing. as chad suggested, growth remains a top priority and advertising is a productive lever that we have continued to deploy to drive revenue growth. adjusted r and d expense was $29.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 or 11.4 percent of total revenues. adjusted total r and d costs, including the capitalized portion, were $40.7 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to $29.8 million in the prior-year period.
even in this tight labor market, we're having good success attracting and retaining talent. adjusted ebitda was $89.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 or 35 percent of total revenues, compared to $67.5 million in the third quarter of 2020 or 34.3 percent of total revenues. our gaap net income for the third quarter was $30.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share, versus $27.5 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the prior-year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. non-gaap net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $53.6 million or $0.92 per diluted share, versus $40.6 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the prior-year period.
we expect non-cash stock-based compensation for the fourth quarter of 2021 to be approximately $22 million to $24 million. for the full year, we anticipate non-cash stock-based compensation will be approximately $98 million to $100 million. for 2021, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be 23 percent to 25 percent on a gaap basis. on a non-gaap basis, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be 25 percent to 27 percent.
turning to the balance sheet. we ended the third quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $230.9 million and total debt of $29.6 million. cash from operations was $83.2 million for the third quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. the average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2021.
during the third quarter of 2021, we've repurchased approximately 61,000 shares for a total of roughly $29 million. through september 30th of 2021, paycom has repurchased nearly 4.3 million shares since 2016 for a total of approximately $484 million, and we currently have roughly $271 million remaining in our buyback program. shifting to guidance. we are pleased to provide strong fourth quarter guidance that reflects the robust performance year to date and we are raising our full-year 2021 outlook as a result.
our q4 and full-year guidance are as follows. for the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $274.5 million to $276.5 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of approximately 25 percent at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter in the range of $103 million to $105 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 37.7 percent at the midpoint of the range. for fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1,045,000,000 to $1,047,000,000, up from $1,036,000,000 to $1,038,000,000 or approximately 24 percent year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range.
we expect full-year adjusted ebitda in the range of $413 million to $415 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 39.6 percent at the midpoint of the range. to conclude, we are very pleased with the performance in the quarter and how the full year has been shaping up. product differentiation, outstanding customer service, and our use of effective advertising, and sales levers are all contributing to our strong results and we have a long runway ahead of us to continue to deliver rapid growth for years to come. with that, we will open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of raimo lenschow of barclays. your line is open.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
hey, thank you and congrats again for another quarter as the fastest-growing hr company that i cover. the -- i have two quick questions. first, chad, can you talk a little bit about -- you talked about the customer -- new customer momentum? can you talk a little bit about the lending kind of site and, you know, the module uptake that you see from this new customer? is there any change in terms of like what people are buying, you know, how beti, etc., impacting how big your lending for them? and then i have one follow-up question.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, definitely. well, beti, for instance, beti is included on all accounts since july that we've sold. and so, that doesn't mean that we've converted all of them that we've sold since july but beti is included in that, meaning that it's sold as part of the package that we sell with that. included in that, there are products that are -- to be honest with you are somewhat our most popular products anyway, but i do believe beti is making an impact on our ability to sell more products at the point -- at the initial point of sale.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
yeah. ok, perfect. and then do you -- if you think back to the pandemic, the -- you kind of did really well in new customers but your existing customers had a lower employee count, which obviously then hurts. since now, in september, like a lot of the benefits kind of fell away.
like what are you seeing in terms of rehiring at the existing customer level? and that -- could that another driver for you as we think about like, you know, next year as well in terms of the revenue trajectory? thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'm going to take this as you're talking about the clients that we had at the time of the pandemic and then the negative impact on them, which we've quantified in the past of that $1.8 million to $2 million. we've talked about a couple of different quarters of seeing improvement in that, specifically this last quarter of -- second quarter, we did talk about we did see a little bit of improvement to the extent we did it was around $100,000 a week. that trend has continued into the third quarter, where i would say it was very similar to what it was in the second quarter as to that improvement of about $1 million to $1.5 million positive impact on the quarter from our prepandemic client base becoming a little bit more healthy. 
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
perfect. well done. congratulations again.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thank you.

next question comes from the line of samad samana of jefferies. your line is open.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good evening. thanks for taking my questions. congrats on a -- on the strong sustained growth for me as well. maybe first, chad, you know, it really seemed like the -- you guys laid down a clear flag that you're investing for growth and willing to invest aggressively.
i'm just -- i'm curious as you think about the investments you've made today. is there any change in the mix between those as you think about maybe, you know, you mentioned the reopening? will there be a mix shift in dollars going to either advertising versus back into sales headcount versus other modalities like user conferences? just how should we think about that investment framework mixing in terms of dollars the -- as the world reopens?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, we'll definitely -- we're definitely focused on the marketing and advertising and i'm sure you guys have seen our assets out there working. we continue to drive that. you know, we've also returned to the office, each of our offices, as well as here in oklahoma city.
i was actually, a week and a half ago, with all of our sales leaders in aspen as we've done really our first big meeting with one another since the pandemic. something else that we're doing, we're having a lot of success hiring. you know, we have to hire service individuals and train them up ahead of the revenue that we are bringing in. and so, we've had a lot of success hiring service individuals, you know, with the anticipation that our growth continues as it has and we will need them to service these accounts.
and so, those are the large areas. obviously, marketing is more of a lever-type area and, you know, we spend that deliberately throughout the quarter to make sure that we're not leaving, you know, powder in the keg, that we could turn into sale -- future sales.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yeah. and samad, i would also echo that. i mean, you know, we're also having success on the r and d side. i mean, we're able to hire and bring those individuals in as well.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then maybe just a question on booking linearity in the quarter. maybe just help us understand the overall strength of bookings in the third quarter and then how it trended throughout the quarter just given, you know, we've heard kind of varying use in software more broadly around trends evolving over the course of the quarter.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, our bookings in the quarter remained strong throughout third quarter. in fact, the october we just finished was our largest booking month ever. i know i say that quite often but, you know, we would expect to have strong quarters in subsequent quarters in months for bookings.
but, you know, bookings remain strong now, deals are booked, and then they turn into revenue over time whether that's 13 weeks or 17 weeks is our focus for those. but yeah, we had a lot of strong bookings come in in third quarter. and as i've mentioned, october was our largest booking month we've ever had at our company.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks, again, for taking my questions.

next question comes from the line of brad reback of stifel. your line is open.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. chad, as you sort of look back over the last 18 months and the efficiencies that you've been able to achieve across the organization, where would be one or two places where you've generated the most? and where do you think it's most sustainable going forward?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, that's a good question. i think that we've gained a lot of efficiencies through our the owned -- our owned technology that we've developed to use internally. some of that is based on internal communication, which had to strengthen in order to survive the work from home and the impacts of the virtual environment as we've moved to it. i believe we're still gaining efficiencies through the sales model as predominantly, most -- all of our sales are still done virtually, which does allow for better training on our side and allows our managers, specifically, to be able to set on more calls.
i'm sure there's others that i would call out that -- those two for sure.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks very much.

next question comes from the line of mark marcon of baird. your line is open.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, chad and craig. really strong sequential growth in this quarter. and obviously, called out the bookings. i was wondering, could you help put a little bit more color behind, you know, where you're seeing the booking strength? is it newer markets for you relative to older markets? smaller clients versus larger clients? and then, obviously, the marketing is having a positive impact but wondering if you're seeing any patterns that are discernable.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
not really. i would say it's more of the same for us. there's just more of it. now, i would remind everyone that we did increase our inside sales group in the past.
i talked about that, how we've grown that over the years. we now have 10 teams there that we have. of course, they're bringing in smaller deals with a little bit lower revenue associated with it. but i wouldn't be -- really be able to call out that the mix is different than what we've had in the past.
it's the same type of mix. we continue to go more market like we always have. and so -- but the mix is very similar.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
great. and can you give a little bit more color with regards to the impact to beti? and then lastly, just a little bit more color with regards to the impact of bringing people into the office in terms of the gross margin for this quarter and how we should think about gross margins going forward.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say the gross margin, i mean, it definitely was impacted some by the return to work. you definitely have some of that, but i would also say that we've had a lot of success hiring our service individuals as we get ready to get trained up, you know, for the revenue that we're bringing in. and so, there's been quite a bit of it there as well.
from a beti perspective, we started selling it to the group, to the masses in july. and since july -- i think in july, i said that we had sold a thousand somewhere in conversion, some of it already started. as of today, we've sold nearly 4,000. again, some have already started and some are in conversion.
so, that product continues to be successful for us as it changes the way that employees do their payroll and really puts the control into their hands.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
that's great. thank you.

next question comes from the line of ryan macdonald of needham. your line is open.
unknown speaker
hi, everyone. this is michael rackers on for ryan. thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. in sort of attack in some other industry work you've done this year, we've heard about a lot of new customer interest and vendor functionality and things like daily pay and talent intelligence, which seems pretty more targeted to the customer segment that you are starting to target more moving upmarket.
how do you think about product expansion in the larger customer segment that may or may not have some different module requirements?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, we're in the larger, you know, for us, the larger clients are the 10,000-employee companies. i believe our largest client is around 20,000-ish employees. and so, we believe we provide a very strong product for that. i've kind of said in the past that there may be such thing as a -- as an enterprise-level business, but i do not believe there's such thing as an enterprise-level employee.
you're an employee, you can be working with a 300-company today and a company that might have 50,000 employees tomorrow. but you're the same person and you expect the same type of functionality. and that's really what we are providing is the appropriate tools for the employee base. i mean, you can hand me a shovel and ask me to dig a four-mile trench and i may or may not be able to do it but that's not the correct tool to do that.
and so, one thing we've been able to do is bring the correct tools to the employee base regardless of size. and a lot of the things you'll find is that the things that an employee has to do are pretty much the same, whether that employee is working at a company that has, you know, 300 employees or 5000 employees. all rules apply. as you get into the larger companies, you do sometimes have to deal more with international-type attack situations and others.
but for the most part, we feel really good about the value that our products are able to deliver to those large-market employees as well.

great. thank you so much.

next question comes from the line of siti panigrahi of mizuho. your line is open.
matt diamond -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hey, guys. this is actually matt diamond on behalf of siti. congrats again on the results here. one thing i'm trying to figure out is the potential for sales office reopening.
chad, it sounds like everybody's enthusiastic to be back in the office. but it's undeniable the benefits that came from virtual selling over the last 18 months. how should we think about sales office openings in 2022?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. we actually did -- i didn't call it out in prepared remarks, but we actually did open up an office in this past quarter. we opened up a second manhattan office there in new york city. as far as from sales, i think it's important to state that we are back in the office but we are selling virtually from our office.
and so, the change there is we were selling virtually from our homes. now, we're back in the office selling virtually from the office. and so, we have the collaboration and it make -- just makes more sense for us to be there.
matt diamond -- mizuho securities -- analyst
helpful. and with beti, it sounds like there's a lot of positive momentum happening in that module. could you help us understand what percentage of the -- in -- paycom's client base today is prepared to upgrade to beti or be sold beti. i know that there are some requirements that go into that module.
but any color there would be helpful.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, prepared from the products, you know, prepared mentally, i'm hoping all of them are. but prepared from a product standpoint, you know, there would be some products that we would upsell to some of our clients that would enable them to get the full value and actually be able to use beti. i haven't disclosed exactly what that is because that's a moving target as we continue to have success selling beti, both into the current client base, as well as to all new clients that are brought on.
matt diamond -- mizuho securities -- analyst
understood. thanks so much.

next question comes from the line of bryan bergin of cowen. your line is open.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. thank you. i have a follow-up on beti here.
so, just curious how the efforts are progressing on selling it back into that existing base of those 4,000-or-so sold clients. can you give us a sense on how many of those are within the existing base versus new?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, we're not splitting that out separately but i would -- you could expect there to be a healthy mix of both with 4,000. so, you'd have a healthy mix of both. you know, for current clients, it's one of those things where they're having success with our current product in the current environment and we're going up to them asking them to change their internal processes again to start the process at the beginning versus at the end. we're having a lot of success with that.
and as we get more and more proof sources of current clients that have shifted over to it and their employees are having great success, we are receiving both more client referrals, as well as more prospect referrals, which is driving more results for us. 
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. sure. and then just on the talent and the hiring front, any challenges at all in acquiring needed talent across the organization, whether that's in sales or services?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, there's no doubt it's a tighter market and it really does depend on at what level we're talking about bringing people in and then also what departments. you know, on some levels, we're actually receiving upgrades in talent due to the fact that i think our brand is much stronger than it's been in the past and we are a destination location for employment. in some areas, just like everyone else, it's a tight labor market. we're all fighting for talent.
so, it's really somewhat department-dependent as well as at what level of employee versus is it a new frontline-type position or is this a management-level position. but it's tight everywhere but we are having a lot of success continuing to bring the people in.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. thank you.

next question comes from the line of alex zukin of wolfe research. your line is open.
allan verkhovski -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. it's allan on for alex zukin. seems like there is a good of inflection in the demand environment, the march and april timeframe. how are you thinking about the competing trends around both reopening, along with the shortage of talent? are those -- are these opposing forces or are they coming together to drive demand? thanks.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i'll tell you from where we're at right now and i've kind of said this a little bit or a bit consistently, i would say, is we needed stability in the market in order for us to -- in order for it to enable our growth so that our growth could actually be reflected as we brought businesses in. we needed some stability, we've had that. as far as it being a tight labor market, you know, i do think there is some impact, obviously. and the larger we get, the larger the impact, you know, on our ability to have what i'm going to call same-store or current-client growth and see that.
we've never been a company that's been dependent upon that, nor have we really looked at that as any type of driver for us. and probably, still today, wouldn't even have thought of it as a question, except for we did go to the pandemic and lost a significant amount through our client base. but from our -- from a macro standpoint of what we see among our client base, you know, we see stability and our growth is coming from our ability to add new clients onto our platform.

next question comes from the line of robert simmons of da davidson. your line is open.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thank you. so, i'm just wondering what are you seeing out there in the market from the competition? is there anything unusual going on in terms of pricing, marketing, or anything that you've [inaudible] 
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so, it is hard for me to hear you. i heard the, what is going on. is anything going on new with the competition? i can't say.
i would say we've always been in an extremely competitive market. i think that's good for clients. the more competitive an industry is, the more innovation you see. it is the heart of -- we're all trying.
i can't say that i've seen anything new in the market from our clients be it from different types of technologies and or techniques that are used with, you know, the -- we've always -- clients have always sold against us with different pricing discounting and, you know, different people accentuate their positives. the positive we accentuate is the fact that we drive significant return on investment for those in low-cost total ownership for those businesses that choose paycom. and that's all experienced through employee usage and an easy-to-use product.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. great. and then are you seeing any kind of change in demand environment in terms of like which modules are particularly being taken up by clients in terms of like -- it's no change in what people really want to focus on is that really not a factor? can you explain some more?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. i will tell you one thing that we are seeing. we -- you know, and i've said this in the past, we've always been really good at selling products. you know, sometimes, not as good at getting clients to use the products that we've sold.
what i would say is happening now and it's really been happening, you know, we came out with the ddx, we came out with manager on-the-go. we kept the data moving, we gave people visibility. then we came out with beti and gave them another reason to go ahead and fully automate. you know, we've continued to do that and we've continued to see great success around usage, which is really driving everything for us right now.

and your last question comes from the line of bhavin shah of deutsche bank. your line is open.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter show. chad, i'd like -- if you could just dive into the upmarket motion a bit. how does the pipeline here evolves as you probably open up this opportunity? and any sense of how the initial sell cycle that win rates have compared to the rest of your business? i know it's kind of early days still.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say really no big changes on that. you know, we expanded the market because we had -- we're already having success in it and already had a very strong pipeline as we continue to move upmarket. i would just say it's more of the same on that and really wouldn't be able to call out many differences than what we've had in the past.
we've just formalized our target market up to 10,000 employees now as we had been having success in that 5,000 and 10,000 range throughout this year.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. and then on beti, i know you're not breaking up the split between the 4,000 of new and existing. but many of those existing, any sense of how many of them have come back to the table to adopt additional modules that kind of fully utilize the benefits of employee self-payroll?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say every client that's deployed beti would have to have the full solution set that beti requires to be able to even implement beti. so, that would have happened upfront. again, i do want to state that most all of the products required or necessary to work beti are our most popular products.
and, you know, we're always -- we -- we've always been pretty good at selling the value to both the client and the employee for them taking that product and using it. so, you know, beti itself -- it's incremental to our overall revenue and will prove it will prove very positive. but really, where it's making the impact, it's driving an incredible amount of value for the client. i mean, it's a very nominal spin for them to add it.
but the value multiple that they are receiving just by adding beti really makes all the other products that we've already provided to them much more valuable with a stronger return. and it's very measurable for both them and the employee. one thing we are starting to receive a lot more of right now are employee referrals who have used beti even at one company they go to another company. and we're continuing to have strong referrals from rank and file employees that have used our technology and now are at a different location or business.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst

we use these non-gaap financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. a reconciliation schedule showing gaap versus non-gaap results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. i will now turn the call over to chad richison, paycom's president and chief executive officer. chad? 
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, james, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. we ended 2021 with a very strong quarter, and i'd like to thank all of our employees for the outstanding effort they put in to making 2021 a great success. i will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter 2021 results. then i will review some of our notable achievements throughout the year.
following that, craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. 2021 was a very strong year for paycom. we extended our platform to the employee even further through innovations like beti, which enables employees to do their own payroll, and we are seeing very strong adoption and record employee usage as measured by the ddx. strong demand continues to bolster our sales momentum, and record new client sales in 2021 have positioned us to deliver another year of rapid growth in 2022.
for years, i have been predicting the end of the old model, whereby hr and payroll personnel's routine of inputting data for employees, is replaced by a self-service model that provides employees direct access to the database. the old model is dying and that is good for both the business and the employee. paycom is leading this transformation. we will continue to automate the processes that generate maximum roi for our clients.
our 2021 fourth-quarter revenue of $285 million came in very strong, up 29% year over year. our full year 2021 revenue of $1,056,000,000 grew 25% compared to 2020. employee usage, which is at a record high, is a key driver of revenue retention, and i'm pleased to announce that paycom's annual revenue retention rate increased once again to 94% this year, which is a validation of the strong roi our clients are achieving. our full year 2021 adjusted ebitda was $419 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of nearly 40%.
the sum of our 2021 revenue growth rate and adjusted ebitda margin resulted in us hitting the rule of 65, reflecting the solid demand for our solutions and the profitability of our business model, and was well ahead of our stated goal to reach the rule of 60. as you can see with our full year 2022 guidance, we are starting strong with the rule of 65. our marketing plan throughout 2021 continue to perform well, delivering strong demo leads throughout the year as we spent aggressively on advertising. more importantly, our sales teams are successfully closing these leads, which is the key driver to our revenue growth.
in her first year as our chief sales officer, holly faurot has executed fabulously on her sales plan, and i'm very pleased with the coordination we are seeing across the sales and marketing organizations. we are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate hcm systems that are failing both the employees who struggle to use them and the businesses that struggle just to make them work. our proven single-database platform just works better, and we continue to differentiate ourselves with easy-to-use solutions that enhance the employee experience and generate maximum roi for our clients. in response to increasing demand in 2021, we expanded the upper end of our target client size range from 5,000 to 10,000 employees as we are seeing success selling to larger clients.
we are also concurrently expanding geographically to meet the increased demand. in addition to the manhattan office we announced a few months ago, we recently opened four outside sales offices in the following locations: las vegas, jacksonville, new england, and south jersey. we have now opened five offices in the last five months. that said, i'd remind everyone that we still only have approximately 5% of the tam today, so there's plenty of runway ahead to expand and continue to capture market share.
paycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2021. our latest innovation, beti, was awarded a top hr product of the year honor. as a workplace, we earned a top 20 ranking in best places to work in the u.s. by top workplaces, and we were named a top workplace in oklahoma for the ninth consecutive year.
we were also named the best company for women to work. these awards are a testament to our execution and thriving corporate culture. as of december 31, 2021, our headcount stood at 5,385 employees, up 28% year over year as we continue to have great success attracting and retaining high-quality talent to further bolster our future growth. additionally, i want to congratulate the 2021 paycom jim thorpe award winner, coby bryant from the university of cincinnati.
this award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes jim thorpe, who is one of the greatest all-around athletes in history. jim thorpe also happened to be in oklahoma. to sum up, we are executing well on all fronts with innovative solutions, high employee usage, and increasing revenue retention. robust market demand and our proven go-to-market strategy are fueling strong new client revenue momentum.
i'd like to thank our employees for help making 2021 such a strong year, and we are set up to do even better in 2022 and we're off to a great start. with that, i'll turn the call over to craig for a review of our financials and guidance. craig?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and corporate secretary
thanks, chad. before i review our fourth quarter and full-year results for 2021 and our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2022, i would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-gaap basis. we ended the year with very strong results, delivering a milestone full year 2021 revenue total of $1,056,000,000, up 25.4% compared to 2020. fourth-quarter results were excellent with total revenues of $285 million representing growth of 29% over the comparable prior-year period.
our revenue growth is driven by strong demand, new business wins, and adoption of recent new product offerings. within total revenues, recurring revenue was $280 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 29% from the comparable prior-year period. we ended 2021 with nearly 34,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 9% compared to 2020. on a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with roughly 17,700 clients, representing a growth rate of 10% compared to 2020.
total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $239.7 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.1%. for the full year 2021, our adjusted gross margin was 85.1%. for 2022, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%. adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $72.3 million or 25.4% of revenues.
our marketing strategy in 2021 has been very effective at driving high-quality demo leads, and our outside and inside sales teams have been doing a great job closing these leads. we plan to continue to invest in marketing in q1 and throughout 2022. in addition, as chad said, we have added four more outside sales offices bringing the total outside sales office opening to five new openings in the last five months. we also continue to add inside sales personnel as we grow our sales organization to meet the demand.
adjusted r&d expense was $32.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 or 11.3% of total revenue. adjusted total r&d costs, including the capitalized portion, were $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $33.2 million in the prior-year period. we aggressively recruited talent in r&d throughout the pandemic, and we plan to continue to invest in our future growth through innovation and new product development. adjusted ebitda was $109.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 or 38.4% of total revenues, compared to $84.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 38.1% of total revenues.
for the full year 2021, adjusted ebitda was $419.3 million or 39.7% of total revenues, compared to $330.8 million or 39.3% of total revenues in 2020. our gaap net income for the fourth quarter was $48.7 million or $0.84 per diluted share versus $24.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share in the prior-year period based on approximately 58 million shares. for the full year 2021, our gaap net income was $196 million or $3.37 per diluted share. our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 30.4%.
non-gaap net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $64.4 million or $1.11 per diluted share versus $49.1 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the prior-year period. for the full year 2021, our non-gaap net income was $260.4 million or $4.48 per diluted share versus $203.5 million or $3.49 per diluted share in the prior-year period. for 2022, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a gaap and non-gaap basis with q1 gaap effective tax rate expected to be approximately 30%. turning to the balance sheet.
we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $278 million and total debt of $29 million. cash from operations was $319 million in 2021, representing an increase of 40.6%, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. the average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. during 2021, we repurchased approximately 164,000 shares for a total of roughly $65.6 million.
through december 31, 2021, paycom has repurchased nearly 4.3 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $488 million, and we currently have $266 million remaining in our buyback program. now, let me turn to guidance for fiscal 2022. we expect revenue in the range of $1,314,000,000 to $1,316,000,000 or nearly 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of $524 million to $526 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 40% at the midpoint of the range.
we are starting this year's guidance at the rule of 65. for the first quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $342 million to $344 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of 26% at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda for the first quarter in the range of $161 million to $163 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 47% at the midpoint of the range. 2021 was a very strong year for paycom as a direct result of the investments we made.
we will continue to invest in talent, marketing, innovation, customer service, and geographic expansion to meet the strong demand we are experiencing and to support our high expectations for long-term future growth. with that, we will open the line for questions. operator?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we will pause here briefly as questions are registered. our first question is from raimo lenschow of barclays.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
hey, thank you. congrats to a great finish to the year. chad and craig, i'd like two questions. one was on the retention rates.
so, 94% is kind of again up from last year, very, very strong especially considering where you're playing in the market. can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? and is that kind of -- how are you thinking about this number going forward? and then the second question is where i got a lot of questions from investors, was around the customer adds. obviously, last year was full year with the pandemic, so you had like a crazy big number there. that kind of moderated this year.
like how should we think about it, especially in light of your comments, craig, around the investments on inside and outside sales? thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, raimo. so, starting with the first on retention. it was about three or four years ago that we started to increase that rate. we've been 91% for six years straight, and then it jumped up to 92%.
and it really jumped up once we started implementing employee usage products. we'd come out with the app. it went up. then we looked at the year before.
the pandemic hit in 2020. it went up again to 93%. again, we had driven through the direct data exchange, having employees make those changes themselves, increased satisfaction again for those clients as it increased the return on investment. 2020, we held the line at 93% and that had somewhat to do to with the trailing revenue -- trailing 12 revenue retention number.
obviously, 2020, we did have some retreat in our revenue, just the natural attrition that came from those employees being laid off or leaving their business during the pandemic. and then now in 2021, we've been able to increase it once again to 94%. and answer to that question, it's all really driven by usage. the more success a client has using our products, the greater the return on the investment they're achieving, and that makes them want to stay with us longer.
and so, how high can it go? obviously, at some point, you do have to look at you're always going to have a certain number of clients that could be bought, sold, and merged. but i -- we're very ambitious with that number. we're seeing a lot of satisfaction across the client base. so, i don't -- i wouldn't necessarily say we're done with our retention aspirations, but we feel really good by being able to raise it again.
as far as the client count that you mentioned, in 2019, our parent company grew, and those are decision -- client decisions, grew by 6.5%, that client number. of course, today in 2021, it grew 10%. last year, it grew 18%, and that was really in conjunction with the fact that we added small business teams to sell small business units. we accelerated our advertising spend in 2020, which generated a high volume of leads.
a lot of those were beneath the 50-employee range. and so, that's when we added several teams to catch that, and that really -- we benefited that from a percentage growth unit add. i would point out that in 2020, even though we did have around 18%, parent company grew growth from a unit perspective. our growth per client billings per client annual lives were -- was roughly flat.
and in 2021, that number's up about 14%.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
ok, thank you. congrats.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is with samad samana of jefferies.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. great. congrats. i'll echo that as well.
just a really great end to 2021. so, maybe, chad, one, just to follow up on raimo's question, and you kind of touched on it a little bit there at the end. but if i think about the net adds that you've added in the context of the, call it, net new recurring revenue, you're getting to like an average customer size of new customers added like north of $70,000 of average revenue versus like, let's call it, in the 50s maybe looking back to 2019. so, you're seeing pretty significant growth there.
i'm just curious, is that a fair way to think about it that you're just signing customers that are even much larger today than in '21? and how should we maybe think about that just on the historical comparison?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, it's been similar as what you've seen us pick up in the past. as we've continued to focus on larger clients that's driven that number up, we're having more success selling larger clients. so, you might say that the ones we're bringing in on average are larger than what we bring -- brought in, in the past.
we're selling more of them. so, we're just having more unit counts at that level than what we've had in the past. and then obviously, we've continued to add product into the mix, which also adds value to each deal that we bring in regardless of what size they're at.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then maybe just a follow-up. beti is impacting retention in a positive way. i'm curious if you can maybe update us on what the traction is in terms of getting the installed base to using beti and how we should think about that progression in 2022.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and so, we're having a lot of success with the installed base using beti. i mean, internally, there is a little bit of a process change for our clients. you're moving things that you were doing after the payroll ends, the pay period ends.
you're moving that to the beginning. but we continue to have success selling beti both into our current installed base. and as a reminder, all new business that we've brought on since july of last year all have beti included in its pricing and usage expectation.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. our next question is with brad reback of stifel.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, great. thanks very much. just a first quick one. chad, can you remind us how many sales teams, both internal and external, you have today and maybe where that was a year ago?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. craig?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and corporate secretary
yeah. so, outside sales teams, we're at 54 now. and as we mentioned, we've added the four recent ones, and then we added one toward the end of last year, so we've added five of those. and then in terms of inside sales teams, from our kpis, we count the inside and the crr group as one, but we've also announced that we've had over -- have 10 plus we're adding to the inside sales group.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
and so, outside sales is at 54, i think right now, total outside sales teams. brad, the last time we added a sales -- outside sales team, we added in 2019. we added our new orleans office. we did not add any in 2020.
the end of 2021 is when we brought through manhattan, and then we continued on with four since then.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. and maybe just following up to close the loop on the unit versus pricing dynamic. with these added sales teams, would it be right to assume that we could probably see a more even split in '22 with the 25% growth between unit and price or maybe even a little more unit?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i'm not sure. we're not as focused on unit growth, i would say. i mean, obviously, we want to win our deals. sometimes our unit growth goes up as it did in 2020 just because of the success we had with our inside sales group.
obviously, those deals have a smaller revenue contribution. so, as we turned into 2021 -- and we had success selling in 2020 as well above our range, but, you know, in 2021, we raised our range because we continued to have so much success. so, our focus continues to be the mid-market, but we also have success below. and that is really what contributes to the increase in unit count, are those small unit deals.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. our next question is with mark marcon of baird.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. let me add my congratulations. with regards to the revenue per client increasing by 14%, how much of that is just because of the bigger clients that you're selling relative to an increase in terms of the number of employees per client just as employment came back versus adding more modules or selling more modules? is there a way to just think about that in terms of the three elements?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, well, it's going to be driven by size of client and number of modules sold into client for sure. any contribution from improving employment in regards to our base would be minimal.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
ok. so, that was a minimal contribution in terms of the employees in the base.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
correct.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
great. and then can you talk a little bit about the assumptions for the gross margins? obviously continue to be best in class. wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the expectations here for '22. what are you assuming in terms of average float balance? and with rates starting to finally move back up, how much do you think you could end up capturing as rates start hopefully normalizing?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and corporate secretary
yeah. on our gross margins, we don't anticipate -- or we don't factor in any rate increases. i mean, obviously, if there are rate increases, which we're talking about here in the first quarter in march, that would be a tailwind to us. based on the average daily balance, it's somewhere between $4 million and $5 million on an annual basis, but that would layer in, mark.
i mean, it wouldn't come to us the day they increase rates, so that's something that kind of layers in over time.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
is that $4 million to $5 million for how many basis points?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
per quarter basis, per 25, right?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and corporate secretary
yeah, it would be on an annual basis for each 25-basis-point increase. so, on a 12 month --
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
excellent. thank you.
operator
our next question is with ryan macdonald of needham.
unknown speaker
hey, guys, this is josh on for ryan. congrats on the strong year and quarter here. curious, now that you've just opened five sales offices, what are you seeing in the macro that's kind of giving you this confidence here over the last couple of quarters to open these offices? and then are you seeing improved activity in hospitality in some of the troubled industries from the pandemic starting to pick up here materially before omicron hit? and then what kind of a pause are you seeing with omicron if any?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. first, i would talk about the office openings. i mean, demand is really what's driving us to add more sales teams. again, we started really spending heavily on marketing in 2020.
it brought on high-quality revenue that produced very strong margins for us, and we continue to have elevated leads. and so -- and again, we didn't really open anything in 2020, so it was really time for us to start that again. as it relates to omicron, i would say that, oftentimes, we don't really know why one company may be experiencing less employment today than it did last week and why it may have more next week. so, i don't really see these factors, as long as we have stability, having a large impact one way or another on our quarters as we move forward.
i'd talked about the importance it need that we had to lap the pandemic with stability, and we've had that substantially since the summer of 2020. so, we feel good about where we're at from here and feel like, barring any major move -- and i believe it would have to be major in some type of employment situation, which we don't expect, i think it should be business as usual for us as we go forward throughout the year.
unknown speaker
ok. got it. great. and then just a follow-up question on the interest income.
and that kind of returns to the model here over the next couple of years. investors are obviously more focused on free cash flow generation with the increasing interest rates. how do you think about the balance of reinvesting that interest income for growth versus letting it just fall to free cash flow and ultimately buying back more shares, obviously, depending on how the stock price goes?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. first priority is always growth for us. i mean, we have been investing our profits into growth, and they're creating more profit. so, that's just kind of what's been happening.
but in regards to the interest rates, we wouldn't do anything unnatural than the things we're doing right now. craig, i don't know if you'd add anything?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and corporate secretary
no. i mean, obviously, as they come back, i mean, we would trade off 1 point of margin for 1 point of growth, but we're going to still spend wisely as you see that we've always done.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
and we're focused to just growing as fast as we can in 2022, so we have that locked and loaded and the funds to be able to do that.
unknown speaker
great. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question is with siti panigrahi.
siti panigrahi -- mizuho securities -- analyst
siti panigrahi. congratulation, great quarter. so, i was getting to your question about your q1 guidance. sequentially, it was 21%, is almost similar to last year versus prior to covid, is 30% plus.
is there a similar kind of expectation from w-2 and form filing this year as well, chad? or any other factor you have considered in your guidance?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. there's a little bit of that. i would kind of point to how fourth quarter in 2021 was our highest revenue quarter that we've had from a fourth-quarter perspective, meaning, typically, first quarter can outpace first -- fourth quarter throughout the years. this year, fourth quarter outpaced first quarter in 2021.
really hadn't happened since 2015 and then it happened in 2014. really, what's happening is our revenue makeup mix. as we continue to sell more products, both at the time of sale, as well as into the base, the contribution that those annualized form filings has on an overall client annualized revenue that we get from them is smaller. and so, the recurring revenue, monthly recurring we're charging the client, you might say, is outpacing that, that we would have growth in annualized fees if you will.
and so -- and then yes, i think you still have some of the trends that were followed in 2020 or happened again in 2021 somewhat. but i think our comps were a little bit easier comping over this year than what we had going into 2021 w-2s versus the 2019 w-2s. but anyway, all that's to say i think one thing that's starting to happen in our revenue mix is that the monthly recurring that we're charging a client due to the additional products that we've come up with that they're buying and finding value in is outpacing any growth in our annualized fees.
siti panigrahi -- mizuho securities -- analyst
that's great color. and then quick follow-up on -- now great to see that you already added four to five sales offices. and how do you think the competitive landscape will change your 5,000-above kind of segment now that you have sales office and they can do in-person, which is probably more relevant for targeting this high-end customer? how should we think about that growth in that?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think it still remains to be seen how prospects are going to buy this technology. we're still -- i mean, most people are still buying virtually. again, we're not going to try to pull clients onto a certain way to buy. we're going to meet them where they live.
so, if they're used to buying virtually and they want to buy virtually, well, we have the solution for that. and of course, if clients are wanting us to come out there, we have that availability to be able to do that. but i would say that we're not seeing a huge shift to in-person selling at this point. we remain ready.
but again, that's something that's going to -- we're going to meet the client where they live on that.
siti panigrahi -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thank you, chad.
operator
thank you. our next question is with bryan bergin of cowen.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, guys. good afternoon. thank you. so, you measure kind of the sales force metrics.
can you talk about where sales force productivity stands relative to pre-pandemic levels?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sales productivity is way up from pre-pandemic levels when you look at a -- on a per-rep basis or even if you look at a per-team basis. when you lose one of your senses, the other takes over and we just -- we became a lot better throughout the pandemic in how we sold. we got better at strategy. we got better at connecting to our prospects.
we got better at marketing. we got better at retargeting. so, sales has been very strong, and it remains that today.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and as far as employee growth or client employee growth goes, i think i heard you say it was minimal in the fourth quarter. are you embedding any assumption on client employee growth in your 2022 outlook?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is with alex zukin of wolfe research.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. i guess maybe, chad, for you. if you think about the pipeline, the sales cycles, sales cycle length, and just in general, the impact of kind of the great resignation, both the puts and takes on the business, where do we stand on all those fronts as we look at '22?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, i would say in regards to the -- sorry, go ahead. ok. i would say in regards to the pipeline, our pipeline remains very strong.
i also would say through virtual selling, i do think it's been, to some extent, easier to connect to some of the players that you would have in a larger organization. in a small organization, you might talk to two or three people, but in a large organization, you have multiple decision-makers and, in our case, multiple user buyers because we are impacting many parts of the businesses -- of the business. as far as the tight labor market, i mean, i think that impacts all of us. we've had a lot of success in the tight labor market, especially in the management ranks, of being able to increase quality for us in those areas.
we're up 28%, i mean, from an employment perspective. we added 28% to our employee base last year. so, definitely, we noticed it being tied out there but -- and it's definitely -- you have to be competitive. but we've had a lot of success building our recruiting teams over the years with very strong learning management systems, where we're able to spin up employees quickly, get them started on their career.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. and then maybe just to follow up. chad, obviously, the amount of sales offices that you added in '21 is -- i don't know if you're catching up from kind of where you weren't able to move as quickly in 2020 obviously. but for the -- to the extent that that's a direct result of like more people being in a position to make a move after being stalled to some extent with covid, whether it's attrition from your competitors like adp and paychex or whether it's the competitive environment, there was a large hack, a ransomware attack at ukg, like what does the competitive set or landscape look like? and how is your dialed-in investment incrementally in kind of expanding the sales team number by a lot more than in previous years? what is that -- what's the signal we're supposed to take away from that?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean, we're focused on dominating the industry and really providing businesses with a very strong return on investment. and really, that's happening. i mean, a lot of the things that we're competing against are just -- they're old ways to use systems. and i believe over time, and you're starting to see that, it just becomes more and more difficult to use them.
and we only have 5% of the market. i mean, that's the other thing. so, we have such an opportunity. demand continues to increase, the popularity of our brands getting stronger.
we have a lot stronger proved sources for larger clients. and we have increased retention rate, which shows you that they're just having a lot of success with it. and what was your question about ukg?
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
i was just asking, have you seen any impact from the hack that they've suffered, the security breach in terms of more -- has that been a pain point that has been used by more clients to switch providers?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i just wanted to get you to say it again. we're having success with that. it's a pretty bad deal when you're down that long, and we are having success with that.
our hearts go out to those clients and especially their employees that are impacted. but those are a little bit longer sales cycle when you're talking about the larger deals. i think this happened in december. obviously, we're on it.
we do believe that we're going to have success taking some business. and, i mean, i think if you're a cfo or hr person, you'd be hard-pressed to stay in that environment without quite a few explanations. i mean, at some point, you got to read the room on what industry you're in. and there's a lot of restaurants that won't serve you salmonella 32 days in a row.
you might want to eat at one of them. thanks for the question.
operator
thank you. our next question is with brian schwartz of oppenheimer.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
yeah. hi. congratulations on a good quarter, and thanks so much for taking my questions. chad, just a follow-up again on your optimism on the demand trends, as well as the sales successes that you'd experienced in the quarter.
clearly, your marketing and sales expansion is having some fruition. i just wanted to ask you again here. are you seeing any changes at all in the environment in terms of maybe what customers are asking for on top of the payroll or anything, the competition? or is your optimism about the demand trend just kind of strong productivity across the sales force today?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, i think we definitely have a strong productivity across our sales force, but i do believe that that's driven by high-quality leads and a differentiated product strategy that clients are having a lot of success for it. you sell one thing, but we're able to prove it out as well. and so, we go out there, we onboard clients onto our product, and then we're able to prove out the value they're receiving.
and so, the more you do that, the more that increases demand, as well as it increases confidence with your sales force. the salesperson goes out there and has an incredible amount of success bringing someone onto our platform, and that's a happy client. a lot of confidence is built up within the sales staff. and so, we had to shift strategies here.
we didn't start off with the employee does the work and inputs the data into the system themselves through the ddx. we didn't start off with that. we didn't start off with self-service payroll. and so, there's been a little bit of a shift from our sales department selling it one way and really coming into their own with understanding the value of selling it the correct way, which is how the clients are going to currently use the product.
so, we're very bullish on that. and really, our demand hasn't seen much or any of a tail off, and i'm thinking of since 2020 or since we came out in 2020. of course, it's up from there from what we would have sold in 2020. but since those first couple of weeks in the pandemic when we shifted into virtual leads and increase in marketing and really becoming more efficient in our areas, we've had a lot of success since that time, and i haven't seen us take a step back since that time.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks, chad. and one follow-up for craig. craig, i have a question on the 4q cash flow. it came in far above what we were modeling.
you pointed out the revenue upside is one of the driver. i just wanted to ask you, did some of the spend plan for 4q, did that get pushed into 1q? or were there any other anomalies to explain the outsized cash flow growth in the quarter? thanks.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and corporate secretary
no, i would say it's mostly just timing, a little bit of timing, q3, q4 to q1. but, i mean, really nothing unusual there. i mean -- and part of it is just the overall strength of the quarter. we had a very strong quarter from a revenue perspective as well for q4.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks, craig.

our next question is with robert simmons of d.a. davidson.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my questions. i guess most of them have been asked and answered already. i guess, have you thought about giving new updated for asc 606 long-term target margins?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and corporate secretary
you know, under 606, i'm not exactly sure of the question. we're continuing to --
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
the long-term margin target -- you used to give like a long-term ebitda margin, not guide but a target. i was wondering if you would update [inaudible]
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, correct. we did. and i think we continue to hit that and then we would update it. and you're right, as we went to 606, we have not updated those long-term margins.
we have strong margins that we're starting off with right now. again, we are focused on growth, but our growth is producing high-quality, profitable business. so, for us, we're focused on the growth side, but we do have healthy, strong margins. it's something we have to take a look at internally of when we may be able to update what a long-term growth margin looks like.
but we're focused on growing for the foreseeable future.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and corporate secretary
yeah. and i would say, i mean, one thing we're really starting this year, adjusted ebitda margin off it and where we finished last year. so, coming out strong out of the gate, a couple of things kind of looking into 2022 just on a modeling. stock comp, we would expect it to be around $110 million, up slightly from this year.
and then one thing, we did bring our grapevine office facility online here at the end of the fourth quarter. so, we're going to see a little bit of an increase in the depreciation for 2022 as it relates to that facility, probably up around 50 basis points as a percent of revenue. and then one thing else that we've announced is kind of the expansion in oklahoma city as well, so capex will be similar to last year as it relates to capex. so, all of those play into our margins, our -- some of those get added and subtracted out for adjusted ebitda.
but we're really excited about where we're starting '22 with the rule of 65.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
on the capex, is that similar dollar amount or a similar percent of revenue?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer, treasurer, and corporate secretary
percent of revenue.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst

our next question is with bhavin shah of deutsche bank. 
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great questions. chad, just any commentary you can provide in terms of which modules are seeing increased adoption as hr becomes more strategic with the great resignation? and then are you seeing any customers -- like are you seeing more customers come back to the table or even the size of land get bigger?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and so -- well, first, i would start with the modules. we've always had healthy uptake, and i've always said the longer we have a module, the more uptake we have in it. when you deploy beti, it does require certain modules to be implemented into the client base and into that client in order for them to use beti.
so, that's helpful oftentimes with our modules, especially for the new clients that we bring on that have beti, of which all of them do. so, that's helpful there. as far as module impact that we see, i mean, you are seeing some impact on learning management, just as people are looking to both retain, as well as spin-up training for new employees. obviously, our recruiting product has been very strong going throughout the pandemic to be able to identify those people that you want to hire.
but as far as when we look at the product mix, we've had healthy usage across all of them. and it really just depends on what industry and what area client might be in to whether or not they would use all of those modules or not if that makes sense. and then as far as seeing customers come back to the table, we're not having a lot of losses on customers, as we just talked about our retention rate going up. when we do lose a client, though, it is -- we get a meeting with them normally pretty quick just because of the usage around their employee base.
if we're looking at a ddx of 95% where employees are making 95% of all the changes into the system, that's a client that finds it difficult to leave without destroying their return on investment and all the automation that they had achieved through our products. so, we have a lot of win-backs there, but i would just start off by saying we're not really losing as many as we once did.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. that's helpful there. and just a quick follow-up on your office openings. i mean, as you guys open up five offices after not opening one and a half years, how do you ensure that you don't see any disruption to your productivity with your other offices as you shift around personnel and make them sales leaders? and to the other point, like how do we think about sales productivity ramping for these five offices? is there any change to the historical cadence?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, you don't ever take top managers out of an office and relocate them to a new office where they start off with zero employees and you don't have some impact on that office where those managers came from because we are -- these are some of our top managers that we relocate like that now. but what you're going to gain out of that new office is going to cover up anything that may have been negatively impacted on the old. and then by the time they get to maturity, there's not much difference between the two. well, there's not a difference between the two on what their quota is and oftentimes, quota achievement.
and so, i wouldn't say it's necessarily a giant sacrifice that we make, but you do -- whenever you do move managers out of an office, you do have an impact. now we're disrupting five of those. there used to be a time where we would disrupt four out of 12. so, the disruption to us is a little bit less.
and i'm using disruption. i don't know that that would be the right word to use, to be honest with you, but it does take a little bit for those managers as they get into those new territories to spin up. but they're our best managers, so they spin up pretty quickly.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.
operator
our final question is with daniel jester of bmo.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for squeezing me in. just to piggyback on the last question, are all of the five new offices fully staffed today?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no. our method is we get -- sorry, go ahead.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
no, no, no. finish, chad, please.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
our method is that, typically, we'll hire four -- a fully staffed office has eight sales reps. we'll start off with three or four in an office. they get selling, pipeline. they start getting starts.
as we've said in the past, it usually takes 24 months for an office to get to maximum maturity, and that's where they have the same quota with the same number of reps, with the same level of pipelines, and with the same level of expectation that we would have for their success as any other mature office.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
gotcha. and then just to wrap up on beti. when the product went live, chad, you made some comments about how long you thought it would take to get full penetration into the base. now that we've seen sort of the growth in the adoption, any updated thoughts about how that progression is going to evolve?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i still feel strongly about what i said in the past. i mean, beti ensures perfect payrolls. it ensures you're not going to have manual checks. you're not going to have voids.
you're not going to have employees with overdrafts and everything else. so, we continue to have a lot of success deploying beti, and i still expect that all of our clients will be using beti at some point. all right. well, i would like to thank everyone for joining us today on the call and a special thanks to our employees for helping deliver another very strong year.
this quarter, we will be participating in the keybanc and morgan stanley conferences in san francisco on march 8 and march 9, respectively. both should be in person, but we'll see. we look forward to speaking with many of you very soon. we appreciate your continued support in paycom.
thank you. operator, you may disconnect.

operator
good afternoon. thank you for attending today's paycom software first quarter 2022 quarterly results. my name is taniya, and i will be your moderator for today's call. [operator instructions] i would now like to pass the conference over to our host, james samford, head of investor relations with paycom.
please go ahead.

chad? 
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, james, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. i'll spend a few minutes on the highlights of the quarter. then i'll focus on the opportunities that i expect to drive strong performance going forward. following that, craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we'll take questions.
our 2022 first quarter revenue of approximately $354 million came in very strong of 30% year over year and was well ahead of the expectations, thanks to strong growth in recurring revenue from new business sales and modestly better revenue from seasonal forms, filings and adjustments. this quarter has set us up really well to strong financial performance for the remainder of the year and we are raising our full year guidance as a result. with our new full year outlook for revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin, i now believe we can exceed the rule of 65. employee usage continues to trend higher as more companies embrace our self-service solutions and push ownership of the data out to the employee.
increasing employee usage is a key component of the roi that our clients realize and we believe our employee usage strategy is a competitive advantage and a driver of our very strong growth. already, well over a quarter of our clients have implemented and/or in the process of implementing beti, our most advanced employee usage payroll experience to date. in less than a year over 10,000 of our clients have embraced beti is the right way to do payroll. beti is fundamentally a better way to run all payroll processes to the benefit of the employer and employee.
we will continue to innovate beti to deliver even more value to our clients, making it even more compelling. beti is the future of payroll. our marketing plan continues to perform very well, delivering strong demo leads and brand recognition across our target market. we are also having a lot of success with our retarget efforts and leveraging our digital assets.
we recently launched a new ad campaign highlighting how employees have been given the wrong tools for their jobs. with paycom, employees have the right hcm tools at their fingertips. our marketing efforts target employee usage at both large and small clients and we're having great success attracting new clients, which is a key component of our rapid revenue growth. on the sales front, i'm pleased with the execution and progress we are making to further penetrate the markets we are in.
i just returned from our president's club meeting in florida with our top sales reps and it was fantastic to see how everyone is energized and aligned with our go-to-market strategy. just a few years ago, we celebrated leading sales reps who sold over $1 million in a year. today, we are celebrating sales reps exceeding $2 million in sales in a year. holly faurot has done an outstanding job aligning the sales organization and the collaboration with the marketing organization is working very well.
in fact, both organizations recently received best marketing department and best sales department awards. these awards are in addition to the awards we received for best companies for women and forbes list of best mid-size employers and top workplaces. i am more confident than ever that we have the right team and culture in place to achieve our growth expectations. as a reminder, we only have approximately 5% of a very large and growing tam and a long runway for rapid growth for many years to come.
also, i want to say thank you to jon evans, who was with paycom for eight years and was our coo for four of those years, as he took over for stacey. jon did a great job for this company, like anyone who does a great job for paycom, their dna exists in the company long after they're gone. we are always excited to turn over the department to the next generation of leadership such as justin long and we know he'll take this group to the next level as has been proven every time we make strategic moves like this. to sum up, we kicked off the year with a great first quarter and are entering the second quarter with very strong momentum.
our differentiated strategy, our people and the value we are delivering to our clients are fueling our long-term growth. i want to thank our employees for their hard work and exceptional performance this quarter. with that, i'll turn the call over to craig for a review of our financials and guidance. craig?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
thanks chad. before i review our first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022, i would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-gaap basis. first quarter 2022 results were excellent with total revenues of $353.5 million representing growth of 30% over the comparable prior year period. in q1, we had very strong recurring revenue growth from strong starts and modestly better-than-expected annual forms, filings and adjustments revenue.
our revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for easy-to-use employee focused solutions and our success in attracting new business wins. within total revenues, recurring revenue was $348.2 million for the first quarter representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 30% from the comparable prior year period. total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $306 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 86.6% and we remain on target to achieve strong full-year adjusted gross margin in the range of 85% to 86%. adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2022 was $72.1 million or 20.4% of revenues compared to 21.8% of revenues in the prior year period.
we continue to see strong return on investment from our advertising spend and plan to continue to invest aggressively in marketing and advertising throughout 2022. adjusted r&d expense was $29.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 or 8.3% of total revenues. adjusted total r&d cost, including the capitalized portion were $42.9 million in the first quarter compared to $34 million in the prior year period. innovation continues to be a key area of investment for us and we have a deep pipeline of projects that we are pursuing.
adjusted ebitda was $170.1 million in the first quarter of 2022 or 48.1% of total revenues compared to $133 million in the prior year or 48.9% of total revenues. our gaap net income for the first quarter was $91.9 million or a $1.58 per diluted share versus $64.6 million or a $1.11 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares. non-gaap net income for the first quarter of 2022 was $110.6 million or $1.90 per diluted share $85.9 million or a $1.47 per diluted share in the prior year period. for 2022, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a gaap and non-gaap basis.
turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $361 million in total debt of $29 million. the average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022. now, let me turn to guidance. based on the very strong first quarter results and the strong demand trends we are seeing, we are raising our full-year 2022 guidance.
we now expect revenue in the range of $1.333 billion to $1.335 billion or 26% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of $533 million to $535 million representing adjusted ebitda margin of 40% at the midpoint of the range. combined revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin, we now expect to exceed the rule of 65 that we reported last year. for the second quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $308 million to $310 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range.
we expect adjusted ebitda for the second quarter in the range of $111 million to $113 million representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 36% at the midpoint of the range. the strength of our results and our raise guidance clearly reflect our confidence in the market demand for our solutions and the success we are having in expanding our market share from the roughly 5% share of the tam that we have today. we have a high margin recurring revenue model, a strong balance sheet, and with the investments we are making and the success of our sales model, we are very well positioned to deliver another year of rapid revenue growth and robust adjusted ebitda margin. with that we will open the line for questions.
operator?
",":

[operator instructions] the first question is from the line of raimo lenschow with barclays. you line is open.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
thank you and congrats from me. that's an amazing quote and interesting guidance and very strong guidance. i wanted to kind of talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the market. obviously, there's like a nervousness about like how your european situation might spill over to the us.
doesn't look like it, but like maybe any comments on that one chad. but then also i wanted to hear more from you around momentum in the different customer segments around large customers, small customers inside skills, what what's driving the strong momentum especially if i look at q2 guidance that looks stronger than what you've done historically. thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so first, as you're aware, our focus is here domestic here in the us. we are focused on those businesses. our system does allow people to store employees that work internationally.
so, as far as the impact on what's going on in europe, i think from a macro level, i think it somewhat impacts every business, but for us, we only have 5% of the tam out there continuing to drive new business revenue and that's not keeping us from being able to do that although, our hearts go out to what's going on over there. in your next question what's driving our momentum, we are having a lot of success above the 1,000-employee mark as more and more businesses look to deploy self-service technology in the hands of their employees. and then, as long as you're deploying self-service technology in those employees' hands, you may as well deploy something that does the most for them or something that they can do the most on. and so, that's definitely help drive our momentum as we continue to move forward.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
ok. and then, quick one quick follow up, if i think about the flow of balance, how are a potentially higher interest rates impacting you and how immediate does that affect?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so, raimo, we had a 25-basis improvement toward the end of first quarter. so, that takes a while to layer into our numbers. we're still investing in fairly short term, but obviously looking at the best way to deploy those balances. so, as they would go up, then we would -- we would start to see impact over time on those increased rates.
operator
the next question is from samad samana with jefferies. your line is open.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good evening. thanks for taking my questions. so maybe chad first for you just, i know the company opened several new offices.
i'm curious if those have been fully staffed already and maybe how those staffing of that it was informed the kind of stronger than normal guidance that you gave for the rest of the year even on top of a very strong 1q?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i can tell you all of the new offices have been open and they are producing already. so each of them do produce. it takes two years for an office to reach full maturity, but obviously we're going to continue to generate revenue from them as they're in the maturing state.
so, definitely some of the revenue that we would expect, the revenue growth that we would expect to achieve this year, there will be some contributions from those offices, although small. i think -- i would think you would see a larger contribution from those offices next year and definitely as you look into 2024.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then, craig, maybe just a follow-up to raimo question. i know we've only seen a 25 raise in fed funds rate, but can you just help us understand, are you baking any further increases into the guidance or is the revised guidance just as of what's already been happened, not the scuttle butter on future potential raises?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yeah, the guidance we gave is really kind of where we are today on what we're earning today. so that included that first 25-basis-point increase. so, they're talking about additional raises even this week. so we kind of have to see how those layer into our earnings.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
ok, great. thanks for taking my questions and congrats with strong quarter.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. samana. the next question is from brad reback with stifel. your line is open.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. chad, is your sellers get back to face-to-face interactions, have you seen any change of productivity as a result? i know you were really productivity over the last few years, but any changes?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no, i wouldn't say we're back to face to face. we're doing some of them face to face. so we're definitely doing more this quarter than we did the last quarter. but i wouldn't say that we are back face to face the way we were pre-pandemic.
i do believe going face to face has opportunities to impact in a positive way or close ratios as we do that. but as we sit here today, it would be hard for me to say that we've fully made that shift again. we're still meeting clients where they live and we're still walking through that process and a substantial number of our clients and definitely the overwhelming majority of our meetings are still being held virtually, and i believe that we're doing that for the benefit of efficiency for both the client as well as us.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. and then, switching gears, i think it was last week, adp talked about more aggressive price increases to reflect the current inflationary environment. from your over the last 20 years, what type of impact does that have on the market and overall customer demand?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, as you know brad, we did our very first pricing adjustment in 2019. it impacted a very small subset of our client base. and we generated around 1% at that time. at that time, i mentioned that, as we look at pricing adjustments and we increase the roi for our clients, it would only make sense that we were able to share in the roi that we increased.
and that's really how we look at it, regardless of inflation or anything else. if are increasing the roi for a client, there's an opportunity for us to share in that value that we create through pricing adjustments and if we don't do that, then it really doesn't matter if there's inflation or anything else. we really don't have that opportunity. so, as far as what another company might do, how that could impact us not so sure on that.
but, for us our pricing adjustments to the extent we do one would be based on an increased over return on investment that our clients are achieving.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks very much.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. reback. the next question is from the line of mark marcon with baird. your line is open.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
hey, good afternoon and congratulations on the excellent results. wondering, can you talk a little bit about the beti conversions that you've had so far and what sort of revenue uplift you've seen and then, what's been the change in terms of the level of client engagement and satisfaction and early reads in terms of retention trends among those clients?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, well from a rolling out beti, we started doing that in july for all new clients, all quotes -- for all quotes given in july, those quotes all had beti and so it was a part of our ongoing strategy. and so, the reason i'm saying that is the way a new client would approach beti is a little bit different than the way a current client would approach beti. and what i mean by that, a current client does have to go through a bit of conversion and they're not necessarily in a conversion mode the way a new client. they're already in a conversion mode and so there's a little bit difference there in how we work with one or the other, but we're also getting a lot better at deploying, making those conversions and helping the client set up their data sets that they have to feed into beti in order to make it work for them payroll after payroll.
and so, in answer to your question from a retention, absolutely, the more of a product businesses use in our case, the more products that they use, the longer they stay and the happier that they are. so we're having a lot of success getting beti out there.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
chad, do you get a revenue lift on the clients that you are converting to beti, and if so --
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
we do, yes. beti yeah, beti provides an incremental revenue opportunity for us. it's as i said, in the past it's a nominal fee. it's one of 29 modules, but we do get a revenue uplift each time we sell beti to a current client or if we sell beti to a new client, their pricing includes beti and so that would be a larger fee than what it would've been prior to beti being included.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
and so in terms of expectations, what's built into your expectations in terms of conversions among the client base that currently doesn't have beti through the balance of the year? and then as it relates to the rate question and the float income, to what extent would you let that incremental benefit flow through to the operating line as opposed to investing it?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, taking the latter first, we're always trying to invest, our first opportunity is to invest in growth and so we're always looking to do that, but we were also very disciplined in what we do. the first question was as far as, is beti built into our forecast, as far as what we're looking to do. it's been built into our forecast the whole time. i've been very aggressive about the expectations about our hopes for bringing beti in.
although i'm happy with 10,000 clients on it, or well over a quarter of our clients, there are a lot of clients out there that aren't yet, as well as their employees, that aren't yet experiencing the benefits and the roi that beti can deliver. and so, that's what we're focused on doing. i don't know that we're gonna hit, my expectations for speed on that we rarely do in situations like that. but what i will say is we're talking about 10,000 clients that have either signed up for it or already converted and this is a product that we started really putting out their own quotes beginning in july.
so it's hard for me to find another product that's moving as fast as what beti's moved with the exception of our aca product like in 2016.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
terrific. thank you, chad.
operator
thank you, mr. marcon. [operator instructions] the next question is from ryan macdonald with needham. your line is open.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. chad, last quarter on the call, there was discussion of a competitor of paycom, dealing with a hack issue in december. obviously that competitor being at the higher end of the market, you mentioned those sales cycles take a bit longer to process through. just curious, obviously now, sort of five months post that, how you're feeling competitively and if you've been able to successfully have some competitive wins there? thanks.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, yeah, definitely. we've had competitive wins, but we always have, it's not that, we don't have a pull the thorn out of your strategy. ours is a full strategy that we go through and definitely as clients were going through having their system down and having to implement all of these different technologies and/or do it manually, so that their employees could get paid. some of them didn't.
that becomes a thorn out of the palm moment, where we can pull that thorn out, and now you're not hurting exactly right now, but that's not necessarily driving an overall strategy for a business and how that changes. and most businesses of that size, i would say or all businesses of that size are pretty strategic and smart about how they move forward in it. and so, all the that's to say is that it would've been odd with at the time that that happen that we would've converted all these businesses overnight because, we're not going to do unnatural things to bring in clients without them understanding what they're buying and how the value is created, because it's important for us to retain them in order for us to really generate revenue and especially margin and adjusted ebitda from them.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
excellent. thanks. and then, just as a follow up, just curious at what you're seeing sort of down market in terms of inbound lead flow for your inside sales teams and how you're feeling about the capacity of those teams currently, any thoughts of sort of incremental investment to expand the number of teams through the remainder of the year. thanks.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
we would expand the number of teams to meet up with the demand. what's driving the demand is our advertising spend. we continue to spend heavily in advertising because it's working. so as our marketing and advertising efforts continue to drive more leads than, obviously, we would want to make sure we have that group staffed to be able to handle those leads.
the small market group, which handles under 50 employees represents about 5% of our revenue. so, when you're talking about how many resources that we would add to grow that into the future, definitely enough to service and be able to sell what the demand is that we're generating from our lead and marketing and advertising volume, but not so much that it shifts our focus and strategy away from what we're trying to capture here.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks for the color. congrats again.
operator
thank you, mr. macdonald. the next question is from siti panigrahi with mizuho. your line is open.
siti panigrahi -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. chad, just one clarification and then follow-up, you said this that revenue from filing and tax models better. so is it now to the pre-pandemic level?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no.
siti panigrahi -- mizuho securities -- analyst
ok. and then, when you're thinking, in terms of product innovation, we heard about ddx now beti, so how are you thinking about what's in terms of product innovation, adding more in features to differentiate further as you are moving up market?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, well, we have a deep pipeline of products that we continue to work on. you'll continue to see products released throughout the year. it's very important that we continue to drive and have success with the current as we have, because they're a building block of what we do next as everything has been as we've rolled it out. so everything's a building block for what's next.
so it's always important for us to roll products out and then get usage. i've been on these calls and listened to different competitors calls and i'll hear them announce a product and two years later they have 300 clients on it, where, we put this out in july to all clients and put it in all quotes and we're already at 10,000 and over a quarter of our clients and so that's very good and as you get version one done, you shift quickly and version two, version three, version four, you're never done developing products and so we're continuing to enhance the products we have to have greater usage on them, and that leads to other products which will continue to roll out through this year.
siti panigrahi -- mizuho securities -- analyst
that's great. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of bryan bergin with cowen. your line is open.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi guys. good afternoon. thank you. first one here on just the client employment base.
can you kind of comment on how client pays for control progressed during the quarter, and where do you estimate your client's employment base now stands relative to those pre-pandemic levels?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i wouldn't say that client employment had a big impact on us outside of the fact that it's stable. that's the main thing that we need, with the exception of massive unemployment, which we did see in the pandemic that happened very quickly. quarter to quarter, i can't say that employment trends have big impacts on us due to the growth nature of our business, other than to say, if they're not stable. and i believe that they've been stable for quite some time now.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and then, just on the salesforce, can you talk about the salesforce growth and your salesforce retention? how that has trended here over the last several quarters.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
substantially unchanged maybe a little better i would say. actually in the last year, we do know that our sales retention is a little better. holly faurot took over and we've had a little better sales retention, but that's also because we've got more reps moving into that executive rep position and we just have higher retention with those groups. and as they sell more quicker, they move in to that executive rep position even quicker.
and so, i do know that sales retention is higher than what it's been, but sales retention always remains a challenge because we have aggressive goals and there's a lot to sell as you go through -- as you go through these products, but i would say well, for sure it's improved some, but a lot of that just has to do with the people hitting executive rep even faster than what they've done in the past.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. makes sense. thanks.
operator
thank you, mr. bergin. the next question is from the line of alex zukin with wolfe research. your line is open.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question. so maybe just the first one, chad, given this is probably one of the largest beats, i think you've had in q1, and i think one of the largest raises you've had, a lot of the questions we get to kind of raimo's first question is around how to think about your business in terms of recession resiliency or recession exposure. you've been -- you've run this company for a long time through many economic cycles. and this one seems a little different given the difficult hiring environment that most of your customers are experiencing.
so just maybe comment on your, like, what's driving your incremental level of confidence in the face of some of these macro issues and a quick follow up.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think tight labor markets, they do a couple of things. one thing it does is you have to do more with less and one way to do more with less is have the right technology that you're deploying for everyone. if you're in a a business that move pipe around, not everybody drives the forklift, but everybody does use the app. so, with our system, you're able to really impact the entire company and to some extent, it gets more difficult to hire back-office people as well.
and so, we're able to make that impact. so i think from that perspective, it's helpful. it's always a good time to automate and become more efficient for any business and i think that when you run through markets like this, it forces people. in good times, you don't necessarily see what's going wrong and in times that get a little bit tougher, it forces you to make those changes within your business that creates efficiency through automation and that's where we come in.
so, it provided again that we're not having massive unemployment shifts. i believe we're in really good shape as we move throughout this year.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. and then, maybe just a bigger picture tech question, if you look at as you move up market, and as we move into an environment that's normalizing the concept of hybrid work, some of your competitors have native or have acquired native capabilities for doing kind of global payroll. how important is that as particularly as you move up market, as companies start hiring in various geographies and even on a global basis, how do you think about, i think you partnered that for that technology today, but what's the longer-term plan to offer that type of functionality natively?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, everything has its time and place and there's certain things that you're able to provide for a customer ahead of some others even, but everything has its time and place and, i would say everything is important, not everything's urgent. so we continue to review those things that make sense for us. again, we don't preclude our clients that have international employees from using third party. i would even go to say that using one system for all your us and even putting your expats and other international employees into that system and using a third party for payroll because you're in germany.
i can honestly say that even in that environment, we're a better fit than the eight-legged octopus with no head they would use otherwise. all that said, everything does have its time and place for what we develop and win and we continue to be ambitious with being the largest in our industry and that takes some time and i believe that we've got a lot of strong momentum and we're heading the right way on that.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. well, keep doing good work again.
operator
thank you, mr. zukin. the next question is from the line of robert simmons with d.a. davidson.
your line is open.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. some of your competitors that are your biggest sources of wins, you've talked about retention rates holding up better than expected. so i'm wondering, what do you see in terms of the source of your new clients and also just the general switching environment?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we're not seeing any changes to our how it's impacting us. our competitors have been talking about increasing retention on and off for the last 24 years that i've been doing this. so, we're focused on taking market share. again, we only have 5% of the tam right now.
so we remain focused on that. and so, yes, i don't really see what they're doing to -- i can't point to changes that are being made that would improve retention rates for someone else in our industry. but i do know the things that we're doing and we're having a lot of success bringing businesses over still today as evident by what we just reported in the first quarter and what we expect into next quarter and for the year.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. and then, on capital allocation now that the company's business model has been asset tested and you're throwing off consistently good cash flow. have you given much thought to paying out a dividend?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and it's one to seven every board meeting, or one to six, every board meeting.
operator
thank you, mr. simmons. the next question is from bhavin shah with deutsche bank. your line is open.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question and echo my congrats on the strong year to start of the year. just, first on the success, you're seeing and probably the 1k employee level, what's driving that and how much of that is maybe attributed to product improvements versus sales execution and then are there any specific verticals or geos you're seeing stronger success here?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i think really what's driving that is, it becomes a necessity at some level. again, even with tight labor markets or even without, you're having to do more and more, whether it's a tight labor market or not, there's all these new laws, regulation, everything that continues to come out, whether you're in a city, state or what have you. and so, businesses can only do so much. so i think anytime you're able to put something in the employee's hands, that's much easier for them to use and saves, the back end a lot of time and eliminates or at least eliminates a lot of exposure and can decrease a lot of the liability that remains.
that becomes an important thing to do and so i also think more and more employees are becoming -- they expect good technology. our latest campaign talks about the wrong tool. employees are going to work. they expect the right tools to do their job and more and more tech technology that allows them to manage their data is considered to be the right tool for that and so larger and larger businesses are almost in a have to scenario at a certain level and i think that we're seeing a lot of that.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. that's helpful and just a quick follow up, just with the change in ceo to justin from josh, anything changing in terms of structure or strategy that justin might look to employ?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no, actually justin ran or implement -- has been running our implementation side ahead of that for four years that he's been doing. he's been very focused on usage. he works very closely with holly. john had done a great job.
i talked to john yesterday. we continue on. i just did want to say this one point, because i know we've had different question about this or what have you. and i only -- it's only one time that i'll -- normally we give a retention number at the end of the year and i'll look forward to giving that at the end of this year.
so it's not a comment that i'm gonna make on an ongoing basis every quarter. but with that said, this one time, i will share with you that our current re number when compared with the same period last year's either equal to or improved. so again, all i can say is john did a great job while he was here and justin's well prepared and has been working very closely with holly and the rest of us this entire time. so, we're very excited about to what he brings to the table.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for doing my questions.
operator
thank you, mr. shah. the next question is from the line of daniel jester withi bmo capital. your line is open.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. maybe just to circle back on beti, have you said on average how long it takes a conversion to go from signing to go live.
and i asked because given your comments that this is the fastest selling module since aca, do you have better visibility when you're giving your second quarter guidance today because this big backlog relative to a typical second quarter?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no, but we have great, i wouldn't say we have better visibility, but we've always had great visibility. we've been guiding in a $2 million range since we ipo in 2014 with $107 million. so we've always had great visibility. in regards to betty again, it's a nominal fee for us and answer to your question from a conversion, it doesn't impact the conversion on a new client.
where you would see a impact would be on current clients that are converting over and it's kind of a mixed bag on how long that conversion might take them, because of the data sets that have to be loaded into beti that might exist outside of our system, such as they're doing commissions and the way they calculate commissions is in a completely different system than paycom and they're fed in. when those commissions are fed in and at what time period they're fed in and how they're fed in matters and that's how we walk through a process with them. but that would be part of their conversion that currently they're already data feeding it in toward the end and we move that toward the beginning based on what employees they're paid. that's one point, there are many others, but it just depends on what's going on with that client as to what the conversion would be into beti.
it doesn't take a long time necessarily if you have a motivated client ready to go, but there is some things that have to be done on the client's end to prepare them to make that conversion. of course, once they do now, let's, set it and forget it and the employees work the system from there.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. the next question is from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse. your line is open.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks so much. and i wonder if you could just follow up on that improvement retention, just help us understand what's driving that? is that kind of the increased module adoption? just any thoughts around that would be helpful.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so what i said it was either equal to or greater than, and then what's been driving our retention for the last three, four years has been usage of the product and clients actually getting the return on investment out of the product as more and more employees continue to have a direct interface with the database and skip the middle person on it and that's really what's driving that usage.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and then, on the client success upmarket, is that kind of primarily organic or is that existing clients moving up like is you're able to quantify how much is existing clients versus new clients that you're winning out in the marketplace above that 1,000 mark?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, what i'm talking about some new clients. i'm sure we've had some current clients that have gone from 878 employees to 1,012, but that's not the group that i'm talking about. when i'm talking about, we've had success onboarding clients above 1,000 and much larger than a 1,000 employees, as well as we continue to go up market. of course we've always had success in that market.
we're just continuing to have more and more of it because we've gone even further up and we've got more people in the field now.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. mcveigh. the next question is from arvind ramnani with piper sandler. your line is open.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to ask about the competitive environment. you've certainly been an innovation engine. you had the direct change a couple of years back and now you have beti.
are you seeing any of your competitors, whether it is the kind of the larger ones or more of the cloud players or even some of private companies, essentially be fast followers or sort of come up with innovation that's sort of keeping up at night?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, not keeping me up at night, but i will say that, i don't know anybody that beat us on to the internet and now everybody is. i don't know that being first is something is enough, is ever enough. you have to continue to innovate something. we've always been in a very competitive industry; i think competitions really what drives innovation.
if we didn't have strong competitors, there'd be no reason for us to come up with new innovative ways to drive stronger return on investment, but we are. we do have a strong competition out there throughout the market. i believe we have the better model and i believe if somebody wants to do less work, they should implement our model and i think that our competitors have a long way to catch up to that and i do think as you look into the future, i think that employees doing their own payroll and employees making all changes into the database through the direct data exchange, the way the direct data exchange measures, i think that's gonna be just an established expectation for any employee going to work. and so, i think that's really a change you're starting to see happen is what do employees expect to use when they go to work? and i think that's shifting, i think up to now, employees expected to go to work and use the eight-legged octopus with no head, which is what i like to call multiple systems cobbled together with multiple passwords, whatever emails and everything else.
i think there's an expectation starting to change on the employee side of how much work they actually want to have to do to manage those types of systems. and so, i believe we're at the forefront of making those changes. i think we're putting out a lot of proof sources of success as we've gone through that. and i would expect only more of the same.
can a competitor do what we're doing? yeah. i think anybody can do anything. you've had people build space shuttles over a two-year period of time. so can someone do this? yeah.
but i do think, you have to be intentful for how you do it and you've got to have that expectation. and i believe we're the ones leading. i know we're the ones leading that and like i'd said with all my calls earlier in this year, we're really set up this year to do a lot of good things and we're already seeing those things happen. so a lot of success right now.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. thanks for that.
operator
you, mr. ramnani. there are no additional questions waiting at this time. so i will pass offer over to chad richison for any closing remarks.

good afternoon. thank you for attending today's paycom software second quarter 2022 quarterly results conference call. my name is bethany, and i will be your moderator for today's call. all lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for "," at the end.
[operator instructions] i would now like to pass the conference over to our host, james samford, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
james samford -- head of investor relations
thank you, and welcome to paycom's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. certain statements made on this call that are not historical facts, including those related to our future plans, objectives, and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. while we believe any forward-looking statements made on this call are reasonable, actual results may differ materially, because the statements are based on our current expectations and subject to risks and uncertainties.
these risks and uncertainties are discussed in our filings with the sec, including our most recent annual report on form 10-k. you should refer to and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking information. any forward-looking statement made speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. also, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures, including adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and certain adjusted expenses.
we use these non-gaap financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. a reconciliation schedule showing gaap versus non-gaap results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. i will now turn the call over to chad richison, paycom's president and chief executive officer. chad? 
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, james, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. we had another very strong quarter. i'll spend a few minutes on the highlights and then turn it over to craig to review our financials and our guidance, and then we'll take questions. our second quarter 2022 revenue of approximately $317 million came in very strong, up 31% year over year with continued strength in recurring revenue from new business sales.
we continue to see strong demand for self-service payroll and automation of human capital management as more companies and their employees embrace innovative solutions like beti. we've been leading the employee usage initiative for years and our efforts are paying off. when data interactions on our platform are performed by employees, our clients realize the roi that self-service promises. at the core of our employee usage strategy is beti, which, we believe, is how businesses and their employees win in payroll.
if any business is doing the employees' payroll for them, that business is doing both itself and its employees a disservice. the only way a company wins at payroll is by having the employees do it themselves. it makes no sense in the year 2022 for any company to continue to transfer data inefficiently through multiple systems or manual archaic processes. beti is the future of payroll, and already, over 13,000 clients, or nearly 40% of our client base have embraced beti.
that's great progress, but as i've said, i expect all clients will eventually deploy beti in order to finally experience the correct way to do payroll. we are reinforcing this message through our marketing efforts. our recently launched new ad campaign calls on businesses and their employees to eliminate unnecessary activities, and the early feedback has been very positive. overall, our marketing plan continues to deliver strong demo leads and brand recognition across the target market range.
in particular, we continue to see strong leads from larger clients, which is driving average revenue per client higher, and an important contributor to our strong growth. on the sales front, our 54 outside sales team continue to perform well driving deeper penetration and market share gains into our target geographies. while we estimate we have roughly half of the country covered geographically, we only have approximately 5% of a very large and growing tam. we have a long runway for rapid growth for many years to come.
to sum up, we finished the first half of 2022 with very strong financial results. with our expectation for the second half of the year, 2022 has become a year of growth acceleration and margin expansion. our differentiated product strategy focused on employee usage and self-service payroll is resonating with prospects, and we are onboarding new clients at a very strong pace. i want to thank our employees for making this quarter another milestone growth quarter.
with that, i'll turn the call over to craig for a review of our financials and guidance, craig?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
thanks, chad. before i review our second quarter and our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2022, i would like to remind everyone that my comments relating to certain financial measures will be on a non-gaap basis. second quarter 2022 results were excellent, with total revenues of $316.9 million representing growth of 31% over the comparable prior-year period. in q2, we had very strong recurring revenue growth, predominantly from new client additions over the past year.
our revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for easy-to-use employee-focused solutions and our success in attracting new business wins. within total revenues, recurring revenue was $311.5 million for the second quarter, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 31% from the comparable prior-year period. total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $268.2 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.6% and we are on target to achieve strong full-year adjusted gross margin of approximately 85%. adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2022 was $82.7 million or 26.1% of revenues, compared to 26.6% of revenues in the prior-year period.
we continue to see strong return on investment from our advertising spin and plan to continue to invest aggressively in marketing and advertising through the remainder of 2022. adjusted r&d expense was $33.9 million in the second quarter of 2022 or 10.7% of total revenues. adjusted total r&d costs, including the capitalized portion, were $48.1 million in the second quarter, compared to $38 million in the prior-year period. we will continue to invest in innovation in our world-class products.
adjusted ebitda was $119.6 million in the second quarter of 2022 or 37.7% of total revenues, compared to $87 million in the prior year or 35.9% of total revenues. our gaap net income for the second quarter was $57.4 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, versus $52.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share in the prior-year period based on approximately 58 million shares. non-gaap net income for the second quarter of 2022 was $73 million or $1.26 per diluted share, versus $56.5 million or $0.97 per diluted share in the prior-year period. for 2022, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be approximately 27% on a gaap basis.
turning to the balance sheet. we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $279 million and total debt of $29 million. the average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2 billion in the second quarter of 2022. we recently increased our liquidity through an expanded revolving line of credit of $650 million and a delayed draw term loan that allows us to borrow up to an additional $750 million as needed.
potential uses of proceeds include, but are not limited to, general corporate purposes, capital expenditures, and stock buybacks. during the second quarter of 2022, we took advantage of a dislocation in the stock market and repurchased approximately 360,000 shares for a total of roughly $100 million. through june 30, 2022, paycom has repurchased nearly 4.65 million shares since 2016, for total of nearly 588 million, and we currently have 550 million remaining in our buyback program. now, let me turn to guidance.
we are raising our full-year 2022 guidance as a result of very strong second quarter financial performance and the continued strength of demand trends. we now expect revenue in the range of $1.354 billion to $1.356 billion or 28% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of $546 million to $548 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 40% at the midpoint of the range. for the third quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $327 million to $329 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range.
we expect adjusted ebitda for the third quarter in the range of $117 million to $119 million representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 36% at the midpoint of the range. with only 5% share of a growing tam, we have a long runway for continued high-margin revenue growth for years to come. our differentiated solutions and go-to-market strategy, particularly with beti are working well and driving new client growth and higher revenue per client. combining our raised 2022 guidance for revenue growth with adjusted ebitda margin guidance implies we are well on our way to deliver a material improvement over the rule of 65 we achieved in 2021.
with that, we will open the line for questions. operator?
 :
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of raimo lenschow with barclays. please go ahead.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. congratulations from my end. two quick questions. chad, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? obviously, macro is a big question for everyone on -- everyone's mind.
employment data are still very, very strong. but like anything that you're seeing out there in terms of end demand changes or a different behavior from customers? it's my first question. my second question is craig for you. obviously, we have quite a bit of rate changes over the last quarter.
can you just remind us how that fits into your numbers going forward? thank you and congrats again.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
you bet. thank you, raimo. i'll take the first. now we really aren't seeing much of a change from what we've seen in the past.
i mean, i will say that i believe that it's not as difficult maybe to hire people as it was six months ago, but it's still very much an employee's market. and i would say we're nowhere back -- in no way back to where we were in 2019, where it was more of an equally yoked employer-employee market. so, you know, there's still a lot of jobs out there unfilled, and it's still a very -- we're still all in at somewhat of a fight for talent.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
raimo, on the interest rate question, for every 25 basis points that interest -- the fed funds rate goes up, we get about $5 million of annualized interest income, but it's typically layered in. so, we saw one in may, and then june and july, we saw some. so, those will layer in some in third quarter, and then some in fourth quarter as well.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
ok, perfect. thank you. congrats again.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of samad samana with jefferies. please go ahead.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, and it's great to see the strong results. maybe first one, chad, just in terms of deal cycles are you seeing a similar closed rates or similar lengths in terms of the typical deal cycle? are you seeing any changes in terms of the level of approval that needs to go to? what are you seeing as far as actually closing deals goes?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. no changes there from what we've been seeing. as far as the timeline and in our close percentages, i would say if anything, they're going up, we're definitely getting more interest in the first calls that we have and being able to move those into second calls. so, we're having more success with that.
but all in all, our close ratios remain very strong and very similar to what they've been in the past.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and maybe just on the newer sales offices. i know it's -- we're still early in, in terms of the ramp, but where are we on the staffing of those and maybe the productivity compared to maybe prior new office openings for comparison?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i would say the staffing is going to be similar. they're more productive today. today's new reps are more productive than what yesteryears reps would have been. but as far as the number of reps that's very similar.
the progression to maturity of any one of our new offices is going to start off with three or so reps. and then we'll continue to add reps over the course of a two-year period. of course, at some point, they're fully staffed with eight and they all have both pipelines and backlogs. and so, after two years, those cities carry the same quota as what we would have had in an existing city.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
ok, ok. great. thanks again for taking my questions, and great to see the good numbers.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brad reback with stifel. please go ahead.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks very much. chad, can you remind us historically what type of impact employment levels that your customers have has on your overall growth?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, next year will be our 25th year, and with the exception of the two months -- that the two beginning months of the pandemic, normal gyrations in unemployment haven't really impacted us. we've gone through multiple cycles. and now the pandemic is a little different because you had an overnight retreat of an employee base, which was a little bit different.
but i would say we're very solid in regards to unemployment. that said, i mean, if unemployment doubles overnight, it would be hard for me to believe it wouldn't have some impact on our current client base, but as we sit here today, unemployment numbers still remain reasonable with where they're at right now. i mean, you might even say they're still fairly low. and then you still have quite a bit of open jobs out there with over 10 million.
i mean, at some point, you have to start thinking, does everybody that wants a job already have one?
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks very much.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. reback. our next question comes from the line of mark marcon with baird. please go ahead.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
hey, chad and craig. let me add my congratulations. terrific results. wondering, can you talk a little bit about the strong leads that you're getting, particularly from a larger client? can you talk a little bit about what sort of size difference you're seeing? how big are some of the companies that are now coming into the pipeline? and to what -- how big is the average client now relative to say a year ago?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, it continues to go up because as you remember, it was about a year ago, maybe a little longer that we increased our range up to 10,000. and so, obviously, it's going to continue to go up a little bit. i wouldn't say that there's been a massive shift for us to go a whole lot higher than that right now. so, what i would say is there's been more within that range, not necessarily quadruple that range.
but we continue to engage well above our target range, and we're having a lot of success. a lot of the leads we're getting right now are still coming from employees of companies that have used us elsewhere, have that single easy-to-use experience, and are really wanting to have that same experience at the next company they went to. so, we're still having a lot of success and continuing to bring in strong demo leads through both that which i'll say is indirect, as well as through our advertising and marketing efforts, which are still yielding great results for us.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
that's great. and then, with regards to the float balances, what was the effective yield that you were able to generate off of last three months?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yeah. mark, we haven't disclosed what yield it is, but i mean, we're investing still fairly short-term. we have commercial papers from overnight money market as well. so, kind of a mix of that, and we're not chasing yield, but we're paying attention to it.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok. obviously, getting more and more promising. thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. marcon. our next question comes from the line of brian schwartz with oppenheimer. please go ahead.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. i'd like -- congratulations again on these terrific results. one for you, chad, one for craig.
chad, the commentary that on the deal closers -- closures you're saying higher asps. are you seeing similar trends in your lead flow also? and then the question i want to ask, craig, with the guidance you're retaining the same ebitda margin. but clearly, we know that inflationary factors have gotten worse here throughout the quarter. so, i'm just wondering, are you able to maintain that margin because of the efficiencies of the business that you're able to overcome? or is that -- are you holding back any sort of spend that maybe you had planned in the second half of the year? thanks.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, on the first, i mean, definitely, the leads are also coming in with larger clients, but also, we still continue to target -- to do targeted prospecting. that's always been our bread and butter. we're very -- we remain very focused on that.
that's more of our general pressure relentlessly applied strategy that we deploy through target marketing efforts, but there's no doubt that the leads continue to generate larger opportunities for us.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yeah. and in terms of the inflationary question, we've seen some pockets where we're seeing some higher inflationary areas, but overall, we're continuing to look for leverage throughout the model and really not holding back on any hires. just finding leverage throughout the model.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. schwartz. our next question comes from the line of ryan macdonald with needham. please go ahead.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, chad and craig. thanks for taking my questions. congrats on a great quarter. chad, in your prepared remarks, you talked about this dynamic where you've got nearly half the country covered geographically, but only 5% market penetration currently.
as you think about continuing to expand paycom's portion of the pie, where do you see the most value in terms of incremental investment? whether it be continuing that geographic expansion in the back half of this year with new offices, incremental advertising spend to build the brand awareness, or perhaps continued investment and expansion inside sales teams? thanks.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, number one is us continuing to get better at the outside sales process. we have more opportunity out there for us within the markets that we're in. we only have 5% of the market out there. so, i would say number one for us is continuing to get better at selling our value proposition out there to prospects.
we have continued to be pulled up market because of the strong value proposition that we are delivering all the way down to the employee level. and so, we are continuing to get more leads that tend to be a little bit larger than what we've had in the past. and i would say, in aggregate, there's more of them as well. and so, really, that's been our focus is getting better at executing and being able to sell that.
now that alone isn't our only strategy. we're getting better at sourcing leads. we're getting better at retargeting them. and then, of course, we continue to look at expanding geographically when it makes sense to do so.
and when we have the staffing and leadership bench to be able to do them.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you. maybe just as a follow-up, when you look at sort of the yield that you're looking to get off of the digital marketing investments in the advertising, can you talk about what the timeframe that you're looking for in terms of that return on investment, and whether if we do see a slowdown in the back half years that could materially impact larger opportunities near term? thanks.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, we measure it weekly. so, i mean, we know our return weekly. i mean, these aren't -- i mean, these are very strong demo leads.
these are clients who are asking for a product demonstration. and we have very good close ratios, once we engage with those clients. and so, it would be more of that for us. as far as the slowdown in the back half of the year in this, i really don't -- i really can't see that.
i mean, we have a very strong value proposition which is resonating very well out there, both with employees, as well as with their employer. and to some extent, the world is conspiring to help us here in just the way different individuals now deploy and utilize technology. and so, we're at the forefront of that. i've said many times, i mean, we might be early, but we're not wrong.
and so, we're going to continue to drive our employee usage strategy throughout the -- both the last half of this year, as well as next year.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks for the color, chad. congrats again.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. macdonald. our next question comes from the line of siti panigrahi with mizuho. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hi. this is alex on behalf of siti panigrahi. i had a question about beti. you talked about 10,000 clients uptaking beti in q1 and this quarter.
you have about 13,000 clients. what drove the 3k net adds and what sort of per employee per month uptake be part of beti? and what kind of growth upside do you see from beti adoption? like can you answer that? and i have a follow-up.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, i mean, we continue -- it continues to grow every quarter for two reasons. one, we continue to upsell beti into our current client base is it's a better way for them to do payroll. it really is the only way someone should be doing payroll today.
but as a reminder, since july of last year, every new client that's come on our system has deployed beti, and so that's a part of our product offering since july of last year to every new client. and so, you got a mixture of both of those. and then as far as the opportunity that upselling into our client base has with beti, it is incremental increase in revenue opportunity for us. so, it's accretive to that profile.
but in every year, we have different focuses on modules. and this year, and i'm sure in the next year we are going to continue to be focusing on upselling beti to 100% of our client base. and again, it'll be positive. but really what it does is it drives greater usage.
greater usage reduces the amount of service we have to provide to any one client. because of course, if their payrolls are correct, we're not having to go through the process of doing corrections and corrections can produce service calls. and so, we believe that with greater usage of beti done the right way, it changes the employee experience, it changes their expectation of what they would expect that any employer that leads to more leads for us that leads to greater satisfaction for clients, which ultimately also leads to less service on our end as clients experience the self-service opportunities.
unknown speaker -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. thank you. and my follow-up was adp continues to see better retention rates, and how does your new bookings on trends -- have trended so far, and are expecting any slowdown in new business bookings from a potential macro slowdown in the second half? and is adp still a major source of new business for you?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. adp has been experiencing better retention rates since i started the company in 1998. i'm surprised their retention is not already at 200%. but it doesn't impact our ability to sell and our ability to sell and take business.
as again, our product is more comprehensive. it's easier to use. and it's just the way that employees should be interacting with their own data.
unknown speaker -- mizuho securities -- analyst
all right. thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of bryan bergin with cowen. please go ahead.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, guys. good afternoon, and thank you. wanted to start here kind of with the [inaudible] recession question. so, just how are you thinking about the sustainability of growth trajectory in the event, the u.s does fall into a bit of a more challenged macro environment? and it's just as you think about the growth composition, what are the key swing factors that may change versus what you think remains unchanged?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, first of all, just talking about the macro, i mean, the only thing that i could really see that would have a significant impact on us would be a very quick and massive shift in unemployment. that doesn't happen incrementally over time but happens somewhat right away. i would think that that would have some level of impact on us. we're a growth company, we're focused on growing.
we're focused on automating the back office and we're focused on making it easier for employees to actually do their job. and so, that's always going to be popular regardless what's going on out there. and oftentimes when people have to do something with less that means they get the opportunity to automate more. and so, i feel really good about our ability to weather, what we would expect to happen.
but again, it would take something -- some massive change in the unemployment rate to really impact us. and i'm not saying we couldn't sell through that. but you kind of saw what happened during the pandemic and what happened there. and i would say, that's probably much larger type of unemployment hit than what we would expect necessarily in a recession, definitely something that would have happened a lot quicker, and all at once.
but we'll just have to see, but say that i'm not really -- i can't really see a whole lot that would prevent us from continuing to grow at a strong rate. and again, i mean, this next year is our 25 years in business. so, we've been through different recessions and been on different cusps of recessions in the past.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok, thanks. appreciate that. and then just a follow-up on free cash flow. can you comment on just free cash flow margin for this year? how you expect those to land for 2022? and just any thoughts on longer-term forward free cash flow conversion trends?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
one thing this quarter that impacted our free cash flow, some was just the tax rate. we saw last year, we -- second quarter, we had some benefit from a discrete item to the quarters or related to some stock vestings. and this year, we didn't have quite the same level. so, i would think that what we're seeing this year would be more indicative with -- as we kind of roll out throughout the rest of the 2022 and then into 2023.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks.
operator
thank you. next question comes from the line of jason celino with keybanc capital markets. please go ahead.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. really strong results here, especially given the macro backdrop, chad, how would you describe or attribute the upside that we've seen just from industry resilience versus company-specific drivers and execution?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, much of our upside in any one quarter is dependent upon when a deal starts. we always believe going into quarter we have a really good -- we have really good visibility into when a deal is going to start. but when it starts matters.
when you're talking about overperformance within a quarter because of course, if a deal starts at the beginning of a quarter, we get 100% revenue billing for that deal, that quarter, that starts at the end of the quarter, we could only get a third of the billing or maybe 15% of it. of course, in subsequent quarters, we get 100%. so, we have pretty good visibility, i'd say we have great visibility going -- guiding quarter to quarter. but as far as the outperformance it's always being delivered by new client wins.
and then on top of that, you really have to look at when those deals are starting for us.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok, perfect. and then, craig, again, 31% growth in the quarter, very impressive. i think the guidance assumes for the second half some modest deceleration. curious on what kind of macro assumptions you've built into this.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes, i mean, as we were coming into guidance, i mean, at this point, we haven't seen anything. you're starting to hear about it, but we haven't baked any sort of a macro impact to our guidance for the back half of the year. really, we're guiding very similar to how we've done in the past. we guide to what we see.
as we get closer to fourth quarter, we can see a little more on the fourth quarter. and that's the quarter that has the bonuses, the off-cycle runs. so, as we're sitting here in by the beginning of q3, we're guiding very similar to how we have in the past.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks for the clarification, craig.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. celino. our next question comes from the line of arvind ramnani with piper sandler. please go ahead.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. so, clearly, good results. but i'm trying to dimension are you able to kind of separate how much of your growth was driven by expansion at existing clients versus new client logos?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. is that the question? i'm just making sure. ok, if that's a question, the overwhelming majority of our revenue and our revenue that we onboard, our new business revenue comes from new client wins. we do continue to sell into our client base.
i've never said land and expand. we land large, but there are opportunities for us to expand into that client base. and we do that, as we believe that clients should be able to use all the products that we have the correct way to drive the employee experience. go ahead, craig.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
one thing i would say, arvind, is our outside clients, our outside sales team, those 54 sales teams are only bringing on new logos. so, that entire group is bringing on new logos. so, the mix has been very similar to what it has been in the past, with the exception that aca came about where we did -- that was such an immediate upsell. but the last few years have been very similar to the mix of new logos to upsell, and it's still -- the overwhelming majority is going to be new logos.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. and just quick follow-up here. have you seen any sort of layoffs or turnover with existing clients that has been a headwind on revenue? or has it been sort of roughly equal? and then the second thing is, if you can comment on pricing, if you've been able to push sort of pricing increases through?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
now, on the headwind -- and then as far as our pricing, we've talked about that in the past where we did our first pricing adjustment, i believe it was in 2019. and we did a small pricing adjustment to a small subset of our client base. we did talk about as we move forward, that talking about our pricing model isn't something that we're going to do just for competitive reasons, but i've also always said that as we make our product more valuable, it only makes sense that we get to share in the value we create through pricing adjustments over time.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alex zukin with wolfe research. please go ahead.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on an all-out great quarter. i guess -- so a lot of these questions have been asked, but i'll try to maybe ask it a different way. it sounds like you're having incremental success selling more modules at the same time, because of beti.
you're still seeing a tremendous amount of new business. you don't really see a recessionary headwind impacting employment rate. so, i guess the main question i would have is, if you look at you're the constitution of your new bookings and you look at that from kind of increased value versus increased units, how does that compare to prior periods? meaning are you getting more of your growth from the fact that your deals are larger incrementally?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i would say comparison very similar to every past year with the exception of when we added on to our inside sales business, which are for more of your emerging businesses, those companies that have less than 50 employees, that group represents approximately 5% of our overall revenue. so, that's one way to think about it is companies that have less than 50 employees represent 5% of our overall revenue. and so, what has been growing is the average size of our other clients. and so, that hasn't been different in any year from year to year.
it continues to go up. and again, part of that diluting factor, if you just take the unit count divided by total number of employees in our system, part of that diluting factor is going to be all of those emerging below 50 employee companies that we added when we added this inside sales group and expanded it in the year 2020.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
understood. and i guess increasingly, as you think about incremental modules, when you think about that incremental potential over the next coming couple of years, do you see it every year if everybody is buying all of the modules up front? do you see that kind of momentum continuing in the future?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we've always said that people buy half at least half or greater of the modules that we have at the time that we sell them. of course, we've been in business some time. so, some of the modules you have to go back and sell into the current client base because we didn't have them at the time we actually sold them in the beginning.
i would say it's a little bit more than half now as we go into new sales just because of what's required for a client to have in order for an employee to do their own payroll. there's several modules that they have to have. i'm not going to say it's a 100% because that wouldn't be accurate. but i would say it's more than what they needed in the past.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. and just a clarifying question. with respect to the guidance, you did -- it looks like a bigger pass-through than usual, bigger raise than usual. so, i think it'd be helpful just to understand, out of the incremental raise, how much of that is coming from the rate hikes coming from the model?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, as we've said, i mean, for us, it's really the new business sales are really going to be what's driving quarter to quarter, and then it does matter when they start. that's not to say that we're not going to have some positive impact from the rate increases, you had the 50 basis points in may, which is in somewhat in the middle of the quarter, not necessarily maybe a little sort of that and yet another 75 basis toward the end of july. we've talked about how those layered in -- sorry, at the end of june. we've talked about how those layer in, and then you also had some in july.
so, we've talked about how those layer in, and so we would absolutely expect that to have a positive impact on both the next quarter and subsequent quarters. but still first price for us, which has been the growth in new logos.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. thank you, guys. congrats on a great quarter.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of bhavin shah with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question and i echo my congrats on the strong results. chad, already you mentioned a lot of the benefits of beti. but just as it relates to retention, can you talk about what you've seen maybe from those customers that utilize beti to the ones that maybe don't yet? are you seeing any improvement there? or is it still too early?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean, definitely, clients that use beti and deploy beti are going to have much stronger usage patterns than someone that doesn't. and once they've deployed beti, it kind of changes the game and the expectation of what an employee expects to be able to use in the business. and so, absolutely that impacts our retention. as i've been saying, usage is really what drives retention.
and i believe that so for any software out there, but definitely ours.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
helpful there. and craig just a quick follow-up or clarification on float. i just want to make sure that i understand it. so, is it safe to assume that your guidance takes into account the layered impact of all the rate increases up until july and assumes no further rate increases? is that accurate?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yeah. that would be accurate. it would not include any future rate increases and then layering in what we know up through july.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
perfect. thanks again for taking my questions.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. next question comes from the line of daniel jester with bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. just one on margin. another great quarter of year-over-year margin expansion on the ebitda line.
but you did have some compression on gross margin. i know that craig talked about the full-year expectation for about 85% gross margin. i would think with float income going higher, you'd have a benefit there just like on the ebitda line. so, can you remind us about the investments, potentially, you're making that could impact that gross margin trends? thank you.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
sure. so, with the one thing on the gross margin line, as we continue to hire and hire in front of the revenue growth, that's going to have an impact on that gross margin and then you'll eventually grow into that. you have to hire and train ahead of capturing that revenue. so, we're continuing to hire aggressively.
and then also, we brought on the new grapevine facility and data center that tier 4 data center. so, you're starting to see some of the depreciation hitting the different areas of our income statement. so, that had a small -- had an impact as well on that -- on the gross margin, but we're still expecting to be at least at that 85% level for the full year.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of kevin mcveigh with credit suisse. please go ahead.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks so much. hey, is there any way to frame what the revenue impact is, if you were -- if beti was adopted 100% across your existing client base? so said another way, what's the revenue impact as beti becomes 100% utilized across the client base?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, beti is one of 29 modules that we have. so, i mean, it would definitely have an impact. again, where we're making the impacts new business logo ads, and beti gives us the opportunity to do that. i think beti will have some impact for sure because we're charging for it.
but i think where you'll see a better impact of beti once we have every single client on, i mean, i think it's going to impact retention. as we've seen, usage has been impacting retention of our product. we were at 91%. i think it was three or four years ago, and it's continued to go up.
and so, that's really been driven by usage. and beti generate stronger usage of our products. so, if history is an indicator, we would expect that once all of our clients have deployed it, and are actually generating that roi, it's going to have an impact on our retention. and then also, all those clients' employees will be used to beti and as they go to other companies in the market, as a normal flow of an employee lifecycle goes from one company to the next, we believe that generates even greater leads for us, as we've been seeing now.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
very helpful. and then can you just remind us the philosophy on float in terms of to the market as opposed to maybe reinvestment in the business?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, we'll have to see on that. i think a lot of it depends on the timing of when we might make some of those investments. you look at -- and if it's something that we can invest in, let's say, advertising or r&d, that's going to generate additional revenues.
and that's something we're definitely going to look at. but we're also a company that doesn't like [inaudible]. so, we're not going to spend it just to spend it. we will to the extent that we don't see an opportunity, we'll let that fall to the bottom line.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of robert simmons with d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. i was wondering, are there parts of the market that are responding particularly well to beti, certain industries that are the most apt to want it and to embrace it?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no, i would say it's been industry agnostic. i mean, you're talking about beti is -- the benefit of beti is to the employee. so, it's really -- it doesn't really matter what industry that is anywhere an employee really, really needs for their check to be accurate going into the weekend, beti is there for them. and within every industry, you will have those types of employees.
and then again, every business that would like to automate and reduce, actually reduce their exposure and a lot of their liability around the payroll process, deploying beti is the right way to do that. and so, now, i can't say that there's any industry that beti would work stronger than the other.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. great. and then can you talk about the ukg situation? i mean, how much benefit have you been able to see from that so far this year, in terms of both bookings to date, and also to pipeline for the second half of the year?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i think that produces an opportunity for everyone. i also think it makes everyone take pause, and everybody's got to make sure they have the right plan for their clients as we're all in this same world together, and -- so i think as you see those kinds of things, i know that we looked at everything ourselves. i'm sure many competitors looked at what everyone can do differently to make sure that employees always get paid.
yeah. i mean, absolutely, it produces opportunity. but i don't -- i wouldn't say it's the hack that produces the opportunity. i mean, it's the fact that someone has an opportunity to have a very good experience in a single system for their employees.
so, they have an opportunity to have multiple systems where their employees are trying to find their passwords. and i would say that's what drives our wins more so than what's happened to them in the past.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. great. thank you very much.

thanks, james, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. we delivered another very strong quarter with a focus on high-quality revenue growth that produces world-class margins. i'll spend a few minutes on the highlights and then turn it over to craig to review our financials and our guidance, and then we'll take questions. our third quarter 2022 revenue of approximately $334 million came in very strong, up 30% year over year, with rapid recurring revenue growth driven by new business sales.
demand for self-service solutions that enable employees to interact directly with their data continues to be strong, and feedback on self-service payroll remains very positive. at the center of our automation strategy is beti, which is how businesses and their employees win in payroll. beti is the future of payroll, and already nearly half of our clients have embraced self-service payroll. our go-to-market strategy includes 54 outside sales teams that focus on penetrating their respective territories.
and we augment their sales efforts with marketing and advertising that drive lead volumes, brand awareness and to call to action. our efforts are producing strong demo leads and our new brand campaign is driving strong recognition across our target market range. we are also seeing a surge in organic lead referrals coming directly from employees. as more employees experienced beti and paycom's comprehensive employee self-service solutions, many are seeking to bring us into the current workplace.
just like in the consumer world, employees don't want to go backwards in technology. and with paycom, employees get the best hcm user experience and the most control over their data interactions. employee users are becoming paycom advocates. and when they get promoted in their current position or move on to a new organization, they are becoming strong influencers.
we have a long runway to go, and our multifaceted go-to-market strategy should help deliver rapid new business growth for many years to come. to sum up, we are delivering high-quality profitable revenue growth. based on our strong financial results to date and expectations for the remainder of the year, achievement of our full year guidance for 30% revenue growth and 41% adjusted ebitda margin puts us back into the pre-pandemic rule of 70. our differentiated product strategy focused on employee experience and self-service payroll is producing outstanding fundamentals with accelerating revenue growth in 2022, expanding adjusted ebitda margins and strong cash flows.
i want to thank our employees for their focus and commitment to paycom. with that, i'll turn the call over to craig for a review of our financials and guidance. craig?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
thanks, chad. before i review our third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, i would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-gaap basis. third quarter 2022 results were very strong, with total revenues of $334.2 million, representing growth of 30% over the comparable prior year period. our revenue growth is being fueled by strong demand for our differentiated solution and strong new business wins.
within total revenues, recurring revenue was $328.2 million for the third quarter, representing 98% of total revenues and growing 31% from the comparable prior year period. total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $280.5 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 83.9%. our focus on high-quality revenue produces world-class margins, and we remain on target to achieve strong full year adjusted gross margins of approximately 85%. adjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2022 was $85.8 million or 25.7% of revenues compared to 25.9% of revenues in the prior year period.
adjusted r&d expense was $37.3 million in the third quarter of 2022 or 11.2% of total revenues. adjusted total r&d costs, including the capitalized portion, were $52 million in the third quarter, compared to $40.7 million in the prior year period. our investments in sales and marketing and innovation are fueling our market share gains, and we plan to continue to invest in these areas to drive our future growth. adjusted ebitda was $126 million in the third quarter of 2022 or 37.7% of total revenues compared to $89.7 million in the prior year or 35% of total revenues.
i am pleased with the 270 basis points of year over year adjusted ebitda margin expansion that we saw in the quarter, which reflects the strength of our business model and flow-through of high-margin revenue upside. gaap net income for the third quarter was $52.2 million or $0.90 per diluted share versus $30.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares. non-gaap net income for the third quarter of 2022 was $73.4 million or $1.27 per diluted share versus $53.6 million or $0.92 per diluted share in the prior year period. for 2022, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a gaap basis.
turning to the balance sheet. we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $317 million and total debt of $29 million. the average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.85 billion in the third quarter of 2022. now let me turn to guidance.
with our very strong third quarter and the strength of our recurring revenue model, we are raising our full year 2022 guidance. we now expect revenue in the range of $1.371 billion to $1.373 billion or 30% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of $560 million to $562 million, representing adjusted ebitda margin of 41% at the midpoint of the range and a 120 basis point expansion from the prior year. for the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $366 million to $368 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 29% at the midpoint of the range.
we expect adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter in the range of $144 million to $146 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of roughly 40% at the midpoint of the range. combining our 2022 guidance for revenue growth with adjusted ebitda margin, we are now expecting to exceed the rule of 70, which is at least five points greater than the rule of 65 we achieved in 2021. we have a long runway for continued high-margin revenue growth. our fundamentals continue to improve throughout 2022, and we have strong momentum heading into 2023.
with that, we will open the line for questions. operator?

[operator instructions] your first question is from the line of raimo lenschow with barclays. please proceed.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
hey, thank you and congrats on a great quarter in this kind of environment. chad, one question for you, then a follow-up for craig. in terms of what you're seeing in the market at the moment, like obviously, there's one company after the other that's kind of talked to that talk about like lean demands, things happening. you guys are spending out a little bit in terms of like not seeing anything.
can you just talk a little bit about like how that's possible in terms of like the -- is there a different nature of what's going on that people holding on to their employees for longer, so then you guys don't see it. is it kind of the offering? but it looks like it's more the [inaudible] space. so that's the first question. then for craig, any comments on the operating cash flow because that one number that came in lower than the model.
so i'm sure there's something going on there, would be great to hear. congrats again.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean i'll take the first one. and i would say, first, i mean, the hiring market is still a little tight, not like it was. i mean i would say there's been a little softening in hiring as far as it shifting maybe more into an employer's market.
i would still say that we're not there yet. i mean, for us, though, as far as moving deals around, i mean, moving deals forward, i mean, september and october were huge book sales months for us. and as a reminder, i mean, we only have 5% of the tam. i mean we reported 33,800 clients at the end of last year.
our two largest competitors have a combined 1.7 million clients. and we're out there making businesses more efficient by having their employees do the payrolls themselves. so we're not short on opportunity right now. we're making businesses more efficient, and i don't see why that would slow down for us as that's really within our control.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes. and i would say on the operating cash flow, raimo, a couple of things impacted this third quarter. and most of it was really just timing between quarters, but we had some additional tax payments here in the third quarter. typically, we get some benefits as it relates to discrete items on stock comp.
and that was -- so that caused our rate to be slightly higher, so we made some additional payments here in the third quarter. and then the rest is really more just expenses and the timing of those expenses and when they're paid. so nothing really to point out other than those two items.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
ok. thank you.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. winslow. the next question is from samad samana with jefferies. please proceed.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good evening. thanks for taking my questions. chad, maybe first one for you. if i think about the growth, staying above 30% even against normalized comps, it's clearly impressive.
and if i look at the fourth quarter guidance, it's actually a stronger seasonal uplift as your initial guidance for the fourth quarter than normal. so the plus 10%, if i go back and look last year, i think you said something closer to like plus 7%, plus 8%. i'm just curious if you can help us maybe think about what's driving the confidence in that kind of strong seasonal uptick in the december quarter? if there's anything you're seeing in terms of change in renewal timing? or is it just float revenue? just help us understand that.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean we've had a lot of strong starts as of late. and so those starts, when a deal starts in the quarter, that really does matter. the size of our beat for a quarter is really dictated by when a deal starts.
if we start that new business, that new client for us, if we start them at the beginning of the quarter, we receive 100% of the revenue billing for that client. if we start the deal at the end of the quarter, we might receive only 15% to 30% of the revenue billing for that client for that quarter. then of course, all subsequent quarters, we receive 100%. so we do have pretty good visibility as we go quarter-to-quarter.
and what would be driving the fourth quarter is, obviously, we benefited from some rate increases. we've talked about that as how those layer in. i mean as you've seen, those do start to layer in. but also just the strength of our new client conversions.
we're converting clients at a rapid pace. they're using the product right off the bat, which is helpful. and so we're having strong growth into the fourth quarter.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then maybe just a quick follow-up. we're getting close to lapping the new sales offices. just any update on how we should think about them? are they fully -- what you would consider to be fully productive? or is there still room for productivity gains there? and how does that maybe factoring into both what happened in the third quarter and then your forward outlook?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, with the offices that we've opened up last year, and i'm going to call it five, even though we opened up one late in the first quarter of 2021. and then i think we opened up four at the very beginning of 2022 or this year. i mean all offices, just as a reminder, it takes offices 24 months to reach full maturity, and that's having eight reps with the backlog and pipeline having been out in the field.
today, i mean, i would say our best one probably has four reps on quota right now, as we sit here today as they've been going through and selling. and so that will continue to increase throughout next year for them, and then they will become mature offices and have the exact same quota as all of our other offices in 2023 -- or sorry, at the end of -- or sorry, at the beginning of -- at the end of 2023 for one of them, and then at the beginning of 2024 for the other four.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. appreciate that. thanks again.
operator
thank you, mr. samana. the next question is from brad reback from stifel.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. chad, have you seen any noticeable change in hiring or retention at your customers?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no, i can't say that we've seen any changes. now obviously, we're seeing changes just from when we're out there hiring people ourselves. and i think to some extent, that mimics a little bit of what our clients would be doing. i would say it's not as extreme as what you were facing maybe even nine months ago as far as the additional bonuses people would look to pay or the recruiting bonuses people might have.
i think more and more companies are getting people back into the office at some level. i think there's less work from home and more hybrid, if not even more work at the office. so again, we're not seeing any slowdowns in our at bats or our lead generation. but i think a lot of that also has to do just with our size.
i mean we only have 5% of the market. most everyone is using a vendor. i mean the craziest thing someone can try to do is try to do payroll by themselves without using a business or a provider. so we're having success making businesses more efficient with a very differentiated go-to-market strategy that is very much resonating out there with both the workforce, as well as with those companies that we serve.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks very much.
operator
the next question is from the line of mark macron with baird. please proceed.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. let me add my congratulations on the strong quarter. craig, i was wondering if you could give us a feel for like what sort of rates you're able to get right now on the tax filing float and how that might look or what you're factoring in for the fourth quarter?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes. so mark, what we've talked about what each 25 basis points represents. we haven't disclosed the exact rate that we're achieving. those kind of layer in over time.
but for every 25 basis points, at some point, we should be getting close to $5 million on an annualized basis. but all of our investments are fairly short term. we're doing cds overnights and then also commercial paper. so those are the types of investments, as well as some two-year treasuries.
so those are really the investments we're seeing now. and then that's kind of where we're at, at this point.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
great. and then chad, you mentioned really strong bookings here in september and october. wondering, given the normal cadence, what does that make you feel like for the fourth quarter and the strength that you're seeing in terms of the pipeline, in terms of the key fall selling season?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean i would say i mentioned those months because they're the most recent. i mean i can go back to august, july, and i can go back as far as we want. we've just been having strong book sales.
i mean, for a long time, i mean even since the pandemic started, we're getting a lot of leads from just employees. i mean -- and we're getting leads from the largest companies in the world. i mean, 20 of their employees will hit our database in a one-month period of time. and so we're having strong leads.
we're able to turn those leads, some of them into -- to influencers as we go in there. but definitely, they become data points and information that we're able to gather as we go into clients. and we're finding that employees really like to use the product. once we convert a client over onto our system -- and again, all new clients have beti.
they're all using beti. but within the very first two payrolls, over 50% of their employees are already doing their own payroll. so that is a differentiated strategy. they're not doing that with any other company.
and as those employees either get promoted where they're at or move to other companies, they're bringing us into other businesses. and so we're having a lot of success with that. and i wouldn't expect that to slow down. i think if the labor market loosens up or even becomes tighter or what have you, it doesn't really change the value proposition of eliminating and reducing exposure and risk for the company as well as helping those employees so that they don't suffer the negative consequences associated with your pay not matching what you expected to be paid.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
it's perfect. thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question is from brian schwartz with oppenheimer. please proceed.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
yeah, hi. thanks for taking my questions this afternoon and congratulations on an excellent quarter. chad, in terms of deal sizes or maybe the cycles as the lead generations going through to your conversions, are you seeing any meaningful changes in those metrics?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no. deal sizes have continued to go up. so deal sizes every year, i mean, i can talk about how we continue to be pulled further and further upmarket. as far as the cycles, i wouldn't say there's been any big change to that.
and let's see the other part of your question. yes. i mean deal sizes are going up. and the cycles, no meaningful changes there.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
yes, you got them both. and then craig, one follow-up for you. the guidance for 4q for -- on the ebitda, on the margin, it's showing less improvement than what the business has done for the last two quarters. and i'm just wondering if there's any catch-up in spend or maybe you're increasing your advertising here in q4.
so i was just wondering if you have any color on that target. thanks.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
i would say kind of similar to how we've done in the past. we want to make sure we have the ability to spend as we see necessary as we're going into fourth quarter. and if we want to increase those ad spend, it gives us the ability to do that.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. schwartz. the next question is from joshua reilly with needham. please proceed.
joshua reilly -- needham and company -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. nice job on the quarter here. if you look at your r&d strategy, i think you have something like 2019 modules today.
is the focus going forward more on adding new additional paid modules? or is it more enhancing the current offerings? or just maybe an update there?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i would say it's both. our strategy, when it comes to both module creation and adoption, hasn't changed. sometimes, we create additional features and functionality within a product, and we do not charge for those features and functionality. ddx is an example of that.
manager on-the-go is an example of that, and i could name many others. and then sometimes, we create a product that has a different level of return on investment. and then we do charge for those products. and it's those products that we call modules, and we do have 29 of them.
so as we move forward, you'll continue to see a healthy mix of both as it makes sense for us.
joshua reilly -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then just to clarify. on the guidance for the fourth quarter, are you considering the 75 basis point rate increase that's likely to come out tomorrow in the current guidance? thanks.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean any rate increase in november and december will have very little impact on our fourth quarter. those layer in over time. so those would have a very small impact on our fourth quarter.
joshua reilly -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. reilly. our next question is from steve enders with citi. please proceed.
unknown speaker -- citi -- analyst
this is george on for steve. i want to ask about competitive landscape. have you noticed any changes in your running into deals, in particular, as you started to move up market?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
not really. i would just say we're running into some competitors. we've always had the same players, whether we were -- now i would say we would have different players if we're talking sub-100 employee company or sub-50 employee company. but when you're talking about the 2,000 plus, which we've always gone from 50 to 2,000 even at ipo we talked about since 2014.
so when you're talking about 2,000 employees or more, it's been the same players for a very, very long time. and so i wouldn't say that we're running into new players. i would say, because we're continuing to move up market, we're seeing some of the old faces a little more.
unknown speaker -- citi -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then you mentioned the brand marketing program in your prepared remarks. i'd love to hear a little more on kind of the successes you've seen there? and if there's any plans to expand that program? thank you.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and so i think what anybody -- when someone's looking at our new branding and marketing, there's really been a big shift. i mean, we've gone from single database, employee usage-driven strategies with the ddx, the direct data exchange, where employees are making all of the changes, which i will update within the paycom system. about 95% of all changes are made directly by the employee without any touch or duplicative effort by hr or payroll.
and so what you've noticed though now is our brand marketing is shifting toward employees doing their own payroll. and in fact, the consequence is suffered by the employees when they don't do their own payroll. it's funny we'll go into a business and we'll ask the payroll person as we're going through the analysis, hey, is your check ever wrong? and the payroll person is often, no, if my check looks wrong, i fix it before payroll. and so why not roll that out to all the employees because they'll do the same thing.
and so i would say before, we oftentimes might retreat to what we're comfortable with, with the app and the single database. today, we're staying in the lane, which is oftentimes uncomfortable of helping employees as well as hr and payroll individuals realize the advantages that can be realized when employees actually do their own payroll.
unknown speaker -- citi -- analyst
thank you for taking the questions.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of siti panigrahi with mizuho. please proceed.
alex kim -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hi. this is alex on behalf of siti panigrahi. i just wanted to ask how has the beti adoption been trending for this quarter? like what percent of beti is your current clients? and what do you expect beti revenue for fy '22? or how has beti performance done versus your initial expectations? and then i have a follow-up.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we're about 50% of all current clients are on beti. and again, that's every client that's onboarded or had been sold since last july. they may not have onboarded right at july, but every client sold since last july is using beti.
and the trend in beti is continuing to go up. i mean that's why we're getting so many leads from employees after they leave one company and go to another, nobody does good going backwards in technology. you take an app off somebody's phone and ask them to do it the old way, it becomes very difficult for them. and so -- and it's unnecessary.
and so beti usage continues to go up. i already did talk about or did make mention earlier of the fact that new clients within the first payroll or so, you've got 50% of their employees are already doing their own payroll. and that continues to increase as clients continue to get better at using the product. and so -- and it's our strategy.
i mean today, everything is about beti. i mean i tell our salespeople all the time. look, if you can't get someone to understand the benefits and value of beti to their organization as well as the positive impact on their employees, i don't have anything else for you to sell. i mean, because everything else comes with that being the case already.
and so it's not -- it's a strategy that we've been continuing to drive, and it's a strategy that really fits within the problems that are already inherent between employees having correct data and receiving correct pay from their employer.
alex kim -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. and i wanted to ask, with the rising inflation, have you been able to pass on price increases to your customers for your modules? and how does beti pricing compare to your other modules?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, beti pricing it's a nominal fee. i would not say that beti pricing compares in fee with our more substantial modules from that standpoint. our first pricing adjustment ever as a company was in 2019.
we did talk about that in the future should we choose to do or make pricing adjustments, it would be based on roi that we're able to deliver for the clients. as i mentioned in the past, sometimes, we develop product, and we do not create a module from that where we're billing. so i think there -- that as we've continued on, any time that we make the product more valuable, it only makes sense that we're able to share in the value that we've created through pricing adjustments.
alex kim -- mizuho securities -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
our next question is from bryan bergin with cowen. please proceed.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi guys. good afternoon. i wanted to start with margin. can you comment on the uptick in 3q adjusted opex levels? it sounds like there's no change to your 85% gross margin target for the year.
i'm just curious what added leverage you're going to get in 4q to achieve that.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes, i would say in q4, a couple of things that have impacted the gross margin, i guess, would be the hiring that we've had. in the past, we've continued to increase our operations group to be able to catch the revenue that we're bringing on toward the end of the year and next year. so that's something that's had a small impact on the gross margin as well as depreciation. we brought the data center in dallas online.
so that depreciation is impacting that gross margin. and then the levers we pull, we always look for efficiencies in the model. so we'll continue throughout the rest of the year to kind of look at where we can maybe have some efficiencies but get -- continue as a high-growth company. we want to make sure we're investing for the future.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
we've made statements in the past about if our gross margin is up way too high, it oftentimes shows that we could be a little understaffed in operations and service. and so oftentimes, when you see it change a little bit toward the downside, it means that we're hiring ahead of the growth. and then as that growth begins to come in and those people take on full load clients, we start to get some of that back.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. i guess a follow-up just off of that, would you say that you're fully staffed now across those different parts of the organization? and then just a follow-up on the new sales offices. are these newer offices ramping faster than historical pace? or is it basically in line with what you've seen?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, what i was first to say about the organization about being fully staffed, i mean it is -- i believe that we've done a good job of hiring. i've talked about over the last nine months, i think it's become easier for everyone to hire as it's been more of a shift back to maybe more of the middle where we were definitely in an employee-driven environment. and then i don't know you fit in like four or five questions in this.
what was the other one, something about hiring?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
[inaudible]
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's right. yes.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
ok. yes. i would say that when it comes to the new sales offices, as we've always had, we've always had increasing -- increasingly more success with new offices than what we'd have with the past, just because the amount of product we're selling, the fact that we continue to go upmarket. i mean, as i said in the past, i mean, i don't know it's about four, five years ago, i said the first rep that sells $1 million in a year, we're going to name the -- we're going to name the award after them.
and it wasn't long after that someone did $2 million in a year as an individual. and i'm sure this year, someone will finish at $3 million that they've sold. and so you would expect a new office when you have your executive reps going from an average sale below $1 million to over $3 million, not an average rep, but i'm saying a top rep, selling that much. you would expect that to raise that type to raise all boats, including the new office opportunities as we open them.

thank you mr. bergin. our next question is from the line of jason celino with keybanc. please proceed.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. chad, craig, i don't know if it's just me or i've been thinking about paycom too much, but i've been seeing more paycom commercials, especially on football games. during the pandemic, you really leaned into marketing and advertising to capture incremental share. is it possible that some of the strength we've seen over the last couple of quarters is coming from increased top-of-funnel efforts?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we're definitely getting better at marketing and retargeting and how we brand ourselves. so yes, i mean marketing is definitely one of those levers that we feel impact sales. and oftentimes, we're landing on a softer beach because of it. i think our market has changed dramatically even since the beginning of the pandemic when we started spending because we are able to do things with -- i'm not going to call them indirectly, but softer employee-driven leads that come from rank-and-file employees that are just tired of dealing with the consequences of having their check wrong.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. no, that's fair. i guess we've been hearing about falling advertising prices as other types of tech and software companies pull back. with this dynamic, does that change the roi for some of the marketing efforts or cost of acquisition efforts that you do?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no. i mean i still believe you can waste money in advertising. so i mean, it's not going to change our strategy. it is an roi metric.
we do measure it every single week based off not only leads but the percent of appointment that we get from those leads and then how we convert them and to close deals as they start. so that -- how we measure effectiveness of our marketing hasn't changed.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thanks.

thank you, mr. celino. the next question is from alex zukin with wolfe research. please proceed.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey guys. first is, usually, we just say congratulations on a solid quarter. but i would say relative to everybody that's reporting this season, just amazing where you guys continue to put up in an obviously very volatile and difficult macro environment. so again, complements aside, i guess i'll start with that question, which is, chad, if you zoom out, is the tougher macro actually helping you? meaning that companies are starting to reprioritize certain efforts either around efficiency, more automation in their back office and their payroll, and then the hiring environment to which you refer to as being back to kind of more normalized levels? like, i guess, how much of a tailwind is this for you? and how long -- like if you had to -- if you look at your crystal ball and you kind of think about the durability of this trend, like what's your thinking around that?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, i will just say we're just getting started with beti. i mean all employees are going to be doing their own payroll. everybody on this call is going to be doing their own payroll. it's how companies win at payroll.
it only makes sense that employees do it themselves. the only reason why employees haven't been doing it themselves is because it's always been overly complicated in multiple systems in blah, blah, blah. so i mean, i think that our biggest opportunities, the fact that people are waking up to this, and they want to do less. i mean, your back office, they want to do less, especially when that equivalates into less exposure for them.
they can do less work and create less exposure, less risk and greater satisfaction with their employees. so i don't really think it matters what's going on in order for us to move our product from a strategic basis. now could the size of the deals be smaller if you're in a looser versus a tighter labor market? well, maybe yes. but i mean -- and i'm not saying that's the case now, but i'm saying their reason for making the change is going to be -- exist regardless of what the labor market is.
and so -- and i believe that we provide that for them. so that's really what's driving it. and i think that as we've shifted over to really giving the employee control over their own payroll and everything else that feeds it. now if i have you responsible for your time and labor management of clocking in and clocking out, ok, which all employees are, but have you responsible for your expense management, which all employees are, your benefits administration, which all employers are, i'm just not showing you how it all added up at the end.
i'm having you do all this work without ever showing you where you're going. and so now what paycom does is we show you where you're going and how it's going to impact your payroll. you'll be amazed at how much better everybody gets it, time tracking, expense management, benefits administration. when you take the blindfold off of them and show them what it should look like at the end, they get a lot better.
and i don't see that slowing down regardless of what's going on in the labor market.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
understood. and then i guess maybe as a different direction, if you look at the funding environment with private companies now and i don't know if valuations are corrected or they will correct, given the incremental opportunity that you're seeing, particularly further upmarket, what -- how would you say your approach is either the same or changed over the course of the next 12 to 24 months around organic versus inorganic innovation.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, i think that we're an organic innovation company. i mean, i've always said that we always look to do things that make sense to us. but i mean, we've always developed our product. we continue to be ambitious with our product and what we look for in the future.
we are continuing to be pulled up market. and honestly, i think that the larger the company it is, the larger company is, the more opportunity for exposure and risk they have and even the more difficult it is to keep everybody paid correctly. and so i think you're going to see more and more -- as we have definitely see the employees of those companies call us. i mean, i don't think we're going to have less opportunity with larger companies as time goes on.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you, mr. zukin. our next question is from bhavin shah with deutsche bank. please proceed.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. chad, on that quip you made earlier on value of 50% self-service adoption by the first two payrolls, what are the things you can do to maybe accelerate that? like what could those things be in? is it more awareness than anything else? and any sense of what the upper balance would look like?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean our clients are -- you're a new client and you're rolling something out to your employees. i mean, i would say that our clients are getting better at it as well. i mean this 50% are just from the group that wanted to. i believe our clients are getting better at talking about the impact that can be had when an employee does their own.
and so -- and you see that number go up. i'm just saying that's where they're starting, which, to me, showing a very strong interest. i mean it's one thing to buy something, it's another thing to use it. and beti's definitely a product that's getting high usage from the point of conversion on.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
that's helpful there. and just a quick follow-up. i mean you talked earlier about maybe tweaking the brand marketing strategy a little bit of kind of going at it from a different angle. how is the effectiveness of this marketing campaign evolved for the last few months given some of these changes? are you able to go after a different customer base or attract buyers that maybe wouldn't come into your full otherwise?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
no, because at the end of the day, there's no such thing as an enterprise employee. i mean, whether a person works for a large enterprise company or a small company, they have the same mortgage, same bills, same medical needs, same child care needs. they all expect their check to be correct. so employees that work from enterprise company one day, can work for a smaller company the next day and they can be back working for a large company.
they're the same person. they expect the same things. and so when it comes to beti, it's for everyone. it's for the employee and it's regardless of the company's size.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. congrats.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from daniel jester with bmo. please proceed.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. maybe just as kind of -- earlier on the call about bookings in the quarter. chad, you mentioned -- called out september and october specifically.
just in terms of the linearity, like how did this third quarter look like other third quarters? did you book more business on a relative basis in september, october? or were you just commenting on sort of the macro outlook? thanks.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, it was commented on the macro outlook, and i just took our most recent two months. i mean, i could go back further into august, july, june. the answer to your question is absolutely, we are booking more today than we've booked in the past.
and i wouldn't say that -- i mean, september is strong, october's strong, but so is august, so is july, so is june. as far back as you go, we've continued to be strong.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then with you've actually obviously run this business for a very long time through all sorts of different macroeconomic cycles. i think clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty about what 2023 looks like. so maybe, just philosophically, chad, how do you run paycom in a recession? what changes? what are the levers that we should expect you to pull either to manage cost or drive additional growth?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i mean very little change for us based on what we're already doing. i mean just as a reminder, i mean, we have 5% of the tam. we have a differentiated product. as i said before, we started off the year with 33,800 clients.
we've got two competitors that if you combine their client count, it's 1.7 million. and so what happens to us next year is dependent upon us, and i think we're in control of that. so i mean, i wouldn't see any major changes from what we're going to be doing into next year.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks very much.
operator
our next question is from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse. please proceed.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks so much. and i'll let my congratulations just given fantastic outcome. can you give us a sense, relative to expectations that you initially said, where was the source of the most upside? was it modules kind of new logos, just employee per logo per cac? and any way to just frame that?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
new logos.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
new logo, that's super helpful. and then chad, is there any way to think about -- i mean, we've got a [inaudible] number this morning is north of like $10 million. is there any way to think about that relative to kind of the module adoption and the type of modules that folks are using? because obviously, one of the debates in the market now is we get a soft landing. and based on the general market in and of itself, seems that's potentially a real likely outcome.
but how to think about modules within the context of the [inaudible]. is there any way to think about that?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i mean we definitely have leading indicators that we look at like for background checks, how many people running background checks, which is an impact of oftentimes onboarding and what have you. i mean all i would say is this. i mean, those types of things are going to impact us a little bit on the margin. but for us, it's really about new logo wins with our differentiated strategy.
that's what's really going to drive our growth. sometimes you have some things that help you with that a little bit, and that could be what's going on in the labor market. but i would say it would have to be something extreme to have any negative impact on us. and likewise, i would say it would have to also be extreme on the other side to have some major positive impact on us, except for the fact that our go-to markets normalize and how we're going to market.
it's like the way we were going to market prepandemic, which for us being out there face-to-face and having those personal interchanges and exchanges of ideas and information really helps us when we're selling deals.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
that makes sense. congrats again.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. mcveigh. our last question comes from robert simmons with d.a. davidson.
please proceed.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. so following up on samad, your sequential guide is the strong as it's been, and i believe, five years. are you expecting anything unusual in the quarter such as extra strong bernstrom this year or anything like that?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
ok. i'm making sure i understand the sequential guide into fourth quarter. we kind of talked -- i kind of talked a little bit about this earlier. when deals start in a quarter matters.
and so if a deal starts at the first of the quarter in october, we get 100% of the revenue billing for that. if a deal start -- or let's even take this quarter that we just finished with the deal started at the beginning of july, we get 100% of the revenue dollars for that deal. if the deal starts in mid-september, we might get 15% of the revenue for that deal. but in subsequent quarters, we get 100% of it.
and so it's a recurring revenue -- recurring revenue model that we have here. so all i would say is that does matter. i've also talked about how, craig and i have been talking about how interest rates layer in over time. eventually, they start layering in as well.
i think you get a little bit of uplift from that as well. but for us, it's really the new client adds onto our platform when they start and our expectation that there'll be -- we'll receive 100% of the revenue billing in subsequent quarters, fourth quarter being the next one.
robert simmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. so it's basically just those two things, i might switch moving around q3 versus q4. all right. great.
and then i guess just, have you seen any notable -- competition? i realize it's the same basis as usual, but any changes in kind of the pricing, marketing approach? any idea who's commenting recently that seeing their churn kind of increase in normalized but only a little bit. i mean, what are you seeing on that front?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean i will tell you that we've always been in a very competitive market. as you've mentioned, it's been with the same people. we're the new people.
we're the new guys. and next year, we're 25 years in business. so we really benchmark against ourselves in the current situation about the -- with the roi that we can create if someone uses our product. you're not going to get the same roi if you use one of our competitors.
you're just not. and so the extent someone agrees with our strategy and can realize the roi available for them if they deploy it correctly, they're going to choose us over someone else, regardless of what's really going on with pricing. that said, pricing does matter. there's a market for pricing, and i think that we all understand that.
but as far as seeing any changes with our competitors, no, other than they all continue to deploy things that they believe will make them more competitive. and sometimes that's pricing. and sometimes it's giving things for free. so it just kind of it kind of depends on what we'll see out there.
but it's really been the same that we've always seen.
operator
that concludes the question-and-answer session. i will now turn the call over to chad richison for closing remarks.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well, i want to thank everyone for joining our call today, and thank you all, and i want to thank all of our employees for contributing to our continued success. in november, we'll be hosting meetings in las vegas at the wells fargo tmt summit and presenting at the credit suisse annual technology conference in scottsdale. then in december, we'll be presenting at the barclays tmt conference in san francisco.
we look forward to speaking with many of you soon. operator, you may disconnect.

operator
good afternoon, and thank you for attending today's paycom software fourth quarter and full year 2022 results conference call. my name is daniel, and i will be your moderator for today's call. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to our host, james samford, head of investor relations. james, the floor is yours.
james samford -- head of investor relations
thank you, and welcome to paycom's earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. certain statements made on this call that are not historical facts, including those related to our future plans, objectives and expected performance, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. while we believe any forward-looking statements made on this call are reasonable, actual results may differ materially because the statements are based on our current expectations and subject to risks and uncertainties.
these risks and uncertainties are discussed in our filings with the sec, including our most recent annual report on form 10-k. you should refer to and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking information. any forward-looking statement made speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. also, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures, including adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and certain adjusted expenses.
we use these non-gaap financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. a reconciliation schedule showing gaap versus non-gaap results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today, and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. i will now turn the call over to chad richison, paycom's president and chief executive officer. chad? 
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, james, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. we ended 2022 with very strong results, and i'd like to thank all of our employees for the consistent hard work and execution that drove four consecutive quarters of revenue growth of 30% or more over the respective prior year periods. i'll spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter and our full year 2022 results and high-level expectations for 2023. following that, craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions.
our 2022 fourth quarter revenue of approximately $371 million came in very strong, up 30% year over year, bringing our full year 2022 revenue to $1.375 billion, also up 30% year over year. fourth quarter adjusted ebitda also came in very strong at $164 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 44%, bringing our full year 2022 adjusted ebitda to $580 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 42%. the sum of our 2022 revenue growth rate and adjusted ebitda margin resulted in us hitting the rule of 72. with our full year 2023 guidance, we are once again starting the year strong with outlook for a solid rule of 65.
as a reminder, we guide to what we can see based on our existing recurring revenue, new business sales and anticipated new starts in the near term. i'm pleased with the momentum we are carrying into the new year. on the product front, 2022 was a very strong year for paycom benefiting from our first full year of rolling out beti, our differentiated employee self-service payroll solution. we are seeing strong demand trends that position us to deliver another year of rapid profitable growth in 2023.
we are leading an industry transformation by making payroll and hcm processes more efficient for both employees and businesses by eliminating manual tasks, improving accuracy and reducing liability exposure caused when payroll and hcm is done in accurately. with beti, employees are doing their own payroll by interfacing directly with their data and a self-service, easy-to-use software. a recent study conducted by ernst & young found that the average organization has a 20% inaccuracy rate when it comes to payrolls, which results in lost revenue, hours wasted correcting errors and increased exposure to potential lawsuits and fines. each of these mistakes cost an average of $291 and could cost upwards of $705 for unentered nonproductive time errors.
so you can see how costly these errors become over time. in fact, over the course of the year, a 1,000-employee company could potentially incur almost $1 million in unnecessary costs, correcting common payroll mistakes. beti automates the payroll processes to deliver perfect payroll and employees are empowered to identify and correct errors ahead of time so that everybody wins. our marketing plan in 2022 continued to perform well, delivering strong demo leads throughout the year as we spend aggressively on advertising.
at the same time, our deliberate investments in marketing are delivering high-margin revenues and we saw improving operating leverage in the sales and marketing throughout 2022. we continue to be pulled upmarket in 2022 with the fastest-growing revenue segment of our business coming from clients with greater than 2,000 employees. we are seeing increasing demand from larger organizations that are recognizing the opportunity to simplify their hcm needs. and paycom is well positioned to benefit from this trend.
with only approximately 5% of the tam today, there's still plenty of runway ahead for us to expand our market share. paycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2022. as a workplace, we were named one of america's most trusted companies, as well as best company for women, and we received a top workplace in oklahoma award for a 10th consecutive year. these awards are a testament to our hard work, our thriving corporate culture and our client focus.
as of december 31, 2022, our headcount stood at over 6,300 employees, up 18% year over year as we continue to have great success attracting and retaining high-quality talent to further bolster our future growth. additionally, i want to congratulate the 2022 paycom jim thorpe award winner, tre'vius hodges-tomlinson from texas christian university. this award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes jim thorpe, who is one of the greatest all-around athletes in history. jim thorpe also happened to be an oklahoman.
to sum up, our focus on the employee experience and client roi continue to fuel our strong results and we are executing well. i'm very excited about the long list of new innovative opportunities we will be pursuing in 2023 and beyond. i'd like to thank our employees for helping to make 2022 such a strong year and we are set up for another great year in 2023. with that, i'll turn the call over to craig for a review of our financials and guidance.
craig?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
before i review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2022 and our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023, i would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-gaap basis. we ended the year with very strong results with full year 2022 revenue of $1.375 billion, up 30.3% compared to 2021. fourth quarter results were excellent, with total revenues of $370.6 million, representing growth of 30% over the comparable prior year period. our revenue growth was driven by strong demand, new business wins and adoption of recent new product offerings.
within total revenues, recurring revenue was $364 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 30% from the comparable prior year period. we ended 2022 with approximately 36,600 clients, representing a growth rate of 8% compared to 2021. on a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with roughly 19,100 clients, also up 8% compared to 2021. total number of employee records increased 14% year over year in 2022 to 6.5 million.
paycom's annual revenue retention rate in 2022 was 93%, which was consistent with our recent four-year average of 93% and up more than 200 basis points from the prior four-year period average of 91%. total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $312.5 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.3%. for the full year 2022, our adjusted gross margin was 84.9%. adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $87.3 million or 23.5% of revenues.
our marketing strategy in 2022 has been very effective at driving high-quality demo leads. with the revenue generated from prior period investments, we saw a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues for the year. we plan to continue to invest in marketing in q1 and throughout 2023. adjusted r&d expense was $36.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 or 9.9% of total revenues.
adjusted total r&d costs, including the capitalized portion, were $51.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $44 million in the prior year period. we have a very strong pipeline of product development opportunities in 2023 that we believe will create tremendous value for our clients and for paycom. adjusted ebitda was $163.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 or 44.2% of total revenues compared to $109.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 or 38.4% of total revenues. for the full year 2022, adjusted ebitda was $579.7 million or 42.2% of total revenues compared to $419.3 million or 39.7% of total revenues in 2021, representing over 240 basis points of margin expansion.
our gaap net income for the fourth quarter was $80 million or $1.38 per diluted share versus $48.7 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. for the full year 2022, our gaap net income was $281.4 million or $4.84 per diluted share, up 44% year over year. non-gaap net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $100.2 million or $1.73 per diluted share versus $64.4 million or $1.11 per diluted share in the prior year period. for the full year 2022, our non-gaap net income was $357.2 million or $6.14 per diluted share versus $260.4 million or $4.48 per diluted share in the prior year period, up 37% year over year.
for q1 and full year 2023, we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a gaap basis and approximately 26% on a non-gaap basis. turning to the balance sheet. we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $401 million and total debt of $29 million. during 2022, we repurchased approximately 365,000 shares for a total of nearly $100 million.
through december 31, 2022, paycom has repurchased nearly 4.7 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $590 million, and we currently have $1.1 billion remaining in our buyback program. cash from operations was $365 million in 2022, representing an increase of 14.3%. the new requirement in 2022 to capitalize instead of expense r&d costs resulted in approximately $27 million in additional income tax payments that would have been deferred under previous law. this impacted both our operating cash flow and free cash flow as compared to 2021.
the average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. for 2023, we anticipate stock compensation to be approximately $120 million. on the capital expenditure front, we're in full construction of our fifth building in oklahoma city. and we now estimate total capex as a percent of revenues to be approximately 12% in 2023.
now, let me turn to guidance. for fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.702 billion or approximately 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of $700 million to $702 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 41% at the midpoint of the range. once again, we are starting the year's guidance at the rule of 65.
for the first quarter of 2023, we expect total revenues in the range of $443 million to $445 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 26% at the midpoint of the range. we expect adjusted ebitda for the first quarter in the range of $210 million to $212 million, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 48% at the midpoint of the range. 2022 was a very strong year for paycom, reflecting the strength of prior year investments and consistent execution. we will continue to invest in talent, marketing, innovation, customer service and geographic expansion to meet the strong demands we are experiencing.
with that, we will open the line for questions. operator?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] the first question comes from the line of raimo lenschow of barclays. please proceed.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
two questions. chad, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on there in terms of end demand, obviously, the markets are nervous, the kind of data points about smb coming in that they might be weaker on some of the players in the other segments of the software market. so just talk a little bit about what you're seeing. we're also looking at the numbers, your renewals came in at 93 versus 94.
just kind of just paint a picture for us a little bit there. and then, one for craig, if you think about the new year and investments, like how do you think balance that kind of seeing other guys be nervous about the economy and your investment approach for the year? just talk a little bit about the flexibility there.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i'll start off. i mean, our go-to-market remains very strong. we continue to have very strong book sales, and we've been selling beti across the board. new clients that come in have about 50% of their employees doing their own payroll within the first two months of using beti.
and so, that continues to be successful. from 2015 to 2018, we had a retention rate of anywhere from 91% to 92%, was 91% for three of those years and 92% for one of those years. for the last four years, from 2019 through 2022, we've had a retention rate of 93% for three of the years and 94% of one of those years. there's often rounding at play as you look through that.
but what i will also say is with clients who have beti, we have a much, much higher retention rate across our base. and i would expect retention to continue to rise as a larger percent of our current client base deploys beti.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes, raimo on the plan for 2023, we've given our guidance on our adjusted ebitda. and it's still a very strong guide on that as we're looking at 41%. so we -- as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're going to continue to spend on the marketing side, the r&d side and then in the service side as well. and really, the marketing is the one area where we can pull leverage.
we don't have any long-term commitments out there, so that is an area where we could pull levers if we needed to.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from samad samana of jefferies. please proceed.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. i guess first one, chad, did i hear you say -- i think you said you had just north of 6,300 employees. i think that's high teens growth over the prior year.
i'm just curious how we should think about the hiring in context of it's slightly slower than it was in 2021. i'm just curious, is it that we're -- should expect just productivity to increase? maybe what the exit rate on that growth rate is and just how we think about the hiring trends for paycom itself.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, we hired what we look to hire last year. i believe our growth was around 18% in hiring. we definitely have a more efficient client.
i've been talking about for quite some time, who -- we kind of have the haves and the have-nots when you look across our client base with those clients that have already deployed beti and are getting strong usage out of it. we're just -- we're having to do less for them. i mean, we're having to fix less things. we're having to do less adjustments, and so they're just much more efficient.
and so, we don't need as many people when people are using beti. that said, we had a very healthy growth in our employment last year. and so, i believe we had success with that.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then, maybe if i just think about -- we've almost fully lapped the new office expansions by a year. i know it usually takes a little bit over a year for them to become fully productive, but just how are those progressing? and how should we think about -- are there any new planned offices that you're assuming in the 2023 guidance that you just gave?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
we always guide to what we can see. i mean, first, i'll answer those office questions. we did open up five offices over the course of about three months. one of those, i believe, was in december of 2021.
the others were in the first quarter of 2022. all of those continue to progress. they wouldn't be at full staffing yet, but they would achieve that throughout this year, as well as with the full backline pipeline. and then, next year, in the year of 2024, they would all be on the same quota as our mature offices are.
as far as what we anticipate to do this year from office openings, as we all know, that you followed us for a while, office openings that we would anticipate to expand into this year would have very little impact on this year but would have more of an impact on both 2024, as well as 2025.

thank you. the next question comes from mark marcon of baird. please proceed.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. one question. craig, you mentioned you've got $2.1 billion held for cash, held for clients in the fourth quarter. what sort of effective yield are you getting on that? and what is the expectation with regards to the float balance growing over the course of the coming year, and how we should think about an effective yield on that?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes. so mark, on the balance, if you look at it this quarter, it grew about 13%. it's grown at different rates throughout 2022. so it's typically going to grow at a rate lower than what our expected revenue growth rate is going to be.
part of that is as we continue to move upmarket, that those funds are held for a less period of time. we have to make those payments much quicker. so that move up market, we'd keep that from growing at the same rate as our growth rate. in terms of the yield, we haven't really given the exact yield but what we do say is that as the rates move up for every 25 basis points, we would expect to get about $5 million.
but it layers in over time. and as we're continuing to look for longer-term investments on our portfolio, some of those are at a little lower rate. and we've actually started to layer in some of those. you can see that from some of our earlier filings.
so we're not going to get -- and also the banks are a little slower to give you those 25 basis points. so it takes a couple of quarters to get those layered in. so it would be something lower than the fed funds rate.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
ok. would the rule of thumb, 70% to 80% of fed funds with a delay, be kind of a good rule of thumb to think of?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, well, i think you're close.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
i mean, i would say that that's kind of in the range, mark.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
we're sub-four today.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes, we're sub-four.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from brian schwartz of oppenheimer. please proceed.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
hi, chad and craig. thanks for taking my questions. congratulations on a real nice job with the business in 4q. chad, i just wanted to ask you a question about either the business activity or the pipeline momentum by customer size.
are you seeing any differences in terms of the demand or the behavior of the larger organizations that are flowing through the pipeline versus, say, the smaller companies?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, we definitely continued to creep up as we have done even since ipo as we've continued to increase our target market. in fact, last year, revenue was up 60% with clients that had 2,000 employees or more. so we are definitely seeing a demand continuing to be pulled higher, especially as businesses are looking to deploy beti so that their employees can actually do their own.
brian schwartz -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
and then, one follow-up just for craig real quickly. did you buy back any stock in the quarter? and can you just remind me again how much authorization you've left for buybacks?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes. so i don't think -- we didn't buy back any this quarter. for the full year, we bought back about $100 million worth. and i think we have a $1.1 billion left on our buyback.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from joshua reilly of needham. please proceed.
joshua reilly -- needham and company -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. if you look at the growth expectations for 2023 here, how do you think about the mix of growth from new customers versus existing? as we know existing customers, while smaller historically in net new bookings, their growth has increased in the last couple of years. and we're seeing some different trends with different software vendors.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we're -- ours is going to primarily come from new logo ads when you just look at the size of revenue that we need to grow by in order to continue to hit our objectives. and so, first prize is going to be new logo adds. we don't really have a lot to call out on pace per control growth from that perspective.
but new logo ads is going to be primary for us. we've always had a healthy upsell to current clients. it's just been at a much smaller level than what new logo ads are. and it's been consistent.
our upsells to current clients as a percentage has been consistent each year with the exception of the year we had aca.
joshua reilly -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then, as we look to q1 here, how should we think about the impact from w2 revenue? remember, last year, that was impacted on a year-over-year basis because of the turnover in 2020 due to covid. are the trends going to normalize here in this march quarter given what happened in '22 -- with hiring or anything to highlight there?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i feel like they are more normal. i think it's important to understand that the -- our year-end services as far as what we provide to a client, that hasn't changed a lot in the last 15 years as far as you added 1099s at one point, but you have w2s, w3s 1099. meanwhile, the growth of our other revenue, as we've added all these other products, has been somewhat substantial.
and so, it's just the percentage or amount that our year-end services has on the overall client base is much lower now than what it was in the past just because it's not growing at the same rate. i would say, yes. i mean, i would say, yes, from a normalization. i think you saw normal hiring and business patterns more so last year than what you had in year's past -- in a couple of years past.
so from a normalization of year in forms filing, yes, i would say that we are -- we're there.
operator
thank you. next question comes from steve enders of citigroup. please proceed.
steve enders -- citi -- analyst
hi. great. thanks for taking the question here. i guess i just want to dig into a little bit more on the outlook for next year and particularly on the margin side.
i think you talked about in the past that if we think about float income flowing through that that some of that would flow down to the bottom line. so just trying to think about how you're thinking about that layering in for '23 and kind of where the biggest areas of incremental investments are coming and that's lead into the ebitda, slight guide down from where we were in '22.
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes. primarily, we've continued to invest in sales and marketing, and that's what we said on the prepared remarks. we're going to continue to invest there and assuming it's going to continue to work. so that's really the area where we're going to continue to invest.
also, in the r&d, i mean, we have a lot of projects in the works, and we'll continue to hire aggressively in the r&d side as well.
steve enders -- citi -- analyst
ok. and i guess on the marketing spend that you're putting out there, i know it's been a more recent initiative for you all, i guess, what's kind of been the roi on those dollars that you have seen? and how has that kind of changed the top of funnel activity or conversion rates that you've seen as kind of the brand awareness campaigns have gotten out there more?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, marketing, we started in 2020. that was also the year that we added four inside sales teams. and then, in 2021, we added another six inside sales teams.
i believe one of those years, our unit count went up about 17%, with 17% growth. marketing drove that as we do our marketing and spend money on advertising we have clients of all size call us. and so, marketing is directly responsible for any business that's coming in below 50 employees. and you have some direct responsibility for it above 50 employees, but it provides more support at that level as our go-to-market's different, above 50 employees than what we experience below.
growth is first prize, as craig has talked about. and as we look at guidance into this year, we expect to spend healthy marketing. but also, we expect for it to work, which would return itself with highly profitable revenue, which we did see throughout 2022, which produced a healthy adjusted ebitda margins.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from siti panigrahi of mizuho. please proceed.
siti panigrahi -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. chad, if i look at your clients' growth in 2022, 8%, that's kind of slowing down versus pre-covid level, which used to be more in teens. i'm sure there's a factor of like you're moving up markets or client size, but is there anything else we should -- anything that impact it? and how should we think about the client growth rate going forward?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i would say the comp had a little bit to do with it. prior to 2020, we had five sales reps that sold inside sales. in 2020, we added 40. and then, in 2022, we added roughly another 50, 60.
so we started selling small business, emerging business in a much stronger way as the advertising was working, so. and i don't want to say that our unit count was inflated prior, but it was different because we did add a lot of small business units and it contributed to a 17% growth in units. i think we've had -- and again, it did that in the year where we did 25% revenue growth. so i think as we look last year, you could deduct that we had a lot of success selling in midrange and above midrange in clients.
and i would say our small business adds were somewhat more normalized because we didn't really add any small business teams last year like we had in 2020 and 2021.
siti panigrahi -- mizuho securities -- analyst
and then, as a follow-up, into your guidance, what sort of conservatism have you baked into your guidance? i know this is definitely going to help float income this year, but what sort of macro environment you're factored in into your guidance?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, we continue to guide in the $2 million range. so we have quite a bit of visibility as we go quarter to quarter. i will say that in -- we started our guide last year for 2022, we started it at 25%, and we were comping over a year where we had done 25% growth.
this year, we're starting our guide at 24% comping over a year where we had done 30% growth. and so, we haven't changed our approach to guidance. we guide what we can see and achievement matters throughout the year. and so, that's what we're focused on as we move throughout the year.
and so, i'm trying to answer your conservatism. i mean, we guide to what we can see each time, and we look to unload the musket throughout the quarter.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from bryan bergin with cowen. please proceed.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thank you. i wanted to follow up on retention first.
so i heard the comments about beti clients being higher and the relative stability from prior years. but just as we think about the year-on-year downtick here, can you talk about -- is this larger client churn? or is it a lot of churn among smaller clients? just trying to understand that dynamic.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, we're definitely -- from a smaller client perspective, and of course, they contribute smaller revenue amounts. but from a smaller client perspective, i do think that you're sending more -- you're seeing more of a trend like maybe what you saw more pre-pandemic. i mean, there's less prop-up for them in the market. for most new businesses, i believe, about 75% of them fell within the first three years.
so all that's at play when you're working with smaller business. as i just mentioned, we started adding -- really started adding those small business units in 2020 and then continue throughout 2021 and even added more obviously in 2022. and so, that definitely plays into it. i would also say that it's a revenue retention number.
so you have a dividing number that you start with. i've been talking for quite some time about the efficiencies that clients are using beti and what they're gaining. in fact, we're just -- we're not having the same hiccups with them that we would often charge them for at a lower margin and then have to fix. and now those are really being prevented with beti.
so you've got a couple of things at play. and then, also, you've got some rounding at play, but all that's to say is 93% from what i've seen still up there, an industry-leading number. and i do expect, again, with clients that have beti, i mean, we're running at a 99% type retention rate with them. so it's a little bit different there.
and as we continue to convert our current client base over to beti, we expect to have some gains in that. i will mention that we always have some uncontrolled losses, your bought, sold, merged-type businesses. so getting to 100% isn't achievable. but i believe that we continue to have an opportunity to bump up retention, and that's going to come through usage -- appropriate usage of our product.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. understood. and then, a follow-up on margin here. so craig, i may have missed it, but did you say where you expect gross margin to land in 2023? and i hear your message on increased efficiency in sales and marketing, and you've also mentioned increased, i guess, new product development.
should we expect that the explanation around ebitda downtick year-on-year, more about r&d ramping? or is it both r&d and s&m?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
yes. i would say it's both r&d and sales and marketing, and as we're looking for our plans for 2023. we didn't really talk about the adjusted ebitda, but we've been doing a pretty narrow range for the last several years. yes, gross margin for the last several years.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from jason celino of keybanc. please proceed.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets
hey. afternoon, guys. maybe, chad, you've been pretty vocal about opportunities in automated payroll and broader hr. when we think about general ai, i feel like this is up your alley.
i mean, what excites you most about the technology if you've looked into it, and what could it mean for paycom and hr as a whole?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean, we are solving problems for the client and processes that i believe can be automated and hadn't been until really beti came into play, which somewhat forces appropriate usage within our software for employees so that they can get paid correctly. i do believe that there's more automation that we can be doing. but you've got to start with, you've got to have the client and the employees using the product correctly, which i will say that about 50% of our client base, that is the case. and last year was our first full year of selling beti and bringing it to the market.
and so, we're having a lot of success for that. i believe ai for the sake of ai isn't really valuable to the client. but i believe that if you can do something consistently and you can use something like ai to do that, i think that's a good thing. so i don't expect we would see it as a wide platform within our industry this year type thing with that.
but i think you'll have more and more businesses looking for that, machine learning and other types of automation that could be used to automate problems experienced by our clients right now.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets
ok. no, that's fair. and then just, craig, maybe a quick one. i think the ebitda beat in the quarter, $18 million, 6% beat toward the higher end of what we've typically seen over the last four years.
anything to note on the strength, expense management, anything on timing of some investments?
craig boelte -- chief financial officer
i mean, there are really three or four buckets that really helped drive that ebitda beat. one, your marketing spend was a little higher fourth quarter, and some of that is just when we are doing those marketing things that we had planned. a little higher capitalization rate on the development, and that's focused on new initiatives. beti clients generate higher-quality revenue.
so we saw a little bit of that. and then, in the quarter, we had a net insurance proceeds of about $4.8 million for expenses that were incurred both current and prior year quarters. so that's really what drove the adjusted ebitda beat.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from arvind ramnani of piper sandler. please proceed.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to ask a question. how should we think about growth from existing clients who are expanding their own client base?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
not any different than what we've experienced in the past. i mean, again, i'm removing the covid year out of that, but not any different than what we've experienced in the past. in any given year, you have some clients grow, you have some clients not. you have some clients buy business.
you have some clients sell business. and so, i believe that always somewhat worked itself out. maybe we win some. maybe we lose some.
but really, the growth for us is driven by new logo adds. i mean, holly has booked sales numbers that drive our revenue growth, and that's how we're going to hit our targets. i think that we expect stability within our current client base as we look to guide, we do have an assumption of stability. we don't really make assumptions of growth and/or downsizing within those -- within our current plan.
across a 30,000-plus client base it seem -- it tends to have averaged out over the last 25 years that i've done this with the exception of the 2020, some in 2021 time period.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
terrific. and if you can just kind of help me to reconcile the 8% growth in new logos versus 14% employee expansion. how should i interpret those two numbers?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean, that would tell you that the client size is growing as well there. we -- i've been continuing to call out that we're having success continuing to be pulled further and further up market. a couple of years or about six years ago, we went from 2,000 to 5,000. a couple of years ago, i mentioned that we're going above, we're going up to 10,000.
i've talked about how we're continuing to go up even further. and so, that's going to get you a larger employee count with potential for less of a unit count. but i would also say, i don't want to overlook the fact that we've had a lot of success on the small business unit. and when you're looking at unit count growth, they're all created equal.
i mean, everything is -- whether you're a one-employee unit or whether you're a 10,000-employee unit, you're created equal on that report from a unit count percentage. but it's just been a trend to larger clients with the exception of the two years, where we decided we're going to add our small business, emerging business units, our groups, of which now we have 10 teams and that really hasn't grown. the teams haven't grown. of course, we continue to add small business units.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from bhavin shah of deutsche bank. please proceed.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. chad, i know you touched on this a bit earlier in the call, but are you seeing anything as it relates to changes in the pipeline generation or sales cycles over the past few months? maybe even reasons why customers are maybe looking to switch or even selecting paycom?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, we continue to have strong product demonstration leads, but that's oftentimes a function of our marketing and advertising. and we pay for those leads. i can say, for us, it's been business as usual. we've been back in the field since september last year, meaning actually back on site on every single call, where before we were doing more of a hybrid, some were virtual, some were in person.
so i would say, if anything, we're having less calls with the client to get to close. i can't necessarily say that's speeding up the process, but i think we're having better conversations as we go through the process. so really nothing to call out there. other than, today, when a client calls paycom and looks to have a product demonstration, it's about beti.
and i would say, in times past, it could be about whatever thorn they had in their paw that we'd be looking to pull out. so it's a little different today in the type of lead we are generating.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. and just a follow-up, how do you think about the pepm opportunity in 2023 relative to some of the growth that you saw in 2022? any specific areas or modules that are --
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, beti definitely drives pepm, because you definitely have to have a certain product set for us -- from us purchased and being used in order for beti to work for you. so i would say that the clients that we are selling in 2022 have a better, stronger product mix than those clients we would have been selling in 2018 and/or 2019. we still do have an opportunity with current clients. we do have to really work at their pace to get them over to beti and to really to get them to achieve the value that it can deliver, and we continue to look at that.
and there's still opportunities, obviously, within our current client base to deliver more pepm, as well as on new business sales.
operator
thank you. and our final question comes from the line of daniel jester of bmo capital markets. please proceed.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey. great. thanks for squeezing me in. appreciate it.
just on that comment about beti, chad, can you update us what percentage of the base has beti at year-end?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
we're around 50%. it's about where we were when we reported in november. as clients go through year-end, there's different objectives for both them and us as we're onboarding clients. beti does require a conversion of process on the side of the client as it is going to change how their employees utilize the system.
there's a detailed conversion-type plan that we go through with every current client as they choose how and when to deploy. but we're continuing to meet out there with our clients. i would also say that your larger clients are deploying it a lot quicker. current clients are deploying it a lot quicker than what your smaller clients -- current clients might be deploying it.
as a point that i would mention once more, all businesses of any size, whether they're small or large since july of 2021 have been sold and converted into beti. so we're really talking about our current client base that we had prior to that.
daniel jester -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. and then, just lastly, and you touched on this a couple of times about sort of the upmarket success and opportunities. as i think about sort of how you're investing to attack those opportunities, is this strategic, i.e., that you're devoting more resources specifically because you think there's more opportunity upmarket? or is this tactical in which kind of year in and year out, you're deploying resources and maybe one year, you see more opportunities smaller and down market and another you're seeing more opportunity in the upmarket, so you can be sort of tactical with those sales investments?
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i'd say it's a little bit of both. and one thing i've been saying for quite some time now, our industry shifted. it shifted to leverage employee usage to help the client. when employees use the product correctly, the client has less exposure and liability around this process, which, paying employees, providing them benefits and everything else.
i mean, that carries some exposure, even how you have an employee applies for a job. and so, i believe that all these -- the self-service technology has really been helping the client. the reason i say that is this, when it comes to an employee, jan smith, whether jan smith works at a 30-employee or whether jan smith works for a 10000-employee in regards to how they work with hcm and payroll products, it's substantially the same as far as the needs that jan has. so what i would say is we've stayed very focused on the employee and an employees and employee regardless of which company they work for.
are there some things that a larger company we just know we're going to run into that's going to be different than what we would run into in a company that might have 150 employees? absolutely, there's some changes in that. and i would say that's where more strategy comes into play, as well as making tactical moves to make sure that we're able to provide the back-end experience that they're looking for. but i will say the more that we're doing at the employee level, the less you're having to do on the back end because a lot of the things you're doing on the back end is to make sure you're not having issues with the employee data. and/or if you do, you're having to fix it.
and so, you get a lot of points for prevention these days. and large companies, they don't want to do a lot of extra work either.
operator
thank you. and with that, we will conclude our time of question-and-answer. i would now like to hand the conference back over to chad richison for closing remarks.
chad richison -- president and chief executive officer
well, i want to thank everyone for joining the call today, and i want to send a special thank you to our employees for contributing to our continued success. the 2022 is a great year for paycom, and we're set up for another great year in 2023. we'll be hosting meetings in new york at the wolfe march madness software conference in february. we'll also be participating in the keybanc emerging tech conference and the morgan stanley tmt conference in san francisco in march.
we look forward to catching up with many of you soon. and operator, you may disconnect. thank you.
