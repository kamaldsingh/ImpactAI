j. williar dunlaevy -- chairman of the board of directors
thank you, david. good morning, everyone. as david said, i'm bill dunlaevy. it's my privilege to be the chairman of the board of directors of berkshire hills bancorp. before sean and jamie cover our financial results, i want to take -- i want to share a few words with you on our announcement yesterday that nitin mhatre has been named chief executive officer of berkshire hills bancorp and berkshire bank, a decision our board made after a thorough planning process and a comprehensive national search. nitin is the ideal choice to lead the bank into the future and propel berkshire to long-term success, fulfilling our promise to meet changing customer expectations and the demands for 21st century banking. nitin's track record of leadership and accomplishment at webster bank and citigroup is exemplary. he has a national reputation as an innovative banking executive who can deliver results, grow market share and improve profitability. he has broad experience working at global banks like citi and shares berkshire's passion for community banking and are pledged to serve the unique needs of all of our customers across our entire footprint. at webster, nitin was instrumental in helping the bank evolve from a mainstream mass-market bank to the specialized bank it is today, serving multiple segments with tailored product offerings.
he oversaw operational improvements in the branches through automation, around a universal banking -- banker model, streamlining the systems and improving customer service. he is a true pioneer in the application of data analytics and the use of digital automation to lower costs, streamline processes and improve the customer experience. importantly, nitin fully embraces berkshire's be first values and principal-driven culture. he strongly believes in empowering employees to respect individual dignity, earn trust through ethical behavior and give back to communities. i also want to take a moment to commend sean gray. sean took on the acting ceo role during a challenging period for the bank and guided us through this ceo transition with a steady hand, steering the bank and maintaining the executive team's focus on our strategic priorities. under his leadership, the entire management team was outstanding during this period, maintaining a high level of performance and showing their commitment under demanding circumstances. that concludes my remarks. i'm now going to excuse myself from this call and turn it back over to sean and our management team. thank you for your time this morning.
sean a. gray -- acting president and chief executive officer
thank you, bill. thank you very much. if i could take a moment to add to bill's comments, first, nitin has a distinguished reputation in the industry and is highly regarded in community banking circle. so i'm excited about our future with nitin leading the bank and myself continuing as president and chief operating officer. we have an exceptionally capable executive team at the bank and we are well positioned for future success. i know nitin is looking forward to engaging with all of you after he officially starts as ceo on friday, january 29. moving on to our fourth quarter 2020 financial results, let me start by mentioning with me this morning is jamie moses, our cfo. and for q&a, we will be joined by george bacigalupo, our commercial banking leader; georgia melas, chief credit officer; and greg lindenmuth, chief risk officer. i'll start my remarks with a focus on the fourth quarter, and then i'll ask jamie to provide more detail on the financials. i'll follow that by commenting on our recent strategic initiatives and our key focus areas going into 2021. our fourth quarter earnings were $0.30 per share, and we earned $0.28 in core eps. these results were ahead of consensus, but they were down from the prior quarter, primarily due to a higher noncash pandemic credit provision. i'd like to first highlight some of our operational accomplishments, we maintained our net interest margin with a strong focus on lowering our deposit costs. we strengthened our fee income, except for a normal seasonal decline in mortgage banking revenue.
we reduced occupancy and technology costs and managed staffing levels, and we completed the exit of our discontinued national mortgage banking operation. our team is adhering to the financial and operating disciplines, while business conditions are currently constrained. turning to credit, we saw further progress toward normalizing our loan portfolio. while credit conditions remain sensitive to the evolving impacts of covid, our borrowers have continued to adjust in this environment. we saw decreases in deferred loans, criticized loans and accruing delinquent loans. total deferrals decreased 22% in the fourth quarter and continued to decline so far in 2021. about 63% of the commercial deferrals are paying current period interest. we remain focused on a handful of covid sensitive industries with primary focus on hospitality and our firestone equipment loans. we've provided further information about these loans and our investor presentation. the fourth quarter was the first time in which significant pandemic impacts began to surface in our traditional asset quality metric. an increase in nonperforming loans was due to two commercial credits which were classified prior to the pandemic. net charge-offs increased due to a handful of hospitality loans. we set our allowance for credit losses at 1.71% of year-end total loans excluding ppp loans. this ratio did not change materially in the second half of the year.
based on our outlook at year-end, we would expect the amount of the allowance to decline in 2021 as pandemic related credit losses are recognized in the future. turning to ppp. we expect that most of loans will be forgiven in the first half of 2021. we've engaged a third-party to support a quick and efficient response to ppp loan requests under the new program now being rolled out. internally, we're giving priority to expediting the processing of forgiveness for first-round ppp loans. we're also anticipating strong volume for our sba lending team based on the new higher 90% guarantee under the 7(a) program. and our small business teams will be focused on credit needs in our communities. we believe our teams are well positioned to respond to new credit demand in our markets based on anticipated economic improvement in 2021. with that, i'll ask jamie to comment in further detail on our fourth quarter financials. jamie?
james m. moses -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, sean. as you noted earlier, our fourth quarter earnings were $0.30 per share, and we earned $0.28 in core eps. core ppnr declined by $6 million to $24 million. in addition to pandemic impacts on our core ppnr, we also recorded $3 million in charges following an operational review of consumer loan servicing, primarily related to past conversions and acquisitions and is reflected in the increases quarter-over-quarter to the professional services and other expense categories. this project has been completed, and we believe that the expense impact has been fully recognized and is limited to this quarter. pandemic impacts on ppnr included interest write-offs on nonaccruing loans and loan workout expense as well as constrained business volumes. i'll take a minute to comment on the balance sheet before further elaborating on the income statement. we had unusually high payroll deposit balances at year-end. and as a result, short-term investments were up $622 million, and total assets increased by $220 million. on december 2, we announced an agreement to sell our mid-atlantic branches. and so we transferred $617 million of deposits and $301 million of loans to held for sale. adjusting for this branch sale, our loans declined by approximately $600 million or 7%. we invested some of these funds into an additional $236 million in investment securities. we also paid down wholesale funding, and the average balance of earning assets, therefore, decreased by approximately $200 million or 2%. looking forward, we're targeting commercial loan growth ex-ppp at a mid-single-digit pace in 2021.
we also plan to grow the mortgage portfolio due to higher originations, slower prepays and purchases from input -- sorry, excuse me, in footprint corresponds banks. we expect this growth to generally offset continued runoff of indirect auto and certain commercial business we are working down, such as aircraft and some covid sensitive types of borrowers. so the portfolio is generally expected to be stable or up slightly before the impact of ppp loans. we expect most of the $633 million in ppp loans that would remain on our books to be forgiven in the first half of the year and, therefore, total loans are expected to be down for the year due to these payoffs. as sean noted, we've engaged a third-party to expedite new ppp loans, and so these won't show up on our balance sheet. we're hoping to see up to 50% of the volume that we handled on the first round and expect to receive some fee income as well as the related deposits. we expect total earning assets to also reflect the ppp runoff as well as the sales of mid-atlantic loan balances as part of the branch sale. additionally, investment securities may come down as we allow higher costing wholesale funds to run off without replacement. on the liability side, for the fourth quarter, adjusting for the branch sale, along with payroll deposits and broker balances, all other total deposits increased 1% for the quarter. wholesale funds decreased to approximately $1.2 billion at year-end compared to $1.5 billion at the end of the third quarter and $2 billion at the start of the year. looking forward, we expect to see organic deposit growth in the low single digits in 2021, while we expect to further pay down broker deposits and borrowings with total wholesale funds decreasing to $1 billion or less by year-end.
turning back to the income statement. net interest income was down a couple of percent in the fourth quarter due to the decrease in average earning assets with no change in the margin. we moved down the cost of deposits to support the margin, including reducing broker deposits, pricing down maturing time accounts and reclassifying the higher cost mid-atlantic deposits as held for sale. loan interest income was negatively impacted by the increase in nonaccruing loans and benefited from revenue recognition from ppp loan forgiveness. looking forward, we expect to continue to see further margin benefit as we focus on deposits repricing down more than assets. we expect asset yields to benefit from the change in mix toward more core lending. the income benefit from this is likely to be more than offset by the impact of lower-earning assets. separately, we expect that the net interest income benefit from additional ppp loan forgiveness will be mostly recognized in the first half of the year. the balance of unamortized deferred ppp fees stood at $13 million at year-end 2020. moving to fee income. we had good results in the fourth quarter across most categories, except for mortgage banking, which is normally seasonally lower. we continue to target $19 million to $20 million in quarterly fee income in the new year. moving to provision expense. we recorded $10 million in the fourth quarter. the increase from the prior quarter primarily reflected the impact of higher nonaccruals on the qualitative component of our model. future provision expense will depend significantly on the severity of the pandemic and its impact in our markets.
turning to expenses. total gaap expense decreased primarily due to the non-core costs related to the ceo separation recorded in the third quarter. core noninterest expense increased by $4 million primarily due to the loan servicing related project, i mentioned earlier, along with the impact of problem loan-related costs. looking forward, we're targeting to manage core noninterest expense down below $70 million per quarter in the second half of the year after our branch initiatives are completed. the benefit from our branch initiatives is expected to initially be partially offset by loan-related expense. regarding taxes, we had a tax benefit for the year, primarily due to the higher provision expense. in 2021, we expect to have a core tax rate in the area of 15%. as we've previously noted, we expect to record a net gain on the sale of the mid-atlantic operations and charges related to the planned consolidation of 16 branches. we expect to report these as non-core items during the first half of the year. based on the asset decline from ppp loans, we expect to be operating with lower assets in 2021, while we also target earnings that will continue to build capital. our financial focus is on improving our return on equity and we're hopeful that conditions will be supportive of that objective as we move through 2021. before i close, i'd like to share that i previously had the opportunity to work alongside our new ceo, and i'm looking forward to doing so again in nitin's new role as the leader of our team here at berkshire. with that, i'll turn the call back over to sean.
sean a. gray -- acting president and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie. our guidance demonstrates that we're leaning in to our operating plan by tightening our focus and building our core business and our footprint and in support of our community bank mission. we announced our branch sale and consolidation initiatives during the quarter. these initiatives were under development for several months, and they're consistent with the strategy of focusing on core operations and core markets. they also reflect our smart blend of technology and flexible personalized service including our distinctive mybanker concierge bankers. our 2021 results will have some noise as we transition through these initiatives and through what we hope will be the final pandemic year. our focus will be on strengthening our purpose-driven community bank. the year 2020 has reaffirmed the premise that purposeful and constructive community engagement will attract customer preference and give us the opportunity to build market share, profitability and long-run investment value. i'm very proud of our team's work this year in responding to the health and financial needs that we encounter. throughout the entire pandemic, we continued to prioritize the safety of our customers and employees, operating flexibly to offer the best service possible within the constraints of government guidelines and mandates. we proactively brought federal borrower relief programs to our markets, including ppp loans and qualifying loan modification. we adjusted our deposit fees and transaction limits to facilitate changes in customer activity.
our employee volunteer teams continued to provide targeted community service, and our foundation increased its philanthropic giving to support the organizations and people impacted the most by the pandemic. we look forward to applying the same energy, creativity and flexibility to the challenges ahead of us by implementing our initiatives and strengthening our competitive advantages in the core geographies that we serve best based on our be first values and commitment to diversity, equity and social responsibility, our local regionalized decision-making and community support, our previous investments in internal and customer-facing technology, our coordinated relationship service with special emphasis on our mybanker personalized bankers. and our disciplined focus on core business activities and our growing business lines, including asset-based lending, sba lending and wealth management. our earnings materials highlight the improved rankings that we are achieving as a socially responsible investment vehicle. we welcome further interest from shareholders who value investments in companies with solidly demonstrated performance in advancing social values. together with our dedication to earning the cost of our capital, we believe this positions our stock attractively as a preferred investment vehicle. i'll close by thanking the entire organization for its support during these past three months. we came together as a team under trying circumstances and delivered well for all of our stakeholders.
the passion, energy and dedication with which you attack the hurdle set in front of us is a credit to your high character and mental toughness. i will be forever grateful to have had the opportunity to be your leader during this transition, and i am looking forward to continuing to build on the positive momentum we've created. with that, i'll ask the operator to open the lines up for questions.

we will now being the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question comes from mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler. please go ahead.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler & co.
hey, guys. good morning.
sean a. gray -- acting president and chief executive officer
hey, mark.
james m. moses -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
good morning, mark.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler & co.
given your comments around balance sheet growth, looking sort of modest in the new year and the fact that your capital ratios have continued to build. i guess i'm curious at what point you'd be comfortable restarting stock repurchases?
james m. moses -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. i think that's a good question, mark. i mean, that's something, obviously, that we are always looking at reevaluate the best way possible for us to get the highest returns for our shareholders. it's something that we are -- we always consider. and of course, from a strategic perspective, i haven't spoken with nitin about this. and so i'm sure he's going to have opinions about the ability -- our ability to invest in either growth or capital actions like this. so, likely more thoughts about that on the next call.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler & co.
okay. and then of the $199 million of cre deferrals that you have, can you give us a sense for what types of cre credits they are and if they are may be concentrated in any particular part of your footprint? thank you.
sean a. gray -- acting president and chief executive officer
georgia. if you don't mind providing a little color there, i think that'd be great.
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
sure. absolutely. hi, mark. approximately about $146 million of the $199 million is in the hospitality book. the remaining $14 million is -- i'm sorry, the remaining is just spread out among some -- there's a little bit of retail in there. it's just smaller, just other credits.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler & co.
okay. and it's -- how did you --
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
hospitality
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler & co.
i'm sorry, i apologize. i didn't hear that.
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
i'm sorry. the bulk of it, like i said, $146 million of it is hospitality. the rest is spread out among various other sectors.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler & co.
and is it geographically concentrated in any particular area?
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
well, the hospitality portfolio is pretty diversified between massachusetts, new york. so i don't have the exact breakout, but i wouldn't say there would be any significant concentrations. so we can definitely follow-up with that.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler & co.
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from laurie hunsicker with compass point. please go ahead.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
yeah. hi. good morning. i'm just hoping that we can say on credits here that -- and just some of these details, and i appreciate how you've laid them out in the slide. so maybe just starting with retail. if you can give us what the balance is on retail, what the credit size is, what the non-accruals are, what the charge-offs are? and then maybe when you're --
sean a. gray -- acting president and chief executive officer
georgia, i think you -- yes.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
yeah. go ahead.
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
yeah. laurie, i've got some of that information available. the balances for retail are $864 million. and i'm not sure if you asked for the deferral amount on retail. that's about $6.5 million of that portfolio is currently in deferral, the rest is all resumed active payment. and i'm sorry, you're also -- i don't have the breakout of how much of that portfolio is criticized, but i can get that to you.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. and then -- yeah, and i was wondering how much of that is also on nonaccruals?
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
the nonaccrual piece, again, i don't have an exact number, but i can definitely follow-up with you. yeah, i don't have the exact number for you on the nonaccruals.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay, great. and i think there was maybe some confusion. if you could just give us a little bit of color around the retail book, i certainly was under the impression that a quarter of it was mall exposure. but can you help us think about how much of that is actually indoor mall, not to be confused with outdoor centers that are anchored by grocery?
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
yes. no, out of the $864 million, we have two components, $273 million, which we call the community center malls, which are the larger outdoor malls. and then we have the neighborhood centers and strip malls, which are also outdoor malls, but just smaller in square footage. so those two pieces make up roughly $525 million of the $864 million in retail exposure. the majority of that is either anchored by grocery, big box, or yeah, pretty much, most of it is anchored by either grocery or a big box tenant.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. and then on...
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
yeah, just to be clear, laurie, we have no, like indoor type mall exposure, that's just not something we've ever focused on. all of our retail exposure is to those outdoor type malls.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. and then just one more question on that, do you have anything that you would consider anchored by movie theaters?
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
nothing is anchored by a movie theater. we do have a large outdoor mall that is anchored by a costco that has a movie theater in it, but costco is the major anchor on that mall.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay, perfect. that's super helpful. okay. and then leisure and excluding firestone, can you give us the balances on leisure, excluding firestone in terms of what's leisure, what's the deferred, what's the credit size? what's the nonaccrual there?
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
leisure is $112 million. oh, i'm sorry, sean.
sean a. gray -- acting president and chief executive officer
no, go ahead, georgia. give the details, and i can provide a little color.
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
all right. yeah, leisure is $112 million of exposure, and $14 million of that exposure is currently in deferral.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. and then do you have the criticized amount and the nonaccrual amount for that, or i can circle back with you if you don't have that?
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
yeah. why don't i get back to you on that? i just want to make sure i give you the correct number.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay, great. and then -- and i'm sorry, sean, i cut you off, did you have comments?
sean a. gray -- acting president and chief executive officer
just on the leisure excluding firestone, as we look at that portfolio, very strong credits, very good collateral coverage, incredibly strong guarantors, composition of golf course, marinas of strong relationship borrowers to the bank, so very different. i know we call it leisure, but very different than the leisure that is included in firestone. so i just want to make that distinguish that difference.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. okay. and then firestone, jamie, can you help us think about of the provision this quarter of $10 million, how much of that was firestone related, or just -- any other color in the details you provided on firestone were super helpful in the deck.
james m. moses -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. sure, laurie. i mean, that's not something that we really get into too much. i mean, i would think that -- i guess, i would say that some of the provision that we had this quarter was definitely related to firestone, but not necessarily any more than anything else that we were doing. so some piece of that was, i think, in general, you look at the amount of criticized loans in firestone, so $83 million. so we have one-third or so of that. but only $5 million of it's on non-accrual at the moment. so i think that we think about that portfolio as certainly being of elevated risk in the same way that we look at our hospitality and restaurants. but at the moment, we're seeing pretty good performance from that portfolio, especially, when you consider that 94% of the deferrals that we have in that portfolio are paying interest to us right now. so certainly an elevated concern, but nothing that is massively impacting our provision or allowance at the moment.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. and do you have the -- what were the charge-offs for the quarter in firestone?
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
yes, laurie, i have that -- that's $1.5 million.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
$1.5 million. okay. okay, great. and then, i guess, just jumping over -- just one more question on firestone. do you have a geographical breakdown? or just even your most concentrated states on that exposure, i don't think we've had an update on that in six years.
sean a. gray -- acting president and chief executive officer
laurie, i'm sean, i can take this from -- i can give general -- and georgia, if you've got it broken down a little greater that would be fine too. we don't have a concentration in any one state over the 11%. from an overall geographies it's predominantly the south, the northeast and the west coast. maybe, georgia, is there more color you can provide?
georgia melas -- executive vice president, chief credit officer
you know, just roughly, i think, last quarter, laurie, you had asked how much of it was in our footprint. our footprint is probably makes up 20% to 25% of the firestone exposure. the rest is spread out among many, many states, like sean said, none larger than 11%.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. okay. that's helpful. and, i guess, just with respect to the branch consolidation and thinking -- and sorry, this is shifting gears, the branch consolidation and thinking about expenses. jamie, can you help us think about how that's going to actually flow through a little tighter? i think you mentioned in the back half of the year, but can you help us think about how that's going to flow through in terms of where we would actually expect to see a core run rate layering in the fact that you probably all start going to have some technology spend? thanks.
james m. moses -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. i think -- yes. so i think that we talked about in my remarks about sub-$70 million expense run rate by q4. and i think that's -- i think we're in a pretty good range there. i think somewhere $65 million to $70 million back half of the year and on a go-forward, i think, is where we're targeting at the moment.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
great. thank you. i will leave at that.
james m. moses -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you.

good morning, and welcome to the berkshire hills bancorp first quarter earnings release conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to kevin conn, head of investor relations and corporate development. please go ahead.
kevin conn -- head of investor relations
thank you, jason. good morning, and thank you for joining berkshire bank's first quarter earnings call. my name is kevin conn, and i'm the head of investor relations and corporate development at berkshire bank. i started in this role about a month ago after spending over 23 years as an institutional investor at sanford bernstein, mfs investments and hudson executive capital. our news release is available on the investor relations section of our website, berkshirebank.com, and will be furnished to the sec. supplemental investor information is provided in an information presentation at our website at irberkshirebank.com, and we will refer to this in our remarks. our remarks will include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those statements. for details, please see our earnings release and most recent sec reports on forms 10-k and 10-q. in addition, certain non-gaap financial measures will be discussed in this conference call. references to non-gaap measures are only provided to assist you in understanding our results and performance trends and should not be relied on as financial measures of actual results or future projections. a comparison and reconciliation to gaap measures is included in our news release. on the call today, we have nitin mhatre, president and chief executive officer of berkshire hills bancorp; shaun dwyer, chief operating officer; subhadeep basu, our chief financial officer; and our chief risk officer, greg lindenmuth, is on the call to answer any credit-related questions.
at this time, i'll turn the call over to our ceo, nitin mhatre.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
thank you, kevin. good morning, everyone, and welcome to berkshire's first quarter earnings call. for those of you who are new to our story or new to me, let me first share some of my background prior to joining berkshire bank. i've worked in banking for 25 years in very large and midsized organizations and have had the opportunity to turn around, transform and grow business units over that time. i believe that my experience positions me well to work with my team at berkshire bank to significantly improve financial performance and stakeholder value. i must say i'm deeply humbled by and grateful for the warm welcome and support that i've received from my berkshire colleagues and the board of directors and also from various partners and well wishers across the industry, including many of you on the call. thank you so much. i'm confident that with new leadership, our new strategic plan in the making, which i'll address later; and the collective resolve of the organization to maximize value for all stakeholders, we will fulfill our promise while meaningfully improving financial performance of this community-dedicated institutions. before i provide the highlights of the quarter, i'd like to share some of my early observations as i complete three months today as berkshire's ceo. first, i want to salute what i know to be exceptionally good about the organization, starting with its score, a strong, 175-year history of being a purpose-driven, community-dedicated bank that truly cares about its customers, bankers and the communities. and we have some remarkably talented bankers who know our markets really well, have built strong relationships with the customers and communities in those markets and have noncustomer-facing bankers who are passionate about delivering high-quality experience to all our customers.
building from that strong core, we clearly have opportunities for improvement, beginning with developing a clearer strategic imperative, specifically identifying the businesses, markets and products we will invest in to grow. we need to double down on what we are best at and most passionate about and what drives our economic engine because there, and nowhere else, is where we'll allocate capital and key resources as we drive for economic profit. as we consider our strategic choices, there is much to be done right away. one, we need to significantly improve channels and processes to jump start our revenue engine. our current levels of originations and relationship deepening are not commensurate with our potential. two, we need to accelerate our road map to digitize customer journeys from loan originations through servicing to integrating state-of-the-art platforms that are built as platform as a service. three, we need to reorient all of our programs to be singularly focused on delivering exceptional customer experience and driving to industry-leading customer satisfaction and net promoter scores, all of which, i believe, will ultimately lead to improved shareholder value. with that, let's turn to our earnings presentation, beginning on slide three, and a few important quarterly highlights. first, and driving home the points i just communicated, is a new leadership team at the helm in choosing energy into the culture, executing on near-term priorities and building together a transformational strategy. i'll touch on our new executive leadership in a few minutes and where we are in our strategic journey toward the end of my prepared remarks. second is the improving income and strengthening balance sheet. some of these highlights that you see on the slide include gaap eps $0.26 compared to a loss of $0.40 in the year-ago period.
core or adjusted eps was $0.32 in the first quarter. noninterest-bearing deposits were up 37% year-over-year, while the cost of funds were down to 48 basis points versus 111 basis points in q1 '20. loan balances were down due to paydowns and portfolio [indecipherable] exceeding new originations. we are rebuilding our organic growth muscle by improving originations and building our pipeline with quality opportunities, as shaun will highlight later. the third highlight is the strides we've made in strength in credit and asset quality. overall trends in credit and asset quality were highly encouraging. loan modifications were down by 86% from their peak at second quarter of last year and by 39% quarter-over-quarter. nonperforming assets were up modestly year-over-year but improved on a sequential basis, down 14% quarter-over-quarter. net charge-offs declined by 5% and 42% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, respectively. during the quarter, we also completed a comprehensive, bottoms-up credit review of our covid-sensitive portfolios, along with a thorough external validation of critical segment of the firestone portfolio. fourth highlight is our laser focus on enhancing customer experience, especially through our digital channels. while we have ways to go, we're gaining traction and drove some early improvements in the first quarter. for example, online banking and mobile banking users increased by 11% and 14% year-over-year, and our mobile app rating increased significantly to about 4.5 stars on ios and android platforms. digital deposit account openings as a percentage of total accounts opened grew from below 2% in q1 '20 to over 7% this quarter. like i said earlier, we have ways to go but are certainly headed in the right direction on this front. finally, we're focused on our capital levels and sustaining our financial flexibility to invest for growth and returns.
capital levels remained very strong with 1q '21 common equity tier one ratio of 14%. as part of our transformational plan, we'll sharpen our focus on capital allocations and fund those businesses with the highest potential for return on equity in excess of cost of capital. as you saw in our 8-k released last night, we also plan to return capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. over time, we expect to deploy capital through profitable balance sheet growth. however, given our capital levels, the board and i believe that returning capital to shareholders via share buyback is a prudent course of action. i'm pleased to report that the board has authorized a share buyback of up to 2.5 million shares equal to about 5% of outstanding shares. with that, please turn to slide four to review some of the organizational highlights. i'm excited to introduce subhadeep basu, who joined as our new cfo in march. prior to joining berkshire bank, he worked at bank of america, citigroup and, most recently, at state street. over his 23 years of banking experience, subhadeep earned increasing roles of responsibility across finance functions. a key executive leader and a partner, he will play an important role in our strategic transformation and driving improved financial performance. next is kevin conn, who you heard from earlier in the call and who joined as our new head of investor relations and corporate development. kevin has served on the buy side for over 23 years and will play an important role as we strengthen our investor relations program. in addition, we've hired several senior leaders or promoted new, high-potential candidates to key roles. selected examples of the ongoing talent infusion includes [indecipherable], who joined us from state street as the new head of fp&a and angela dixon, who joined as our new chief diversity officer, leading our d&i initiatives.
previously, angela was the president of dixon consulting, a management consulting firm focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. additionally, we're making a few changes in the board. as you may have seen in our proxy, the board has nominated two new directors, as set forth in a cooperation agreement between berkshire and holdco asset management, under which we agreed to nominate michael zaitzeff from holdco; and a new independent director, deborah bailey, selected by berkshire. michael is the co-founder and managing director of holdco's general partners and has served on numerous corporate boards, oversight committees and creditor committees. deborah bailey has a distinguished career in both public and private sectors. she currently sits on the [indecipherable] board of governors. her prior government regulatory experienced with the occ and federal reserve bank board includes a role as the deputy director of banking supervision and regulation, where she was a direct report to federal reserve chairman, ben bernanke. she has also held positions as the managing director at kpmg and deloitte & touche. we're grateful that michael and deborah have agreed to serve on our board and look forward to their contributions. i also wanted to share that david brunelle has been promoted to white's chair of the board. david has served on our board for three years and has over 20 years of business experience in financial services. in addition, he is current chair of our audit committee and member of our governance and nominating company. finally, i'd like to express my sincere thanks to neil mahoney and jeff templeton, who are retiring as of may 20, 2021. both neil and jeff have been on our board since 2005, and we're deeply rate for their contributions to berkshire bank. we wish them well always.
with that, i'll turn it over to subhadeep to review the financials in more detail.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, nitin. i'm excited to be part of the team here at berkshire bank. now if you turn to slide five. i'd like to share high-level p&l with you on both a gaap and an adjusted basis. as a reminder, the adjusted basis excludes $3.5 million of expenses pertaining to primarily our branch-consolidation activities. our gaap revenues were up 10% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter as strength in fee revenues offset weaker net interest income. gaap noninterest expenses were up about 10% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter on higher legal and advisory fees and $3.5 million of restructuring expenses that was driven primarily by branch consolidation. credit provision expenses dropped to $6.5 million, down 35% versus the fourth quarter and down 81% year-over-year due to improved economic forecast and reduced net charge-offs. our tax position was 22% of pre-tax income this quarter. adjusted revenues were down marginally year-over-year, primarily due to weaker net interest income. it was up 6% quarter-over-quarter with strength in fee income, offset by weaker net interest income. adjusted expenses were up about 5% quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven primarily by higher legal and advisory fees. adjusted eps was $0.32 in the quarter versus $0.28 in the last quarter, and adjusted return on tangible common equity was 6.44% versus 5.5%. turning to slide six. let me address changes in our earning assets. earning assets were up modestly on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis with a mix shift from loans into investment securities. loans, excluding held for [indecipherable], were down 16% year-over-year and 8% versus the fourth quarter. mortgage balances were down 34% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by prepayments.
our consumer loan book was down 31% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower home equity loan originations and strategic loan runoff from our indirect auto loan book. the commercial and industrial loan book was down quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to ppp forgiveness that accounted for approximately $190 million decline in commercial and industrial loan balances. our commercial real estate balances were down due to market conditions resulting in weaker loan demand. our loan book will also be impacted by the planned sale of the eight mid-atlantic branches around midyear 2021, which have about $300 million in loans. our total investment book was up 67% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter in response to the growth in deposits and weaker loan demand. our longer-term investment portfolio was up 26% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. it is highly liquid with over 80% of the portfolio consisting of agency moderate projects and seller notes. our short-term investment book was also up significantly, driven by deposit growth and mutual demand for loans. we plan to redeploy that liquidity primarily for paying down high-cost borrowings, enhancing investment book yields and supporting loan growth. slide seven shows our average liabilities. given the growth in deposits, we have a unique opportunity to shift our funding from wholesale to lower-cost deposits. higher cost funding from fhlb borrowings and brokered cds are down significantly. the combination of the above have enabled us to significantly lower our cost of funds from 48 basis points -- to 48 basis points from 111 basis points a year ago, a 59% reduction in funding costs. slide eight shows our net interest margin trends. net interest income and net interest margin dropped from the first to second quarter of 2020 as interest rates declined. over the last three quarters, net interest margin has been stable, and net interest income has been down modestly.
wholesale funding, which includes fhlb borrowings and brokered deposits, is down 57% since year-end 2019 and 26% since year-end 2020. higher cost borrowings are down $379 million from year-end 2019 or 46%, and broker cds are down $777 million or 64%. moving on to slide nine. slide nine shows our adjusted fee revenues. we had broad-based fee revenue growth in the first quarter, up 70% year-over-year and up 34% quarter-over-quarter. loan fees were up on strength in sb originations, asset-based lending originations and also on swap fees related to cre loans. i'd note that loan fees include $1.5 million of ppp referral fees, which will not recur after the second quarter. it also includes adjustments for our swap contracts and msr valuations. wealth management fees were up 7%, and insurance revenue was up 3% year-over-year. both businesses are seasonal and are subject to fee cyclicality with higher fee revenues typically in the first quarter of the year. on slide 10, we show our adjusted expenses. they were up 5% on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. professional services fees were above our usual quarterly run rate on higher digital and advisory expenses. we expect those expenses to moderate during the course of the year. excluding professional services expenses, all of the total expenses were down 1% year-over-year. loan processing expenses were lower due to lower loan volumes. as discussed earlier, our $3.5 million of restructuring expenses were primarily attributable to our branch-consolidation activities. slide 11 is a summary of our asset quality metrics, which show encouraging signs. loan modifications have dropped to $214 million, which is down 86% from the peak in the second quarter of last year.
nonaccrual loans are up modestly year-over-year but down 14% versus the fourth quarter, and net charge-offs are down 42% versus the fourth quarter. we are cautiously optimistic about our credit exposures. we expect credit provisions and charge-offs to trend toward prepandemic levels over the next year or so. slide 12 shows our exposure and credit metrics for covid-sensitive segments, including hospitality, firestone, restaurants and nursing-assisted living loan books. quarter-over-quarter, our loan balances are down, our criticized assets are down and our covid-related loan deferrals and nonaccruals are also down significantly. the sequential quarter trends are very encouraging. slide 13 and 14 include more granular details on our covid-sensitive loan portfolios. again, overall trends are encouraging, and deferrals across these portfolios have declined quarter-over-quarter with declines ranging between 25% and 71%. slide 15 shows detail on our capital and liquidity positions. our capital levels remain very strong. our executed common equity tier one capital ratio ended the first quarter at about 14%. as of fourth quarter of 2020, our common equity tier one ratio was about 230 basis points higher than our peer median ratios. our capital structure is also very robust with high-quality common equity tier one capital accounting for 98% of tier one capital and 88% of total capital. as nitin alluded to earlier, we are singularly focused on instilling discipline around effective capital deployment and earning returns that maximize franchise and shareholder value. the share buybacks discussed earlier is one of the key steps toward that goal. also, with the deposit-to-loan ratio of 75%, we are well positioned to fund future loan growth.
in summary, this was an encouraging quarter wherein we had revenue growth, primarily driven by increased fee income; a steady downward trend in funding costs; improved asset quality trends, including in covid-sensitive segments; lower credit provisions; and strong capital and liquidity positions. we also continue to see muted demand for loans. i'd like to close with comments on our outlook. first, the most recent moody's economic forecast points to a significant recovery in the u.s., specifically, a 6.5% gdp growth in 2021. vaccinations have also progressed at a rapid rate with about 30% of the u.s. population vaccinated. massachusetts, connecticut and new york, states where our footprint is concentrated, have vaccination rates that are higher than the national average. while we are upbeat about the economic forecasts and vaccination progress, weaker loan trends seen in recent quarters are expected to persist for us and likely for the industry. it's still early in the year, but we expect modest decline in loan balances for the remainder of the year, both driven by the time to economic recovery and ramp-up of origination pipeline, run-off of the ppp loans and certain loan book balances. we estimate about $450 million of ppp-related loan runoff between first quarter 2021 and year-end. the estimated impact of ppp on nii for first quarter of '21 was $6.6 million. we expect core nii for the remainder of the year to be flat to down modestly. we expect net interest margin to modestly improve over the course of the year. we expect organic deposits to be flat to up modestly during the course of 2021. on wholesale funding, we expect to further beat our maturing wholesale funds during the course of 2021 and further lower our cost of funds.
based on current economic forecast and our portfolio composition, we expect a meaningful, improved credit environment over time, and the credit provision expenses will trend toward prepandemic levels in 2022. we also expect that we'll get to day one cecl reserves to loan ratio in 2022. i caution that our credits can be lumpy, so we don't expect a straight line on provision expenses or charge-offs. we expect fees to return to normal levels in the second quarter from the high level in first quarter but remain stable to up modestly off that lower base. on a run rate basis, we expect second quarter expenses to moderate. consistent with our previous guidance, we expect to trend below $70 million in expenses by end of year. however, in light of nitin's earlier comments and in addition to expenses, we are focused on optimizing efficiency ratios. and we expect our tax rate for 2021 to be around 15% to 16%.
with that, i'll hand over to shaun.
shaun dwyer -- chief operating officer
thank you, subhadeep, and it's been a pleasure collaborating with you since your arrival. i'd like to begin by sharing some of our key operational highlights from the first quarter, which are collectively positioning the company toward a bright and innovative future. i'm on slide 16. we have several ongoing initiatives aimed at transforming our community bank model, including the continued optimization of our branch network. we remain laser focused on executing our previously announced branch-optimization initiatives to strengthen our franchise. this includes the consolidation of 16 branches, nine of which were completed in the first quarter. the majority of the remaining branches are targeted for consolidation by midyear, and we expect to maintain our strong history of deposit retention. the sale of our eight mid-atlantic branches in new jersey and pennsylvania is on track and scheduled to be completed by midyear, pending necessary regulatory approvals. the branch sale is expected to include more than $600 million in deposits and $300 million in loans. effective optimization of our branch network allows us to meet changing customer needs, reinvesting those savings into the right blend of personalized service and the latest digital technology to enable a seamless customer experience. the combination of our branch-optimization efforts, the 16 plant consolidations plus the sale of the eight mid-atlantic branches will reduce our overall branch footprint by 18%, bringing our branch count to 106. moving on to slide 17. we will continue to evaluate our banking channels supported by our mybanker, which provides highly personalized service, digital offerings and financial advisement. our mybankers have a track record of customer and portfolio growth and continue to be instrumental in retaining our client base and deposits post consolidation.
as a result, we expect our mybanker program to be an area of growth and a proven alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar channels. recently, there has been several significant bank merger announcements in our markets. these transactions create disruption in the market and opportunities for all our bankers to begin forging new relationships and strengthen existing ones. in mid-june, we will open a commercial office in providence, rhode island, and that will serve as a hub for lending activities in support of our eastern connecticut and rhode island markets. as i noted above, we will continue to meet changing customer needs, including increased digital adoption by accelerating and executing our digital transformation road map. this will allow us to create a full omni-channel customer experience that combines the personalized service of traditional banks with value-added digital offerings. we've already completed a number of technology infrastructure projects aimed at improving operational efficiency and the customer experience. this includes the launch of our best-in-class digital account-opening platform we're excited to provide customers with a frictionless experience, allowing them to open an account in just over two minutes, which is four times faster than the industry average. during the last quarter, we saw additional progress from our initiatives, including a remarkable increase in our mobile app rating, increasing significantly to about a 4.5-star rating in the apple app store and google android platform. we expect to make additional enhancements to our mobile app to better serve our customers in the upcoming quarter. this progress builds on the existing infrastructure investments made in our consumer ebanking, enterprisewide esignature and additional salesforce api integration.
we'll continue to periodically keep you updated on the progress and impact of these initiatives. now while loan demand is muted based on excess liquidity in the market, we are seeing our share of potential deals, as outlined on slide 18 of our presentation. our overall pipelines are increasing toward prepandemic levels. our teams are active in our communities, and we continue to be selective to maintain our credit and pricing discipline in a competitive market. commercial originations are up quarter-over-quarter, as are residential mortgages. our abl group has had a strong start to the year, bolstered by key new hires. we also made additions to our business banking and private banking teams to strengthen our position and ability to support our boston area customers. we produced solid benefits for our communities, customers and shareholders during the quarter. with over 8,000 applications processed successfully, we were able to save approximately 100,000 jobs on the payrolls of small- and medium-sized businesses through the ppp program. our efforts not only helped us generate additional income for the bank but was instrumental in supporting thousands of small businesses on our main street. now since the start of the ppp program last year, we have assisted our markets with nearly $1 billion in ppp loans. on the socially responsible front, we were added to the bloomberg gender equality index in 2020 and were named a best place to work for lgbtq equality by the human rights campaign. these accolades demonstrate the collective actions of all of our team members and will help enable us to become the leading, socially responsible, omni-channel community bank.
with that, i'll turn it over to nitin.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
thank you, shaun. before we open it up to questions, i want to provide a quick update on where we are in terms of our new strategic plan. i'm on slide 19. since the day i arrived, we've been working on a transformational, strategic plan that will significantly improve berkshire's financial performance while building on our core values and purpose. we are building this plan organically with inputs and commitments from senior leaders of the bank. we have internally branded this as berkshire's exciting strategic transformation, or best. at a high level, best has three foundational pillars: optimize, digitize and enhance. the first pillar, optimize, will drive efficiencies across our channels, geographies, processes, business segments and optimize our balance sheet. the second pillar, digitize, will deliver personalized online experiences across customer journeys for customers and consumers and businesses alike. we believe our efforts will result in a highly differentiated omni-channel experience and deliver top-quartile customer satisfaction levels and net promoter score. the third pillar is enhance, through which we will enhance engagement, experience and value proposition for our bankers and customers, including improved customer segmentation and relationship deepening, which will lead to growth in balances and wallet share over time. overall, best plan is focused on transformation through organic growth, whereby we'll focus on getting better before we get bigger.
we believe that with successful launch and execution of best, we will become the leading, socially responsible, omni-channel community bank in the markets we serve. so what does that ultimately mean? what it means is through the execution of this program, we'll deliver the return on equity in excess of our cost of capital in approximately three years. and over that period, we'll improve our efficiency ratio by over 10%. we will be in the top quartile of customer satisfaction and net promoter score in the markets that we serve. and we will be in the top quartile of esg indexes nationally. we look forward to sharing more details of our strategy at our virtual strategy update call scheduled for may 18, and we'll provide more details in the coming weeks. in closing, having worked with the leadership team over the last three months, i can assure you that we're moving forward with a sense of urgency, collective resolve, passion and confidence to prove that berkshire, with its purpose-driven, community-dedicated culture, now enabled by our best program, is ready to transform our performance to enhance returns for all our stakeholders.
thank you. and with that, i'd like to open up the floor for questions. jason?

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from laurie hunsicker from compass point.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
yes. love seeing the buyback. i appreciate all the details in the press release and the deck and the details on credit. but just wondered, maybe subhadeep, if you can help us a little bit. you said core net interest income, flat to down. and i'm just trying to walk through this very high level, like, first, your net interest income currently of $75.1 million. there was 6.6 of ppp. so -- and obviously, you'll have ppp for the rest of this year. but assuming that's out, assuming that the accretion income, which was $1.5 million, normalizes to below $1 million, assuming the sale to isc completes, maybe that's another $2 million out, and then you've got some of these higher-risk, higher-yielding loan books running down like firestone, which is great they're running down, but that comes out. so i'm suddenly sitting at an adjusted nii core of $65 million, $66 million. so potentially, i'm missing something. and so if you can just step us through maybe just a little bit more details around nii, around net interest margin, how we should think about that, maybe even from a cleanup standpoint as we fast forward several quarters, that would be really helpful.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure, laurie. thanks, and let me just jump in here and, obviously, happy taking more questions around that. so obviously, as you pointed out, that's a key component of our p&l. so as we pointed out and i pointed out earlier in my prepared remarks, $6.5 million dbp impact. having said that, and we have around $450 million in ppp loans to the trading of the balance sheet as well as our sale of mid-atlantic branches with around $300 million in assets, right? so my remark focused around core nii, which is ex ppp, which we're expecting to be around sort of flat to modestly down to the end of the year. where we're expecting sort of the ins and outs as part of this is we're expecting deposit growth in sort of profitable deposits. we're expecting to be down wholesale funding and lower our cost of deposits. and obviously, we are -- there is a pipeline that shaun referred to in terms of growth in loans on the different books that we are focusing on. i think combination of that is where -- based on which our guidance was around flat, core nii to be flat toward the end of the year.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. so sorry, just to fine-tune this a little bit more. if i'm looking at this, thinking $65 million, $66 million of nii a quarter, is that right? or am i missing something larger? can you just help me think about that a little bit?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. i think -- so without getting into sort of a lot of details, and happy to take you offline in terms of where our head is at, we're probably looking at around between $66 million to $68 million of nii fourth quarter.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. great. that's helpful. and then the sale to isdc, i had in my notes originally that was closing on or about april 23, and it looks like that's delayed as -- is there any reason that's delayed? or how should we be thinking about that?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
no. so i think discussions are ongoing, and our expected closure date is in the second quarter. but shaun, if you want to add more color to that.
shaun dwyer -- chief operating officer
sp04 yes, our internal projections, we had it at midyear to give some time for necessary regulatory approvals, but all things are moving forward appropriately.
operator
the next question comes from mark fitzgibbon from piper sandler.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler -- analyst
i wondered, first, nitin, you may want to hold off answering this until your may 18 call. but i guess i was just curious, under your new three-year plan, is the balance sheet likely to be bigger or smaller than it is today, would you guess?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. i think i weaved that into my comments. it's going to get better before we get bigger, as i described it. so i think in the initial part of it, we're going to rebalance the balance sheet, and then it will start growing. so you'll see the exact cadence of it when we connect on may 18.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and i know that you closed those nine branches, and obviously, you're closing -- or selling the new jersey branches shortly. i guess i was curious, are you also considering selling other geographies?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. i'll let shaun go first and then share my comments as well.
shaun dwyer -- chief operating officer
so mark, i think -- and with the speed of digital adoption taking pace, i think you have to continuously be looking at branch optimization. so we do go through a very thorough process. can't comment on specific geographies, but we will continue to look at all of our branches. and obviously, with this most -- with the most recent reductions, we're reducing the branch footprint by about 18%.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then so assuming moderate or shrinkage of the balance sheet, you'll continue to create capital. should we think about this buyback program as the first in a line of potentially many programs as a means for absorbing excess capital?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. mark, i think, just an outset, i would say we're obviously pleased to reinstate our share buyback program, per gaap, i think, was about 18 months. we absolutely think it's a step in the right direction as we continue to look for ways to deploy capital that maximize the shareholder value. and like you said, that will be an ongoing process. so we'll keep you updated as and when we consider these actions.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then lastly, just to clarify on the tax rate. i think the guidance you gave was 15% to 16% for the rest of this year. should we expect that, over time, the tax credit business will shrink and the effective rate will drift upward?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
mark, this is subhadeep. no, i think we're going to continue with our tax credit program, and the sort of the increase in tax rate that you saw was because of sort of the timing of our tax credits that goes on and off our income statement. so you're going to see the impact of additional tax credits going into the rest of the year and beyond.
operator
there are no more questions in the queue. this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to nitin mhatre for any closing remarks.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
thank you all for joining us today and your interest in berkshire. i hope you'll be able to join us on may 18 as we detail our plans to transform berkshire. in the meantime, have a great day, and be well. jason, you can close the call now. thank you.

in june, we welcomed two new board members, deborah bailey and michael zaitzeff to their first board meeting, and we've also been building out berkshire team, which i'll address later in the call.
let's turn to our earnings presentation, beginning on slide 3. we had a strong quarter with solid financials, improved asset quality, continued capital deployment and the launch of our transformational best strategy as the key highlights of the quarter. in terms of financials, we had a good year-over-year trend across all key financial metrics, that drove improved eps and return on tangible common equity or rotce. adjusted eps was $0.44, up $0.12 quarter-over-quarter and up $0.57 year-over-year. revenue improved year-over-year and declined slightly from q1. net interest income was stable once again and fee revenue strengthened year-over-year. increased consumer spending drove interchange fees higher, while strong gain on sale from higher sba loan originations increased loan related fees. expenses were down across the board on both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. lower compensation and lower professional services, expenses drove much of the improvement. subhadeep will share more details on this in a few minutes.
on credit, what a difference two quarters make. asset quality has shown consistent improvement over past two quarters with delinquencies, non-accruals, charge-offs all down quarter-over-quarter driven by improving economic conditions and proactive loss mitigation programs. we are well reserved for credit and i'm grateful to our credit and portfolio management teams for their diligence and vigilance over the last six quarters under the pandemics challenging circumstances.
on capital we returned $26.8 million to shareholders in the second quarter, through share buybacks and dividends representing about 124% of net income in the quarter. our capital ratios remained strong relative to peers with cet1 at 14.3% of risk-weighted assets at the quarter end. our balance sheet strength gives us ample of capital to both opportunistically repurchase stock and to achieve our expected loan growth targets. and on strategy, we're grateful that about 700 investors, analysts, employees, community members and centers of influence attended our best strategy launch meeting on may 18. as we said then, our strategy will self-fund, that is, expense will fund investments in bankers technology and customer experience, which in turn significantly enhance stakeholder value. for example, our enhanced procurement strategy targets over $10 million in expense saves over three year best program timeline, in addition to real estate rationalization cost saves. later in the call, i'll discuss how we are building back our loan originations engine and we'll provide data on early progress on our best program's performance targets.
with that, i'll turn the call over to subhadeep to discuss our financials in more detail. subhadeep?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, nitin. if you turn to slide 4, i'd like to share our high level income statement with you. my comments will be on an adjusted numbers versus gaap. please see the appendix for a reconciliation of our gaap and adjusted financials. our revenues were up 4% year-over-year as fee growth offset a modest decline in net interest income. fees were up 36% year-on-year and consumer activity increased from their pandemic lows. revenues were lower sequentially, driven by seasonally higher wealth management and insurance revenues in the first quarter. we also had a high swap fair value adjustment in high ppp referral fees in the first quarter. expenses were down 8% sequentially driven by lower professional services, compensation and payroll tax expenses. we are very encouraged by our early progress on expenses, however, i want to remind you that we will be investing in hiring bankers and investing in technology as part of the self-funding the best plan. our provision expense was zero this quarter, down from $6.5 million in first quarter reflecting an improving credit environment. our return on tangible common equity was 8.1%, up 210 basis points versus the first quarter.
turning to slide 5. let me address changes in our earning assets. earning assets were essentially flat on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. while the industry headwinds for loan growth are expected to persist, we are encouraged by the expansion of our team of bankers and the upward trend for deal activity. commercial real estate was flat versus the first quarter and excluding ppp run-off our underlying average c&i loans were modestly down by 3%. importantly, we are encouraged by recent loan origination volumes.
our loan originations for the second quarter of $310 million reflect a 63% and 33% improvement versus prior year and prior quarter respectively. the growth in originations is also balanced and spread across our commercial and consumer portfolios. loan yields were up 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter. for the cre portfolio we recognized higher purchase loan accretion and c&i yields rose due to ppp forgiveness. we ended the quarter with $173 million in ppp loans, these balances are expected to run-off in the third quarter of 2021. to assist with your analysis, we have added a page in the appendix on ppp impacts to our balance sheet and p&l. we have $146 million in non-strategic indirect auto loans, which we expect to run-off over the next eight quarters.
as you will recall, we are also selling eight mid-atlantic branches in the third quarter which at average second quarter loans of $269 million and average deposits of $517 million. we expect the transaction to close in third quarter of 2021. our investment portfolio has grown 13% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. we continue to pursue investment options to enhance yield on the investment portfolio while balancing liquidity niche [phonetic] plan.
slide 6 shows our average liabilities. we continue to manage down our funding costs by replacing higher cost funding with lower cost funding. non-interest bearing deposits are up 19% year-over-year. higher cost brokered cds and fhlb borrowings are down year-over-year, 65% and 60%. our cost of funds has dropped by 60% from 92 basis points in second quarter of 2020 to 36 basis points in second quarter of 2021. our net interest margin has been stable at 262 basis points.
slide 7 provides more detail on our funding trends with the growth of non-interest bearing now money market and savings deposits. our lower cost deposits constitute 83% of our total deposit base. 84% of our customer cds are expected to reprice in the next six quarters. the benefits of our cds repricing downwards are reflected in our deposit cost for customer cds, down 102 basis points on a year-over-year basis. we have also paid down $0.5 billion in wholesale funding in the first half of 2021. we anticipate paying down approximately $300 million of additional wholesale funding in the second half of 2021.
slide 8 shows our fee revenues. we encourage that fee revenues are up 36% year-over-year as economic activity has recovered of pandemic lows. deposit related fees, which includes service charges and deposit accounts and card fees like interchange, were up 40% year-over-year as consumer activity increased. our sba lending business continues to exhibit strong momentum. loan fees and revenue are up 30% driven principally by higher gain on sale from sba lending and higher swap fees. fees were down sequentially driven by seasonally higher first quarter wealth management and insurance fees. we also had high positive swap and msr fair value adjustments and high ppp referral fees in the first quarter.
on slide 9, we show our expenses. adjusted expenses were down 8% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by lower professional services expenses, lower compensation expenses and lower occupancy expenses. on a year-over-year basis, expenses were down 2% driven primarily by lower headcount and lower ppp related expenses. our headcount was down 6% on a year-over-year basis. as discussed at our may 18 best launch, our goal is to self-fund our transformation efforts and we are very encouraged by the early progress we're making on that front.
slide 10 is a summary of our asset quality metrics, significantly improved across the board. loan modifications are down 94% year-over-year to $98 million or 1.4% of loans. charge-offs are at $4.7 million, down 50% versus first quarter. total delinquencies including nonperforming loans are at $66 million or 92 basis points of total loans, which is down 27% versus the first quarter. both charge-offs and delinquencies for the quarter are close to pre-pandemic levels. leading indicators also point to similar improvements in asset quality. the 30 to 89-day delinquency bucket as reduced 57% year-over-year from $35 million to $15 million. improved credit quality coupled with improved economic forecast resulted in zero provision expenses in the second quarter versus a $6.5 million provision in the first quarter. our allowance for credit losses is at 1.69% of total loans, excluding ppp loans. it should be noted that delinquencies net of charge-off and acl as a percentage of total loans are down, notwithstanding a decline in our loan balances.
slide 11, further highlights significant improvements in our covid sensitive segments including hospitality, firestone, restaurants and nursing assisted living loan books. covid sensitive deferrals are down 88% year-over-year and 58% versus the first quarter. criticized assets are down double-digits versus the first quarter and nonaccrual loans are down 4%. the appendix includes two pages detailing trends for each of the four covid sensitive portfolios. covid deferrals for our restaurant and nursing, assisted living portfolios are down to zero, and down 86% for firestone and 38% for our hospitality portfolio. i'm happy to discuss with you further if you want to follow-up with us.
slide 12 shows detail on our capital and liquidity positions. as nitin mentioned, we returned $26.8 million of capital or approximately 124% of second quarter 2021 net income to shareholders via stock repurchase and dividends. our capital levels continue to remain very strong. the common equity tier 1 capital ratio improved by 10 basis points versus first quarter. our second quarter '21 estimated cet1 ratio is at 14.3%. we continue to execute on our share buyback program, having already purchased 745,000 shares of the 2.5 million shares authorized by the board. as you can see from the quarterly cet1 walk, our estimated rwa has also dropped due to change in asset mix moving to lower risk categories.
in summary, this was an encouraging quarter and provides us momentum as we continue to execute on our transformation plan. we had revenue growth primarily driven by increased fee income. expense discipline drove down expenses and credit quality has significantly improved resulting in zero provision expenses. capital levels are robust as we continue to return excess capital to shareholders. our rotce was 8.1% and we grew our tangible book value per share to $22.66, which is up 3% versus second quarter of 2020.
now i would like to close with comments on our outlook. while we are upbeat about the vaccination trends in our footprint and improved economic forecasts, weaker loan demand trends seen in recent quarters are expected to persist. we expect nii to be lower for the rest of the year as ppp interest income declines and non-strategic loan books continue to run-off. we expect fee revenues to be stable throughout the second half of the year. we expect a meaningful improved credit environment over time and that credit provision expenses trend toward pre-pandemic levels in 2022. as we said last quarter, we expect to get to day one cecl reserves to loans in 2022. i caution that our credits can be lumpy, so we don't expect a straight line on provision expenses or charge-offs. we expect expenses for the rest of the year to be stable at about $70 million run rate. our tax rate was higher this quarter and we expect our tax rate for the rest of 2021 to be in mid to high teens. and we expect our fully diluted share counts to be lower.
with that, i'll turn it back to nitin for closing comments. nitin?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
thanks subhadeep. as subhadeep shared the pandemic and the macroeconomic factors have caused loan growth challenges for the industry and for berkshire. in addition, while we expect that the decline in ppp balances, closing of mid-atlantic transaction and run-off of non-strategic books to occur in the second half of 2021, we feel confident that we will see modest growth in balances beginning in 2022, and we will strive to outperform market trends through our best plan initiatives.
we are adding to our loan originations muscle in three broad ways. first, we are successfully retaining our strong performers and hiring new bankers in both commercial and consumer banking. second, we are partnering with correspondent lenders for residential mortgage originations in our footprint. and third, we are partnering with fintech platforms to prudently increase relationship based lending to serve the needs of customers and prospects in our footprint.
on slide 13, we show how we are strengthening our team and winning new business. our existing team of bankers have strong relationships with their customers and know their markets, communities, centers of influence and sponsors really well. and we have a very high banker and customer retention rate. m&a activity in our markets and bankers seeking to work in a community dedicated institution has provided berkshire a great opportunity to hire bankers from competitors who share our passion for doing well by doing good for our customers and the communities that we operate in.
we've hired leading commercial bankers across our footprint in several key asset categories, including ben garcia, a senior asset based lender from wells fargo in the albany market; boston business banking team led by scott vickery from webster; and tim kensky, a senior banker from bank of america in albany commercial lending markets. to fast track our optimization efforts outlined in the best program, we also hired mark milen, who is one of the top procurement experts in the country and he's 100% focused on managing our 1,500 plus vendors more efficiently and build effective strategic sourcing program for us.
our bankers are energized by our focus on organic growth and we are winning new customers and new deals from our competitors. we have shared some examples here to highlight that we are winning significant relationships across our banker footprint especially in commercial and business banking. a combination of these initiatives have created market momentum that drove second quarter originations 63% higher year-over-year and 33% higher quarter-over-quarter.
on slide 14, we show our early progress against our best performance targets across our five key metrics. rotce, roa and ppnr are up smartly compared to the baseline of full year 2020 performance and will be tracked on an ongoing basis to ensure that these key metrics continue to track toward our best program goals. for second quarter, the financial metrics of rotce, roa and ppnr are moving in the right direction, reflecting 8.1% and 70 basis points on adjusted basis for rotce and roa respectively, an annualized second quarter ppnr is at $116 million, up by over 6% from the baseline full year '20 ppnr. we're also making progress on harder to measure but equally important esg and nps scores. our blended esg score rose 10 points versus last year to take us to 29 percentile and our net promoter score puts us at about 50 percentile among the banks operating in new england. below some terrific smaller competitors, but well ahead of some large household name banks. we will continue to provide regular updates on progress on the best program.
in summary, a solid quarter across many fronts. stable net interest income, strong commercial loan originations and stable balances, good fee momentum, good expense control, improving credit profile and we are well into our share repurchase program. our best program will build further momentum into 2022.
with that, i'll turn it over to the operator for questions. operator?

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question comes from mark fitzgibbon with sandler o'neill. please go ahead.
mark fitzgibbon -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
guys, good morning. first off, congratulations on a good quarter. wanted to just follow-up, subhadeep, you mentioned that the new jersey branch sale will happen in the third quarter. can you give us a better sense for when in the third quarter that's likely to happen?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, mark, good to hear from you. hope all is well. at this point, the guidance that we're going to give is, it is going to close in third quarter. till the deal is finalized and signed, we can't give out further details on potential dates.
mark fitzgibbon -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
okay. and then secondly, i think you mentioned in your outlook comments that you expect operating expenses to be sort of stable in the $70 million range, but assuming you were to get -- sell those branches sometime early or mid-third quarter, shouldn't operating cost come down by a decent amount, wouldn't that $70 million kind of be high?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure, mark. so on that $70 million guidance, that's the net number from a sort of total operating expense perspective. remember there are ins and outs of that number. so sort of just to highlight that, there are sort of expense saves that will reduce that number. but on the other front, we are going to invest as we said for sort of best plan related, hiring bankers and technology. and the third will be sort of the branch expenses that will be coming in on a run rate basis that you will see not only in -- for the rest of the year, but coming in, in 2022 as well.
mark fitzgibbon -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then, i wondered if you could share with us, i know you said that there is industry pressures on loan demand, but could you share with us the size of your pipelines today?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
i'll take that, mark. what we could say is, we clearly had the originations quarter. i think our originations were highest in the last five quarters, and so is our pipeline. and i think that gives us the momentum getting into third and fourth quarter and that will continue to grow as we continue to hire new bankers and build out more teams in commercial and small business, while we are ramping up our partnerships for the consumer side of the equation. so i think the short answer would be a, not just the originations were at the highest point this quarter but so was the pipeline across commercial and consumer.
mark fitzgibbon -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
okay. and then nitin just sort of a more strategic question, as you look at the -- your fee-based businesses like wealth management and insurance and mortgage, are there any candidates for dramatic new investments or growth or any of those potential sale candidates, i guess, i'm just curious, because you've talked a lot about growing the lending businesses but hadn't heard much on the fee side?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
so it's a great question, mark. and you know this very well, fee is obviously highly capital efficient stream of revenue. it also is challenging in the times that we are in. we are looking at all opportunities to grow fee revenues from the components of the businesses that we have. we are investing heavily into our sba loan originations unit that creates significant amount of gain on sale and fee revenue and that's accretive for both income as well as return on capital. we are looking at some components where they might be opportunities to rationalize some of the operations which are not as efficient as the other businesses are. so i think the short answer would be, yes, we want to grow fee revenue. we are looking to invest into fee income opportunities coming from 44 bc, which is our sba arm, wealth management and mortgage and consumer operations, while looking at opportunities to rationalize some of the businesses.
mark fitzgibbon -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from laurie hunsicker with compass point. please go ahead.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
yes, hi, good morning.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
good morning laurie.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
good morning.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
i just, i wonder if we could go back to expenses, because i'm also trying to understand this too, in other words, if i'm looking at the ispc sale is coming out, and your quarterly run rate is dropping closer to call it $65.5 million, $66 million a quarter. are you then suggesting that the delta difference there that's going to be hiring people, technology spend, etc to take you to $70 million. is that the right way to be thinking about that?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, laurie, good to hear from you, subhadeep. so i think as i sort of answered the prior question, the call before, so as we said we are going to get expense saves from our branch sales and -- but we are going to be investing that amount into part of that into our best plan and there are several ins and outs in terms of expenses, there are i think expense saves that are coming in optimization on sort of real estate and other things that are coming in, that will drive that number down. but at the end of the day, $70 million is sort of a balanced impact of all those different categories.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. okay, great. and then also just to confirm, you're going to be running with a branch count in the neighborhood of 106 or 107 or so, is that correct?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes, laurie, i'll ask sean to address that question.
sean a. gray -- president and chief operating officer
sure. and just adding to the expense run rate discussion, we've consolidated 15 of our planned 16 branches. the 16th is scheduled for late october. deposit retention has been exceeding expectation. the budget is on target. and when we launched best, we talked about an additional 5% to 10% of our branch count being reduced throughout the end of the year and into next year. so we feel for an experienced proven consolidator, we've got a good strong history of customer and deposit retention. so we will continue to execute on that 5% to 10%, eight to 10 branches or from, starting now those plants have begun moving into the first half of next year.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay, great. and so then as we look to next year, that's potentially another five to 10 branches that you may close. is that correct?
sean a. gray -- president and chief operating officer
that is correct.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. okay. just making sure on that. okay.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
hey, laurie, just to add a little flavor on what sean just highlighted, i think what's been remarkable, just looking at this and even me coming in six months and looking at the history of consolidations that we've done, whereas sean highlighted, we have retained our customers, retained the deposits, but we've also done a remarkable job of retaining bankers through managing through attrition, which has been the strength of this organization. i just wanted to highlight that.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay, great. that's helpful and then credit to your point, improved a lot this quarter. it looks very, very strong. you had mentioned [indecipherable] and i guess your prepared comments that pre-pandemic levels in terms of provisioning won't return until 2022. so we're thinking for the back half of 2021, you're going to stay very nominal loan loss provisioning, unless like this quarter or how should we be thinking about that? i mean your reserves to loans, ex ppp is sitting at 1.69%. maybe any color on where you want that target to be?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, laurie, sure. so look at this point based on where we think our portfolio is looking at sort of the improved economic forecast, where it's going, that's basically what we saw as our zero provision expenses. as we highlighted in the first quarter, we feel really good in terms of the direction, the strategic direction from a credit quality perspective our portfolio is going and we believe that momentum is going to continue. so as that momentum continues, you're going to see similar trends in provision expenses for the rest of the year and going forward. and i want to emphasize that with sub trends continue, we expect to return to pre-pandemic levels of acl to loan loss reserves.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. okay and then just in terms of that target that reserve to loans target what's a good number? how do you think about that?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
so again, it depends on sort of our -- the portfolios and as you know in part of the best plan we have, we are growing our commercial business, we are growing our consumer business. if you sort of take that out, in a ballpark if you look at our book of business, commercial book of business and consumer mix that we have currently it's between 90 basis points to 100 basis points.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. okay. and then in terms of you had -- you said in you're adding new tax credit investments, which obviously will appear in the back half of 2021, and you gave us the tax rate guide, but i just wonder, i know you sometimes in the past you have taken a charge in the fee income that sort of tax advantage [phonetic] commercial projects investment which was a bit of a drag. are we going to expect to see that uptick or how should we be thinking about that line?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. and as you know, tax credits can be lumpy. so, and then we go through sort of a very well thought out process in terms of how we do that. so yes, first two quarters, you didn't see the benefits of that from a effective tax rate perspective, but in subsequent quarters as i provided in my guidance, we are going to see the downtick in the effective tax rates.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. okay. but, so in terms of the drag, in terms of the charge through non-interest income, i mean, could we go back to where we're seeing at a $3.5 million, $4 million annual run rate to this line or how should we be thinking about that?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
so i think given sort of the first two quarters, we at this point, i think i'll provide sort of the guidance on the effective tax rate, which i said in the mid to high teens. and then, laurie we can discuss in more detail when we talk later about the additional question that you have.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. okay, perfect. that's helpful. and then just two more questions. just looking at this fx table there, that just wasn't at the kind of for the broken out detail. the ppp income that was in the net interest income number in the $75 million, what was that number?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
so i think the last page and take a look at it, laurie, when you have a chance, page 20, slide 20 of the earnings presentation has a detailed ppp impact by quarter. so to answer your question, the interest income impact was $5.1 million for ppp for the second quarter.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
oh, i see it. you know what i see it right in here. got it, ok. and then the same thing on accretion income. it looked like it was rounded to $2 million. i was just looking in your [indecipherable] which is a big number. just wondered do you have an exact number as to what that was, the accretion income included and net interest income?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, we can talk after all those details when we speak later laurie.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. i'll leave it there. thank you.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
thanks, laurie.

the next question comes from jake civiello with janney. please go ahead.
jake civiello -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
good morning, guys.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
good morning jake.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
good morning.
jake civiello -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
i know you alluded to nim pressure in the second half of the year. if we think about your net interest income dollars, 2q was really the first quarter in a couple of years where you actually saw net interest income move higher. if you could, you can continue to grow your net interest income, despite the nim pressure?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
sorry, jake, can you repeat the last part of the question?
jake civiello -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
yes. so do you think you can continue to grow your net interest income dollars despite the margin pressure that you alluded to in the back half of 2021?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
so i think and this goes back also to jake the discussion we had as part of the best plan. so as we said, this year our balance sheet is going to be sort of modestly to the flat -- flat to maybe marginally down for the rest of the year, but that represents sort of the impact of ppp loans running off and other runoff of nonstrategic portfolios. having said that, we are really getting sort of spending sort of the next half of the year preparing for ramping up the balance sheet growth. in terms of a nim perspective, i think as you know, obviously there are pressures in the market, but we expect sort of nii to be sort of down modestly down for the rest of the year.
jake civiello -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay, great, thanks. then the only other question i have is, do you anticipate that you'll continue to grow the investment securities portfolio as you had at the past several quarters or does the shift in the interest rate environment here over the last few weeks kind of change your thinking on that?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
no, i think if you look at our investment portfolio, it has grown and grown over the last few quarters, including this quarter. in terms of that liquidity that we have, we're looking to sort of obviously best deploy it in terms of a, making sure that we enhance the investment portfolio yield. so you're going to probably see some more deployments into securities. at the same time we want to make sure that we are adequately sort of prepared and planned for to deploy that for the best plan related strategic growth. so to answer your question, yes, you can see some deployments into securities.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
jake?
jake civiello -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. thanks. thanks guys, that's all i have.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer

thank you, kevin. good morning, everyone, and welcome once again to berkshire's third quarter earnings call. i'll begin my comments on slide three, where you can see the highlights of the quarter. it was another solid quarter with progress across four components highlighted here, including financials, asset quality, capital and strategy. in terms of financial results, we posted gaap eps of $1.31 in the quarter, an increase of $0.89 and $0.88 year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, including onetime gains through strategic exits from insurance business and mid-atlantic market. adjusted eps was $0.53, up $0.09 quarter-over-quarter and unchanged from a year ago. to provide more color on the financial results and specifically about the balance sheet, i'd say that we are making tangible progress toward our high-performance goals overall. we're still indeed getting better before getting bigger phase for the balance sheet. this is consistent with what we had highlighted during our best program launch call on may 18 this year. our deposits balance sheet is getting better in terms of its mix and corresponding cost of funds. our loan balances are declining, including runoff of nonstrategic portfolios, but we're also seeing a reduction in the rate of decline in loan balances and should start seeing growth in those balances in the first half of 2022 as we reactivate the organic growth muscle through growth and productivity from existing bankers, addition of top-notch bankers and adding new partners to grow loan originations. expenses were essentially flat on both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. subhadeep will share more details on this in a few minutes, and i would reiterate that we are committed 100% to self-funding our best strategy.
we will generate expense saves while reinvesting most of those saves to grow revenues and bottom line in coming years. adjusted return on tangible common equity, or rotce, for the quarter was 9.5%, and adjusted return on assets was 0.86%. both of these metrics, trending in the right direction, consistent with our best program three-year targets. switching to asset quality. as you will see from the charts in the deck and the appendix, our credit trends continued to improve rapidly across the board as our risk management actions over the past year or more have paid dividends. delinquency rates are around pre-pandemic levels of 0.87%, down 11 basis points year-over-year and five basis points quarter-over-quarter. covid loan modifications were down 85% year-over-year to $65 million or less than 1% of loans portfolio. you may recall that our covid deferrals had peaked in q2 of 2020 at $1.6 billion when our bankers ran toward our customers at the start of the pandemic versus running away from them to give those borrowers the best chance to survive through the crisis. deferrals are now down by 96% from that peak, and we've been able to help many of our customers weather the storm effectively. kudos to our lenders, portfolio managers, credit and workout teams for their customer focus and corresponding asset quality improvement. nonperforming loans were down 22%, and net charge-offs were down 66% year-over-year and 55% quarter-over-quarter.
marked improvement in asset quality supported provision benefit of $4 million in the quarter. on capital, we returned over $54 million to our shareholders in the second quarter through share buybacks and dividends, representing about 210% of our adjusted net income in the quarter. our capital ratios remained quite strong relative to peers with cet1 at 15.3% at quarter end, an increase of about 1% over previous quarter. our balance sheet strength gives us more than ample capital to both opportunistically repurchase stock, to improve shareholder value over the near term and to achieve expected loan growth targets in our best plan over the medium to long term. on strategy front, we made great progress this past quarter on our best strategic plan. we streamlined our business model by selling noncore operations, including the sale of our insurance subsidiary and mid-atlantic franchise. we announced our berkshire community comeback initiative that highlights how our lending investments and philanthropic initiatives in the community will help our customers across the footprint and specifically in the low- to moderate-income neighborhoods. this is consistent with our best plan as well as our vision to become the leading socially responsible community bank in new england and beyond. as mentioned earlier, part of our growth strategy includes partnerships. these partnerships include like-minded fintech partners that are delivering exceptional customer experience.
we just announced a strategic partnership with upstart. upstart is a lending -- leading artificial intelligence or ai lending platform designed to improve access to credit digitally while reducing the risk and cost of lending. upstart will help us generate consumer loans in the footprint within our credit risk parameters. we continue to build our firm with key hires, which i'll describe in more detail later. it's a great environment to hire bankers in our footprint as there is significant consolidation going on. our board of directors continues its refresh. we added jeff kip as a new director, and dave brunelle was named as the chair of the board in the third quarter. jeff's bio is attached in the appendix section. our heartfelt gratitude goes out to bill dunlaevy, who retired after 10 years of service on our board, including the last two years as the chair, during which time, berkshire made meaningful changes in both governance, executive leadership, risk management and strategy. thank you, bill. we appreciate your steady and prudent guidance during a challenging time.
with that, i'll turn the call over to subhadeep to discuss our financials in more detail. subhadeep?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, nitin. a very good morning to everyone. i hope everybody has gotten over the bad overtime loss that celtics suffered yesterday. with that, let me get into the earnings in a little bit more details. if you could please turn to slide four, it captures our income statement. i would like to point out that our third quarter gaap numbers include $52 million in pre-tax gains from the sale of berkshire insurance group and mid-atlantic businesses and net $1.4 million in restructuring charges associated with fhlb prepayments, real estate and severance. please see the appendix for a reconciliation of gaap and adjusted financials. my comments will be on an adjusted basis and not gaap. we've also included non-gaap views, excluding insurance, and mid-atlantic businesses to help with your analysis. revenues were down 5% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year driven by a decline in net interest income. excluding the sale of the insurance business quarter-over-quarter, adjusted revenues and expenses were down 4% and 1%, respectively. net interest income decline was driven primarily by runoff of ppp and nonstrategic portfolios, sale of mid-atlantic businesses and lower loan balances. expenses were essentially flat sequentially and year-over-year. i'll touch on expenses in more detail in a few minutes.
we had a provision benefit of $4 million this quarter as the credit quality of loan portfolios continue to improve significantly. including net charge-offs of about $2 million, the acl decreased by $6 million. our return on tangible common equity was 9.5%, up 145 basis points versus the second quarter, and our return on assets was 0.86%, up 15 basis points from the second quarter. the core effective tax rate was at 12% for third quarter of '21, down from 24% in the third quarter of '20. the lower tax rate was driven primarily by recognition of historic tax credits funded in the third quarter of '21. overall, our net income was down 3% year-over-year but was up 16% quarter-over-quarter. net interest margin was down six basis points from 262 basis points to 256 basis points, primarily driven by a lower ppp income, purchase accounting attrition, partially offset by a reduction in wholesale funding. turning to slide five. let me address changes in our loan portfolios and earning assets. our total average loan portfolio was down year-over-year, primarily driven by runoff of ppp and nonstrategic portfolios like indirect auto and aircraft, sale of mid-atlantic businesses and lower loan balances for consumer and commercial portfolios. excluding those portfolios, our loans were down 2% sequentially and down 14% year-over-year.
the bottom table shows average loans, excluding ppp, mid-atlantic and non-strategic runoff portfolios. the mid-atlantic loans will be off the balance sheet as of end of third quarter of '21, and we expect the indirect auto and aircraft portfolio to decline by 50% by the end of 2022. the commercial real estate portfolio, which accounts for 51% of the total loan portfolio, has been stable at approximately $3.6 billion over the last three quarters. we expect the balance sheet to begin ramping up in the first half of 2022. the investment portfolio is up 54% year-over-year. we're actively pursuing strategies to deploy cash into higher-yielding securities to drive earnings growth while retaining asset sensitivity and credit quality. we will share more details in subsequent quarters, starting with the fourth quarter of 2021. if you could turn to slide six. slide six shows our average liabilities. our funding mix continues to meaningfully improve as lower cost of funding replaces higher-cost funding. noninterest-bearing deposits are up 13% year-over-year, and as of third quarter '21, accounts for 29% of total deposits, which is up from 24% in third quarter of 2020. year-over-year, our cost of funds have dropped 42 basis points from 73 basis points to 31 basis points. also, year-over-year, our cost of deposits have dropped significantly, down 39 basis points from 61 basis points to 22 basis points. if you could turn to slide seven. slide seven provides more detail on the unique improvement in our funding profile and future opportunities to further lower our cost of funds. year-over-year, our retail cds have declined by about $600 million or 28% with costs going down by 81 basis points from 154 basis points to 73 basis points. furthermore, $1.2 billion of our high-cost retail cds will reprice over the next six quarters and continue to lower overall deposit costs.
we have also significantly lowered our reliance on wholesale funding. year-over-year, brokered cds are down 61%, and higher-cost fhlb borrowings are down 67%. as part of our strategy to lower funding costs, we have prepaid $94 million of fhlb borrowings in third quarter of '21 and reduced fhlb borrowings to about $14 million at the end of third quarter. we expect our brokered cd borrowings to decline by over 75% by the end of second quarter of 2022. our borrowings also include $97 million of expensive subordinated debt with a coupon of 6.875%. we plan to redeem it no later than third quarter of 2022. overall, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to meaningfully lower the cost of funding and drive profitability as we grow our balance sheet over the course of the best plan. slide eight. turning to slide eight, we show our fee revenues. i would like to note that our fee revenues for third quarter 2021 include only two months of insurance fee revenues due to the timing of sale of the insurance business in third quarter of '21. excluding insurance, our fee revenues were up 11% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. we are encouraged that fee revenues are up 4% year-over-year as the economy is recovering of pandemic lows. deposit-related fees were up 8% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter as consumer activity increased.
loan fees and revenue were up 66% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by higher gain on sale from strong sba lending and higher swap fees. the sba lending business continued to exhibit strong performance and achieved historically high revenues in the third quarter of 2021. wealth management fees were up 15% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter driven by market impact, new products and new relationships. other noninterest revenue declined due to $1.6 million in higher amortization expenses related to new tax credit investment project initiated in third quarter of '21. however, this was more than offset by the $2.2 million increase in investment tax credit benefits that lowered the effective tax rate for third quarter of '21. moving on to slide nine. on slide nine, we show our expenses. we continue to maintain expense discipline while we execute on our best strategy to self-fund, that is reinvesting meaningful expense saves to drive growth while maintaining overall expenses at or near current levels. adjusted expenses were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. increases in compensation expenses year-over-year were offset by declines in occupancy and equipment and other expenses. we are already benefiting from the expense saves from the branch consolidation that was done earlier in the year. starting with fourth quarter of '21, we'll also benefit from the expense reductions from the sale of insurance business and mid-atlantic businesses.
on other focus areas like procurement and real estate, we continue to make good progress driven by our newly formed procurement organization. moving on to the next slide. it provides a summary of our asset quality metrics, strong improvements in credit quality across the board for third quarter of '21, and importantly, significant improvements for three quarters in a row. covid loan deferrals are down 85% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter to $65 million or 0.95% of loans. net charge-offs are down 55% versus second quarter to $2.1 million. allowance for credit losses to loans, ex ppp, essentially remained flat driven by lower reserves but compensated for by lower loan balances. our covid-impacted portfolios, including hospitality, restaurants, firestone and nursing-assisted living, continue to significantly improve with year-over-year deferrals declining between 68% to 100%. we have moved more detailed credit data for covid-sensitive segments to the appendix and happy to discuss in more detail. moving on to the next slide, slide 11, on capital and liquidity. slide 11 shows detail on our capital and liquidity positions. our capital levels remain uniquely strong. our common equity tier one capital ratio ended the third quarter at an estimated 15.3%. as nitin mentioned, we returned $54.1 million of capital to shareholders this quarter via stock repurchases and dividends. we also completed our last approved stock repo program for 2.5 million shares.
we continue to stay focused on deploying capital to support balance sheet growth and returning capital to shareholders through opportunistic share buybacks and dividends. we can assure you that capital return is a key part of our three-year best strategy. so in summary, we had growth in fee income; decline in net interest income, principally driven by ppp and nonstrategic loan portfolio attrition; we had flat expenses; meaningful improvements in credit quality, resulting in provision expense benefit of $4 million; significant improvements in funding costs; and very strong levels of capital and liquidity to support growth and capital return, as outlined in the best plan. we also divested our insurance business and sold the mid-atlantic businesses, both of which were not part of our core growth strategy. and we executed on a share repurchase program of buying back 2.5 million shares. we also grew our tangible book value per share from $23.58 or 6% versus third quarter of 2020. i would like to close with comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter. we'll be providing 2022 guidance in january 2022. we are upbeat about the economic forecast and are encouraged by loan growth that the industry has started to experience. we expect our loan portfolio to decline modestly. we expect our nim to be stable for the fourth quarter of 2021. we expect our nii, or net interest income, to be down due to the impact of ppp, the sale of our mid-atlantic assets.
we expect our funding cost to further decline in the fourth quarter. we continue to be asset sensitive and expect to benefit from rising interest rates. adjusted for insurance, we expect fee revenues to be flat to modestly lower for fourth quarter of 2021. we expect a meaningfully improved credit environment over time, and we expect to get to day one cecl reserves to loans on the existing portfolio between second quarter of 2022 and third quarter of 2022. i'd caution that our credits can be lumpy, so we don't expect a straight line on provision expense or charge-offs. we expect expenses for the best rest of the year to be stable at about $68 million run rate. tax rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be in the mid-teens and end at 18% to 20% for full year 2021.
with that, i'll turn it back to nitin for further comments. nitin?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
thanks, subhadeep. on slide 12, we have our best north star chart, which shows five key performance metrics for our best strategic plan. we are encouraged by our progress across financial, esg and nps front. we recognize that the progress won't be linear every quarter for every metric, but we're confident that, directionally, we'll be making forward progress toward our north star objectives outlined, and we're committed to sharing the progress on an ongoing basis. slide 13 is a one-page summary of berkshire community comeback initiative announced last month. over three years of best program, we plan to lend and invest over $5 billion into our local communities, which includes specific esg targets for low-carbon financing projects and lending in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in our footprint. as we invest in our communities, we will prove that a bank with a purpose can also deliver strong financial performance. turning to slide 14. over the last few months, we have experienced renewed invested interest in our stock. and based on the discussions with them, here's how we believe our story is being perceived from outside in.
berkshire is being looked at as a unique comeback story. the key tenets of the comeback story are strong capital position that will enable loan growth and capital deployment to shareholders; combination of digitization, productivity growth and partnerships that will drive growth in originations as we reignite our organic originations engine; outsized cost of funds reduction in coming quarters. as we indicated on this call, our cost of funds have reduced significantly faster than our peers, and we believe that this momentum will continue over coming quarters. best is a self-help plan. that is, there is no rate hike benefit in the best plan core targets. we have unique esg performance metrics and focus which is consistent with 175 years of purpose-driven orientation of berkshire bank and our bankers. we have renewed focus on customer experience and nps, which is aligned with financial performance objectives. and last but not the least, we have a unique opportunity to hire talented values-guided community-dedicated bankers in our footprint from banks impacted by m&a, moe and other such activities. since our last earnings call, we've hired many frontline bankers, including senior bankers and leaders. for example, we hired lucy bellomia from bank of america to run our retail banking business.
we hired ellen steinfeld from tiaa to reinvigorate our consumer and home lending business. we hired jeff klaus, an experienced commercial banker, to build our loan book in the middle market in connecticut. we also added steve crowley and karen heston to our wealth management team and marissa ames and lynne singletary to our sba lending team at 44 business capital. it will take some time for the new hires to build originations momentum, but we expect loan balances to stabilize and start growing in the first half of 2022. in summary, a solid quarter across many fronts, improved financial results, growing checking and deposit balances and stabilizing loan balances, moderate fee income momentum, good expense control and improving credit.
with that, i'll turn it over to the operator for questions. emma? emma, can you open the line for the questions, please? emma, it looks like we have some questions in the queue. could you open the line for questions?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from mark fitzgibbon of piper sandler. mark, please go ahead. your line is open.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning and nice quarter.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
good morning, mark. thanks.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler -- analyst
first question, just to be clear, nitin, i know you said that growth should resume in early 2022. but should we expect much more in the way of balance sheet shrinkage in 4q?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
i think in the guidance, subhadeep did indicate that we'll have a modest decline, but the rate of decline is declining, as i mentioned in my comments, mark. so, it will be relatively flat to modestly down in the fourth quarter, and we begin to start seeing growth in the first half. so i think we are consistent there.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, great. and then secondly, cash balances have built up quite a bit at berkshire as well as most banks. i guess, with sort of 18% of the balance sheet and cash, i'm curious what you think the right level of liquidity for your balance sheet at this point in time would be and maybe how long it takes to get there.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey, mark. this is subhadeep. good to hear from you. so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are looking at different deployment strategies for that cash, including, obviously, moving into sort of high-yielding securities. and that's part of our overall best strategy as well coming to an optimal level. i think you got to remember that sort of the liquidity use for multiple purposes, as we grow our balance sheet we need to fund that balance sheet as well. so over time, we will come to a sort of optimal level, and we'll share more details around what that would be and with more details in january of 2022. but overall, you're going to see a reduction in that cash balance going forward starting in fourth quarter.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. great. and then also, i wondered if you could share with us the size of the loan pipeline, what the mix of that looks like and maybe your commercial line utilization rates, please.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. mark, broadly speaking, the pipeline has grown as compared to the end of second quarter as well as end of third quarter roughly about $300 million in commercial, line utilization about 47%.
mark fitzgibbon -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from david bishop from seaport research partners. please go ahead, david. your line is now open.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah. thank you. good morning, gentlemen. yes. hey, good morning. curious about how we should think about return of capital as we enter into 2022. obviously, the gain from the mid-atlantic branch system and the insurance subsidiary obviously bolstered overall capital levels, along with the balance sheet attrition. just curious, is there sort of a targeted level you're thinking about between buybacks, the combination of buybacks and dividends paid into 2022, 2023.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, dave, this is subhadeep. no. great question. i think that's one of the topics that there are a lot of discussions that we continue to have within management as well as with the board. we are very, very focused, as both nitin and i mentioned, on deploying the capital. so our deployment strategy is obviously threefold: help support the growth of the balance sheet over the course of the next two years, take our dividend yield where it should be and obviously increasing it from where we are as well as returning capital to shareholders via buyback. so there are a lot of discussions happening and expect to provide more information relatively soon in terms of what are the strategies for capital return.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
got it. and then you guys have been pretty active, obviously, in terms of adding lending talent here over the past several weeks and months here. just curious, maybe when this talent achieves critical mass, what sort of growth rate or volume of loans you think they can bring on balance sheet into 2022? i don't know if you have that from a dollar perspective or a growth perspective, just how we should think about the growth opportunity of these new adds.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. no. great question, dave. i think, broadly speaking, what we have embedded within the best plan, and you'll hear more details about it at the next quarter when we break it by year,as opposed to doing midyear. what we have baked into the plan is about 40% to 50% growth in our frontline bankers, and that requires us to be hiring at a certain clip. and we are at that run rate right now.
and the hires that we made in the second and third quarter will start building their pipeline in this quarter and the next quarter. so we start really seeing the originations kick in from the second quarter, and that's when we also expect around that time the balance sheet to grow. just broadly speaking, the overall growth in the frontline bankers that we have in the plan, that, itself, should be giving us about $0.5 billion to $1 billion of incremental originations, to your question.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
i appreciate the color. and then one final question before i hop back into the queue. remind us -- i think you noted, subhadeep, that you expect the allowance to trend down on the day one cecl reserves. remind us what that number is.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. so i think around 100 basis points on our existing portfolio, day one cecl reserves.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
100 basis points. got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from steven duong from rbc capital markets. please go ahead. your line is now open.
steven duong -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning, guys. just the first question, just on your rate sensitivity. you mentioned that you're asset sensitive. i guess, subhadeep, can you speak to just how much sensitivity from a 50 basis points or 100 basis points you can expect on your nii and also just what the assumptions are going into that in terms of deposit data?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, steve, good to hear from you. so as you said, i mean, obviously, looking at our balance sheet and our cash position, we are asset sensitive. in terms of added data for sensitivity and where we stand to benefit from 100 basis points or 200 basis points lift, we'll add more color and details in our 10-q.
steven duong -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, got it. and then just on the partnership with upstart, i guess, can you guys just maybe give some more color on these loans? are they, kind of, buy now, pay later types of loans? how big are they, the credit profile of the customer and how much exposure you guys are willing to take on it?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yeah. happy to give you overarching view, steve, and we could get into more details later. but broadly speaking, upstart is a program and part of our program plan to partner up with like-minded fintech partners that provide easier access to credit for customers in our footprint where we can build on to a larger relationship. it is an ai-based decisioning model with about 1,500 factors that help maximize the opportunity for customers to get access to that credit at the best available price. it is -- we're going to stay in the prime space. fico is above -- well above 625. in terms of the originations, we expect that one partnership alone to be about $100 million of personal loan originations a year, but we would have more partners over time.
steven duong -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. perfect. thank you for that. and then just on your sba revenues, have you guys disclosed how much in sba revenues you had this quarter? and what was it last quarter?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, steve. no, i don't think we separately disclosed sba revenues. it's included in one of our key revenue lines.
steven duong -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just last one for me. your acl is $166 million, ex ppp. and so if we're assuming loss rates continue on, i don't know, 20 basis points, somewhere around there, and you're looking to get a day one cecl of around $100 million, $101.1 million, that -- if you triangulate that, that would seem to mean that you have a lot of reserves to get off in the next three quarters or so. is that fair to say?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
sorry. i was -- hi, steve. so i think in terms of where we get to our acl reserves, that's based on our evaluation of the portfolio and what we're looking at from a net charge-off perspective. and as and when sort of as our model is determined based on our policy and guidelines and our forecast for net charge-off rates, we make the determination to release reserves, as we did this quarter. i think it's fair to say that given the charge-off trend that we are looking at, and if this continues, likely to be more reserves in the coming quarter -- releases in the coming quarters.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
steve, to your question...
steven duong -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
...just to add to what -- steve, just to add to what subhadeep just said. that 100 to 110 basis points that you outlined, that's on the existing portfolio. we're also adding new portfolios along the way, and we would have to take incremental cover for that as well. so we will get to that day one cecl for the existing portfolio by around the third quarter time line that subhadeep outlined.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey...
steven duong -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, yeah. it just seems like -- yeah. i'm sorry. go ahead.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
steve, i just think one quick correction on our -- on the comment around the sba lending revenues. i think we don't have it expressed in our tables. but i think on our overall press release, you'll find the disclosure around sba lending revenue of $5 million.
steven duong -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. so that's $5 million this quarter. is that right?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
correct.
steven duong -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. yeah. and then just on your -- back to the acl. i guess you had the negative $4 million this quarter in the pcl, and that didn't really do much on your acl. so it just seems that this would imply that, eventually, by sometime mid late next year, you're really going to have a lot of -- a sizable negative pcl, assuming loss rates continue on where they are. and so, is that a fair way to think about it?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
i think, steve, like as we reflected in our comments earlier on, i think as to the past to the next quarters, depending on sort of our portfolio performance and the credit trends, you're going to see how that turns out in the next two to three quarters. but i think i would like to reiterate the comment that i made earlier about sort of the direct correlation of improving credit quality and potential for more reserve releases.
steven duong -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. i appreciate you taking the questions. thank you.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. thank you, steve.
operator
our next question today comes from laurie hunsicker from compass point. please go ahead. your line is now open.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
yes. hi. thanks. good morning. and bill dunlaevy, i just want to say, i'm wishing you well. but nitin, subhadeep, kevin and dave, i'm just wondering, can you circle back a little bit on upstart and help us think about -- just to the earlier questions, can you help us think about how you see that line? in other words, a year from now, its $100 million; a year from now, it's $200 million. can you just help us think a little bit about that?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. its $100 million a year kind of momentum at this point of time, based on the credit parameters that we've outlined for ourselves.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. and then, is it $100 million, and you're going to hold it flat and just see how it performs, see how the loss rate is going or it's $100 million continuing to grow $100 million or so every year? how do you think about that?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. we'll keep watching the performance. the great thing about programs like this, laurie, is this gives us an ability, one, to partner up with true, cutting-edge, ai-based lending platform, that also looks at daily repayment of the customers and recalibrates its decisioning model. so there is tremendous amount of ai-based intelligence that goes behind this that helps us track the portfolio, and we get the benefit of that.
and on the other side, it also gives us the ability to make sure that the portfolio is performing as we outlined it to be. and i think to that extent, yes, we'll continue to just keep watching the portfolio as we build it. and then, if it performs as we expect it to, we'll continue to operate the program going forward.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. and i just -- i wanted to make sure i heard this right. the fico -- the average fico is 625?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
no. that's the minimum fico. i think what you would end up getting, by and large, based on some of the experiences that we've heard from other banks, it's about 700 plus, as an average fico.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
it's 700 plus. okay. so i mean -- so in other words, i'm just going to use lending club here as an extrapolation. we just got off an earnings call where that's still a whole entire page of the slide deck that's the focus here.
i mean, lending club was something that many, many, many banks got into, realized the loss rate was much more severe and then subsequently got out of the tranche b or, for that matter, then completely got out of it altogether.
i mean when you think about what you're adding here, is there -- i mean, there's a big difference in unsecured consumer if you're 700 plus or 740 plus versus you're going down to 625. can you just -- can you help us think a little bit about that piece that's going to be sub-700, what you're going to see there?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. i'll be happy to, laurie, and we could also cover it off-line. but at a high level, there is a big difference in the program where you purchase loans versus you originate loans based on your criteria, your credit box, your max aprs and your max dti kind of scenarios.
so essentially, you're creating an originations engine through partnering up with fintechs-like ai, who have received real good kudos about how they built that decisioning model. in fact, they have a three year of kind of a cfpb clean sheet on how their decision model works. so i'm happy to share that in detail, laurie. this is a different program than purchasing loans that some of the banks have done with likes of lending club.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. and what are you modeling in terms of the charge-off rate?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
it's a range between 4% and 5%.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
4% to 5%. okay. and then what's the coupon?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
on an average, it's going to be about 11% to 12%.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
11% to 12% coupon. okay. great. and then just one last thing. is this a national book or is this...
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
no. it's in the portfolio. that's the difference, laurie. this is in footprint, relationship basis. the customer is ours, and we build relationship-deepening programs around these customers.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay, ok. great. thanks for that color. and then, i guess, subhadeep, can you just give us what the ppp fees were, the forgiveness fees this quarter into your net interest income?
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, laurie, good to hear from you, yes, and good question. we anticipated that, anyway. but the last page of the deck, slide 21, outlines the ppp impact. so for third quarter of '21, we are around $2.1 million from that
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. okay, great.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
...which is down from second quarter sort of at $5.1 million.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. sorry, i missed that. and also, i probably missed this, too. it's somewhere in your slide deck, and i apologize. it's earnings. but can you just help us think or just give me an update on the accretion that was included in net interest income?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. i think it's the accretion was, i would say, 50% over our consumer book. that includes both consumer and mortgages, and rest 50% is over our commercial loan book. and i think...
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
no, no. sorry. i mean, corporately, within your net interest income, what was your accretion income? in other words, last quarter, it was $2.2 million. and i apologize, it probably is somewhere in your press release, and i just haven't had a chance to find it yet?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. and i think it's on our earnings tables as well. so i think the total dollar amount for -- and i'm sorry. i'm having a difficult time -- yes. i think i'll -- it was $1.7 million.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
$1.7 million. great. thank you. apologize that i didn't find that. okay. so i guess when i'm looking at those two line items or just even excluding the ppp fees, your -- so your core net interest margin was down to 248, and it looks like ppp is basically gone. and so when we think about a forward-looking margin, putting some of these components together -- and i guess one more question around that. the $94 million in fhlb borrowings that you prepaid, when did that happen in the quarter?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
that happened at the very end of the quarter, laurie, the last week. so literally, the benefits of that, really, on a run rate basis, we're going to see it in the fourth quarter onwards.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
great. okay. that's helpful. okay. so can you just -- can you help us sort of forward think a little bit? i mean i realize you said the margin was stable, but you certainly had outsized ppp fees that won't be there. so i guess where are you making up for that differential? in other words, when ppp fees won't be there, and so somewhere -- if margin is still trending at the 2.56% -- i mean, it seems to me that there's still sort of almost a 10 basis point delta happening there. can you just drill down a little bit more how we can -- yes. go ahead.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
sure, sure. and i think -- so if you -- first of all, if you think about sort of the -- our core nim, right, and where we ended up, that was, as you said, rightly pointed out, on the negative side, there was a ppp impact, right? but on the positive side, there were sort of funding impacts or non-brokered deposit mix, that declining, the fhlb borrowing, which didn't -- we didn't really get the benefit of that, that will -- helping us in the fourth quarter. and then secondly, our roll-on, roll-off portfolios and sort of the impact on that from that perspective. so i think overall, that's probably what's going to guide sort of a stable nim that i offered up in my guidance.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay, ok. and then just in terms of your noncore portfolios, can you just update us now on the balance of where the indirect auto is and the balance of where the aircraft is?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. sure.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
and if you don't have those numbers [indecipherable] go back.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
no, that's fine. it's on the footnote table as well. so for indirect auto, and i'm quoting end of period, we're at about -- third quarter '21, we are about $120 million in balances. and then on the aircraft, just i don't think we disclosed that separately. we can call you later with that information.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
the low 40s.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. i would say the low 40s, like mid to low 40s, like $45 million to $47 million.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay.
subhadeep basu -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
it's subhadeep. i guess it's roughly in the mid-30s in aircraft.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
mid-30s. okay. that's helpful. and then when do you expect both of those portfolios to be zero?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
so as part of our -- i think in my prepared remarks, we said end of 2022, we expect that to decline by over 50%. i think the rest of the attrition will happen over the course of 2023 if the normal sort of our forecasted rate of attrition holds and the payment behavior that you're seeing.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay, ok. that's helpful. and then just more broadly on the restructuring charges, when do we see those go away? when are there no more restructuring charges? are we at it, as we sit now, that we're going to have sort of a clean look in the fourth quarter? how should we think about that?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
so i think, laurie, like -- restructuring charges are based on sort of obviously in a circumstance of events and sort of how envision sort of planning and managing the business. so at this point, we have what we have in restructuring charges. if there are future restructuring charges, we'll disclose that as part of our quarterly earnings.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. but as we sit today, looking forward, fourth quarter and beyond looks largely clean, shy of you while making another announcement. am i thinking about that the right way?
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
i guess at this point, laurie, i am unable to offer a comment on that.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay, ok. and then i guess, just lastly, the gains that you pre-disclosed, i just didn't see an actual breakdown on the $51.885 million. what's insurance and what's the branch sale gains, if you could just bifurcate those? i mean i think insurance is around 35%. but if you have an exact number. and if you don't, i can follow up with you off-line.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
yes. so i think, overall, for the combined impact, i think, was 78 basis points on the impact of the two. and of that, i think insurance is about $37 million pre-tax.
laurie hunsicker -- compass point -- analyst
okay. you know what? i'll follow up with you off-line. i was just looking for exact -- yes, we're chatting later in a bit. okay. thank you. i will leave it there. i appreciate you taking the question.
nitin j. mhatre -- chief executive officer
thanks, laurie.
