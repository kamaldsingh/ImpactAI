[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of doug schenkel from cowen. your line is open.
doug schenkel
hey. good afternoon. and thanks for the call and for taking my questions. thanks for all the detail today.
there was a lot there, and it was really helpful. just starting with guidance. i'm sure it's not lost on you that your guidance for the year is a bit below where most recent consensus was. it's not far off, but it's a little bit lower.
i would imagine your skewing guidance to the lower end of the error bars, given the environment, keeping in mind that we're still just coming out of the pandemic, we hope, and that it is early in the year. if you were to come in above the range, what do you think the top three things are that are likely as you sit here to drive -- ultimately be the key drivers to upside relative to where you're setting expectations for the year?
chad robins
sure. doug, i'll take that. i think there's opportunities in immunoseq t-map on some of the kind of additional data deals as we expand there. in terms of our kind of life science research business, i think there's also potentially upside in our kit sales.
and there may be potential to hit some additional milestones on the development side. so there's potential across the business, for upside potential in kind of all the potential business segments. obviously, we've got kind of high hopes for the clonoseq business as well. so there's certainly opportunities there.
but as you said, it's -- you're coming out of the pandemic. we want to make sure that we're guiding the street and are being cautious.
doug schenkel
ok. super helpful. and then just a few other things, just to follow-up on -- based on the presentation. it does seem like the timelines changed on a couple of things.
first, i believe the timing of the genentech ind moved from q1 to q2. in the grand scheme of things, if i have that right, it's clearly not a big deal, but i just want to see if there's anything to detail further in terms of maybe something that genentech is further evaluating prior to the submission? and then the second thing is on the launch of the clia based lyme ldt, which i think also slipped. again, i may have those wrong. but if i have them right, i'd love you to talk a little bit about what i just asked about on genentech and then for lyme.
i just want to see how concerned we should be about timing given just how north american tick season tends to fall.
chad robins
yes. i'll let harlan answer the genentech question. just as far as lyme, we've been talking about a 2021 clia launch. so i'm not -- i don't think the timeline has slipped there.
it looks like we're on track to be able to launch during this year in a clia environment. harlan, do you want to cover genentech?
harlan robins
sure. so thanks, doug. so basically the -- through informal interaction with the fda and the set of consultants, genentech decided to upfront let's say, a set of studies and provide more information that they thought they were going to do between ind filing and first-in-humans. so this -- the timeline for first-in-humans didn't change at all.
so it's just a matter of where the ind filing is going to go relative to some of the other things that needed to be done. so i think we're -- it was a -- and it's genentech's call anyways, but i don't believe that we think there's a material change in sort of longer term view of this product. hopefully, that's sufficient.
doug schenkel
ok. yes. that's helpful. and one -- sorry -- sorry chad.
chad robins
doug, i just wanted to make one more comment on guidance. i think your models had the $10 million kind of revenue recognition from the ind acceptance on the genentech deal. it is street had it in the model. and we're -- just from a rev rec issue, our -- and accounting principles are recognizing four to five.
so that's going to probably $5 million to $6 million of it right there as well. just to clarify.
doug schenkel
yes. that's a super helpful bridge going back to that. and then last one, kind of as a follow up for, i think, harlan, and then i'll get back in the queue. what are the next steps after successful data is generated for the personalized t therapy? i guess i'm just trying to see if you've learned anything in terms of how ultimately, the regulatory process is going to unfold here after that data is generated?
harlan robins
yes. so in some ways, we're learning as we go. we've been -- both genentech and adaptive have as many sets of consultants as well as internal capabilities to assess regulatory, and we're interacting with the fda. so we're -- it has -- since it is new, it hasn't been completely worked out yet, but -- i'm not sure i can answer that as directly as i would like yet, but we'll get back to you when we get more resolution on the details.
but so far, the fda certainly seems there -- i think they're excited about the possibility as are we, but we have to see if -- what the exact requirements are going to be. and we're trying to dot every i and cross every t.
doug schenkel
ok. thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of brian weinstein from william blair. your line is open.
brian weinstein
hey, guys. thanks for taking the questions. good afternoon. on t-detect covid, obviously, a great milestone here for the company to launch a t cell-based diagnostic.
can you talk -- just you talked enthusiastically at the beginning about it. can you just talk more about the importance of this? and what it sells -- what it says about t cell diagnostics as a class of products going forward? and really how it can be impactful across various conditions? you've outlined several of those in the past. but i'm just curious about kind of what this milestone signals you think to you guys, the broader community? and also curious about thoughts fda has had about reviewing the t cell-based product?
chad robins
sure. thanks, brian. harlan, do you want to try framing this and putting it into context?
harlan robins
sure. thanks, brian. so basically, every major diagnostic company in the world has put out a serology test for covid. and yesterday, we launched a test using a completely different technology that answers some overlapping questions.
and as part of our data, we've done head-to-head comparisons. and our test performs as well or better than almost any of the serology tests. and even beyond that, we're kind of getting better every week at both detecting covid as well as many other diseases in the pipeline. we've learned a lot from covid to apply there, too.
so -- and i don't yet even know what the limit of how good we can be in terms of sensitivity and specificity and how broad this can be in terms of how many diseases we can eventually include in the single test. but it already stands up to the premier tests for viruses in terms of serology from the best companies in the world for -- in the space of covid. and to be honest, that was the thing we really learned. i didn't know -- i knew we could detect covid.
i didn't know that we'd be able to do it with the sensitivity and specificity that really could compare to the kind of best-in-class, and already. and so that was what was kind of -- if i think about it, so it's a good -- so if i think of a good analogy, so i would think of tesla from -- when they released the roadster a decade ago. so there they released a product that probably wasn't designed to be a big commercial product, but they show that an electric car could outperform a ferrari. and if we would really been -- if i have been paying attention, if everybody else had really been paying attention.
i think we would have realized that it was, at that point, it was sort of fait accompli that we would all end up with electric cars. because just it was a totally different way of propelling the automovil and even with one engineering team by itself was able to kind of blow away what everybody else in the world was able to do over -- with many, many years or decades of engineering. so that's kind of -- we're kind of sitting on this precipice, and i'm pretty excited about it, as you can probably tell.
brian weinstein
that's great. sorry. go ahead.
harlan robins
you also asked about the fda?
brian weinstein
yes. i just talked about how fda is thinking about reviewing a t cell-based product here, if you have anything specific that they've kind of commented to you about?
harlan robins
yes. so we've been in -- we're in the interactive review stage, and so far, everything is going quite well. we're -- the fda has been super supportive and also quite reasonable. so there's some -- because it's totally new, there's some extra steps that we hadn't even thought of, like, for example, they don't even -- that there's no space on the fda website for a test like us.
so they have to literally create a new space on their website in order to put us on there. so there's some extra like minor time delays here and there, but in terms of our interaction and the data that we provided them and their feedback on it and the studies we've done, we feel very good about it, and they've been great partners on us to date.
brian weinstein
great. thanks. and then if i could sneak two more and just on t-detect, in general. first, i heard you talked about in lyme.
i mean, is there anything on the oncology-based diagnostics that you guys are coming up with? i think ovarian was originally the one you were targeting first. and then chad c, can you just talk about if there's t-detect covid and t-map covid in the guidance? and if so, are you willing to quantify that? thanks.
harlan robins
so we are working in a couple of different areas of cancer. i do think that that's going to be a longer time horizon than -- i think, we have a group of autoimmune diseases and other group of infectious diseases that are all moving faster, mostly because the space of antigens is so broad in cancer, that it's sort of a bigger, harder problem, but we are advancing. and our partnership with astrazeneca is going to accelerate that as well. and i think we might have some other partners that can help us in that regard in the future.
so we're bullish about it, but it's going to take some time on the cancer side.
chad cohen
brian, on your questions on t-detect and t-map covid. so we do have some small studies that are contemplated with respect to t-map covid sort of -- in the guide. so to the extent that there are larger studies available to us throughout the year, i think that would -- as chad robins mentioned, probably represent upside to our outlook. and then yes, t-detect is in our guide as well.
it represents, i think, a very sort of low percentage. we're looking to see what the trajectory is from our full launch just the other day, before we perhaps think about where that might go from an upside perspective. but right now, it's sort of low single digits for the year.
brian weinstein
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of salveen richter from goldman sachs. your line is open.
unknown speaker
great. good afternoon and thank you for taking our question. this is elizabeth on for salveen. i guess big picture with regards to the drug discovery vertical and then more so for other oncology efforts, in general.
i guess, could you speak to adaptive strategy for partnering assets here versus keeping programs in-house? and then a second question. so in 2021, i guess, could you walk us through the exact data that's going to be disclosed from the private products and shared product candidates? i think if i heard this correctly, there's tot data coming from 15 cancer patients for the private products early in 2021. and we're just trying to get a sense of what that could look like? thank you.
chad robins
sure. i'll start with the first question, and then i'll pass it off to harlan for the second question. with respect to our partnering strategy versus how much we're going to take in-house, i look at it this way is that, to start with in terms of both our human capital resources expertise, right now, we're learning from kind of the best. we had the opportunity to partner with kind of multiple companies.
we chose genentech and cell therapy and really have an opportunity to kind of learn as we go. and over time, we will look to kind of potentially kind of move up the value chain and vertically integrate as we learn more. but for right now, we're in the stage where we think our expertise at kind of using immune receptors and finding them as targeting molecules for therapeutic uses are -- as our place in the ecosystem right now, but we -- that could change over time. and we could make investments over time to expand that capabilities as we learn more and get that expertise.
and then as far as kind of what data is going to be presented or available over the year with respect to kind of the shared and private product, i'll pass it on to harlan to disclose if we can, what's going to be available.
harlan robins
yes. so since this is a partnership with genentech, in most cases, they'll have the final say over what gets released and how it gets released. i presume that in terms of the private product, the actual data itself, there'll probably be little released publicly. this is sort of internal as of now and that we're going to forge ahead as fast as possible toward getting this filed with the fda and getting in the clinic.
and then on the shared products, also, i think as we file our ind, i think, the first shared product, what the target is, will become known as part of that. and then for the next one, i think, we'll let -- we'll definitely inform you when we trigger that next product, but the actual target itself will be known upon filing on, i'm sure. so probably not as forthcoming in this case. and it's because it's not really under our control.
unknown speaker
got it. thank you so much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of tejas savant from morgan stanley. your line is open.
tejas savant
one quick one, chad, for you on the labcorp agreement. just what additional steps does labcorp need to take here before performing key detect on site? or is it essentially ready to go? and then how quickly do you expect the collaboration to result in accelerated growth for clonoseq and immunoseq? and at a very high level, at least, can you walk us through how the economics would work versus the direct sales for you?
chad robins
sure. actually, i'm going to have julie answer the question on labcorp.
julie rubinstein
sure. tejas, thanks so much. so the labcore agreement is actually, as you noted, a combination of a variety of agreements that we've signed with them. one is the extension of a blood collection for t-detect.
the other is the ruo kit. the second site lab, as you mentioned, and then clonoseq. so for the on-site next steps, we are in the process right now of operationalizing that. there's a little bit of work that we need to do to make that happen, but the teams are already working together to identify those next steps, and it should be ready in a couple of months, i would say.
and in terms of the growth timeline and the economics, specifically for the clonoseq agreement, that is really a marketing program, whereby we cannot, for compliance reasons share economics in terms of commission to reps and so forth. so it's essentially an agreement whereby we are paying labcore a very nominal amount actually to have the opportunity to include clonoseq in their oncology reps' bag, and so that they can end market clonoseq to their community oncology users -- customers.
tejas savant
got it. got it. that's helpful. and then how do you think -- yes, go on...
julie rubinstein
just one, you asked also about the seller timeline. and so we've been working for a little bit of time actually to operationalize with labcore's so that we'd be ready to hit the ground running with training and get their reps ready to sell in the fields right away. so we do anticipate seeing some amount of penetration through that relationship in 2021, but it is baked into our guidance.
tejas savant
got it. perfect. and then, julie, do you expect this to sort of accelerate that transition from bone marrow to blood pretty meaningfully here, say, by the third or fourth quarter of this year? and by when should we expect a response from the fda on all?
julie rubinstein
sure. so we do anticipate and hope, actually, that there is going to be a larger proportion of usage of clonoseq in blood. what i can tell you to date since the launch of cll a 70% of those orders are actually in blood. so while i think it will be indication dependent, we're definitely seeing a tendency toward blood, at least, for that particular indication.
and that's really nice to see. we just -- we filed all, and we don't -- we haven't actually provided, i don't think announcement of when we expect it, but it would -- we expect it to follow the normal sort of six months or so time line from the fda.
chad robins
that makes, tejas, the cdrh right now is slammed right now with covid, and back up in general across diagnostic applications. so i just want to make sure that kind of set the stage. it's really an industrywide problem that we're working through out of that dx to try to solve.
tejas savant
got it. that's understandable. and one final housekeeping one for chad c. what are you assuming, chad, in terms of the lyme contribution at the midpoint of the guide here?
chad cohen
i mean really nominal, it would, i think, in contribution.
tejas savant
ok. yeah. that's perfect. thank you so much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of tycho peterson from jp morgan. your line is open.
tycho peterson
thanks, guys. a question on the truab discovery efforts. two parter: first, the covid neutralizing antibody, as you said, you're in advanced discussions. so should we assume that you kind of bake something in the guidance there? or could that be another source of upside? and then i think the bigger question here is where are you going with the discovery approaches on truab? i mean could you go after more so sepsis? i mean there seems to be unlimited opportunities for monoclonal antibody therapies.
so what are kind of the priorities for the research efforts side?
harlan robins
so there's nothing in the guidance. it's not contemplating any contribution from that.
chad robins
harlan, do you want to answer...
harlan robins
sure. yes. so yes, thanks, tycho. so we're evaluating a variety of different directions to go with our antibody platform.
that includes some of the things that you're mentioning, but we actually have a variety of other directions that we're exploring as well that i think are sort of opened up by a combination of our immunology platforms as well as our truab platform. so we'll give more information as we go because right now, we're sort of in the -- we're just in a planning phase and evaluating different options. but we're pretty excited about this, and we're bringing on some new technologies as well and evaluating some potential partners as we go forward.
tycho peterson
ok. and then on immunoseq t-map, i'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about the level of interest, the funnel beyond the initial partnerships with astrazeneca and oxford. can you just talk to what the funnel looks like there for incremental partners?
chad robins
sure, tycho. julie, you want to take that.
julie rubinstein
sure. yes. as we discussed, i think in the fall, obviously, the trials were very far advanced when we brought this product to the vaccine developers, and we're all thrilled about that. i think there's been -- obviously, the introduction of the new variants as well as new fda guidance that you might have seen recently on immunogenicity and just this better understanding of the importance of the t cell response, the whole virus is definitely helping and advancing many of our discussions.
we have about more than the companies were allowed to discuss that are working with us already on t-map covid, and we're running a variety of different types of trials for them right now with the pharma companies as well as, as i mentioned in my remarks, a nice set of trials on the academic side as well. so we will have data on almost all of the most advanced vaccines and i think from that data, we're going to learn a lot as will they, that will really set the stage for the way this continues to progress throughout the year.
tycho peterson
ok. and then a modeling question, just on life science research. are you assuming kind of a sequential improvement here in sequencing in the first quarter? are we through the worst to mid? or do you think it could continue to be down?
chad robins
i don't know -- julie, do you want to take that, or do you want me to?
julie rubinstein
maybe i can start and then you can...
chad robins
sure.
julie rubinstein
i guess what i just wanted to make a couple of quick remarks on that with life sciences research. we -- just to clarify, as you know, life science research on the pharma side is made up of both the mrd pharma as well as the tcr pharma work that we do. and the mrd pharma work is quite advanced registrational trials, which actually did quite well in 2020. it's really the exploratory work that was most impacted by covid because it's non-covid related.
we do expect to see recovery in that front and continued growth with the mrd pharma work that we do. and i'll let chad kind of take you through more specifically in the numbers.
chad robins
yes, absolutely. so the way we're thinking about it, just as i mentioned on the script, is that the first quarter really from a life science research perspective, should be our low watermark. for the year with progressing revenues as well as bookings throughout the year, for both the pharma contracts that are tied to those registrational studies, as julie said, on the mrd side, and those that are more exploratory in nature. so we are assuming sort of sequential growth across revenue and volume.
but as you know, it's also -- there is a ton of variability when it comes to some of these trials. and so sometimes they can -- depending on the size of the trial, they can impact whether one quarter is maybe benefiting a little more than the next sequentially. but short of -- some large volume samples coming in from particularly large trial, we should see continued growth quarter over quarter.
tycho peterson
ok. a last one, i think you mentioned opening a european lab. can you just talk to the strategy there?
chad robins
sure. so we already have a small number of people in europe, but in order to essentially access kind of core lab's in europe, we had to establish a european entity, and that will allow us to kind of expand kind of the boots on the ground and the field force there.
harlan robins
it's not a lab we're opening.
chad cohen
yes, effectively starting off with a legal entity in base years.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan chase & co -- analyst
ok. got it.
operator
your next question comes from the line of derik de bruin from bank of america. your line is open.
unknown speaker
hi. this is ivy on for derik today. thank you for taking my question. congrats on the t-detect covid progress there and the labcorp partnership.
just curious, how do you see the tests rolling out as estimates or discussion regarding how the immunity timing evolves? just curious how that all plays out. and then what have you seen in terms of the uptake since your soft launch back in december?
chad robins
sure. julie, do you want to take that?
julie rubinstein
sure. ivy, so yes, so in terms of the early access launch, as you mentioned, i'll start there. as i think you know, we didn't have any virtual prescriber capability. so it was a little bit of a challenging ordering process.
and therefore, we didn't do any marketing. but yet, we had over 650 tests ordered and delivered, and 13 concierge medicine groups signed up. and as i mentioned, 60% participation in the opt-in for ongoing research. so given the fact that it was available, people have to sort of find it on their own, and it was over the holidays.
we feel like it does give a good appreciation for interest in t cell testing. with the full launch in the virtual prescriber capability, a labcorp blood collection, and some of the excitement we're already seeing in the media and the hopefully imminent eua and that targeted marketing, for some period of time, we expect to see growth of the test. but we are, as you mentioned, very aware of the changing dynamics of the diagnostic market. we recognize that things may change with more vaccination, widespread vaccination.
but what we do know is that the t cells matter, and we are thrilled to be able to participate in understanding exactly what they mean, and we'll continue to share that information. and that's really why we did this, as we've always said from the start. it's really about validating both our platform and the utility of reading t cells in blood across diseases. and we really think we're going to learn a lot from this experience to contribute to the future growth.
it's really just the beginning for t-detect.
unknown speaker
great. a couple of questions on the lyme disease. i know we talked about pricing around $500, if i remember correctly last time. could you update us on any thoughts there? and number two, could you share a bit more details on the current thinking on commercialization? like are you bringing a sales force or also partnering with labcorp? thank you.
julie rubinstein
sure. so right now, that's still our target price. we are continuing to do payer research as the data matures. and that maturity of the data is also influencing our commercialization plans.
we've talked previously about focusing exclusively on the acute lyme setting. and we are, in fact, seeing some interesting data that shows the potential utility of this in the -- what we call the pclbs setting. so those patients who had been treated with antibiotics but have lingering symptoms. so a lot of those are sort of tied together as that data continues to read out.
and that will help us set the commercialization plan going forward. from an organizational perspective, we have hired a vp of sales, who's putting together his plans around exactly how we anticipate the final pricing and marketing plan for the test, and we'll provide more details of that most likely on the next call.
unknown speaker
great. one final quick one. just wanted to get an update on the percentage labs open since that still impacting the research business.
chad robins
you cut out a little bit, ivy. can you say that again?
unknown speaker
yes. i just wanted to get an update on the percentage of labs open, as of 4q or exiting january? is that still impacting the research business and all that?
julie rubinstein
so our view of it is that those labs are opening. they're in the process of opening. and then hopefully, that will continue. they're not as fully staffed like they maybe -- were in the past.
but we're definitely starting to see more activity, more usage of the kit. and in fact, even with t-map covid, as i mentioned, a lot of the research is shifting toward covid, and we're starting to see uptake of those opportunities with our academic business as well. but it's still -- we have remains to be seen. we don't have a very large field force on the academic research side.
so we don't have the same sort of coverage we have with our clonoseq field force to really hit all the ups and downs in all the various locations throughout the country. and so that also leads to a little bit more of the volatility that we're seeing, but we're definitely seeing much more of an opening that we hope will continue as the year progresses.
unknown speaker
great. thank you for the detail.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david westenberg from guggenheim securities. your line is open.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thanks. so lot's already been covered. so i just want to confirm, i think you said 600 tests in t-detect have already been ordered. i want to make sure that's correct.
is there any anticipation number that you have for t-detect for this year, just given the fact that we're rolling out that vaccine? but more importantly, i want to ask in terms of how meaningful the additional samples can be from a platform standpoint? from terms of r&d, can that help you get other tests out faster? and then in terms of regulatory conversations that you have real-world samples, i mean, do you think that speeds up some of your time lines for immunoseq dx maybe lyme or some of the things that you're going to do in gi? and i'll just stop with that. and that question will be our last question.
chad robins
yes. sure, david. so first, let me just start with, the slr to confirm the kind of 600 tests without marketing or kind of the virtual prescriber. and in terms of projecting number of tests, just keep in mind, this is a brand-new category of testing.
so it's very, very hard to predict. what our testing volumes are going to be with a marketing initiative. so -- i'm -- we're not going to provide guidance on that. as far as kind of how t-map -- or excuse me, how t-detect covid has accelerated signal generation.
i'll have harlan comment because it's been quite significant.
harlan robins
sure. yes. so i think one of the biggest boon to our learning was -- from covid was a couple of things. one is that, obviously, everybody was sharing samples, so we were able to get a very large amount of samples.
and they were super clean because the pcr-based diagnostics of who got the disease and who didn't was -- is quite accurate. so we got many, many thousands of positives and negatives that we're able to really use to improve our algorithms and understanding in conjunction with microsoft. and for example, we have been sitting on a sample set for multiple sclerosis that we had, to be honest, hadn't been making that much headway on. and then we started applying some of our algorithmic learnings that we had from covid and all of a sudden, a really nice clean signal started appearing.
this is still in research, but we're pretty excited about this. and it's improving our signal in all of our studies, including celiac and lyme and crohn's, and a variety of others that we're working on behind the scenes as well. so we're -- this has been a huge boon to our understanding. i think there was a third part to that question.
was there a third part to your question?
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
the only other third part would have been the regulatory standpoint?
harlan robins
yes. so we've -- the nice thing about covid, from our point of view is there's an eua out there, which allows us to interact with the -- in an accelerated time frame with the fda and really get them to see our data, understand our assay and they've been really great about the whole process. so i think that interaction obviously, having that personal interaction and really understanding what their comments and concerns are, and coming to an agreement on how to address them has been a big boon for us and hopefully, will carry over into other areas for -- as this product expands into multiple diagnostics.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mark massaro from btig. your line is open.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for the question. i'll just ask one, and it's for chad robins. companies like grail and thrive certainly are pursuing multi cancer tests that can screen for roughly 10 or up to 50 different cancers.
i know you guys are contemplating a panel approach on t-detect. but i think i also heard you talk about maybe a general health panel in the future. and so if i heard that correctly, can you just elaborate on that? and just talk about the decision to pursue panels or maybe a really large panel?
chad robins
yes. it's a great question. thanks, mark. we -- it's -- we're really looking at it as a three-phase approach, where right now, we're going disease by disease.
the second phase is a panel like approach based on kind of patients who come in the door that have a similar set of symptoms. but at the same time, we're parallel tracking, and we're actually exploring options for kind of large-scale trials to be able to look at many different diseases at the same time to get to a really a -- i don't know if i'll call it a pan disease diagnostic, but many disease at the same time, diagnostic. and there's different ways to do that and different methodologies and partners that we're looking at as potentials to accelerate that kind of multi disease panel.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
thanks so much.
chad robins
you bet. thanks, mark.

thanks, karina. good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call. what a year. once again, i want to thank all our adaptive employees for their unwavering dedication, flexibility, and execution in a very challenging 2020.
yesterday, marked a pivotal moment for diagnostic testing. adaptive launched t-detect covid, proving that it is possible to read how t cells detect disease in the blood. this test is now validated for covid, but it's just the beginning. t cells see all diseases in the exact same way, and t-detect will translate this natural capability of t cells into a broadly applicable tests that will change the diagnostic paradigm.
we recognize it may take time for t-detect to become mainstream, but the stage is set. the fda has reviewed and provided encouraging feedback on our eua submission. fda is working through how we can implement a new t cell testing category. fda clearance under the eua pathway, when received, will be the next milestone for t-detect and one of many to come as we realize its value over time.
in addition to the launch of t-detect covid, all the efforts we put in place to combat the pandemic are being leveraged to accelerate a variety of development and commercial initiatives that will drive the future execution of our platform to power the age of immune medicine. let me walk you through the significant progress we made throughout the year. as shown on slide 3, despite the impact from covid-19, we grew our business and ended the year with over $98 million in revenue, up 16% versus 2019. and revenue in the fourth quarter also grew 25% versus prior year to $30.2 million.
as you can see, the amount of progress is significant. and demonstrates our ability to execute across our business areas, which are all driven by the same platform. starting with clinical diagnostics. in addition to the launch of t-detect covid, we also advanced t-detect for other future indications.
the immune sense study for t-detect lyme was launched and is expected to be completed in 2021. we identified another signal in crohn's disease, which may represent a significant opportunity to reduce the expensive and time-consuming diagnostic odyssey that crohn's patients currently undergo. we are also advancing at an increasingly rapid pace in many other disease states. clonoseq also achieved important milestones during the year.
we obtained our first label expansion with the fda for cll in both blood and in bone marrow. and i'm pleased to announce that we recently filed with the fda for the second label expansion of all into the blood. we are hopeful that more patients will be able to know their mrd status from a simple blood draw as data continues to support this approach. in our life science research business, although the most impacted by covid, we developed in three important ways: first, as a result of finding from the immune code database, we launched immunoseq t-map covid to elucidate the t cell response to vaccines and development for covid-19.
second, we further extended immunoseq t-map to cancer with our recent partnership with astrazeneca to map t cell receptors to cancer antigens and astrazeneca's portfolio of cancer medicines. and third, we entered into several contracts to expand distribution of our research-use-only kits with partners, including prominent cros and core lab's. in fact, yesterday, we announced an expanded partnership with labcore to enable broader access to our growing portfolio of immune-driven clinical diagnostic and research products. in drug discovery, we made significant progress on the tcr discovery front with genentech, with both the shared and private products.
the path is set for important milestones in 2021, including ind filing by genentech of the first shared product, generation of a data package by adaptive for a possible second shared product, and proof-of-concept on the private products. in addition, we leveraged our new medicine platform to build world-class antibody discovery capabilities that can benefit society for years to come. our powerful technology allows us to search deeper and find more potent neutralizing antibodies against a wider variation of targets at very low concentrations. we have already found potent neutralizing antibodies against parts of the sars-cov-2 virus that could potentially treat patients impacted by a wide variety of variants.
we are in advanced discussions with several potential partners. as you can see, 2020 was a busy year for adaptive, and laid a strong foundation for our 2021 plan, which we will discuss in detail throughout the call. but before i pass it on to julie to provide details of our in-line products and our pipeline, i want to take a minute on slide 4, to reorient to the fact that everything we do at adaptive derived from using the genetics of the adaptive immune system as the source code of our platform. our platform then transforms this code into data to enable the development of diagnostics and therapeutics for almost any disease.
the massive and growing amount of immune receptor data that we generate with over 58 billion immune receptors that said really at the epicenter of all of our business areas. and the scalability of our platform and our data enables us to become a clinical product development engine. i am more confident than ever in our open-ended growth story as we have made substantial progress and have development activity under way at various stages in life science research, clinical diagnostics, and in drug discovery. and with that, i'll hand it over to julie.
julie?
julie rubinstein
thanks, chad, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. i want to echo chad's thanks to our incredible employees. it has definitely been a challenging but successful year. starting with clinical diagnostics and the exciting launch of t-detect covid on slide 5.
yesterday, we began marketing t-detect covid with new features that we developed since our early access launch back in december. this is a big milestone for adaptive and the first steppingstone for t-detect success. the test is available at t-detect.com, where a virtual provider, depending on eligibility, will now authorize a prescription. additionally, patients now have the option to get their blood drawn at one of over 2,000 labcorp patient service centers or by a mobile phlebotomist at their location of convenience, including their home.
we have filed t-detect covid with the fda via the eua pathway and are actively working with the fda on final details, including labeling. we anticipate obtaining eua clearance as the first t cell-based test to be validated by the fda. as mentioned in the past, we are offering t-detect covid for self-pay consumers and concierge medicine practices who were receptive during the early access launch. however, we know that the covid testing world is highly dynamic, and we are paying close attention to the evolving environment in light of vaccine rollout.
importantly, t-detect covid has enabled us to educate the fda for future submissions, activate work to prepare labcore as a second site for t-detect testing under eua guidance, and build awareness with hcps and consumers. additionally, all consumers at t-detect covid will have the option to participate in research to explore the potential role that two cells play in immunity for the natural infection or vaccination. to date, we have had a 60% option rate from current consumers. and we believe this is going to be very helpful as we all continue to navigate the pandemic.
we look to share learning from our on market real-world data in appropriate ways with the scientific community and consumers over time. we are very excited as the launch of t-detect covid marks the beginning of the commercial journey for t-detect and also enables acceleration of future indications under development. as you can see on slide 6, we are focusing on accelerating disease mapping through the r&d pipeline. in the near-term, we believe that we will be able to offer t-detect to improve upon the standard diagnostic paradigm in disease specific -- in specific disease states, including lyme, crohn's, celiac and others.
following t-detect covid, we expect to launch t-detect lyme in our clia lab in q4 of this year. we will continue to enroll the remainder of the immune sense lyme study during this year's lyme season, and these data will support our commercial and regulatory efforts. we are also actively progressing in crohn's disease with several thousand crohn's case-control samples expected to read out throughout the year. we intend to share these data iteratively as we have done with covid.
in addition, we have completed an extensive commercial analysis of crohn's disease, which confirms that the escalating testing from initial blood and stool tests by the primary care provider to invasive colonoscopies by the gi specialists, can cost anywhere from $8,000 to $22,000 per patient. with an instruments of approximately 18,000 patients with crohn's disease per year in the united states, multiplied by the number of people with gi symptoms that are somewhere along with diagnostic testing odyssey, the significance of a highly specific and sensitive blood test for crohn's disease as apparent. we also expect the readout of our 1,000 patient celiac studies later this year. we are excited about the progress we are making in these two gi disease states and are evaluating future development and commercialization possibility.
gi conditions may be a good cluster of diseases for which we can develop a panel to offer differentiated diagnosis of patients with shared system. a panel approach has always been the plan for the second phase of the t-detect product development life cycle. to expedite this, we are exploring several ways to enable texting and validation of disease classifiers in parallel. we hope to be able to share more details on this novel clinical validation approach in the near future.
longer term, we intend to reach our ultimate goal of enabling population immunomics, whereby t-detect can become one test with many results, all driven by the same blood sample that informs the general health of a person or a population. turning to slide 7 with clonoseq. clonoseq q4 sequencing volumes grew 40% versus prior year and 12% versus the prior quarter, although the business did experience some impact from covid toward the very end of the year. to date, more than 2,000 clinicians have been activated to order clonoseq, of which nearly 850 were activated in 2020.
hcp's ordering for the first time in 2020 contributed approximately 20% of order volume in the year, and in q4 2020 alone, orders were submitted by 738 unique hcps. more than 15,000 unique patients have had one or more clonoseq tests to date. in 2020, approximately 6,900 patients received clonoseq testing, of which around 50% of tested patients each quarter was a new clonoseq patient. in q4 2020, orders were submitted for approximately 3,100 patients, exceeding numbers achieved in all previous quarters.
we expect growth to continue and clonoseq volumes to double in 2021, with rates increasing quarter over quarter as the year progresses. to reach this goal, we are focused on deepening our penetration through a significant ramp-up of commercial efforts, including direct-to-patient advertising and peer-to-peer educational programming for clinicians. we also expect to expand our commercial reach and have increased the size of our specialized sales and customer support organizations, adding resources focused on community oncology and integrated delivery network. additionally, we have entered into a collaboration agreement with labcore, under which labcore's integrated oncology sales force will promote clonoseq with hematologists in the u.s.
this will enable new customers to leverage labcore's already established spend out testing workflows for clonoseq ordering and report delivery. through these investments, we expect to increase adoption across institutions, but particularly in community oncology settings, where the majority of cll patients are treated, and many myeloma patients are also seen. as always, expanding into blood testing is also a key strategy for clonoseq, as it is less invasive and more seamless for patients. since receiving our fda label expansion for cll in august of 2020, we have seen more than 70% of cll mrd tests being performed in the blood.
we are pleased to announce that we have submitted a 510(k) application with the fda for all in blood. and with ongoing data generation and validation efforts, we expect to continue to expand into blood testing for other indications, such as multiple myeloma and nhl. 2020 results provided the clonoseq business with a solid foundation on which to continue to build during 2021, which will be an important year in clonoseq's life cycle. that said, we will continue to monitor any potential impact of covid on testing volumes.
turning to life science research on slide 8. during the fourth quarter, research continued to be our most impacted business area by covid. on the academic side, as anticipated, we experienced delays in sample arrivals as academic centers were still not fully operational for non-covid related projects. although it is still at a slow start in q1, we are beginning to see more academic labs reopening and higher kit usage.
on the pharma side, we did have some delays and cancellations of clinical trials, which impacted our ability to recognize revenue. however, the team increased the total value of our new pharma bookings by over 20% in 2020 versus 2019, which is encouraging for future growth of our pharma business. we are focused on driving revenue for our research business in 2021 in a few ways. from a product perspective, we are expanding adoption of the updated immunoseq ruo kit for core lab's and cros, and the new immunoseq t-map covid product extension for vaccine developers.
regarding the ruo kit, in 2020, we signed 35 new core lab partnerships with well-respected labs in the u.s. and we also signed contracts with two global cros, q2's and labcore, to enable them to become immunosequencing centers of excellence for their biopharmaceutical customers. regarding t-map covid, we are currently working with several top-tier vaccine developers, including astrazeneca and oxford university in conjunction with bill & melinda gates foundation, to assess the t cell response to various covid vaccines in their studies. it was challenging to integrate into the incredibly needed and successful speed of vaccine trials in the back half of 2020.
but with the new variance on the rise, understanding the t cell response across the entire genome of the virus is becoming increasingly necessary. interestingly, we are also seeing several orders for t-map covid from academic lab who are studying the impact of vaccines on patients receiving other immune mediating therapies such as cancer immunotherapy. we expect to see more usage of t-map covid in these kinds of studies and perhaps even in conjunction with research being performed by the nih and the nci post-eua clearance. as chad mentioned, immunoseq t-map doesn't just apply to covid.
it applies to any disease. as such, in january, we announced a multiyear pan portfolio partnership with az to map t cell receptors to cancer antigen and az's portfolio of cancer medicines. this is our second application of immunoseq t-map, and is our first data play in oncology, stemming from our antigen mapped microsoft collaboration. from an organizational perspective, we are focusing our investments in research sales in two keyways: first, we are opening a european business entity to support international expansion.
we believe there is a lot of interest in immunosequencing at core lab's outside of the united states, and we want to improve our ability to capture that business. secondly, we are expanding our organization to include an inside sales team and more marketing colleagues to grow our kit business and data monetization opportunities. moving on to drug discovery on slide 9. progress continues full speed ahead in both shared and private t cell mediated products with genentech.
for the first shared product, we had anticipated the ind submission by genentech in the first quarter of this year. based on productive interactions with the fda, genentech decided to file in the second quarter to include additional information requested by the fda that was initially planned for post filing. for the second shared product, we have characterized several promising ccrs currently being considered by genentech for the development of its second shared product. we expect to complete a second tcr data package this year.
and if this tcr candidate is selected by genentech, this could result in the potential development of our second shared product using our trutcr approach. in addition, we continue to build our pipeline of trutcr candidates against additional targets that we've prioritized with genentech. for the private product, we have started screening and identifying patient specific tcrs against specific tumor mutations using blood from each cancer patient. we are on track to deliver a proof-of-concept from an initial 15 cancer patients to genentech by q1 2021.
these data and results from additional cancer patient samples will be used to establish a prototype during the second half of this year. to scale our private product development, we are building a dedicated lab that will be opened by the end of this quarter. this additional space will accommodate our end-to-end personalized product workflow. importantly, this space has the capacity to accommodate early phase clinical studies.
we are also in the process of growing our product and process development teams and hiring dedicated ftes for this purpose. as you can see, lots of progress and exciting milestones ahead in our partnership with genentech. switching now to our neutralizing antibodies on slide 10. using our truab antibody discovery approach, we identified several lead antibody candidates that strongly bind to different parts of the virus.
our growing portfolio of novel antibodies include candidates that not only bind to the rbd region, but also bind to s1, trimer, and s2. this could have important advantages in the pactual strategy that targets different mechanisms of action to inhibit the virus and potentially virus varin. we are advancing discussions with potential partners who similarly believe that our antibody candidates may provide a differentiated solution in the wake of these variants. building on our success in identifying differentiated antibodies to sars-cov-2 as our first clinically relevant target, we are exploring additional future applications of our truab discovery approach.
as part of our drug discovery growth strategy, we aim to identify additional naturally occurring, fully human antibodies against several targets in infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders, particularly where we can fill a strong unmet need. i'll now pass it over to chad c, who will provide you with a financial update.
chad cohen
thanks, julie. i'll first review our fourth-quarter financial results, briefly describe our full year financial performance, and then we'll provide an outlook on 2021. turning to slide 11. total revenue in the fourth quarter was $30.2 million, representing a 25% increase from $24.2 million in the same period last year.
our revenue mix for the fourth quarter consisted of 42% of our revenues coming from our sequencing category and 58% coming from our development category. sequencing revenue in the fourth quarter was $12.7 million and decreased 8% from the same period in 2019. this decrease was primarily driven by our research business and partially offset by growth in our clinical business. research sequencing volume decreased by 46% to 5,907 sequences from 10,898 sequences in the fourth quarter 2019.
trial enrollment delays and project deferrals resulting from the covid-19 pandemic were both contributing factors to the decrease on a year-over-year basis. however, we did see growth in our pharma business related to mrd registrational studies. on a sequential basis from the third quarter, we did see modest growth in our pharma business in respect to volumes, but our academic business continue to feel macro pressure from the current environment. with respect to our clinical diagnostic products, clinical sequencing volume, which now includes our t-detect covid volume, increased 41% in the fourth-quarter 2020 to 4,539 clinical tests from 3,218 clinical tests from the fourth-quarter 2019.
we have seen a recovery of our clinical sequencing volumes with our fourth-quarter 2020 volumes, up 13% from the previous quarter. development revenue grew to $17.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 69% from the same period last year. the increase was largely due to growth in revenue generated from our genentech collaboration based on ongoing aggressive investments into our drug discovery efforts. shifting now from our revenue to our operating costs.
total operating expenses for the fourth-quarter 2020 was $74.4 million, representing a 54% increase from $48.4 million in the same quarter last year. continuing to work down our operating expenses, cost of revenue was $6.2 million during the fourth-quarter 2020 compared to $6 million for the fourth quarter last year, representing a 3% increase. though the increase was relatively flat, there were some material puts and takes year over year. we invested in additional lab personnel, lab management and capex to ensure that we came into 2021 with the appropriate capacity to operationalize our growth projections.
this increase in overhead drove up our overall costs of running our production lab but was offset by a lower mix of revenue sample volume. research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $35.8 million compared to $21.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, representing a 69% increase. the increase was to support our drug discovery activities relating to our genentech collaboration and antibody discovery for covid, as well as validation efforts for t-detect covid and t-detect pipeline development, along with investments tied to expanding our clonoseq indications. sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $18.5 million compared to $12.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, representing an increase of 47%.
the two primary drivers of the increase were personnel and marketing costs. year over year, we continued our hiring process to support the clonoseq brand and also made our first fully dedicated team hires to support our t-detect covid launch. we also undertook a large corporate rebranding effort and continue to deploy marketing investments to soft launch our t-detect covid product and to support our clonoseq brand. overall, these increases were partially offset by savings in travel and customer event related expenses.
general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $13.4 million compared to $8.2 million in the fourth-quarter 2019, representing an increase of 63%. the increase was primarily driven by growth in finance, legal, and hr headcount, and personnel costs. net loss for the fourth-quarter 2020 was $44.6 million compared to fourth-quarter 2019 net loss of $20.6 million. adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2020 was a loss of $34.6 million compared to a loss of $18.7 million in the same period of the prior year.
quickly turning now to our annual financial results for 2020. total revenue was $98.4 million, representing a 16% increase from $85.1 million in 2019. our revenue mix for the current year consisted of 42% of our revenues coming from our sequencing category and 58% coming from our development category. sequencing revenue in 2020 was $41.4 million and decreased 5% from 2019.
research sequencing volumes decreased by 36% to 22,663 sequences from 35,491 sequences in 2019. as previously discussed, trial enrollment delays and project deferrals resulting from the covid-19 pandemic have been contributing factors to this decrease. clinical sequencing volume, however, increased 50% in the current year to 15,216 clinical tests from 10,168 clinical tests in 2019. development revenue grew to $56.9 million in 2020 and up 37% from last year.
the increase was largely due to growth in revenue generated from our genentech collaboration. operating expenses for the year totaled $251.2 million, representing a 54% increase from $163.5 million in 2019. the largest driver of opex growth on a dollar's basis was research and development, which grew $45.4 million, up 64% from prior year, followed by sales and marketing, which grew $22.9 million and up 60% from prior year. earlier, chad and julie articulated the business rationale and opportunities available to adaptive, which drove these investments.
full-year 2020 net loss was $146.2 million compared to $68.6 million in the prior year. and adjusted ebitda for 2020 was a loss of $119.6 million compared to a loss of $57.5 million in 2019. we ended the year with approximately $807 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. we had no debt.
with respect to our outlook for 2021, in light of an ongoing covid recovery, we are planning an initial revenue range of $145 million to $155 million. this outlook represents 52% growth at the midpoint of the range and a strong reacceleration of revenues from prior year. we are contemplating our sequencing revenues to represent between 50% to 55% of our total revenues for the year, which includes our expectations for effectively doubling our clonoseq volumes. in our development revenues category, we currently contemplate increasing revenue from the amortization from the $300 million upfront from genentech based on increasing investments into the partnership.
additionally, we anticipate a $10 million genentech ind acceptance milestone payment in the second half of the year. but it should be noted that this outlook reflects only a partial recognition of the payment in 2021 of between $4 million to $5 million based on a proportional method of revenue recognition from our accounting literature. in addition, we are also contemplating mid-single-digit millions in potential mrd regulatory milestones in the back half of the year. with respect to some of the trends for the year, we anticipate our research business to be back-half weighted, and we expect q1 2021 to be our lowest watermark for the year.
this is due to normal seasonality, along with the overhang of the fourth-quarter covid impact. we anticipate that a strong backlog of signed pharma contracts coming into 2021, coupled with ongoing execution of new pharma bookings will contribute significantly to the growth so long as we continue to get access to samples. regarding our operating expenses and capital investments, we expect closer to $8 million to $12 million in sequential opex growth quarter over quarter, resulting in a slight reacceleration of opex growth as a percentage of revenue versus the prior year. these expenses will primarily support commercialization activities and investments in our immuno medicine platform.
in addition, we are deploying more capital off our balance sheet to support large scaling projects, which includes the opening of our new office and molecular lab facility in seattle, as well as the opening of our personalized cell therapy prototype facility to support our genentech partnership. we are excited for the next phase of growth at adaptive. and with that, i'd like to turn the call back to chad for his closing remarks.
chad robins
thanks, chad c. as you heard during the call, we have many exciting upcoming milestones in 2021 on the commercial and development fronts across all business areas, which are listed on slide 12. we're more confident than ever in our value proposition as we continue to deliver on our promises and demonstrate the capabilities of our platform. with that, i'd like to turn it back over to the operator and open it up for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of brian weinstein from william blair. your line is now open.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the questions. good afternoon.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
good afternoon, brian.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
hey, you know, really interesting stuff on the crohn's disease and the ability to distinguish between patients with colitis. can you talk about -- i'm very excited about this. can you talk and rightfully so, can you talk about a little bit more about what this potentially means for patients and the enthusiasm that you guys have for this potential product?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah, sure. i'll start and then i'll hand it over to harlan if he wants to dive deeper, but the upshot in this is, yeah, we're super excited about the crohn's data. this data proves that t cells are uber specific, so we can eliminate false positives. for each disease, we're going to get better and better on sensitivity, but this data, it's really the first data that provides the foundation for our thesis of going from looking at single diseases at a time to moving upstream in the clinical paradigm, so that doctors are able to differentially diagnose between diseases.
and remember, that whole kind if we -- as we outlined the whole vision for t-detect going one disease at a time to differential diseases to ultimately get into the concept of kind of one sample with many results from a single blood sample, we're working on our way. so we're really excited about what we're seeing and it really provides a foundation.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
great. then following up with the question on clonoseq. julie, you guys have talked a lot about investments that you guys have made in sales and marketing. you have a labcorp relationship now that is supposed to help you out.
can you just talk about how those investments are going in terms of the return that you're seeing on those? are you seeing the --
julie rubinstein -- president
no, did you guys get brian?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
brian, you got cut off there. but i -- was that the end of the question? what were the investments we're seeing in clonoseq? julie, do you want to take that?
julie rubinstein -- president
sure. is brian still there?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
i'm not sure, but go ahead and answer the question.
julie rubinstein -- president
ok. sure, absolutely. yes, we've been making carefully gated investments in clonoseq at an appropriate time to drive a doubling of volume as we've set out to achieve this year and we believe we're well on our way. the team is executing well.
we're starting to see an accelerated ramp to get us there. so for example, as i mentioned, we've had really nice growth in multiple myeloma and even despite launching cll in the middle of the pandemic, we're seeing a nice pickup in the cll as well. we have about half of the nccn centers using it now, 30% of orders are already coming from the community which is a new set of institutions that we're targeting about half. we've pretty much doubled the number of accounts ordering cll in the first quarter of the year.
so we believe we're right on track with our plan which was always back-half weighted in 2021. we have also a lot of initiatives in place, like peer-to-peer education, more marketing toward patients. we've just about completed training the new cohort, the new class of reps and so they'll be entering into the field. in fact, the team is together all week this week in a national sales meeting and we just really believe all the steps we're putting in place are setting us up for success in 2021.
operator
your next question comes from the line of derik de bruin from bank of america. your line is now open.
unknown speaker -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. this is ivy on for derik today. thank you for taking my question. so first on --
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
hi, ivy.
unknown speaker -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, so first on the clonoseq, just would highly appreciate if you could talk more about what needs to happen to reach the inflection point and get accelerate the growth for the volume. and then also if you could talk about the progress on the other indications, such as multiple myeloma and nhl.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
so julie, do you want to speak --
julie rubinstein -- president
sure. ok.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
go ahead, julie.
julie rubinstein -- president
sure. absolutely. hi, ivy. so, yeah, i mean, we're really very, very focused heads down on growth now.
so we've had great success opening up. we're activating accounts. all or a majority of our target accounts in the academic centers, now we're moving into the community and then we're really focused on deepening penetration in those existing accounts. as we've discussed, we deployed a new dhs sales team for their hematology specialists to drive adoption in the accounts.
we're focused on speeding up time to ordering post activation, doing that by clarifying use cases, doing more peer-to-peer education, as i mentioned. we're also focusing our users on id'ing as many patients as possible at diagnosis because that makes it easier to incorporate mrd more routinely in care. and as we mentioned also, we're focused on really moving the cll community toward accepting mrd as part of the routine way in which they manage their patients. so all of those things are just examples of how we're focused on growing in each of the disease states.
as i mentioned, multiple myeloma, we've been really educating that community about clonoseq for quite some time now and that growth continues at a really nice steady pace. cll, we expect it's going to continue to pick up, particularly, as we move on from covid and these patients can get back into treatment more regularly. we're hopeful also that our reps will be able to get back in person. you know that -- you know as i'm sure you're hearing from everyone, is really just starting to happen now and that's particularly important as we're moving into a new community setting.
and so that's kind of how we think about what really needs to happen to continue on an accelerated ramp throughout the year. i think you asked about indications. so you know that we filed all and blood and the fda has kind of put many of those reviews on hold right now. but as i mentioned in my earlier remarks, we can offer all and blood in our clia lab and that's, in fact, happening quite regularly now.
multiple myeloma, we're still waiting on the data to read out from the trial and we are increasing our focus in nhl now validating in blood and also waiting for a variety of clinical validation studies to read out that our medical team is overseeing, as well as, our pharma team in partnership with a couple of key partners who are also quite interested in advancing clonoseq and mrd in the nhl setting.
unknown speaker -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. that's very helpful, julie. i have two other quick questions on the financials. so first one, with all the moving parts, i apologize if i missed it in the prepared remarks.
i want to see if you could provide an update for the mix between sequencing revenue and development revenue in terms of the total revenue percentage. i think last quarter, you talked about maybe sequencing accounting for 50% to 55% of the total. so just curious given all the changes, where does that move to? and i'll put my second one upfront as well. so last quarter, you talked about contemplating the increasing revenue from amortization from upfront payment with genentech, so wondering if there's an update there.
thank you so much.
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
sure. i'll take those. so very quickly, yes, we still believe we're in the range for the full year of sequencing revenues to come in at between 50% to 55%. you saw a really strong revenue activities from our research component of the business.
this quarter, there were some planned large projects that really came in a little sooner than expected. so we're effectively just reiterating that we still believe in that 50% to 55% as a percentage of the total from a sequencing perspective. and then from a development perspective, sort of your second question, yes, still in the same sort of ballpark that we articulated on the last quarter. we had mentioned that modeling our development revenues for the full year should really start with looking at the third-quarter 2020 revenues and not our fourth-quarter ones.
we still believe that. we came in a little heavier than anticipated just given the robustness of the investments that we made in the quarter. but overall, we believe our development revenues are in line with what we previously articulated and we should see potentially some modest growth, but it won't be like a ton coming off of this quarter's numbers on a quarter-over-quarter basis. so still in that sort of range that we provided last quarter in terms of the total amount of development revenues from genentech.
unknown speaker -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you very much chad.
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
yeah.

your next question comes from the line of tycho peterson from j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. i'll start with immunoseq t-map covid. just curious now that you've headed out a couple of quarters, how big that business is? and how do you think about the durability there as we think about the variants, next-gen vaccines and the like? how do you think about the durability of the trends you're seeing there?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
sure.
julie rubinstein -- president
sure.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
maybe i'll start with that and then, julie, feel free to kind of jump in. but one is for t-map right now, that business is actually kind of just starting to pick up. in light of understanding the t cell disease response to variants and the vaccines, so we are seeing that business. in terms of kind of durability, it depends on kind of your view of covid and being endemic in the population, but t-map as a franchise, as part of the research business, we see having quite a bit of durability.
i mean, based on the fact that we can leverage kind of the map, the antigen map that we're building with microsoft to be able to inform kind of other parts of the business. so one area that we're particularly interested in and we think there's future opportunity in, is in the autoimmune space. and what's exciting about that is, not just the ability on the research business, but also the ability for that data to potentially inform kind of therapeutic targets. so you're starting to see that crossover.
so we're -- in terms of kind of durability and kind of the future of that business, even if kind of the covid opportunity winds up waning, we think there's opportunity in other disease states and that's kind of one of the kind of major benefits of the antigen map.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. the pfizer partnership, i'm curious how meaningful that is. you mentioned, i think it's across a couple of clinical programs.
julie, can you maybe comment on that one?
julie rubinstein -- president
sure. we don't disclose the financials as you know. it's much like many of the others that we've signed, where there's -- actually, in this case, there's some annual payments, sequencing revenue, as well as, milestones. it is a multiple myeloma translational partnership and so there'll be multiple compounds involved in the development program at pfizer targeting multiple myeloma.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then on genentech, now that you've delivered the proof-of-concept for the 15 cancer patients for the private product, can you just talk a little bit about how you think about their evaluation process? are there next steps on the private product that we should be paying attention to?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
harlan, can you take that one?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
sure. so we're working both together and in parallel on this since the -- just as a reminder, the objective on the private product is to take the t cells that are attacking the cancer in a given patient and take the t cell receptors out of those t cells, identify them, and then synthesize them and put them back into a set of that patient's own t cells and/or an off-the-shelf product at some future date with the idea being that we'd have a safe-on target and potent therapy. so the two parts are, on our side is really identifying very rapidly the t cell receptors that are cancer specific, and that's really the proof of principle that we're going through. and we now have to do all the development work, exactly how much blood, how is it stored, what materials we're going to start with to optimize the process and then all the other development processes related to the reagent use, the actual workflow, etc.
and at the same time, genentech is working on the actual cell therapy part, the cell manufacturing part, etc., and together, we're discussing the science on a regular basis. so it's proceeding nicely, but we have a -- it's a hard thing to do and we have a ways to go, but the trains on the tracks and we're feeling good about the direction we're going.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thank you.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
thanks.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah. thanks, tycho.

hey, everybody, thanks for taking my question and apologize in advance. i know everybody on the line is struggling a little bit, so i apologize if any of these have been answered. my first is just on the genentech shared product market -- [technical difficulty]
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
hey, doug, we can't -- we can't hear you. you're breaking up. could you try that again?
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst

your next question comes to the line of tejas savant from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, this is yuko on the call for tejas. thanks for taking our questions. you mentioned you would be sharing data for crohn's and celiac later this year. what would you have us focus on with that presentation and what additional information should we be looking for?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah. so far, we've done a couple of different things. we had one study which we -- which was a smaller study, a few hundred samples where we first found our crohn's signal and we talked about that a little bit last year. but what we're waiting for, we now have 5,000 samples in-house that includes crohn's and colitis.
there's 1,600 colitis samples. so we're going to finished sequencing which we're almost done, that data set, and then we're going to analyze that data set and then put it together. so we'll present the data once that's -- the larger study is fully analyzed and we have the -- really making sure we've dot our is and cross our ts on all the science.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then i've a follow-up. given the good traction you're seeing for clonoseq, cll, and blood, what are you seeing in terms of uptake for clonal testing and blood outside of cll? i think you might have mentioned all, could you remind me if you have?
julie rubinstein -- president
sure. sorry, so --
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
julie, could you take that one?
julie rubinstein -- president
so, yeah, i think -- yeah, we have about 25% of our usage in all in blood which is in our clia lab since it's not an fda-cleared label expansion at that time.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. great. and then how about in mm as well?
julie rubinstein -- president
so that's much smaller at this stage, multiple myeloma is sort of different biology. it's a disease of the bone marrow and the data is still emerging and the trial is still reading out at the moment. and so that one is not quite as advanced yet in blood as some of the other indications.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
julie rubinstein -- president
sure.

your next question comes from the line of doug schenkel from cowen. your line is now open.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. we'll try this again. can you guys -- can you all hear me a little bit better now?
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
you sound great, doug.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
that's better.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. the landline was messed up and now i'm on the cell. but anyway, sorry about that. so again, apologies in advance if some of this was covered earlier.
on the genentech shared products, i'm just wondering if you're starting to get any positive signals that fortify or build conviction that this is, in fact, a bonafide neoantigen, whether it's mutated or not mutated? and if not, at what point you think you'll have such a signal? and then i'm just wondering and maybe this has been going on all along, but is there -- has there been some consideration of maybe accelerating the pace of looking at targets like this in parallel? again, i'd assume, to some extent, that's already happening, but just given -- no matter how great you guys are, given limited biological and safety information around any given target, i'm just wondering if there are ways being contemplated that might increase the probability of success just in increasing the numbers and using that as a means to more quickly reach an ind submission.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure. so starting with your first question. so adaptive upfront confirms and this is to be honest, one of our specialties. we confirm that the antigens that we're going after as targets are process and presented and immunogenic.
so we know even before we do the bulk of our work on characterization that these are really good antigens to be going after and we have done that for many hundreds of targets on the discovery side. then the next step is sort of then searching for the absolute best key receptors that hit those targets which we have been done also with, i'd say, maybe not quite as many, but still well over 100 different targets. and then the next step is working with genentech, where we have to pick out the subset that has the optimal clinical use, meaning that it is ok in all their clinical parameters. they can recruit the patients, these mutations and/or tumor sites, and antigen occurring.
they have deemed it -- we, together, i guess, have deemed it safe and all the other parameters that need to be considered. and so, yes, i hear your point. on the second question, and yes, we're parallel tracking more than one on the latter steps for the reasons you said, there's a lot of work that goes into each one. on the adaptive side, we're able to do many on the discovery side in parallel, but there's a whole clinical program that needs to be put around each one.
so the farther that we get down the line, the more work and the tighter the funnel, but we are in parallel tracking more than one.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. and then on personalized t cell therapeutics on that program, again, you may have covered this, especially given i heard an earlier question that i think gone at this. but i believe you were targeting to share proof-of-concept data and launch your prototype lab in the first quarter or close to that.
did that happen?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah. we've -- i mean, we shared that with genentech. i don't know that we're not going to share it publicly. but yes, we've completed our first pilot experiment and we're -- have shared data with genentech and we're now having, in fact, we've been since then have done multiple other samples.
we had targeted to do 15 patients, but we're now well beyond that and we're progressing forward and we have sort of regular discussions with the scientific team at genentech, as well as, the clinical.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
and the prototype lab.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
oh, and yeah, sorry and the prototype lab is now built out. and we've completed construction and we're -- now is the real development effort on locking down the workflow through that lab, etc., and we've hired some of the team. we have to hire some of the -- some more of the team out and -- but all the equipment is in. it's -- the lab is ours and it's fully operational.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
and it sounds like, with that in mind, you're in good position to hit your target of 60 patients by end of year.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
oh, yeah, yeah.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. ok. all right. that's great.
thank you again and sorry for the technical challenge.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
oh, no problem. thanks, doug.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder

your next question comes from the line of mark massaro from btig. your line is now open.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for the questions and congrats on a strong quarter. i guess, my first one is similar to doug's question and that is, you know, there are some investors that seem to have concerns about your ability to advance another shared target. and so, i guess, for those that are skeptical, can you just maybe address -- i know julie mentioned that the first target was -- the first candidate was specific to the target.
but wondering if you can provide a little more detail around maybe picking from a neoantigen as opposed to a tumor-associated antigen and just give us a sense for what steps you guys can do to mitigate any potential risk items in the future.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure. so, you know, the with -- no matter what target there is, there's a whole set of safety procedures that we need to ensure and so the risk profile is different if it's tumor-associated antigen versus a neoantigen because the neoantigen is not found in the normal human genome, but there are also likely some pretty safe tumor associated antigens. but the primary consideration, we're -- i think we're in a better spot in a lot of ways which is that the -- there's been a lot more work done on what's normally expressed in many, many different tissues now. just sort of the public data has increased significantly, so we're able to do a lot more upfronting of safety considerations and we're feeling quite confident that our next target is -- has very, very low safety risk, relatively speaking.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
ok. and my second question, congrats on realizing the $7 million mrd milestone payment in the quarter. obviously, i was not expecting that. so mrd clearly is a promising biomarker and it can be used as a surrogate endpoint and can help with mrd enriched studies.
can you just give us a sense -- i don't know if you can give us any detail as far as what -- how specifically clonoseq was used? was it in an adjuvant or metastatic setting? and can you also speak to the pipeline or the size of additional studies that you could realize or pull forward milestones in the future.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure. julie, do you want -- do you want to take that?
julie rubinstein -- president
sure. so we -- i can just tell you that the -- what's public, that the -- and then, i guess, i would suggest maybe reading the labels just so we don't say anything we're not supposed to say, but one of them was with sanofi for sarclisa in multiple myeloma and the second one is abecma, bms' abecma for bcma car-t in multiple myeloma and there are secondary endpoints.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
great. and then just the pipeline -- yeah.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
sure. so we -- what we've disclosed is there's over $300 million in the pipeline. and obviously, there's kind of the puts and takes as we accomplish those milestones and kind of burn it down. those are kind of off to that number, but at the same time, we continue to kind of replenish that number with additional studies that we sign.
and obviously, the hope is that the kind of replenishment outstrips the amount we're burning down, at least, over time, but those milestones are available to us and use, frankly, in a variety of different settings. one of the big kind of catalyst would be if the fda-approved multiple myeloma as an endpoint in trials that would allow us to kind of be able to have access to a significant amount of those milestones over time.
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
you know, the only thing i would add to that is that those milestones cut across about half a dozen or so different partners with about a dozen or so projects across those partners.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
thanks so much.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
you're welcome.
chad cohen -- chief financial officer

your next question comes from the line of david westenberg from guggenheim securities. your line is now open.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thank you for taking the questions. i would stick with the mrd area. so has there been any new mrd interest based on all the studies that are going out in solid tumor? i realize that's a completely different market for you, but one of the interesting things that we've been finding out from all our oncology surveys is that there's a lot of oncologists is that there's a lot or hem-oncs that deal with solid tumors sometimes and vice versa. so just curious if there's been any kind of additional interest just with the amount of data that's coming out all over the space.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
yeah. i'll take that, dave. and it's just maybe it's a tip of the iceberg of this and i do think that we will kind of benefit from this concept of monitoring residual disease kind of, in general, are using kind of genomics to be able to incorporate into kind of patient care continuum. in particular, as you mentioned, this would be in the community setting, where an oncologist is treating all comers.
so once they get comfortable with the concept of monitoring in general, whether they're monitoring in solid tumors and using kind of the variety, i won't mention anyone by name. but a variety of different test available and solid tumor monitoring, that kind of picks their interest and to be able to also monitor in liquid tumors. so no and especially in the community, the hem-oncs don't want to be kind of on the cutting edge. on the flip side, they also don't want to be kind of left behind.
so i think you're just -- you're hitting the point where kind of we're just starting to see it move kind of from the kind of the true kind of bleeding edge thought leaders into hopefully kind of crossing over to mainstream and i do think we'll benefit from kind of mrd as a broad-based category. but i would say it's very early and we're just starting to see that because, as julie mentioned, we and others of our peers haven't been able to go in yet and do that education. when that happens as a collective group, i think that all boats will kind of rise on the tide. with the difference being, we're kind of the one company that is really focused on kind of the hemologic malignancies and mrd in that space, where i think there's many different technologies that are looking at mrd and solid tumor monitoring.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
yeah. actually, let's stick on that concept because i think you are very differentiated in that you have a specialized technology where you're actually looking for the b cell in b cell-mediated cancer, and i think you're in the market all by itself. now i mean, the reality is that you are dealing with hem-oncs on a very regular basis. you know, and if you indeed would maybe win that call point, do you think maybe you would add approaches outside of clonoseq just to complement the fact that you already have that sales force and maybe such a good reputation with the group? and i'll stop there after that.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
it's a good question, david, and we continue to look for ways to add value to the portfolio in the bag. so i would just say, we've got kind of a search and evaluation team out there that continues to look at opportunities to add incremental value to our offerings and i'd probably leave it at that for now.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities -- analyst

unknown speaker -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. good afternoon and thanks for taking our questions. this is elizabeth on for salveen. just a quick question from us on truab.
so you mentioned you're exploring that in other diseases. maybe if you could just expand on this and then both the near-term and the long-term strategy for the program.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
harlan, do you want to take that?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
yeah. so this is a great question and this is very much in the developmental stage, but i've really charged our research team with asking the question, hey, starting with the principle that our real advantage is that we have a really deep scale and meaning we can sequence. because of our sequencing capability, we're able to go through many, many, many different antibodies in a given sample. so the question is where does that particular advantage allow us to find antibodies that which would be differentiated from what other groups can do? and so i don't think we're at the point where i feel comfortable with giving the kind of the exact direction we're going yet, but i think the team has come up with some quite good directions and we're going to resource it.
we are resourcing it and feel like this is something that we're going to have to, i think, in general, get back to on kind of publicly, but we're feeling good about the program in general.

good afternoon, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the adaptive biotechnologies first-quarter 2021 conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, thank you, carrie mendivil. please go ahead.
carrie mendivil -- investor relations
thank you, teri, and good afternoon, everyone. i would like to welcome you to adaptive biotechnologies first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. earlier today, we issued a press release reporting adaptive financial results for the first quarter of 2021. the press release is available at www.adaptivebiotech.com.
we are conducting a live webcast of this call and will be referencing to a slide presentation that has been posted to the investors section on our corporate website. during the call, management will make projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. these statements reflect management current perspective of the business as of today. actual results may differ materially from today's forward-looking statements, depending on a number of factors, which are set forth in our public filings with the sec and listed in this presentation.
in addition, non-gaap financial measures will be discussed during the call and a reconciliation from non-gaap to gaap metrics can be found in our earnings release. joining the call today are chad robins, our ceo and co-founder; julie rubinstein, our president; and chad cohen, our chief financial officer. in addition, harlan robins, adaptive chief scientific officer and co-founder, will be available for q&a. with that, i'll turn the call over to chad robins.
chad? 
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, carrina. good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our first-quarter 2021 earnings call. at adaptive, what has remained a constant is our commitment to change how diseases are diagnosed and how drugs are discovered using our proprietary immune medicine platform. this is supported by our culture, which is stronger than ever and we can see that in the palpable energy and excitement we feel as we plan to begin the process of reentry and moving into our offices that are new in seattle, san francisco, and new york.
i want to thank all our employees for their commitment to the company, to each other, and to the patients we serve. as you can see on slide 3, our first-quarter results reflect a strong start to the year and are testament to the diversity of our platform and the capability of our team. revenue in the first quarter was $38.4 million, representing significant growth of 84% versus prior year and 27% versus prior quarter. we saw a substantial progress across our business areas.
most notably, we achieved an important milestone in our clinical diagnostics franchise with t-detect covid which received emergency use authorization in march for the confirmation of recent or prior sars-covid-2 infection. it is the first t cell-based test to be validated by the fda and marks an important strategic product milestone for adaptive. importantly, t-detect covid proved that t cells can detect disease as well or better than their well-known methodology which would derisk the future success of t-detect. in addition to the continued work ongoing to make t-detect lyme available by year end, we are excited about new data we have obtained that further supports the potential of t-detect to diagnosis patients with crohn's disease.
importantly, these data not only confirm the signal already identified last year, but also show a clear distinction from colitis, a differentiation that is often challenging with current diagnostic tools and that could provide substantial benefit to clinicians and determine the early care path for patients. we believe this is an important milestone in demonstrating the ability of t-detect to differentially diagnose patients with shared symptomatology. julie will share some of these data in her remarks and we expect to share more details in a public forum later this year in both lyme and gastrointestinal disease. related to mrd pharma which is accounted for within our research business, i want to highlight the consistent quarter-over-quarter growth generated by our partnerships which further supports the overall value of the clonoseq brand to adaptive, clinicians, and our pharma partners.
this quarter, we booked $7 million in milestones related to fda regulatory approvals in which our clonoseq assay was used as a regulatory endpoint by two of our mrd pharma partners. these milestones were contemplated as part of our full-year guidance and -- but it's great to see these materializing and accelerating. in addition, we recently added a new collaboration with pfizer, a long-standing partner, who will now use our mrd assay to measure minimal residual disease at a clinical endpoint in its clinical trials. regarding our immunoseq t-map covid efforts, we are seeing greater uptake from our pharma and academic customers who continue to be interested in understanding t cells and their role in immunities of virus and/or the immune response to vaccines.
the data we have generated for our partners is contributing to key publications. most notably, astrazeneca's new england journal of medicine publication included our data demonstrating that t cell responses may contribute to protection from covid-19, even in the presence of lower neutralizing antibodies. this is one of several key use cases for t-map covid that are emerging as the dynamics of the pandemic continues to evolve. in our drug free efforts with genentech while suspension of the first shared cellular therapy candidate was an unfortunate setback, our collaboration remains strong and we are advancing toward the completion of the next shared candidate data package.
for the private product, we completed an initial proof-of-concept from the first set of 15 cancers and we are working on many more this year. we are optimistic about the progress toward our ultimate vision with genentech to enable the development of personalized cancer cell therapy which, if successful, may transform cancer treatment. in summary, we had a strong start to the year and are confident in our ability to execute toward our 2021 goals. as you can see, we have multiple revenue sources and open-ended growth opportunities stemming from the same platform.
this is possible because we use the adaptive immune system as a source code to enable the development of diagnostics and therapeutics for almost any disease. as we continue to achieve important development proof of points that dominates the power of our platform, our ability to become a clinical product development engine accelerates. with that, i'll hand it over to julie.
julie rubinstein -- president
thanks, chad, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. i first want to highlight the strategic value of t-detect covid in the future of the t-detect franchise on slide 4. the t-detect covid is the only fda validated t cell base to confirm recent or prior sars-cov-2 infection, with 97% sensitivity at 100% specificity per our cv study. it has also demonstrated 90% sensitivity up to 10 months post infection in a real-world study in 76 convalescent patients.
since launch, we have had over 3,000 consumers order the test, including members from over 50 concierge medicine practices and approximately 75% of users have opted in for the ongoing research we continue to conduct to better understand immunity to covid-19. although the vaccine rollout will likely diminish the market to confirm prior natural infection, we intend to engage person's covid status in all future t-detect tests. this may be informative for patients with a broad range of symptoms potentially stemming from a past sars-cov-2 infection. most importantly, we believe the r&d and commercial investments made for t-detect covid will accelerate the rate at which we develop and launch future t-detect applications.
these include, among others, educating the fda about the power of t cells and our underlying technology, improving our models and techniques, and building a commercial infrastructure to market the test and service customers, all of which we will accomplish in a very short period of time. now let's talk on slide 5 about our vision for the evolution of the t-detect franchise. as we have always said, our key strategic focus for t-detect is to become one blood test with many results. in order to achieve this vision and help the millions of patients experiencing some sort of diagnostic odyssey, we need to move from disease-specific diagnosis to differential diagnosis among patients with shared symptoms and ultimately to population immune.
while we are advancing toward a differential gi diagnosis in r&d, we are advancing on key next steps for t-detect in lyme disease. specifically, our goals are to complete the enrollment of the immunesense lyme study, publish these data and other clinical validation data from our johns hopkins collaboration, and offer t-detect lyme as an ldt in our clia certified lab by year end. we believe that t-detect lyme can potentially double the efficacy of the current serology-based standard of care testing for acute lyme disease which could benefit the 600,000 people diagnosed with lyme disease each year. preliminary data also show that t-detect lyme may help identify patients with post-treatment lyme disease syndrome or ptlds, estimated to be approximately 200,000 patients per year.
these individuals continue to have lasting symptoms even after being treated with a standard course of antibiotics. turning to slide 6. here you can see some exciting preliminary data that supports expediting our path toward our first differential diagnostic in gi conditions which we believe will create a greater value proposition for patients and adaptive. first, we completed an additional cohort of patients with ilial crohn's, a type of crohn's disease in the small intestine which corroborates our early crohn signal.
from several hundred patients, our classifier is already over 70% sensitive at 99% specificity for this type of crohn's disease. importantly, these data also demonstrate that the t cells that recognize ilial crohn's are distinct from the t cells that recognize colitis, celiac, covid, among other diseases. as you can see on the graph on the right, our distinct covid pcr classifier got more sensitive as the sample size increase. to that end, our next steps for our gi differential diagnostic is to evaluate and improve our signal based on the analysis of additional samples from over 5,000 crohn's and colitis patients which are in-house and will be completed and presented later this year.
importantly, as a reminder, our assay can run on genomic dna stored from retrospective sample tests with clinical metadata which may serve as clinical validation studies for regulatory purposes. among the thousands of well-characterized samples we are working through in the lab, we will also be able to understand how our signal performs in patients with other types of crohn's disease that occur in other regions of the digestive track and aim to identify a signal for colitis as well. in parallel, we are also engaging more deeply with gi specialists to understand product market fit and with payers to arrive at a pricing strategy that contemplates a blood test that can reduce the diagnostic odyssey in an increasingly cost-effective way. there are as many as 22 million patients with gi symptoms who may see a primary care physician each year.
a few million of these patients are escalated to a gi specialist if inflammatory bowel disease is suspected which is the population we are initially focused on. these patients usually take around a year to receive a definitive diagnosis which requires a biopsy and the whole diagnostic process can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000. it is important to note that the current stool tests that are often used have challenging compliance rates and low specificity, leading to more biopsies than necessary. therefore, our hope is to develop a differential diagnostic that can offer patients with similar gi symptoms clarity early on in the testing journey from a blood draw.
switching gears to clonoseq on slide 7. the total value of the clonoseq brand to adaptive continues to increase as the combination of clinical testing with mrd sequencing revenue and regulatory milestones from our pharmaceutical partners, materials, and scales over time. on the left side, you can see clonoseq testing volumes of 4,757 tests in the quarter grew 35% versus prior year and 6% versus the prior quarter. although the business is still recovering from the impact of covid at the end of 2020 and had a slow start to the year, march was the highest volume month-to-date.
during the quarter, orders were placed by 825 unique hcps spanning 231 accounts for approximately 2,900 patients tested. clonoseq is now used in all 31 nccn cancer centers for one or more disease state and has been used to treat more than 16,700 unique patients. importantly, with eight months having passed since our fda clearance in cll, 17 of the 31 nccn centers are now using clonoseq for their cll patients. in addition, we continue to drive expansion of payer coverage policies for cll in q1, reaching about 125 million covered lives.
as we wait for the fda's review of our 510(k) filing for all in blood, we are already seeing that blood-based testing accounts for 25% of clonoseq usage in all patients available to them as part of adaptive clia validated ldt service. studies of clonoseq and blood for other indications, such as multiple myeloma and nhl continue and we will keep you informed on future readouts throughout the year. of note, we are actively engaged with one of our pharma partners this year to validate clonoseq and blood for dlbl, one of the largest nhl subtypes. we continue to expect clonoseq volumes to double in 2021 with growth more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year.
however, the resolution of the covid overhang in the first half is an important factor to achieve our expectations and one that we are monitoring closely. on the right side of the slide, you can see the growing number of publicly disclosed pharma partnerships where clonoseq is used as the test of choice in clinical trials that incorporate mrd as a clinical endpoint. from these partnerships, we obtained sequencing revenue as part of our research business, as well as, regulatory milestones which we record as development revenue. as chad mentioned, we recognized $7 million in mrd milestones from two pharma partners and signed a new translational mrd collaboration with pfizer, bringing our future available milestones to over $300 million.
turning to life sciences research on slide 8. our research business experienced significant recovery in the quarter, mostly driven by sequencing from pharma partners using both our immunoseq and mrd assays. additionally, new pharma bookings continue to grow at a significant pace. academic research, although a small contributor to the overall business, experienced some lingering impact from the pandemic in the first month of the quarter as academic centers were still not fully operational for non-covid research -- related research projects.
however, recent order volumes are showing encouraging recovery at higher than pre-pandemic levels. related to immunoseq ruo kit, the team has been focused on getting more labs and our cro partners, q2 and labcorp, trained and operationally set up to start using the kit. we expect to bring on additional core labs and cros throughout the year. regarding immunoseq t-map covid, we are working with several top-tier vaccine manufacturers, including astrazeneca, oxford, bill and melinda gates foundation, and johnson & johnson to assess the t cell response to various covid vaccines in their study.
our recent data on astrazeneca samples which showed the vaccine caused expansion of cd4 and cd8 t cells to regions of the spike protein, including those not impacted by variant was published in the new england journal of medicine last month. we expect more data to be published soon, demonstrating the utility of t cells to study vaccine efficacy in the wake of variant. with the new variants on the rise, we are seeing an uptake by pharma and academic partners who are using immunoseq t-map covid to determine efficacy of vaccines to the new variant, select new targets, and evaluate next-generation vaccines, generate data to support the clinical understanding of response to vaccination in immunocompromised patients and understand the strength and duration of t cell versus antibody response post vaccination. we will provide updates on our findings as we progress.
moving now to drug discovery on slide 9. starting with our collaboration with genentech on the shared program, as disclosed earlier in the quarter genentech suspended efforts on the first shared product. as previously mentioned, it is important to note the reason for this decision was specific to the target and not the pcr candidate. recent data within the public domain showed that the expression levels of the selected target was high in a healthy cell type that wasn't previously assessed within the preliminary safety analysis.
out of an abundance of caution, genentech decided to sit this program and focus on the next set of tcr candidates in our true tcr library against different selected targets. our next tcr candidate is in advanced stages and we expect to complete and deliver this tcr data package to genentech this year. parallel, we continue to advance other candidates against a variety of targets within our tcr library that have been prioritized with genentech. while we use blood from healthy donors for our true tcr approach with the shared product, we use blood from cancer patients for our private product process.
on the right side, you can see we are also making good progress on our private products. as chad mentioned, we completed an initial proof-of-concept in which we identified tumor-specific tcrs new blood from 15 cancer patients and we're currently reviewing these data with the genentech team. initial results are encouraging and during the remainder of the year, we aim to process the blood of at least 60 cancer patients as we build our prototypes. the totality of our patient-specific data will allow us to establish our personalized approach with genentech and ultimately define our future private product.
in april, we also officially opened our new south san francisco lab space, adding more than 10,000 square feet of dedicated space future, end-to-end personalized product process. importantly, this new space has the capacity to accommodate future first-in-human studies. we also continue to build out the product and product development teams and have started hiring dedicated ftes for this purpose. our collaboration with genentech remains strong and continues full speed ahead, both with our shared and private product program.
regarding our true av antibody discovery approach, as disclosed last quarter, we have been able to identify highly potent rbd antibodies that are robust against all known variants and predicted future variants of sars-cov-2. in addition, we have promising non-rbd s1 and s2 neutralizing antibodies that could also be incorporated into a cocktail strategy that targets different mechanisms of action to inhibit the virus. it is recognized that covid-19 is now endemic in the population and effective therapies are still needed. as such, we continue our discussions with potential partners who similarly believe that our antibody candidates may provide a differentiated solution in light of new variants.
in conjunction, we are exploring additional applications of our true av discover in other diseases to maximize this valuable platform extension. i'll now pass it over to chad cohen, who will provide you with updates.
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
thanks, julie. turning to our financial results on slide 10. total revenue in the first quarter was $38.4 million, representing an 84% increase from $20.9 million in the same period last year. our revenue mix for the first quarter consisted of 39% of our revenues coming from our sequencing category and 61% coming from our development category.
sequencing revenue in the first quarter was $15.2 million and increased 60% from the same period in 2020. the growth was primarily driven by a $5.2 million increase in revenue generated from our biopharmaceutical customers. research sequencing volume increased to 7,026 sequences, up 17% from 6,030 sequences delivered in the first quarter of 2020. we are pleased with the strong start to the year.
but as a reminder, we do see variability quarter over quarter and historical trends show most of our pharma revenues come in the second half of the year. clinical sequencing volume, excluding our t-detect covid volume, increased 35% to 4,757 clinical tests delivered in the first quarter of 2021, up from 3,518 clinical tests delivered during the same period in '20. although we continue to make progress, the covid headwinds from 2020 haven't completely abated and we do expect some ongoing pressure on clinical volumes at least through the first half of the year. development revenue grew to $23.3 million in the first quarter, up 103% from the same period last year.
as you will know, the primary component of our development revenue today relates to the amortization of our genentech upfront. however, the largest driver of our development revenue growth this quarter was due to the recognition of $7 million in milestones from two key mrd pharma partners which came earlier than expected in the year. as julie mentioned, we have over $300 million in mrd pharma milestones available to adaptive as our biopharma partners utilize our mrd assay in the development and regulatory approval of their relevant drug programs. shifting now from our revenue to our operating costs.
total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2021 were $79.7 million, representing a 44% increase from $55.5 million in the same quarter last year. working down our operating expenses, cost of revenue was $10 million during the first-quarter '21, compared to $5.3 million for the first quarter last year, representing an approximate 87% increase. higher cost of revenue was primarily driven by increases in personnel and related labor and overhead costs, as well as, an increase in allocated facility expenses due to our new molecular lab and headquarters which is currently under construction and quickly approaching completion. an increase in revenue sample volume, mix shift to our clonoseq assays also led to a higher materials costs which were partially offset by usage of our production lab to process a greater percentage of r&d samples.
research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2021 were $33.8 million, compared to $23.9 million in the first quarter of 2020, representing a 41% increase. the growth was largely related to an increase in personnel costs, with our software engineering, innovation, and south san francisco cellular lab teams driving the period-over-period increase. sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2021 were $20.6 million, compared to $14 million in the same quarter last year, representing an increase of 47%. increased personnel costs contributed to the majority of this growth, particularly, the expansion of our commercial team supporting clonoseq and t-detect.
we also saw larger investments in our t-detect marketing efforts and shared corporate parking services. these increases were partially offset by savings in travel and customer event-related expenses. general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2021 were $14.9 million, compared to $11.8 million in the first quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 26%. the increase was primarily driven by growth in headcount and related personnel costs.
net loss for the first quarter of 2021 was $40.6 million, compared to first-quarter 2020 net loss of $31.4 million. adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2021 was a loss of $30.1 million, compared to a loss of $28 million in the same period of the prior year. we ended the quarter with $745 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and we had no debt. with respect to our full-year guidance, we are reiterating our revenue range of $145 million to $155 million which already contemplated the delivery of the mrd milestone we recognized this quarter and exclude the ind milestone that we no longer expect to recognize as a result of the suspension of the first shared product.
we are really pleased with our first-quarter results, and although it is early in the year, we are confident in our ability to achieve our full-year commercial and development goals. we look forward to providing you with further updates next quarter. i'll turn the call back to chad robins.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, chad. as we outlined during the call and listed on slide 11, we've achieved some important milestones already in 2021 and have many more upcoming across all business areas during the rest of the year. we feel good about the momentum across all areas as we continue to deliver on our promise and demonstrate the capabilities of our platform. with that, i'd like to turn it back to the operator and open up for questions.
",2021-Q1,ADPT
0.9998,0.9996,,,", today, we announced an important addition to adaptive's management team.
i want to welcome nitin sood as our new chief commercial officer, who will oversee our in-line product portfolio. nitin will lead us through a critical next phase of commercial expansion, including multiple anticipated product launches and international growth. with that, i'd like to turn the call back to the operator and open it up for questions.
 :
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question is from derik de bruin of bank of america. please go ahead.
derik de bruin -- ban
hi. good afternoon. hey. thank you for the updates.
can you elaborate a little bit more on the vaccibody agreement? and just what you're doing there specifically in just sort of what the terms that are and also the moderna relationship. just some incremental information on that would be helpful.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
sure. thanks, derik. so, this is harlan. so, to start with, the reason we partnered with vaccibody is that they have a unique capability to truly target a t cell response, whereas the primary mode for how basically all vaccines that have ever been put on market work have been targeted toward generating an antibody response.
and as we're learning the virus as -- sars-cov-2 is quickly escaping antibody -- neutralizing antibody response and the t cell response is becoming of greater and greater importance. and so in order to generate a very broad overall protection, we think that a t cell response is vital. and since they have this unique capability, and to target t cell response, and we are able to determine kind of best-in-class what to target, we thought it was kind of a perfect marriage. and beyond that, love the management team there and the scientific team, and we've really well vetted them.
we've actually given them some sets of targets already, and they've already generated some vaccine response in animal models that has been nice and robust. they've been vetted by the genentech as well. and then in terms of the deal, it's a royalty-based deal where we're sort of in it together and think there's huge long-term potential here. ok.
sorry, what was the next question?
derik de bruin -- ban
the moderna relationship.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
yes. the moderna relationship. yes. we've had a long-standing relationship with moderna.
obviously, the world has just seen how great a company they are. and we're really excited to -- really work with them to help understand the t cell response to their vaccine just in relation to what i just said a minute ago. they're taking advantage of our t-map product, which is our research-based product that gives considerable more information than our just straight diagnostic products on exactly what their -- what the specifics of their vaccine are inducing in terms of what part of the virus they're getting a t cell response to, how broad that response is, etc. and really, allowing them to understand.
and i think it wasn't even well understood. their vaccine is proving to be efficacious even in cases with reduced -- neutralizing antibodies, and we think and -- that it's the t cells that are helping out that they're inducing from their vaccine.
derik de bruin -- ban
great. and then just one more. the comment that you're not going to be able to double clonoseq volumes this year. i'm just curious, are you already seeing drop offs in demand now? or is this something that you're just anticipating happening because of the variants? i'm just curious in terms of what you're seeing in the markets right now and how that factors into year that is.
is there still the potential to hit that number? or are you just being cautious and -- right now?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. derik, it's chad. i'll put this in context. i mean, we had a good quarter.
we continue to expect strong growth in the second half, which is kind of back half weighted. we are continuing to grow here, and we haven't seen much of a drop off at all. actually, it's just in light of the delta variant and what we're seeing right now with limited access by kind of the field team. there are certain kind of uncertainties and uncertainties especially with kind of the impact on our patient population, which julie had mentioned kind of in her prepared remarks.
so therefore, we really want to take a measured approach, and we're looking at taking a modest reduction. if helpful, just kind of what julie closed with, i will reiterate that i want to kind of put in context that this is just one component of the overall kind of value of clonoseq and the mrd kind of brand, which is growing across clinical, pharma, research and international. so yes, it's -- we want to take a kind of a measured approach here as we look at it.
derik de bruin -- ban
got it. thanks.
operator
and our next question is from brian weinstein of william blair. go ahead sir.
brian weinstein -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey guys. good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions. maybe one just on the guidance here.
so, it was a good quarter, obviously. and you beat, i think, where most people were by like $7 million or something like that. and you raised the bottom end of the guide by just $1.5 million. so, can you just maybe talk through kind of the thought process there? was there anything that was pulled forward in this quarter that was expected later in the year? is the not raising by the full amount of the upside having to do with this clonoseq more conservative stance? just any color that you can give on kind of how you thought about the guidance.
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
yes. maybe i'll start with that one. brian, it's chad cohen. yes, i mean we made a lot of progress in the second quarter, as you can see by our results.
we had strong sort of sequencing numbers. we grew those 132% year over year really delayed by our clonoseq numbers, strong t-detect covid even contributed to some of that our research business sort of across the platform. we had a really strong quarter and continue to expect really nice growth in our sequencing sort of category through the end of the year. we're just south of 50% of our revenue is going to sequencing in the first half of the year and expect about close to about 60% in the second half, getting to that sort of 50% to 55% range for the full year.
so strong growth. i think just given the emergence of the variants, we at this time are just passing along really the $1.5 million milestone that dropped in the quarter that was outside of -- out of the guide. we have really strong conviction in the numbers that we're presenting as our full year guide, bringing up the bottom end of the range. but yes, as chad said, we're being sort of measured or metered in response to what we're seeing with the variants.
brian weinstein -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it. makes a lot of sense. next question on the new signal that you guys are talking about in ms. so, it seems just in general that these signals are starting to come a bit more -- are coming a bit more regularly at this point.
can you talk about the expected pace of being able to find these new signals? and then as you're finding those, do you have the proper resources right now to be taking multiple signals to the next phase here? and then i know i'm throwing a lot at you on this topic. but you've also talked a lot about infectious disease and now autoimmune. is there any update on any of the progress on the oncology side? i know that was an area that you guys were clearly looking at before. i haven't heard much on kind of any signals on that side.
sorry for all the questions, but thanks for the answers.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes, brian, maybe i'll provide some framing, then pass it to harlan to take the first part of that, which is kind of the expediting signal generation and how we think about it across categories of infectious disease. obviously, now we've got progress in -- accelerating progress in autoimmune and then kind of where we are in the cancer space. but as i think what you're pointing out is signal generation is one component of it, and then kind of at the back end is having a product on market. in between that, you have a significant amount of steps in terms of kind of clinical trial and analytical validation, health economic analysis, market access, work with the payers, kind of regulatory, all that goes into defining kind of product market fit and where the kind of clinical utility is for doctor treating patients.
all of those areas -- and this is such a kind of a massive opportunity, and we're investing and hiring a phenomenal team and putting resources into kind of really defining the buckets to go from signal generation to kind of ultimately products on market and then also thinking about how we leverage kind of what are kind of shared resources versus kind of where we need to hire kind of specific discrete kind of medical expertise in disease areas, and we put a lot of thought behind that. but maybe i'll turn it over to harlan in respect to kind of how we're thinking about and expediting signal generation.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
sure. thanks, chad. so, in terms of the research side and the development side, we're working hard to get an economy of scale by sort of standardizing our methodology. and so, for example, we're able to -- now each different disease class requires algorithmic development and chemistry.
the chemistry is united among all of our different assays right now. we literally have one delivery mechanism, which is just the same for t-detect covid that will be t-detect everything. so same sample type, same chemistry, etc. the only thing that potentially can change is the algorithms.
and we're uniting at least within disease class those algorithms, which is why we've been able to really expedite on the infectious disease side. we have a few that are covid on market. lyme coming soon. we just published a paper on that.
and there's multiple other infectious diseases that we have really nice probably clinical-grade signals in already. separately, in the autoimmune space, we're making progress across multiple different autoimmune spaces. we talked about ibd. we talked about ms.
we have some others that we're working on and in the same concept, right? we're uniting and trying to get cross learnings from one where we can then get much faster at the others. so, what does this require? this requires us to get a certain amount of samples with patients with those diseases. and we've been collecting those for quite a while now, and we have either sample sequenced already, as we told you already in multiple -- in ms as well as in ibd, but we have others coming in other autoimmune diseases and other infectious disease as we go. so, all of those are progressing really nicely, and we're very pleased with the direction they're going.
you asked about oncology. oncology has a much broader set of questions, and we are working in the research setting. here, the class of drugs is enormous and a number of companies working on them is huge. and so, we're working to help all those companies really understand how to use those drugs, etc., in terms -- and -- but that does feed on and stems from our connecting t cells to antigens at scale.
and the issue here is simply that the immune response to cancer is so broad because the potential antigenic space, the things that your immune system can see, is huge. so, it's just a harder problem. we are making progress, but it's going to be on a longer time frame just because of the scale of the project. so, we're moving, it's coming, but it's going to be a little while on that side.
we're going to have a more near-term successes that you'll see hit in infectious disease and autoimmune space.
brian weinstein -- william blair & company -- analyst
that was awesome. great. thank you, guys, so much. i appreciate it.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
thanks.
operator
and our next question is coming from doug schenkel of cowen. you may ask your question.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. my first one is, i guess, a guidance question. one of the key assumptions embedded in full-year guidance is that the commercial expansion that you're in the midst of takes hold and supports a material ramp in second half diagnostic revenue. i just want to see how you're thinking about that now.
obviously, some nice growth sequentially in that category, maybe that's evidence enough that things are going well. but i'd love for you to expand a little bit more on what you're seeing and how comfortable you are with this high-level assumption that things will continue to ramp in this category as a result of the commercial build out over the balance of the year, especially keeping in mind, there might be some risk as it, i guess, related to the delta variant in terms of physician office access.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
julie, do you want to take that?
julie rubinstein -- president
sure. thanks. yes, i think the way you just framed the question is exactly right. we're absolutely experiencing, as we mentioned in the remarks, double-digit growth in each of the indications for which we have an fda label in clonoseq.
and we continue to see really nice growth in the back half of the year, borrowing some of the comments chad made related to the delta variant. but specifically, you're absolutely right. we've invested quite a lot commercially both in the sales force as well as on our medical team. and so we have a lot more focus on peer-to-peer education.
we're seeing the results of patient education, and we're really focused also on making sure that we id all newly diagnosed patients as regularly as possible in our new accounts. we're growing the reach of our targeted account population quite a lot. i've talked a lot in the past about tier 1 and tier 2, about 250 accounts that were our target universe. we've really expanded that to over 900 accounts now that we're in the community with cll, and we're seeing nice progress in penetration in the -- that broader universe of targeted accounts.
so that's just some of the types of initiatives we have underway that we're doing together with our commercial and our expanded medical team to grow usage of clonoseq in the clinic.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
excellent. and a quick follow up on that one specifically. i won't hold you to generating the same type of sequential growth you just did in that category moving forward because that was pretty impressive in the quarter. but fair to assume that you're expecting continued sequential growth over the balance of the year from diagnostics for all the reasons we just talked about?
julie rubinstein -- president
yes. yes.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
absolutely.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and then just a product question on t-detect crohn's ibd. and maybe i had it wrong, maybe i didn't. but before i was thinking of this as a single disease test, now it looks like it's designed to distinguish across multiple gi disorders, including uc and crohn's.
is this now should -- again, maybe i just had it wrong. but if i didn't, should we be thinking about this as essentially a panel test for that category?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
yes. thanks, doug. so, the goal is definitely to create a panel test that include uc and crohn's. obviously, it will be dependent on the full signal and timing and everything else.
but that is the goal we're presently analyzing sets of samples in both crohn's and uc, as well as a few other related indications. and the goal is both in the near term to create a differentiated diagnosis and then to continue to add more to the panel as we create additional signals.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. i should actually mention but i'll broaden that too. i mean that's our goal for each one of these tests is to have a differential diagnosis. but it starts with kind of getting a beachhead in one disease state and then getting a high-sensitivity level, fixing a very high-specificity level and then kind of moving across to other kind of diseases that have shared symptomatology, so that the very first thing we can do is kind of rule out other diseases.
but then the goal over time is to be able to definitively have not only ability to rule out but have sensitivity in each one of the diseases so that we can definitively diagnose each one of the diseases with shared set of symptoms.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. yes. actually, as you're describing that and i think about your typical playbook, that makes a ton of sense. all right.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. sure, doug. thanks.
operator
and our next question is from tejas savant of morgan stanley. please ask your question.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. this is yuko on the call for tejas. in light of the emergence of the delta variant questions about durability of vaccine response, could you comment on what you're seeing in terms of t-detect covid uptick? and what could an upside case look like?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
yes, that's a great question and obviously, super important. we are seeing that the t cell response to the vaccines is long lasting. now we've seen samples over a year. and certainly, at 11 months, we had good statistics to say that we at least by t-detect standards, we could detect as positive over 90% at 11 months.
however, the -- at six months, the -- quantitatively, the number of t cells specific to the -- specific induced vaccine is waning at six months. so, there's some loss there. so we're working with certainly a variety of investigators and a set of vaccine makers to hopefully incorporate this as we move. i'll pass it to chad to talk about the upside case.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. i mean, the upside case -- and again, i just want to make sure we're framing in the right context because you brought the term upside case. so, i'll talk specifically about the three areas which could have potential upside. one is in the research business.
if the government decides to kind of fund a large-scale study to truly understand the cellular immune response or the t cell response to the virus, there's potential upside for us in that. well, actually, in the same vein, let's say, within research, and we're working on this, if the fda kind of mandates that the vaccine manufacturers include a measure of t cell response in their clinical trials, that would be upside. right now, they're opting in to do it as evidenced by kind of the most recent kind of signing with moderna. so those are the two upsides of the research.
from a t-detect standpoint, it would be if we could figure out how to get reimbursed for a t-detect covid test, that would be an upside. and the third is in the drug discovery category. if our partner vaccibody shows that their vaccine, which is a dna-based vaccine that doesn't have kind of the cold chain storage requirements proves to be effective on a stand-alone or as a universal booster, that would be a tremendous upside case. but again, just to characterize those all, it's upside and not in any way in our guidance assumptions for the year.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and then a quick follow up. would you provide any thoughts on timing of potential milestones over the next 18 months from genentech and any other collaborations?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. i think it's as we said, we're going to be delivering our data package to them in the fourth quarter of this year, but we've not yet kind of specified kind of timelines as to when we are going to be expecting milestones to hit. but we should hopefully be able to. as soon as we know, we will be able to provide an update to you guys.
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
yes. any additional milestones in the year will be upside to the guide we're giving.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question is from tycho peterson of j.p. morgan. please ask your question.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
guys good afternoon. wondering if you can comment a little more on the moderna deal. how you're thinking about that opportunity? is that something where you get back-end economics? if you could just touch on both the covid piece and obviously, the zika vaccine you mentioned as well in the press release.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. tycho, with respect to moderna, this is one that falls into kind of our research bucket of revenues and t-map covid, where we're helping moderna assess the cellular immune response or the t cell response to the vaccine, kind of what it's inducing outside of the antibody response. so there's no kind of back-end economics associated with that deal like there is with our drug -- with our vaccibody deal where we're kind of part of the design and development.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then on t-detect, obviously, you mentioned the multiple sclerosis signal. can you maybe just touch a little bit about how you're thinking about that opportunity and time lines?
julie rubinstein -- president
sure. tycho, so this is early days for us, obviously, and so it's an early signal. there's more work to be done, but we are beginning to explore that market. we understand the incidence isn't huge.
it's about 12,000 to 15,000 patients diagnosed annually in the united states. however, as you probably know, the process of getting there involves a lot. there's a whole variety of clinical scores that need to be met. there's mris that need to occur and lumbar punctures and some other relatively invasive and expensive tests that create a diagnostic odyssey that can be challenging.
so there's never been, as far as we know, a blood test to really be specific for ms. and that's what we're really most excited about is to be able to do that upon the earliest signs of symptomatology of ms, and that's really where we think there is a room for huge improvement with our potential t-detect ms application.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and maybe one last one. julie, on the pharma side. you had another mrd partnership. how you're thinking about kind of the pipeline for the back half of the year for similar partnerships on the pharma side?
julie rubinstein -- president
yes. i mean it continues at a pretty regular cadence all the time. our pharma business, both actually, i should say, on the mrd side and the non-mrd side. so we're seeing a really nice come back to life of the t cell pharma work that we do.
and we're also broadening beyond oncology quite a lot as a lot of the data and the places we're going and the kols we're beginning to interact with are beyond oncology. so the totality of the pharma business right now for mrd testing as well as non-mrd testing is looking really bright for the back half of the year.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
and tycho, one thing that chad cohen mentioned in his prepared remarks that i just want to kind of call out again is kind of the replenishing of the milestones that are associated with these deals. even though we did draw down kind of some of the milestones this year, we're actually going to more than replenish those milestones. i think maybe next quarter, we'll put -- provide an update on what those numbers look like, but we more than replenish what we've been able to take out over this year through new deal signings and what i would call a very robust pipeline in the mrd pharma category.
operator
and our next question is from mark massaro of btig. please go ahead sir.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for the question. i guess i believe it was last quarter, you talked about having over $300 million of potential future milestones in mrd. can you just talk about how the agreement with janssen may have expanded that size? and i think it would be interesting to hear you pulled down $1.5 million this quarter, $7 million last quarter.
it feels like we're going to see a relatively steady cadence of these over the coming quarters. i think julie just kind of alluded to that, but if there's any way you could provide any more clarity around that, that would be helpful.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
i'm going to start, and then i'll pass over to chad cohen to talk more about the numbers. but again, i want to highlight one -- another calls out from the prepared remarks, which is really call to action the multiple myeloma paper that was published in the ccr, it's clinical cancer research, is that really called for the use of mrd as a regulatory endpoint. that -- when that happens, that would be a catalyst that would make a significant portion of those milestones on the balance sheet available to us. so that's kind of a catalyst-driven event that we've been -- well, the field has been working on for some time.
and i think we're making a significant amount of progress. with specifics regarding kind of the quantum of new dollars, chad, do you want to comment?
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean i can just comment that we continue to grow almost quarter over quarter, the number of milestones that we can participate in. so, we're at a number that was greater than last quarter. we'll be thinking about how best to sort of provide you quantitatively with that going forward and at what sort of time points and milestones that we reach.
i'll just say that we're happy with the number of deals that we've been able to do. it validates our thoughts about the size of the market and how we can be instructive to our biopharma partners around using milestone and the clinical endpoints. the majority of our milestones relate to primary endpoints with the second category with secondary endpoints. and they cut across about a dozen different partners with multiple studies, sometimes within each of those partners within the u.s.
and ema. so, they're quite varied, and i think they represent some really nice optionality for us that we are improving really delivers on our p&l from time to time, as you've seen for the past few years.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
ok. and then congrats on the vaccibody deal. i guess a quick three-part question. the first, i think i heard you say that this would be used as a universal booster.
would that be, obviously, a booster for both moderna and pfizer? or can you comment on that? and then secondly, i would imagine this is likely a non-exclusive deal. can you confirm that? and then on the royalty side, should we think of this as like a low-single digit? or could it be more lucrative than that?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. so, i'm going to try to make sure i got those all in, mark. but -- the first question is -- the answer is yes. we do see this as a potential universal booster.
and the second point there is it also could be because of the lack of cold chain storage requirements to be able to disseminate to kind of around the world. there's some potential there, is number one. we're not able to kind of specify the financial arrangements in terms of kind of royalties, but i think you're thinking about it in the right way. and two, from a t cell design and development perspective, there's kind of a limited set of exclusivities around what we're specifically doing with them.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and here's our last question from salveen richter of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
elizabeth webster -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. this is elizabeth on for salveen. i was just wondering if you had any thoughts about how the t cell-based sars-cov-2 vaccine differs from gritstone bio's approach where they're also trying to sort of develop a t cell-based vaccine. and then i have a follow-up question around the ms program.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
sure. this is harlan. i don't want to speak too much about gritstone's approach because i'm not fully familiar with them. i know that one of the big difference is the reason that the vaccibody wanted to partner with us is that our ability to basically use our chemistry and technology to establish immune response, not through an algorithmic approach but through a direct assessment of the immune response.
so, i think we're starting there. but also the one thing that's unique about vaccibody is their ability to target the immune response directly to the antigen presenting cells of choice. so as far as we know, this is -- as far as i'm aware, this is a unique ability. and so, it's not to say that other vaccine players aren't attempting to induce a t cell response.
obviously, from the primary -- as i'm sure you're well aware, the primary focus of vaccine development throughout history and with all the ones on the market right now were designed to generate antibody response, not a t cell response. but they, of course, would -- everybody wants. it's not like you're avoiding a t cell response. so anyway, the point being that this unique ability to target antigen presenting cells and adaptive's proprietary ability to pick out truly the best immunogenic targets is what kind of sets this collaboration apart, i think.
but i can't comment directly on the ins and outs of gritstone's approach.
elizabeth webster -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, that's really helpful. and then regarding t-detect in ms, just wanted to know if there's anything sort of different about how you're thinking about the development of the program here or maybe a different clinical consideration versus some of the other indications, given there's an association of the viral origin, epstein-barr virus for ms versus other autoimmune diseases where there's not such a close sort of viral tie?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
salveen, so there's actually pathogenic ties and/or confusion in a variety of these different autoimmune conditions. but certainly, i think some of the best studies, as you're saying, is in ms, where there's some direct connections, including some papers that we've been part of publications on. we're trying to fill out our diagnostic approach in viruses that are focused around -- let's say, around the space of the autoimmune diseases of interest. so for example, in ibd, we're looking at pathogens that are implicated and/or confused with the disease in the gut.
when we get to rheumatoid arthritis, we've actually got ahead of ourselves on the vaccines -- on the viral side, where we're looking at a set of viruses that can get confused with rheumatoid arthritis conditions and same with ms. so, we're trying to package these together where we can either look at causation and/or look at differential diagnosis where the disease itself can be confounded symptomatically. so absolutely, we're exploring these in various capacities, and that's really driven in a lot of ways, our developmental efforts on the viral and the rest of the pathogenic side.
elizabeth webster -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
and we have our last question from david westenberg of guggenheim. please go head.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking the question.so i first want to talk about kind of way you were to think about pricing in t-detect and what is a fair asp? i think historically, i know t-detect or immunoseq, as you used to call it, has not really a major cost advantage versus competitors. but what do you think is actually a fair price as we bundle kind of certain diagnostics? i mean, what's kind of a bar? and i realize you probably can't give a specific price, but as we think about this test in the future and your ability to panel it or go after single indications, i just kind of want to think about how you might think about fair pricing. and i have one follow up after that.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. hey david, so as we move from kind of single diseases to differentiated diagnosis to what the -- i would say, kind of the holy grail for us is kind of being part of an immunoscreen or checkup, how we think about price points along each one of those kinds of care of continuums, wind up kind of being different. meaning, if you're going to have kind of a regular checkup cost at the end of the day, as part of an immune screen, that has to be at a lower price point. but as you look at kind of disease diagnostics, a lot of it has to do with kind of the market access landscape, the unmet medical need, the noninvasive nature of your test, etc.
and that usually -- why i brought up kind of market access in the payer landscape is payers essentially are willing to pay at least at this time kind of different price points for different levels of -- different types of tests. for example, it's kind of well-known that they're going to pay more for a cancer-based test or an autoimmune-related test right now than an infectious disease-related test. so, we continue to kind of work with the payer community and aren't yet -- we've talked preliminary in some of the disease categories that we're looking at or some of the disease indications, i should say, that we're looking at about kind of test points. but we really kind of ultimately want to be able to kind of hit that sweet spot at the end of the day of how much we can charge for it, and that will be kind of reimbursed broadly by the payer community.
chad, do you want to?
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
no. i agree with chad's comments. i would say that additionally, from a margin perspective, the incremental cost of layering in additional signals within each test is going to be small. and so from that perspective, as we sort of move up the value chain from a market perspective, the gross margins -- the potential gross margins of the business for t-detect just continue to grow in sort of concert of that.
so i think we're really excited about it and that t-detect covid was a beachhead and a stepping stone to a much bigger concept.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then one, switching gears to clonoseq. just quick thinking in terms of other potential indications.
i don't think t cell diseases are as big markets. but is there any other off-label -- is there any off-label usage? or is that any consequential part of overall in clonoseq? and i'll stop there.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. well, there are. and i wouldn't say off label because they are brought up under our clia lab, under kind of the regulated clia environment. there's two of them.
i can say one is in cutaneous t-cell lymphoma or ctcl. and the second is, although most alls are b-cell derived, there's about kind of 8% to 10% that are t cell derived acute lymphoblastic lymphoma. and so both of those populations, we do service right now through our clia environment.
operator

good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to the adaptive biotechnologies second quarter financial results conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, ms.
karina calzadilla. please go ahead.
karina calzadilla -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, delfin, and good afternoon, everyone. i would like to welcome you to adaptive biotechnologies second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. earlier today, we issued a press release reporting adaptive financial results for the second quarter. the press release is available at www.adaptivebiotech.com.
we are conducting a live webcast of this call and will be referencing to a slide presentation that has been posted to the investors section in our corporate website. during the call, management will make projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. these statements reflect management's current perspective of the business as of today. actual results may differ materially from today's forward-looking statements, depending on a number of factors, which are set forth in our public filings with the sec and listed in this presentation.
in addition, non-gaap financial measures will be discussed during this call, and a reconciliation from non-gaap to gaap metrics can be found in our earnings release. joining the call today are chad robins, our ceo and co-founder; julie rubinstein, our president; and chad cohen, our chief financial officer. in addition, harlan robins, adaptive's chief scientific officer and co-founder, will be available for q&a. with that, i'll turn the call over to chad robins.
chad? 
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, karina. good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our second-quarter 2021 earnings call. we had another strong quarter and momentum continues to build across our business areas. results reflect our commitment to applying our immune medicine platform to transform disease diagnosis and drug discovery.
adaptive's incredible employees are dedicated to the company and the patients we serve. it's been awesome seeing desks fill up and meeting new hires for the first time in person but we also realize that pandemic is an evolving situation. we'll continue to monitor our return to office initiatives. we are energized by our progress and the data emerging from our platform.
moving to the slides. starting on slide 3. our second-quarter results demonstrate solid performance. revenue in the quarter was $38.5 million, representing a significant growth of 83% versus prior year.
we saw substantial progress across our product and our pipeline. our covid efforts continue to gain traction, especially in light of the delta variant as more stakeholders act on the relevance of including t cells to understand the immune response to the virus and vaccines. recent data to understand the astrazeneca and j&j vaccine response to variants using immunoseq t-map covid were published in the new england journal of medicine and in nature, respectively. also, we are pleased to announce we signed an agreement with moderna in which immunoseq t-map covid will be used to measure the t cell response to their second-generation covid vaccine and their zika vaccine.
in addition, we signed a license agreement in our drug discovery business with vaccibody. this is the first time that our t cell data will be used to inform the design and development of a t cell-based sars-cov-2 vaccine. importantly, adaptive technology may inform the design of an entirely new class of vaccines that elicit a t cell response for many disease states. we are in active discussions with the fda, nih, cms, cdc and the white house administration to include the t cell response in funded studies to answer critical questions related to vaccine durability, breakthrough infections and efficacy in immunocompromised patients.
our view has been that this virus is endemic in the population and that t cells may answer many of these questions. we are making progress, and we will keep you informed on these discussions. beyond covid, our t-detect franchise continues to advance. results from our case-control data set with john hopkins was just published as a preprint and serves as a basis for clinical validation.
in addition, our immunesense study for t-detect lyme will complete enrollment in the fall. together, these studies will support bringing the test online in our clia lab around year end. we continue to progress toward t-detect ibd as a differential diagnostic with more than half of the 5,000 samples from crohn's and ulcerative colitis patients already analyzed. we expect to share the data toward the end of this year.
we have also made significant progress in other autoimmune disorders, and we are encouraged by an early signal that we have in multiple sclerosis. for those of us who have friends and family suffering from this debilitating disease, we know firsthand that early blood-based diagnosis may alleviate years of uncertainty and more effectively guide the treatment path. autoimmune disease diagnosis is a critical next step for adaptive, and we are prioritizing our development efforts in this area. in addition, the overall value of our clonoseq brand continues to grow as evidenced by both strong clonoseq volumes and the signing of yet another major pharma mrd collaboration.
importantly, our team has been building the case that measuring mrd regularly for patients with blood cancers is best practice. last week, an international panel of multiple myeloma experts published a call to action in clinical cancer research to guide the use of mrd in the clinic for patients with multiple myeloma. of note, the publication also builds the case for the use of mrd as a regulatory end point for which adaptive has significant associated regulatory milestones. in our drug discovery efforts with genentech, our collaboration continues to advance in both the shared and private products.
we remain on track to deliver the next shared candidate data package to genentech and extend our proof of concept in the private product from 15 to approximately 60 cancer patients this year. in summary, we are delivering toward our 2021 goals, and we are enabling opportunities stemming from our platform. before passing the call on to julie on slide 4, on slide 4, i want to provide some color on how we are using our covid efforts as a model to unlock multiple commercial opportunities from the same underlying immune receptor data set. by decoding the fundamental biological link between our immune system and the diseases with which they interact, adaptive can create value in many disease categories across research, diagnostics and drug discovery.
in this case, we applied our immunecode data for a research product called immunoseq t-map covid, which is now being used by vaccine developers, academic institutions and advocacy groups, leveraging the same data source we launched t-detect covid, the first indication for our clinical diagnostic t-detect franchise. and we signed a drug discovery agreement with vaccibody for the design and development of next-generation t cell-based vaccine. this concept of one data set stemming through multiple opportunities is an approach that we are pursuing in many of the disease states that we are mapping. so now i'm going to hand the call over to julie.
julie?
julie rubinstein -- president
thanks, chad. moving to slide 5 with t-detect. t-detect covid trends continue to ramp up and now over 10,000 customers have ordered the test. we did observe downward pressure in orders in june and early july as the vaccines rolled out, but concerns with the delta variant has renewed interest.
we expect to launch a covid-immune response website later this month to enable customers to gain additional research insights about their t-detect test results. to start, it will include a personalized comparison of the strength of an individual t cell response to that of others with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection. next, we expect to add more information profiling a person's t cell response to vaccine. for t-detect lyme, as chad mentioned, results from our case-control data set with john hopkins have been published.
these case-control data demonstrate that our highly specific t cell test is three times more sensitive than standard two-tier serology in the first few days post infection and nearly two times more sensitive in the first one to two weeks. in addition, the data also supports that the t cell response precedes the antibody response to the borrelia bacteria. immunesense lyme is enrolling nicely, which will enable us to complete validation and make the test available in clia around year end. during the first half of 2021, data emerging from our tcr mapping efforts have given us confidence in the ability of t cells to be used to detect a variety of autoimmune diseases.
these are diseases that afflict millions of patients and are challenging to diagnose and treat with highly specific clinical tools. in addition to the exciting data in ibd, we are encouraged by the signal we are seeing in multiple sclerosis because it appears to be strong not only in patients with later-stage disease, but also in patients at much earlier stages, which is where ms is particularly challenging to diagnose. we have more samples arriving in the next couple of months and look forward to improving the sensitivity of our ms signal later this year. the early sensitivity we are seeing in lyme, ms and other diseases supports the premise that t cells are the first specific defense cells to see disease antigens and should be able to be leveraged for true, early and specific detection of many diseases from blood.
switching gears to clonoseq on slide 6. on the left side related to clinical testing, you can see clonoseq clinical testing volumes of 5,475 tests in the quarter grew 75% versus prior year and 15% versus the prior quarter. during the quarter, orders were placed by approximately 950 unique hcps spanning 248 accounts for approximately 3,400 unique patients tested. and clonoseq has now been used to treat more than 18,500 unique patients.
importantly, we observed double-digit growth quarter over quarter in tests delivered in each fda-approved indication; all, multiple myeloma and cll and within community accounts. this growth reflected recovery in the second quarter and was a result of our continuous sales, marketing and educational initiatives. that said, the spread of the delta variant poses challenges to the back half weighted growth we had anticipated in two main ways: first, rep access to clinicians, and second, reduced clinical visits recommended to our specific blood cancer patient population who are immunocompromised. as such, it is now becoming unlikely that we will double our clonoseq volumes by year end but continue to expect healthy growth in the second half of the quarter.
the recent paper that chad highlighted is a key indicator of the growing sentiment that mrd does make a difference in the treatment of multiple myeloma patients. these prominent international kols and fda regulators state that quantitative, accurate, standardized and sensitive mrd testing may provide greater information relevant to tumor biology and likelihood of relapse when performed in a sequential fashion over multiple time points during the continuum of care. they go on to say that complete response provides a false sense of disease control. and at any given stage in the disease evolution, achievement of mrd negativity will predict a better outcome compared to patients at a similar stage who have not achieved the same depth of response with any given therapy.
of note, the paper also aggregates information from almost 40 ongoing phase 3 trials, more than half of which utilize clonoseq that are evaluating mrd-directed therapy or mrd as an endpoint. endorsements like this are a very important call to action to change behavior in the clinic. i also want to highlight a recent clonoseq publication in the journal of clinical oncology focused on dlbcl patients, which showed that ctdna-based surveillance of patients with dlbcl undergoing car-t therapy with axi-cel may be a useful adjunct to radiologic assessment of disease status. this is one of many ongoing studies as we pave the path for future clonoseq testing in nhl.
on the right side of the slide, you can see the number of publicly disclosed pharma partnerships where clonoseq use in clinical trials continues to grow. this quarter, we signed another pan portfolio pan-indication mrd partnership with janssen, which includes both sequencing and potential future development revenue. we also recognized an additional development milestone revenue based on use of mrd data as a clinical endpoint, which brings a total of $8.5 million in recognized revenue from development milestones year to date. lastly, on slide 7.
we are continuing to make good progress on our genentech collaboration. as you can see in the chart, the shared and private product programs are complementary in many ways. there are significant learnings across t cell identification, engineering and manufacturing that we plan to leverage from our shared product to inform our private product approach. in fact, just this week, we had our quarterly jrc, and we are in lockstep toward both -- on both of our programs, and we look forward to sharing more details at the appropriate time.
i also want to highlight the relevance of our new license agreement with vaccibody. vaccibody is using adaptive-identified viral antigenic peptides that are driving t cell responses to develop a second-generation t cell-based sars-cov-2 vaccine. this vaccine may provide more complete viral protection against known and future variants of concern. a phase i/ii trial is expected to start in q4 of this year and will include testing in unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals to be able to assess the true potential of this vaccine candidate as a universal booster.
i'll now pass it over to chad c. for financial updates.
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
thanks, julie. turning to our financial results on slide 8. total revenue in the second quarter was $38.5 million, representing an 83% increase from $21 million in the same period last year. our revenue mix for the second quarter consisted of 48% of our revenues coming from our sequencing category and 52% coming from our development category.
sequencing revenue in the second quarter was $18.6 million and increased 132% from the same period in 2020. growth in sequencing revenue was driven by both significant asp and volume increases over prior year in our pharma research business and also by volume growth in our clonoseq business. research sequencing volume increased to 6,900 sequences, up 65% from 4,185 sequences delivered in the second quarter of 2020. clinical sequencing volume excluding our t-detect covid volume, increased 75% to 5,475 clinical tests delivered in the second quarter of 2021, up from 3,136 clinical tests delivered during the same period in 2020.
development revenue grew to $20 million in the second quarter, up 53% from the same period last year. the largest driver of our development revenue continues to be the amortization of our genentech upfront. we also saw a $2.2 million increase over prior year and revenue generated from our mrd development agreements, which includes a $1.5 million regulatory milestone that was recognized in q2 2021 from one of our biopharma partners. even as the milestones materialize, we continue to replenish and grow the available milestones that we can participate in from ongoing demand for using mrd as a regulatory endpoint in clinical trials.
shifting now from our revenue to our operating costs. total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were $88.3 million, representing a 53% increase from $57.9 million in the same quarter last year. working down our operating expenses. cost of revenue was $10.8 million during the second quarter of 2021 compared to $4.9 million for the second quarter last year, representing a 119% increase.
higher cost of revenue was primarily driven by increases in labor and overhead costs as well as an increase in revenue sample volume, which drove higher consumption of materials and related items. we also saw growth in allocated facility expenses stemming from our new high throughput lab and office space under construction, which is quickly approaching completion. research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were $37.8 million compared to $26 million in the second quarter of 2020, representing a 45% increase. the growth was largely related to an increase in personnel costs, driven by innovation, south san francisco cellular lab, molecular product development and software engineering teams and increasing cost of materials and allocated production lab expenses.
sales and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were $23.2 million compared to $14.3 million in the second quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 62%. the majority of this growth was due to increased personnel costs, particularly related to teams supporting our clinical diagnostic businesses and medical affairs as well as large marketing efforts to support our in-line products. general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were $16.1 million compared to $12.2 million in the second quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 31%. the increase was primarily driven by growth in head count and personnel costs.
net loss for the second quarter of 2021 was $49.3 million compared to second quarter 2020 net loss of $33.5 million. adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2021 was a loss of $35.6 million compared to a loss of $28.5 million in the same period of the prior year. we ended the quarter with approximately $690 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and we had no debt. with respect to our outlook for the year, we are narrowing our full-year revenue guidance range to $148 million to $155 million, up from our prior range of $145 million to $155 million.
the increase in the bottom end of our range reflects the additional $1.5 million mrd milestone payment in the second quarter as well as strong execution year to date. we still anticipate sequencing revenues to represent between 50% to 55% of our total revenues for the full year. we are encouraged with our first half results and are confident in our ability to achieve our full-year commercial and development goals. we will continue to closely monitor any impact from covid variants in the second half and look forward to providing you with further updates next quarter.
i will now turn the call back over to chad robins for final remarks.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
hey, thanks, chad. i'm very encouraged with the progress we are seeing across all business areas and looking forward to executing on the catalysts outlined in slide 9. what i'm most excited about is the data emerging from our platform, which we expect to monetize for multiple opportunities in research, diagnostics and drug discovery. before opening up for ",2021-Q2,ADPT

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of tycho peterson of j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. congrats on the reimbursement coverage for t-detect covid. i know that's a big deal. can you maybe just help us think about the intended use case, the benefit of using it and how you size the market opportunity?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah, sure. thanks, tycho. and yes, this is we're really, really excited about this, the news of coverage. so maybe i'll -- the first question about who is intended -- who the product of t-detect covid is intended for.
i'll take that and then i'm going to pass it over to our new chief commercial officer, nitin sood and if you could handle the question about the benefits and the market opportunity from there. so just to -- for the first question, just kind of let me outline it. so medicare issued a coverage decision for a certain population, the immunocompromised patients who are less capable of mounting an immune response to either the natural infection of covid and/or to the vaccination. but we believe and we said this from the beginning that unfortunately, this is going to be endemic in our population.
and these subset of patients will -- they're always going to be at risk even as the virus moves from kind of the pandemic state to an endemic state. so the risk will remain high about whether or not they can amount an immune response. and if you look at kind of this estimated population of immunocompromised population, it's around kind of seven. the estimates vary, but on the low end, we think it's around 7 million in the united states.
and this will be kind of the population that we believe will benefit from our t-detect covid test. and we think that this kind of t cell testing is at a really high level, it's going to fill a big gap in the current testing paradigm. so nitin, can -- you want to take how it will be used and the benefit to this population?
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
yeah. thanks, chad. so as you all know, your body produces t cells as part of your immune response to infections and vaccinations and our t-detect covid test reliably assesses the presence of t cells or a t cell response to covid-19, indicating recent or prior infections. covid vaccines also produce a t cell response, which may result in a positive t-detect covid test.
and physicians can use this to help their managed care. and as like chad talked about, particularly for immunocompromised patients, helping make -- helping physicians to make decisions related to vaccines or vaccine boosters and patients who are on immune-suppressing medications including deferring or postponing such medications or providing even preventative monoclonal antibody treatments. as chad noted earlier, part of that immunocompromised population is in the oncology space and that is the population we're going to target. we think out of those 7 million individuals, 1 million are in the oncology segment.
and we're going to use the clonoseq sales team to target those physicians . and then we're going to do sort of more targeted promotion to transplant centers, hiv treatment centers, where we also believe there is an autoimmune sector, where we believe there is an immune-compromised population. and simultaneously long term, we're working on generating additional evidence to make the test semi-quantitative as well as generate a correlate of protection, which we think is going to be not only beneficial to physicians and strengthen our value proposition to physicians, but also really strengthen our value proposition to vaccine developers. and i think longer term, i think it sort of opens up a whole lot of opportunities for us.
given the success of mrna vaccines, i think there's going to be a lot of activity in vaccine development even beyond covid. and i think having a test that measures quantitatively the t cell response and produces evidence around correlate of protection, will open up a whole bunch of doors beyond covid as well.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. that's super helpful. and maybe just sticking with the vaccine theme then on moderna, you mentioned you've got the samples in-house. obviously, you're working on the second-generation covid vaccine.
how should we think about time lines there? any updates on the development path?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure. harlan, do you want to take that one?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer
sure. thanks, tycho. we're evaluating the response to the cellular immune response to the vaccine and we're -- the data is going to be owned by moderna. so it's not going to be at our liberty to discuss the outcomes of that.
but we're definitely wrapping up soon in returning data.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then on the enhanced clonoseq for cll, how do you size the ighv opportunity? i know you talked about a 20% increase in orders early on. but how are you sizing the incremental opportunity there?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
nitin, do you want to take that?
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
yeah. i mean i think the benefit there is going to be that it's going to encourage physicians that order cll to order the id test. there is sometimes less incentive for them to order the id test. now they're going to get actual prognostic information right at diagnosis.
so that's -- so i think it encourages physicians to order the id test. and really cll is treated a lot in the community setting and really enhances the value of clonoseq in the community setting. so that's how we think about this.
tycho peterson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. great. and one last one for chad cohen before i hop off. just on guidance, $3 million beat.
you're keeping guidance intact. 4q guidance is a bit below the street. anything to think about for the fourth quarter, why you might be a little bit more cautious here?
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean we tend to think about the business in semesters more than quarters. and we've historically just talked about it that way, front half versus back half. so third quarter, we saw a lot of really strong pharma volumes that we had really contemplated a little more in the fourth quarter.
they came a little early. we're still seeing really strong sequencing business. if you look at the back half, growth over last year is looking at about 70%, given the numbers that we implied with our guide, growing really nicely also first half over second half at about 20 or so percent. and the business really is performing far better in the back half from a core sort of sequencing perspective.
we gave the guide around sort of 50-50 split between sequencing and development. the first half was sort of more of like a 40-60 split. the back half is more of like a 60-40, it sort of gets to those numbers. so our sequencing volumes and our sequencing revenue in the back half are really strong relative to the first half.
the first half also just had $8.5 million in milestones, which makes that first half number look a little bigger from a development perspective.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer
ok. i appreciate the color. thanks. i'll let others hop in.
chad cohen -- chief financial officer

our next question comes from the line of derik de bruin of bank of america. your line is now open.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, everyone.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
hey, derik.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so i guess first question and it's -- sort of tag teams on tycho's. what was sort of the impact on your clinical sequencing volumes and your biopharma volumes from the spike in the delta variant? you and a number of other companies last quarter were a bit cautious on sort of your second half views given that. so just wondering if you could sort of like quantify what's going on or what you sort of saw with it in terms of volumes?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah. there was definitely a third quarter impact related to the delta variant on the clinical sequencing volume for clonoseq and that was really primarily for two reasons. the first reason is because our reps had really limited access to be able to get into accounts, especially when you're talking about kind of the new accounts and new indications like cll, which were growing, you really need kind of that in-person kind of rep access. and the second also related to certain populations, which kind of interplay with the covid announcement is this population because they're immune compromised, we're really being told to -- in cases where they didn't need to come in for imminent treatment, just that we're really kind of delaying their in-person hospital and clinician visits.
so that kind of the combination of those two factors definitely took a hit in the third quarter. like the preprepared remarks, we are encouraged based on the ighv launch in cll and some of the trends that we're starting to see in the fourth quarter, both related to the ighv launch in cll, but also with, i think, the delta variant not having an impact fortunately, for a lot of reasons, we're starting to see some really positive signs.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so i know it's a little -- i know it's early to start thinking about next year, but i have to ask. when you began this year, you talked about doubling your total clinical test volumes and obviously, with the uncertainty with delta, that understandably doesn't happen. but do you have any initial thoughts on how you sort of think about clinical volumes trending for 2023?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
well, we're not -- excuse me, for 2022?
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i'm sorry, 2022. sorry, i'm already a year past. i'm on the beat. there you go.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah. look, derik, i mean we're bullish on this business and we're encouraging -- encouraged by the trends that we're seeing. like i said, although there was an impact from the delta variant, our overall thesis in the clonoseq business is incredibly positive. we're not yet at the point where we're prepared to release guidance for 2022 yet, but we certainly think it's going to be a strong -- we certainly expect to have strong growth in 2022.
and i would say, again, we look at the interplay in that business, the clinical sequencing volume plus the mrd pharma opportunity overall makes up the clonoseq brand. and overall, that business has been growing quite nicely and we expect it to grow and get on a nice growth trajectory in 2022.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

our next question comes from the line of brian weinstein of william blair. your line is now open.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. i was hoping you could maybe help us understand a little bit more on the news from vaccibody today, the importance that it has for adaptive at a high level relative to kind of the technology? and then can you just remind us practically what it means to the company and the potential financial opportunity if all of this were to play out positivity?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah, sure. hi, brian. thanks for the question. first, let me -- i want to put this into context.
i understand that kind of vaccibody isn't a household name like moderna and j&j. but this is really important for adaptive because we do view this as kind of a true extension of the platform into another area of drug discovery. and what i mean by that is, yes, you've heard about kind of moderna and j&j deals where we work really from essentially looking at the immune response to their vaccines and being able to, as harlan said, kind of hand over that data to really help them understand how their vaccines are working. this is different in that we're actually using our platform to inform the design and development of the vaccines.
you kind of more specifically from a scientific standpoint, pieces of the virus or the viral proteom called t-cell receptor epitopes, we can essentially by looking at the t cell response to those pieces of virus, we can determine which pieces go into the vaccine construct to specifically elicit a broad and diverse t cell immune response. and this is a new type of vaccine, a t cell-based vaccine, of which our technology is perfectly kind of suited to be able to inform that design and development. so we think it's important for two reasons. one is we can potentially extend this proof of concept would allow us to extend to other disease areas if we can show that this is the right way to design and develop t cell-based vaccines and potentially with other larger players and/or vaccibody.
but then secondly, there's a potential based on their delivery mechanism, they have a dna-based vaccine, which doesn't have cold chain storage requirements . so there's an opportunity here and we'll have some royalties on the vaccine that if this vaccine could be delivered as another option of a booster to certain parts of the world where you would benefit from not requiring or not having accessibility to cold chain storage requirements, that's really where we kind of see the potential opportunity. but first and foremost, brian, we're really looking at is, hey, does this work? can we use our platform to design a vaccine and then this really opens up we believe a lot of opportunities for us.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
ok. and then for you, harlan, just your thoughts in general on current vaccine effectiveness. we listened to the webinar that you did back, i think it was october and you've been a little bit concerned about durability there. and just the need for a t cell-based approach, kind of like what kind of just talking about with vaccibody and how you guys are playing there.
but just generally, your thoughts on what you're seeing on current vaccine effectiveness and the need for a t-cell-based approach in general?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer
yeah. so certainly, we should be i think very pleased with the efficacy of the vaccines. i mean we're seeing at six, eight months out that the response is staying quite strong. it's certainly in the cellular immune response.
but it is -- it does start to wane after that. we can see it, depending on the vaccine start dropping at six months or start dropping at eight months, so which is really corresponding to other measures, the efficacy measures that show that the rate of breakthrough infection starts going up at that point in time. so i think the booster regimen that's being suggested is right on schedule. and hopefully, we can broaden that i think to having that for the wider population would be, in my opinion, a very good thing.
and certainly, the side effects seem to be staying quite manageable. so i think we're moving in a good direction and i'm excited for the next generation of vaccines coming out too.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
ok. and then one more for me. just you've talked about moldx kind of looking at t-detect. anything on private payers if you guys been reaching out to them? and any thoughts on the likelihood of gaining coverage in some of the larger private payers there for the same population? thanks guys.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
nitin, you want to comment on private payers?
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
yeah. so the current covid testing guidelines provide for commercial payer coverage of fda, eua covid tests within the context of the public health emergency and our t-detect covid test falls within this category. so we'll be working with private payers over the next several weeks to outline the operational process for bringing coverage online.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
thanks, guys.

our next question comes from the line of dan brennan of cowen. your line is now open.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you. hey, chad and chad. nice to be on the call.
so i wanted to -- first question is just on clonoseq just maybe stepping back, i know derik asked the question. i'm just wondering, can you just provide an update on the commercial investments that you made to kind of drive growth? obviously, delta could be having the kind of temporal impact right now. but just give us an update on people that have been put in place, what you've seen thus far? and if we look out toward '22 and beyond, just what are the key kind of milestones in terms of regulatory approval of new enhancements that can be important toward driving growth in the franchise.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah. so first off, welcome to the call, dan. a pleasure to have you covering us. we're making kind of significant investments in clonoseq in kind of preparing for 2022, in particular kind of increasing the amount of reps on the ground, both in terms of our key account managers and a dedicated hematology specialists based on some early signs that we've seen in the ighv kind of launch.
but we also believe that kind of training this cohort as a class together will have kind of significant benefits as we look to scale the business. with that, i'll turn it over to nitin to make more specific remarks.
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
yeah. i mean i think -- yeah, we've spoken before, we are pretty positive on our clonoseq business. we have the best-in-class sensitivity. we have fda approval.
we have widespread payer coverage. in fact, this quarter alone, we increased coverage for cll by 15%. we see other positive trends. there was an mrd white paper that was published in july that supported the use of mrd both as a regulatory endpoint and in clinical practice.
authors included many top kols -- nicole gormley of the fda. we saw a german cost impact analysis study published in september that there is a favorable -- eur 75,000 favorable economic impact with the use of clonoseq directed therapy. so i think we see positive trends. as a result, we're investing in the channel.
we're strengthening how we market the product. we're improving and investing in improving customer experience. so repeat ordering is seamless. and then longer term, we think we'll get some positive feedback from the fda on all in blood.
we have three major studies going on in multiple myeloma. we received some positive feedback for the 80 studies we have ongoing for nhl, for non-hodgkin's lymphoma. so overall, i think we see all kinds of positive trends and we continue to invest in the business broadly.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you for that. and then just on mrd, obviously, sizable kind of milestone opportunity to be recognized there. in terms of thinking about the events that will play out, to start to realize more significant portion of that, is that more so like '23, '24 or could '22, just given the time lines for the development program? just wondering how we should think about kind of when a bigger part of that starts to become realistic.
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
yeah. dan, this is chad cohen. how are you doing? good to hear from you on the call. as we mentioned, we have over $330 million of milestones available to us and that's been growing really nicely even as we've been taking these down.
it's hard to really sort of bookend the time frame with respect to our participation in them but they'll happen over the next few years. i think just to characterize the milestones, they represent probably on the order of a dozen or more different deals with even more compounds and projects within those deals. and i'd say twoi-thirds of the economics in those milestones relate to primary endpoints, which is a much bigger sort of pool of endpoints that we hope to participate in, in some day. what we've really been participating in so far are the secondary endpoint milestones which continue to grow and for which we've recognized about $10 million this year.
so i really feel it's becoming more of a structural component of our p&l than it even has in the past and they continue -- we continue to grow the available pool of milestones and hope to do more deals, especially as we get into other indications like nhl.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
awesome. great. thanks, guys. appreciate it.

our next question comes from the line of mark massaro of btig. your line is now open.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the attractive reimbursement for t-detect covid. i guess, how should we think about -- i know that this question has been asked, but there's about 1 million cancer patients that would be eligible. 1% of that market is about $8 million of revenue.
so just, i guess we're trying to get a sense for how quickly do you think you can get 5% of that opportunity? is it two years? is it one year? and i think it would be helpful from a modeling perspective.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
let me make a couple of comments and again, nitin, feel free to add on. first off, i want to make -- in order to operationalize, this, it's going to be -- probably 60 to 90 days. there's a lot of things that we need to do to put in place to be able to offer this to hcps through a reimbursed channel, including going out and a good question earlier on private payer reimbursement, we need a specific code from the ama to be able to ensure coverage by the private payers. but that being said, our target is the 1 million, in terms of a direct coverage, is the 1 million immunocompromised patients that we have access to.
and then secondly, there's another, call it, 6 million to 7 million patients who are immune compromised that we'll be doing non-direct promotional activities to as well. but i think it's fair to say, look, this is not only a new product launch, but this is a new product category. so we're extremely encouraged and bullish. but in terms of kind of how quickly we can get to 5%.
and the good news is, i think there -- the world has been helping and talking about the adaptive immune response to the virus. so that bodes in our favor. so some of that kind of marketing effort is done. but in terms of the specific use case, which was asked earlier, exactly how and when you use it, what therapeutic regimens or lifestyle choices will a patient -- will a doctor provide to assist in the management of patients, this all has to be worked into the current patient paradigm of care.
so we're going to go as quickly as possible to capture as much of the market as possible and we're working through that right now. nitin, do you want to add onto that?
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
i mean i just want to reemphasize the fact that we do have a sales channel exactly into those 1 million patients, but it is going to be an effort on our part to educate that physician population about the adaptive immune system. so i think we're going full steam ahead to make this available and we're going to keep an eye out on it. and i think we're going to include updates for you all when we provide guidance next year.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
and then obviously, we're bullish about it because we're prioritizing it. and that was catalyzed based on the fact that we were able to get the coverage that we did allows us to step on the gas and go in and pursue this opportunity because we think it's real.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
that's great. so you did acknowledge you were impacted by the delta variants in q3. you made some positive commentary about volumes here in q4. you grew 8% sequentially for clinical clonoseq volumes in q3.
do you think it's reasonable based on the positive commentary for delta so far, one-third of the way through q4 that you can kind of have an almost similar performance on the clinical side for clonoseq in q4?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer
yes. we certainly anticipate having sequential growth in the fourth quarter.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then just my last question. how should we think about the opportunity for lyme disease as it relates to reimbursement? certainly, i wouldn't expect $700 or $800 a test, but any thoughts you have there and update you have as it relates to discussions with any payers?
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
yes. i mean i can speak to that. i think as we've said in prepared remarks, we're going to be launching the lyme test closer to the lyme season. we've reprioritized and refocused ourselves on t-detect covid.
and at this point in time, we're engaging with payers and having conversations and we'll provide you an update as real information is available to us. but that is a focus for us to figure out the reimbursement for lyme, yesah.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
great. that's it for me.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of salveen richter of goldman sachs. your line is now open.
unknown speaker -- goldman sachs -- analyst
this is elizabeth on for salveen. thank you for taking our questions. i just wanted to ask about the enhanced version of clonoseq for cll patients. are there any other enhancements for clonoseq that you're considering or would potentially consider for other indications?
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
yeah. so i think we're not prepared to disclose anything right now, but certainly, nhl, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, is an area that's going to be a lot of focus for us and enhancing our capability in the blood-based multiple myeloma, test is going to be a focus for us. and then we're also potentially considering adding an ighv like test in other indications.
unknown speaker -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks.

our next question comes from the line of tejas savant of morgan stanley. your line is now open.
unknown speaker -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. this is yuko on for tejas. now having gone through the reimbursement process for t-detect covid, could you just share some of the learnings from that process? and how are you thinking about positioning reimbursement pricing discussion as you roll out additional indications for t-detect?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
hey, yuko. thanks for the question. so i think the first thing to keep in context is that because we got an eua from the fda, it gave us the opportunity to expedite reimbursement discussions with moldx. and what essentially that means is there's a significant amount of education that has to go in to be able to really to understand exactly what this is.
because this is a new way to diagnose disease using t cells, we were able to go in and really outline the case. and so now you've got a baseline set at the moldx program. and frankly, we were able to do some of this at cms national. now as we look to kind of future indications, we do believe there's an opportunity to price a test based on the value that test provides to patients and the healthcare system.
don't get me wrong. we're pretty encouraged by the price point we were able to kind of receive from moldx, but we think in certain high unmet medical needs, in particular, in the autoimmune category, there should be potential to really price a test based on the true value it provides to the system and to patients. so i don't know if that totally answers your question, but those are some thoughts we have around kind of reimbursement, what we went through with covid and how it impacts our thinking in terms of kind of the longer-term thinking for the franchise.
unknown speaker -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, that was super helpful. thank you. and then also, you mentioned you saw the impact from delta variant this quarter. have you seen improved physician office access toward end of the quarter and into october? and then you previously mentioned that covid-19 may disproportionately affect the community channel.
did you see that also playing out this quarter?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah, we did. i mean, the reality is that we're still restricted access to both the community oncology setting and the academic medical centers. it really hasn't opened up yet to the extent that we want. so we were able to achieve the growth we did kind of despite having some of those headwinds out in front of us.
we're seeing -- on a regional basis, you're seeing some of that, but our reps are being creative and trying to meet where we're allowed to even outside the hospital settings, coffee shops and parks and doing everything that they can to be able to educate the clinical community.
unknown speaker -- goldman sachs -- analyst

next question comes from the line of david westenberg of guggenheim securities. your line is now open.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking the question. so question number one is we've seen for kind of a number of years, researchers doing immune mapping using single cell approaches. and i think there was just a company -- a private company recently that raised a pretty big round on using single cell approach in order to map the immune system.
so i just wanted to ask, just in terms of your approach differing from others that are using that other kind of approach.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. so there -- people mean a lot of different things by mapping the immune system. i think what you're referring to is a company that has an approach to look at a whole bunch of different parameters to get some kind of more global picture of what they think is going on in the immune response. we're, i would say, in some ways, more focused and focused specifically on the immune receptors, which is the immune system's way of specifically identifying disease.
so it's not -- it's sort of a different approach and probably has very different sets of applications. for the diagnostic approach, i don't think that those other approaches are really playing in that space. so i think we're the only ones, i would guess, really working on -- i shouldn't say that -- but likely the only ones working on the diagnostic space. but on the target discovery space, we're more focused on antigenic targets as well as the t cell receptors used for therapeutic use against those targets, which is very different than maybe looking for more general immune-based targets that some of these other companies might be using.
they're very early on. we don't have a ton of data on what they're exactly doing. but certainly, the immune system is, as we know, quite large and is affecting every aspect of medicine right now, including the primary direction people are going for cancer therapies in addition to obviously working in the vaccine space in autoimmune. so i think there's -- we'll see more and more different directions.
the confusion of using the same term to mean different things, mapping of the immune system, hopefully, we can clarify what we mean by that anyway so that it's not such a confusion.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
no, no, i appreciate it. it's just a question we just got a couple of days ago. so anyway, secondly, in terms of t-detect covid, are there any other infectious diseases that might have utility in terms of, a, finding t cell versus b cell immunity, differentiating natural versus vaccine immunity and kind of measuring immune response length for a period of time? i'm just trying to contemplate future applications for t-detect that you've discovered today that might be applicable to other infectious diseases that we maybe haven't thought about in the future? and i'll stop there after that.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah. i mean this is a great question. and the biggest appreciation and learning was, i think the community at large, even the scientific community, the immunologist and virologists, i don't think everybody really appreciated the role that the cellular immune system is playing in protection, whereas -- and part of this is probably just historical that we've had the ability to measure an antibody response and even a neutralizing antibody response for 50 years. and we didn't really have a way of measuring the t cell response at scale.
but now that we do and also now that we're in this situation where we're seeing these new variants from covid that are really avoiding the neutralizing antibody response from the vaccines at high levels, we're seeing the importance of the t cell response to really give us the protection that we need to prevent severe disease. and so because of that, there's been an uptake in interest in looking at the t cell response. and what's on us, we have to prove that the t cell response really correlates with protection. if we can show that directly, then we really have the tool that people can use going forward in a whole variety of different vaccine efforts in different diseases to help them develop the right vaccine but also prove that their vaccine is working and provide the information that the regulatory bodies need as well.
so we're pretty excited about this evolution of this field. we're obviously a little frustrated. it was slower than we -- we had hoped that for people to start appreciating t cells, but it is happening and there's going to be, i don't know, the t cell revolution is coming.

chad? 
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, karina. good afternoon, everybody. thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. we had another quarter of strong performance with key progress across our business areas, paving the way for our immune medicine platform to transform disease diagnosis and drug discovery.
thank you to all of our employees for their dedication and commitment to our company and the patients we serve. this quarter, we had the pleasure of opening our new corporate headquarters and laboratory facility in seattle. this building represents a new chapter for adaptive to scale our business as we continue to grow. from sample processing, data analysis, this is truly an end-to-end facility designed to be a place that inspires our workforce to deliver innovative solutions for our patients and our community.
moving to the slides. starting on slide 3. our third quarter results demonstrate continued progress. revenue in the quarter was $39.5 million, representing significant growth of 50% versus prior year.
increasing the overall value of our clonoseq brand through both clinical adoption and pharma mrd collaborations remains a key focus. we recently launched an enhanced version of the clonoseq assay for cll patients, which gives patients ighv mutation status in the same test where we measure the trackable mrd sequence. this is an important step as clonoseq will become an even more valuable diagnostic for hematologists to use at the start of patient workups. in addition, our pharma partners continue to benefit from using our mrd assay as an endpoint in clinical trials and this quarter, recognized another regulatory milestone.
our covid efforts continue to gain traction on multiple fronts. we are delighted to report that we received a positive assessment from moldx recommending coverage for t-detect covid for immunocompromised patients. this is a further validation that t cell testing fills an important gap in understanding the immune response to the virus and is a key reimbursement milestone for the t-detect franchise. of note, a large subset of the immunocompromised population is the same blood cancer patients we target with our clonoseq commercial team.
in addition, there is an increasing number of research collaborators and vaccine manufacturers interested in using immunoseq t-map covid to assess whether t cells may provide a correlate of protection. these data would answer key questions in understanding immunity of the virus. beyond covid, our t-detect franchise continues to progress. we completed our immunesense lyme study, which showed our t cell-based diagnostic to be nearly two times more sensitive than standard two-tier testing in identifying individuals with early disease.
this is the second technical proof of concept that our t cell-based testing has advantages over serology in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. we continue to advance t-detect in autoimmune indications. for ibd, we already have a signal in ileal crohn's and approximately 5,000 ivd samples in-house, of which over 80% have been sequenced and the remainder are in process. we expect to have the totality of the data completed by year-end and will share steps of development at that time.
we have also identified a signal in multiple sclerosis and have additional samples in-house, which are currently under analysis. autoimmune disease diagnosis is a key focus area for adaptive and we are prioritizing our development efforts around our business units. in our drug discovery efforts, our genentech collaboration is progressing well. on the shared product, we are assessing efficacy and safety data with genentech to enable a decision by year-end to move our lead product into early development.
for the private product, we are on track to complete our proof-of-concept in 60 cancer patients by the end of this year. in addition, it was great to see vaccibody announced the initiation of its phase 1/2 study for the two sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates under development, one of which includes t cell-based components identified by our immune medicine platform. this is the first time that our platform is being used to inform the construct of a novel vaccine and we're encouraged by this important advancement. in summary, we are executing toward our 2021 goals and continue to generate data to enable multiple opportunities stemming from our platform.
i'll now provide more detail on some of these highlights and then i'll pass it over to chad cohen, who will review the financials. starting with clonoseq on slide 4. on the left side, clonoseq clinical volumes of 5,928 tests in the quarter grew 47% versus prior year and 8% versus the prior quarter. during the quarter, orders were placed by over 1,000 unique healthcare providers spending 260 accounts for approximately 3,800 patients tested and clonoseq has now been used to test more than 20,000 unique patients.
test delivered grew quarter over quarter in each indication. we increased the number of ordering physicians and the number of accounts, including within the community setting. so far into the fourth quarter, we have seen our daily order volumes increase and expect to achieve sequential growth. the recent launch of ighv was an important milestone for clonoseq, which we expect to influence utilization for cll patients.
ighv testing is recommended in clinical practice guidelines because it has shown to be prognostic in cll. we do believe this added feature will help boost cll orders and have already observed a 20% increase in cll orders in the four weeks since launch. although off a small base, we believe this is a great indicator at this very early point in the launch. we continue to drive expansion of payer coverage policies, reaching over 240 million covered lives in all and multi myeloma and over 150 million in cll.
of note, cll covered lives increased 15% this quarter and we had an important payer addition with centene, who now consider clonoseq as medically necessary for their patients with all, multi myeloma and cll. on the right side of the slide, you can see our mrd pharma partnerships continue to drive the value for the clonoseq brand. in addition to sequencing revenues, we have over $330 million in future regulatory milestones. this portfolio of eligible milestones continues to grow and materialize over time.
and this quarter, we recognized an additional $1.5 million, which brings the total to $10 million year to date. turning to t-detect on slide 5. the interest in t-detect covid orders despite vaccine rollout continued over the quarter, mostly related to concerns with the delta variant. importantly, given the lack of effective test to assess the immune response to covid-19 infection in certain groups of individuals, including immunocompromised patients, moldx has allowed for reimbursement of t-detect covid at $770 per test.
there are approximately 1 million oncology-related immune-compromised patients in the united states. notably, we are planning to leverage our clonoseq sales channel and increase our promotional efforts to this population. this is an exciting advancement for t-detect as this is the first reimbursement that potentially paves the way to accelerate market access for future indications. for t-detect lyme, our immunesense lyme study was completed and data was presented at idweek in october.
the study validated that t-detect lyme in patients tested within 30 days of symptoms onset is nearly twice as sensitive versus standard two tier serology testing in detecting lyme disease. given the focus of these data in the acute setting, we've decided to make t-detect lyme available closer to the start of the lyme season while focusing our near-term efforts on operationalizing the t-detect covid reimbursement launch. i also want to emphasize the key interplay between our clinical diagnostics and pharma research business. just as the overall value of our clonoseq brand is driven by a combination of clinical test volumes and the strength of our mrd pharma portfolio, the same applies with t-detect.
the right side of the slide shows a variety of ways in which our pharma and research partners are using t-map covid to assess t-cell response to vaccines and potential correlates of protection. we believe that the role of t cells will continue to gain traction as covid becomes endemic and questions about immunity remain unanswered. we intend to be the go-to platform for the acute and accurate quantification of t cell response for our pharma partners and other research collaborators. lastly, on slide 6, our drug discovery efforts continue to advance.
we are on track with our genentech cell therapy collaboration to advance both the shared and the private products. both programs are making good progress as expected and our joint genentech-adaptive teams are working closely together to assess efficacy and safety data of our lead tcr for our shared product to enable a decision by year-end to move into early development. the teams also continue to establish private product specifications. last quarter, we disclosed the extension of our drug discovery capabilities to inform the design and development of vaccines with vaccibody.
vaccibody designed its next-generation t cell-based covid-19 vaccine candidate by encoding multiple spike and non spike-specific t cell epitopes validated by adaptive. this t cell-based vaccine is intended to address sars-cov-2 variants of concern and to be used as a potential universal booster to available vaccines. this morning, vaccibody announced the start of its two arm phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of its two vaccine candidate, an rbd-only vaccine and our t cell vaccine. both vaccine candidates will be tested in already vaccinated individuals.
look forward to seeing progress on this new and important program that aims to address variants of concern and we'll continue to work with the vaccibody team to share any additional information at the appropriate time. our vaccibody collaboration is yet another validation of our platform in drug discovery. we're excited to pursue additional opportunities to inform the design and development of next-generation t cell-based vaccines in other diseases. i'll now pass it over to chad cohen for our third quarter financial update.
chad cohen -- chief financial officer
thanks, chad. turning to our financial results on slide 7. total revenue in the third quarter was $39.5 million representing a 50% increase from $26.3 million in the same period last year. our revenue mix for the third quarter consisted of 56% of our revenues coming from our sequencing category and 44% coming from our development category.
sequencing revenue in the third quarter was $22.1 million and increased 96% from the same period of 2020. growth in sequencing revenue was driven primarily by a $5.8 million increase in revenue generated from our biopharmaceutical customers and a $5.4 million increase in revenue generated from our clinical customers. research sequencing volume increased to 8,710 sequences, up 33% from 6,541 sequences delivered in the third quarter of 2020. clinical sequencing volume, excluding our t-detect covid volume, increased 47% to 5,928 clinical tests delivered in the third quarter of 2021, up from 4,023 clinical tests delivered during the same period in 2020.
development revenue grew to $17.4 million in the third quarter, up 16% from the same period last year. the largest driver of our development revenue continues to be the amortization of our genentech upfront. this quarter, we also recognized a $1.5 million mrd regulatory milestone from one of our pharma partners. as of the third quarter of this year, we have over $330 million in potential mrd pharma milestones available to us, representing a net increase of $20 million compared to the same period last year.
shifting now from our revenue to our operating costs. total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were $95.8 million, representing a 51% increase from $63.3 million in the same quarter last year. working down our operating expenses. cost of revenue was $14.2 million during the third quarter of 2021 compared to $6.1 million for the third quarter last year, representing a 134% increase.
higher cost of revenue was primarily driven by an increase in materials costs due to sample volume, an increase in labor and overhead costs and growth in expenses related to the sample collection for our t-detect covid product. research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were $36.1 million compared to $30.3 million in the third quarter of 2020, representing a 19% increase. the growth was largely related to an increase in personnel costs, driven mainly by innovation and new product development initiatives. sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were $24.9 million compared to $14.5 million in the third quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 72%.
most of this growth was due to increased personnel costs, particularly related to the team supporting our clinical diagnostic businesses and medical affairs as well as larger investments in our clonoseq marketing efforts. general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were $20.2 million compared to $12.1 million in the third quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 67%. this increase was primarily driven by growth in headcount and personnel costs as well as expanding our overall facility footprint and higher depreciation expenses. net loss for the third quarter of 2021 was $56 million compared to third quarter 2020 net loss of $36.7 million.
adjusted ebitda for the third quarter of 2021 was a loss of $41.1 million compared to a loss of $28.4 million in the same period last year. we ended the quarter with approximately $632 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and we had no debt. with respect to our outlook, we are reiterating our guidance range for the full year of $148 million to $155 million, representing 54% growth year over year at the midpoint of the range. for the full year, we estimate a fairly even 50-50 split between our sequencing and development revenues given the realization of milestones already recognized through the third quarter.
i will now turn the call back over to chad robbins for his final remarks.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, chad. i'm proud and encouraged with our achievement year-to-date across all business areas. and looking forward to the additional key milestones we expect to accomplish over the next couple of months as outlined on slide 8. the data emerging from our platform continued to support the current and future value generated from our clinical diagnostic and drug discovery opportunities.
with that, i'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and open up for questions.
",2021-Q3,ADPT
0.9998,1.0,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from mark massaro of btig. your line is open.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for the questions. i guess maybe the first one on the 2022 revenue guide. at the midpoint, it came in about $3 million below consensus.
i guess, we understand that sequencing revenue is going to be about 60% of the total revenue for the year. can you just give us -- chad, your comments suggest that like access to the clinic seems to have improved in january. so can you just give us maybe some framework for what led you to this guidance, recognizing that hopefully, maybe we're out of the woods with covid perhaps? but can you just give us some of the puts and takes to how you came up with that range?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah. sure. hi, mark. so first of all, it's early in the year, and we want to be prudent.
but there's variability in revenues associated with the milestones, and there's some variability in some of the t-detect with the changing dynamics of the pandemic. there also is potential upside in some of the t-cell mapping efforts and potential target discovery efforts that we're looking from our t-cell franchise. and there could be potential upside in clonoseq, both in the clinical business and the mrd pharma business as well. but we're very confident in our ability to execute.
and like i said, it's early, and we want to make sure that we're being prudent as we look forward to the year.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
maybe just my second question. you did get attractive reimbursement for t-detect covid. what are you seeing with respect to demand there? i think you talked about ebbs and flows related to variants. but do you see that being a material product here in 2022? and how should we think about that test sort of being any type of read through to any other products in your franchise?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah. that's a really good question. i mean first and foremost, i think it was great that we were acknowledged by cms for this important use case in covid. we are currently enabling the software infrastructure for the reimbursed product.
it is important to note though that the new rate hasn't started yet, and we're assessing our path forward in light of really the changing nature of the pandemic. as i mentioned on the comments related to guidance, this isn't a very significant portion of the revenue profile of the year, and we're being extremely prudent in monitoring kind of what's going on in the pandemic. as far as a read-through, remember the covid test is an eua, and it gave us a lot of experience in launching a test to consumers. we're going to leverage some of that consumer-related experience.
but for the future tests -- the test case for kind of lyme and going forward and setting us up for the franchise and the launch of the ibd panel in 2023. what we're looking to do is really get that whole machinery and infrastructure in place, and we're building that out over the course of the year so that we can rapidly deploy tests up on the system in a clear environment to generate data and to be able to launch test with a extremely high specificity and increasing sensitivity that have a high positive predictive value to patients.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
and sorry, just a quick follow-up to the guidance question. i know you talked about how q1 will be the low watermark for the year. but in q1 of 2021, you did grow sequentially. so can you just help us determine whether or not you expect to grow sequentially in q1 '22?
kyle piskel -- interim chief financial officer
yeah. i mean -- this is kyle. q1 2021 was a little bit of a difficult comp for us. we had $7 million in milestones recognized during that year and also a little bit of pull through, which we typically see at the end of the year from our pharma business in q1 '21.
so while q1 of 2022 is kind of sequentially stable to q4 of 2021, we're still expecting to see modest growth in the sequencing line and roughly flat again on the development line with no milestones anticipated.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
ok. that's it for me. thanks, guys.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thank you, mark.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brian weinstein of william blair. your line is open.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys. how are you doing? thanks for taking the questions. so obviously, you talked about the mrd and the immune medicine kind of characterization. but is that mostly an external reporting mechanism? or can you just talk about how the business is being structured internally if there's been any changes in terms of how you're structuring it along these lines and if it's changing kind of the way that you're thinking about investments here? or is this strictly just an external kind of reporting mechanism?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, brian, for the question. actually, it's both external and internal. what we're trying to do in terms of providing clarity externally. at the same time, we're trying to create very focused teams around the different business areas for businesses that really fit together.
and so if you think about it, mrd pharma and clonoseq really fit together. and at the same time, all of the underlying mapping data that supports all of the opportunities in immune medicine under really kind of that t-cell franchise, all fit together. and so we're not only looking to align our revenues to these business areas. we're also looking to align organizationally so that we can better prosecute and be focused and nimble against these opportunities.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
great. and then as a follow-up, on the mrd, the $330 million, obviously, you guys aren't going to talk about who the partners are. you said that i think you had 60 or so of them. but can you just give us an idea about kind of the sizes that some of these potentially could be in the timing that some of the more important ones might readout? i recognize that your risk adjusting things in your guidance.
but is there any kind of additional light that you can shed on kind of the makeup of that $330 million at this point?
kyle piskel -- interim chief financial officer
yeah. this is kyle again. i'd say think of the basket of milestones of $330 million is being one-third relating to secondary endpoints and two-thirds of them relating to primary endpoints. we've got access to the secondary endpoints right now.
and that's what you're seeing run through in our top-line numbers and expect us to continue to see that this year and on to the next year. and then once our pharma partners get access to enabling these primary endpoints, we expect to see the rest of that two-thirds kind of unlock and start to fall into our top line.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
ok. i guess i'll just leave it there. thanks so much, guys.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, brian.
operator
thank you. and next, we have derik de bruin of bank of america. your line is open.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. so -- a few questions. so what's embedded in your guide for clinical testing volumes? last year, at this time, you talked about doubling clinical volumes in '21, obviously, the pandemic sort of stymied those plans.
but i'd love to know sort of what you're embedding in the guide for volume?
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
yes. so this is nitin. i'll take that question. so despite covid, we had strong growth in 2021.
we grew 48%, our hcps that ordering the test grew 57%. and as a result, we decided to expand our sales team because all the leading indicators for the business are very positive. good news is we've completed the hiring and we're deploying the expanded sales team, where we've doubled the size of the sales team. and 2022 is off to a good start with actually we have very strong performance in january.
so i'm confident of our strong position the momentum we're seeing, and i expect that our growth trajectory will actually increase in 2022. and we also have a lot of other things outside in the industry that are acting as catalysts. for example, in cll, we're seeing the adoption -- a greater adoption of six-duration therapy. these therapies require measurement of depth of response.
and obviously, mrd is the choice to do so. in multiple myeloma, we're seeing clinical data reading out right now that allows mrd-directed de-escalation of therapy. that's another catalyst. and then finally, in non-hodgkin's lymphoma, medicare is providing a path for reimbursement, which i think will be a longer-term catalyst.
so overall, i expect 2022 to grow stronger than 2021, and we actually expect, given our penetration to have growth in -- even beyond 2022 into 2023 and 2024.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
right. yes. but ultimately, i mean, when you report next quarter, are you going to give us a volume number? because ultimately, that's one of the metrics that street's going to look at.
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
yep. yep. we will give volume numbers.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah. and derik, as part of that breakup of the businesses, that is one of the things that comes -- will be kind of output of that is that we'll be able to provide volume numbers around the business.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and are you going to -- does anything change historically just from sort of how we should think about -- thinking about the volumes between the clinical and the pharma business?
kyle piskel -- interim chief financial officer
no, i wouldn't think anything historically change. you're just going to get an additional dimension to look at mrd and aggregate across our clonoseq business and our pharma business.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. so why the gross margin has been down quite a bit the last couple of quarters. i mean does that expect to sort of like creep back up? or does it stay sort of like pressure at these levels in the 60s?
kyle piskel -- interim chief financial officer
i mean some of that's a reflection of the milestone timing. and i'd say, expect to see modest improvement, especially as we're accessing more of our mrd pharma revenues, which have higher asp price points over the year. so i wouldn't expect big swings over the periods outside of when we see milestone revenues land in the p&l.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. i noticed on your catalyst chart, there wasn't anything called out for line. what's the pathway on that and '22?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. for t-detect lyme, remember, just to frame this, this has been a great technical proof point of the platform. and it's going to have a -- while it does have a minimal revenue contribution in it's really key to building the foundation of our clia related infrastructure to be able to enable one blood test for multiple answers. so not only are we building a lab, we're building all the software and data infrastructure to be able to essentially launch test after test through the exact same system.
and so what we're doing is learning how to update and improve the classifier as we continue to generate more data disease-by-disease. so we are going to launch in lyme, and this is going to be a patient-directed physician ordered consumer test to begin with, and then we're going to aggregate that data and increase sensitivity over time. we'll launch first in the acute setting, but the goal here is to get into the larger segment of the post-treatment lyme disease setting, which that enables us to access a larger testing population. so we're still kind of finalizing the pricing and kind of moving forward under that premise.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and just one more, if i can. so how do we monitor from the genentech standpoint on obviously, the candidate was selected? maybe that was a little bit more. the news around that was a little bit more muted than we had anticipated.
i thought there might have been a little bit more information on that. how should we sort of think about the can selection and some of the other packages? and just how do we sort of monitor the progress of this? like what's the -- what are the obligations, if any, from genentech to sort of disclosed?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. so just to frame it, genentech selected the tcr candidate to move forward. it's against a neoantigen which is expressed in tumors and not on healthy tissue. so there's inherently a better safer safety profile associated with that type of antigen.
and -- so genentech will determine kind of the timing to advance its first cell candidate forward into the clinic with certain goals in mind. so they're going to have to demonstrate the kind of manufacturability of the product. and they also have kind of further work to do in terms of ensuring safety and administration to the kind of the patient population. so we're working kind of closely together to do more of that kind of end-to-end testing.
and then further this year, we have a whole library of candidates, and we're going to aim to submit an additional kind of two data packages to genentech this year. we can't disclose the targets, but we could -- there is a potential that we could have several stack milestones over the next few years that are associated with the product -- sorry, with the program, i should say.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. and next, we have tejas savant of morgan stanley. your line is open.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. this is yuko on for tejas. thank you for taking our question. with investments behind the clonoseq sales force, would you elaborate on the magnitude in which the increased sales force would expand on your existing call points? or is it more that there will be increase in the frequency of calling on those physicians?
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
yes. so we -- as i said, we are doubling the size of our sales team. we'll have around 70 or so individuals are doing two things. one is deepening our penetration in the existing accounts we have, primarily in the academic setting.
so that's there, they will be increasing the frequency with which they call out to physicians and expand the number of physicians that we had into those accounts. and then the second part of the sales team is going to be focused on adding new accounts, primarily in the community setting. so we'll be doing both activities deepening the penetration of the accounts we already have and then adding existing -- or adding new accounts in the community setting.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. that was super helpful. and then one more. regarding the nhl opportunity for clonoseq, would you comment on the current practice regarding minimal visual disease monitoring in dlbcl? is this a market that you expect would likely need to need to invest in to build awareness?
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
yes. so in terms of the use of mrd in non-hodgkin's lymphoma or in dlbcl, this is certainly behind in myeloma and cll. but the adoption or the clinical need is increasing as evidenced by the fact that medicare provided a path for reimbursement. however, a lot more clinical evidence needs to be generated to drive adoption.
and we will be investing in clinical studies to demonstrate the use of mrd in dlbcl.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thank you.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thank you.
operator
thank you. next, we have tycho peterson of j.p. morgan. your line is open.
rachel vatnsdal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. this is rachel on for tycho. so first up, on t-detect, can you just share your latest development progress with crohn's and celiacs. so what are the latest milestones that we should watch for? and then what is the timeline for launching t-detect gi syndromic panel?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yeah. hey, rachel. thanks for the question. yes.
so again, what we're focused is really on launching a test with a very high positive predictive value, which means that we have to set the sense the specificity very, very high and then increase the sensitivity over time. so for ibd, which is the furthest advanced, we are planning on launching a test next year to a set of patients with shared symptoms. we completed so far 5,000 ibd samples and confirmed in ileal crohn's and have signals in colonic crohn's and ulcerative colitis. so we're looking at a specificity in the 99.5% range and then improving the sensitivity all through this year is really the goal is to increase those metrics.
and we are launching a clinical validation study that we're preparing for, and we're going to be launching that this year and preparing for a launch in 2023. so we're looking at a kind of two- to four-year diagnostic path for patients. we have four to five kinds of specialist business and thousands of dollars for these patients to get diagnosed. and we're really looking to essentially eliminate or significantly reduce that diagnostic odyssey kind of by launching this path forward in ibd.
rachel vatnsdal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. and then it's good to hear about the decision to go forward with the tcr candidate with genentech. but to clarify, can you just say, are you guys progressing to ind ready for that candidate or not?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
can you repeat that last part?
rachel vatnsdal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. if you guys are progressing to the investigational new drug application for the tcr candidate with genentech?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
there's a lot of steps as we prepare for -- to have a successful clinical trial. but certainly, that's the direction we're all moving in. yes.
rachel vatnsdal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
sounds good. and then last one for me. just on clonoseq, can you give us an update on how your conversations have been going with private payers? and then does guidance assume any additional traction with private payers this year?
nitin sood -- chief commercial officer
yeah. so i think, as you know, we have about 240 million covered lives for multiple myeloma and for all. in terms of increasing coverage, we're very heavily focused on cll, where we have about 150 million covered lives. further, we are engaged in conversations with private payers to really improve the collection rate we have, and our focus is going to be to drive increase in asp.
so the expectation is a mid-single-digit increase in overall asp in 2022.
rachel vatnsdal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from salveen richter of goldman sachs. your line is open.
elizabeth webster -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. good afternoon. thank you for taking our question. this is elizabeth on for salveen.
just regarding the guidance to deliver the two additional tcr data packages by year-end for the shared program. i guess could you just comment on the key learnings ahead of this, given the first candidate was selected to move forward? and then just your general thoughts on how the program maybe a little bit derisked at this point? and just how you're thinking of this as a derisking event?
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
sure. this is harlan. i'll take that. so for the -- both with this -- so we're -- for now, we're staying away from naturally occurring targets in the human genome so that we're derisking the safety profile, and that will continue for our other share our other targets as well, the two other data packages that we're going to deliver.
we've i know we don't get to communicate that much, but we've -- the team has been working really hard behind the scenes and we've generated a very large number of t-cell receptors against a wide variety of targets and our and been working hand in hand with genentech. so we've learned quite a bit about what's acceptable to them and also what we find acceptable to move forward and i think has the best chance of really being able to help patients with cancer. so i'd say the program is certainly is derisking as we go as we improve our technology and learn more. hello? i think we lost you.
elizabeth webster -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. yeah. that was our question.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
ok. thank you.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the adaptive biotechnologies fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings results conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, ms. karina calzadilla, investor relations at adaptive, ms.
calzadilla, the floor is yours.
karina calzadilla -- investor relations
thank you, chris, and good afternoon, everyone. i would like to welcome you to adaptive biotechnologies fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. earlier today, we issued a press release reporting adaptive financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. the press release is available at adaptivebiotech.com.
we are conducting a live webcast of this call and will be referencing to a slide presentation that has been posted to the investor's section in our corporate website. during the call, management will make projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. these statements reflect management's current perspective of the business as of today. actual results may differ materially from today's forward-looking statements, depending on a number of factors, which are set forth in our public filings with the sec and listed in this presentation.
in addition, non-gaap financial measures will be discussed during the call and a reconciliation from non-gaap to gaap metrics can be found in our earnings release. joining the call today are chad robins, our ceo and co-founder; and kyle piskel, our interim chief financial officer. in addition, harlan robins, adaptive's chief scientific officer and co-founder; and nitin sood, our chief commercial officer, will be available for q&a. with that, i will turn the call over to chad robins.
chad? 
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, karina. good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. as always, i want to thank all of our adaptive employees for their dedication, flexibility, and strong execution during another challenging year as we continue to adjust to the changing dynamics of the workplace. 2021 was a year of key achievements for adaptive, which set a solid base for many upcoming catalysts in 2022.
indeed, we are off to a great start with genentech's selection of our tcr candidate targeting a shared cancer neoantigen to progress as a potential therapeutic product candidate, which i'll discuss later in the call. before i go into our annual performance details and upcoming milestones, i'd like to address an important initiative we communicated at the jpmorgan conference. as shown on slide 3, to effectively allocate capital and drive growth, going forward, we will discuss adaptive around two key and distinct business areas. mrd and immune medicine.
the mrd business is comprised of our clonoseq diagnostic test offered to clinicians and the clonoseq assay offered to our pharma partners to support drug development and approvals. the immune medicine business is comprised of drug discovery, research, and diagnostics, driven by our t-cell mapping efforts with microsoft. this includes genentech, nykode, the t-detect franchise, and immunoseq tmap. we aim to begin reporting revenues based on these two business areas by next quarter.
turning to slide 4. you can see the significant progress we made throughout the year. despite the impact from covid variance, we delivered strong growth and ended the year with $154.3 million in revenue, up 57% versus 2020. the revenue in the fourth quarter grew 26%.
in our mrd business, we expanded our clonoseq sales team, which will be fully trained and in the field by mid-year. and we launched an enhanced version of the clonoseq assay for cll patients, which provides additional mutation status information at the time of diagnosis. in addition, multiple clinical studies were published, demonstrating clinical utility of clonoseq for patients. we continue to be the mrd test of choice in pharma clinical trials having signed two major pan-portfolio agreements in 2021.
regulatory milestones from our partnership started to accelerate with $10 million in recognized revenue during the year. we also achieved important milestones in our immune medicine business. as mentioned, on the shared program, genentech has selected a prioritized tcr candidate to progress as a therapeutic product. throughout the year, we also made significant progress on the personalized product.
and successfully completed initial proof of concept in which we identified tumor-specific tcrs using blood from about 60 cancer patients. another key achievement was the extension of our drug discovery capabilities into vaccines with our nykode collaboration. this is the first time that our t-cell data will be used to inform the design and development of a t-cell-based vaccine. nykode has initiated its phase 1/2 clinical trial for sars-cov-2 and we expect data in the first half of this year.
importantly, adaptive technology may inform the design of a new class of t-cell-based vaccines to treat different diseases. we also made great progress in our t-detect franchise, highlighted by the emergency use authorization of t-detect covid. this is the first t-cell-based test authorized by the fda and clearly marked an important strategic milestone for t-detect. we also completed the immunesense lyme study, which is the first clinical validation study successfully conducted by adaptive.
we expect to enable t-detect lyme in our clia lab offering during lyme season and to leverage our consumer pay experience that we learned from t-detect covid. in autoimmune disorders, we identified four signals demonstrating the applicability of our technology in this hard-to-diagnose class of diseases. lastly, i'd like to touch on the important traction of our t-map covid product, which is being used by multiple pharma partners such as j&j, astrazeneca, and moderna to understand the t-cell response to coved vaccines. this is just the beginning of our ability to leverage mapping data as a product for pharma to understand the immune response across diseases.
now i'm going to provide more details on our business, starting with mrd on slide 5. there is a strong synergy between clinical adoption and the inclusion of clonoseq in pharma drug development trials. the integration of clonoseq and pharma trials increases the value of mrd for clinicians to make therapy decisions and raises awareness of clones validation and sensitivity. at the same time, the adoption of clonoseq in clinical practice drives its inclusion as an endpoint in pharma clinical trials.
both clinical testing and pharma partnerships achieved significant growth and traction during 2021. for the full year, tests delivered grew 48% to 22,516 tests. ordering healthcare providers and ordering accounts experienced significant growth of 57% and 32%, respectively, versus 2020 and approximately 28% of all tests were done in the blood. during the last few weeks of december, we experienced a slowdown with the intersection of the omicron surge in the holidays.
however, we have seen an uptake in january and anticipate that our commercial investments, data readouts, and expansion of our commercial offering will enable us to overcome last year's headwinds such that we accelerate our growth trajectory in 2022. we began expanding the sales team with a focus of reaching the community setting. our goal is to have the sales team fully built out and trained by midyear, which will allow us to deepen our penetration in academic centers and increase our reach into the community. as part of our growth strategy to increase blood-based testing and expand indications, we are seeking medicare coverage for diffuse large b-cell lymphoma.
it is important to note that clonoseq for multiple myeloma and nhl in blood are already available through our clia offering. on the pharma side, our clonoseq assay is currently being used in 155 active trials by more than 60 pharma companies. importantly, we're embedded across all phases of clinical development and use as a clinical endpoint across multiple indications with different drug modalities. through these partnerships, in addition to the per-sample sequencing revenue, we also have access to more than $330 million in regulatory milestones.
now let's turn to immune medicine business on slide 6. we have been building the necessary capabilities to identify and map t-cell receptors to disease-specific antigens that serve as a source code for t-detect, pharma partnerships, and our drug discovery efforts. we validated this platform strategy with our covid efforts and are now organizing our teams to repeat the success in other infectious diseases and in autoimmune disorders. slide 7 shows the most advanced indications for t-detect, their progress, and next steps.
during 2021, over 30,000 consumers ordered a t-detect covid test. for the most part, orders followed the course of the pandemic with significant increases during variant surges. we will continue to offer the test to consumers with modest promotional activities to maintain awareness and monitored demand behaviors as the pandemic evolves. to increase the value proposition in a potential endemic state, we're working with vaccine manufacturers to generate correlate of protection data and other measures of efficacy.
we're in direct communication with the fda to determine the best path forward, and we will continue to provide updates as the data progresses. 2021 was a year of signal generation in the autoimmune space for t-detect. we first confirmed a t-cell signal specific to ileal crohn's and demonstrated t-cells were distinct from those that recognize colitis. this data is being presented at the european crohn's and colitis organization scientific conference this week.
we also completed the analysis of over 5,000 ibd samples, which supported encouraging signal identification in colonic crohn's and colitis. in addition to ibd, we confirmed a signal in multiple sclerosis and have identified an early signal in rheumatoid arthritis. it's important to understand that our tcr classifiers get more sensitive as the sample size increases. our focus this year is to improve these autoimmune signals by significantly increasing sensitivity while maintaining extremely high specificity in order that we minimize false positives.
to that end, we're in the final stages of designing our protocol to initiate clinical validation in ibd. we believe autoimmune disorders represent a large market opportunity for differentiated clinical diagnostics and a meaningful opportunity to inform drug development with our pharma partners. lastly, slide 8 shows progress in our cell therapy collaboration with genentech. we continue to make good progress with both our shared and private programs.
regarding our share program, we delivered efficacy and safety data for a tcr candidate that targets a shared cancer neoantigen. following a review of data generated by bolt adaptive and genentech using this tcr candidate, genentech recently selected this neoantigen-specific tcr. also, this year, we're on track to deliver the genentech up to two additional tcr data packages. in our private program, following successful initial proof-of-concept screens.
this year, we aim to centralize, test, and optimize the personalized process using additional cancer patient samples in our purpose-built south san francisco lab. we continue to work closely with genentech to establish the private product specifications and build our private product data package. the personalized data that we generate this year with genentech will define early product development. i'll now pass it over to kyle piskel for our financial update.
kyle piskel -- interim chief financial officer
thanks, chad. i'll first review our fourth quarter financial results, briefly describe our full year financial performance, and then we'll provide an outlook for 2022. . turning to slide 9. total revenue in the fourth quarter was $37.9 million, representing a 26% increase from $30.2 million in the same period last year.
our revenue mix for the fourth quarter consisted of 61% of our revenues coming from sequencing and 39% coming from development. sequencing revenue in the fourth quarter was $23.1 million, an increase of 81% for the same period in 2020. growth in sequencing revenue was driven primarily by a $6.5 million increase in revenue generated from our pharma customers and a $3.3 million increase in revenue generated from our clinical customers. research sequencing volume increased to 9,510 sequences delivered up 61% from 5,907 sequences delivered in the fourth quarter of 2020.
clinical sequencing volume excluding t-detect covid, increased 41% to 6,356 clinical tests delivered in the fourth quarter of 2021 versus prior year. development revenue was $14.9 million in the fourth quarter, down 15% for the same period last year due to lower amortization of the genentech upfront payment. shifting now to our operating costs. total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $99.5 million, representing a 34% increase from $74.4 million in the same quarter last year.
cost of revenue was $14.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $6.2 million for the fourth quarter last year, representing a 131% increase. higher cost of revenue was primarily driven by an increase in material costs due to volume growth and an increase in labor and overhead expenses. research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $34.7 million compared to $35.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing a 3% decrease. this decrease was mainly attributed to lower material costs and production volume, partially offset by increased personnel costs.
sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $26.7 million, compared to $18.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 44%. this growth was primarily driven by an expansion in the clonoseq organization and commercial support. general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $23.3 million, compared to $13.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 74%. the increase was primarily driven by an expansion of our overall facility footprint and higher depreciation expenses as well as growth in headcount, personnel costs, and consultant expenses.
net loss for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $61.4 million, compared to fourth quarter 2020 net loss of $44.6 million. adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $44.9 million, compared to a loss of $34.6 million in the same period last year. quickly turning now to our annual financial results for 2021. total revenue was $154.3 million, representing a 57% increase from $98.4 million in 2020.
our revenue mix consisted of 51% of our revenues coming from sequencing and 49% from development. sequencing revenue in 2021 was $78.9 million, an increase of 90% from 2020. research sequencing volume increased by 42% to 32,146 sequences delivered versus 2020. clinical sequencing volume excluding t-detect covid, increased by 48% to 22,516 clinical tests delivered compared to prior year.
development revenue grew to $75.4 million in 2021, up 32% from last year. the increase was largely due to growth in revenue generated from our genentech collaboration and a $7.5 million increase in revenue recognized from milestones related to our mrd pharma partners. operating expenses for the year totaled $363.3 million, representing a 45% increase from $251.2 million in 2020. the largest driver of opex growth on an absolute dollar basis of sales and marketing, which grew by $34.1 million, up 56% from prior year.
this was mainly due to additional personnel costs. we also saw increased investments made in clonoseq and t-detect marketing efforts. full year 2021 net loss was $207.3 million, compared to $146.2 million in the prior year. adjusted ebitda for 2021 was a loss of $151.7 million, compared to a loss of $119.6 million in 2020.
we ended the year with approximately $570 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and we have no debt. with respect to our outlook for 2022 on slide 10, we expect full year revenue to be in the range of $185 million to $195 million. at the midpoint of the range, we anticipate our sequencing and development mix to be approximately 60-40. this would represent growth in the mid-40% range for sequencing revenues versus prior year and roughly flat year over year for development events.
our development revenue is largely comprised of the amortization of the $300 million upfront from our genentech partnership, which we expect at similar levels to 2021. it also includes potential milestones in the low to mid-teens millions that are available to us this year from our various pharma partners. with respect to trends over the year, we expect q1 to be the low watermark. this is mainly due to normal seasonality, coupled with an omicron overhang from q4 and no anticipated milestones during the quarter.
in addition, the growth in our sequencing business is expected to be back-half weighted as our expanded clonoseq sales force hits its stride around midyear. regarding our operating expenses, we expect full year opex growth to be in the mid-to-high single-digit range from our fourth quarter 2021 run rate level. this deceleration in spend reflects the significant investments we made last year, which will continue to support our core growth initiatives as we continue to ramp the business. we are being thoughtful about our cash and expect to deploy capital off our balance sheet to support those projects with the greatest potential while consistently growing revenues faster than expenses.
with that, i'll hand it back over to chad.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, kyle. as you heard during the call and shown on slide 11, 2022 is expected to be a catalyst-filled year with multiple shots on goal across both our mrd and immune medicine businesses. we're off to a running start, and i'm confident in the success of our business as we continue to execute and demonstrate the capabilities of our platform. with that, i'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and open it up for questions.
",2021-Q4,ADPT
,,,,":
operator
thank you, sir. [operator instructions]. and we have your first question from brian weinstein with william blair. your line is open.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. i just want to go through the growth rates here a little bit because i know there are some moving parts here, it seems like, in the quarter because you posted basically flattish growth.
but kyle or chad, can one of you guys just go through some of the factors that kind of drove that flattish growth? i heard some genentech stuff that was in there and some other things that might have sort of impacted that growth rate on a onetime basis. i just want to make sure that we understand what those things were.
kyle piskel -- interim chief financial officer
sure. i'll take that, brian. i'd kind of first like to start with the two main components that drive a bit of quarter-to-quarter comparative challenges. the first being the mrd milestones -- and just as a reminder, in q1 of last year, we had approximately 7 million in milestones from our mrd business.
and this quarter, we have 3 million. so you're seeing $4 million in compression there from a comp perspective. the second component is the genentech amortization, and comparing that to last quarter last year, we had about 16 million versus this quarter where we're up about 12 million. so those two things kind of really compress the growth.
and if you back those out, you'd see about 47% year-over-year growth. so that's kind of driving some of that uptick issue. 
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
and when we think about the genentech amortization, it's always somewhat of a black box for us, i think. how should we be thinking about that going forward? i mean just so that we're level set here so that we can sort of back that stuff out in -- with a little bit more visibility. it's always somewhat confusing for us.
kyle piskel -- interim chief financial officer
yes, i'd say for the -- it's tied to our expense investment in the genentech collaboration, i'd say. for the remainder of the full year, we're still on track to be about the same total revenues last year, maybe a little bit of a bell curve this year through q2 and q3 and then come back down a little bit in q4. but overall, i'd say it will be fairly consistent to last year.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
got it. and then, chad, for you, obviously, the markets are very focused on pushes toward profitability, cash flow breakeven. i don't think you guys have given kind of formal talks about that, but i'd love to kind of have some sort of path that you guys are thinking about toward profitability, the steps that you guys think that you'll need to take. and any thoughts on timing there?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. so first, i'll just acknowledge that the path to profitability and at least cash flow neutrality is incredibly important for us at adaptive. and we -- i think we got out ahead of it earlier, early this year and took proactive steps with doing the restructuring and the reduction in force. we continue to look at ways to manage expenses, and at the same time, look -- we're looking at opportunities to bring in, what i'll call, nondilutive cash flow through different partnership and financing mechanisms.
look, let's face it. the cost of capital is high right now, and we're kind of on a path to do what we can so that we don't have to take in capital that will be dilutive to the company in this economic environment. that said, too, with tycho coming on board, we were really sharpening that long-range plan and should have better visibility into that time horizon to get to kind of cash flow profitability and should be providing that for you within the back half of the year. 
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
ok. thanks, guys.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure. thanks, brian.
operator
we have your next question from salveen richter with goldman sachs. your line is open.
elizabeth webster -- goldman sachs -- analyst
this is elizabeth on for salveen. thanks for taking my question. just on the genentech, maybe if you could kind of walk us through what might be needed for the private product specification and what you kind of aim to deliver this year. and just maybe remind us what goes into those data packages.
thank you.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure, i'm going to have sharon benzeno, who's head of our immune medicine business, take the call. sharon?
sharon benzeno -- head of the immune medicine business
yes. thanks, elizabeth. so as we've previously stated, and on the heels of our successful proof-of-concept screens using a blood from 60 cancer patients last year, that was the first path at designing certain specifications that we're carrying through this year and expanding that in an additional set of 30 or more cancer patients as well. and so the goal there is, importantly, running the end-to-end workflow on our end in our dedicated san francisco lab end-to-end.
and in parallel in conjunction with the pieces of the puzzle that genentech is putting together, the process being in the product. so that's where we're aiming this year, building off of the success from last year. 
elizabeth webster -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you. that is helpful.
operator
we have your next question from mark massaro with btig. your line is open.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for the questions. if i can, i'll ask two all at once. i guess first, nice growth from clonoseq this quarter.
can you just comment on your visibility of what you're seeing in the field? are you guys fully open nearly to prepandemic levels? and maybe just comment about what kind of access you have, reps in the field versus virtual? and then the second question is, on slide 17, you show you've got crohn's and ms and celiac kind of in the lead for your autoimmune diseases. should we think of those as like the lead candidates? i guess what my question really boils down to is to what extent are you committed to advancing and investing in ra? obviously, crohn's and colitis are linked. so can you just help us think about the priorities of the autoimmune disease portfolio? 
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure. mark, i'm going to have nitin sood, head of our mrd business, take the first question. and then with regard to prioritization, harlan will take that. so, nitin?
nitin sood -- head of the mrg business
mark, yes, so we're seeing an improvement in in-person meetings. it's trending in a positive direction. but i would say today, still about 60% of our visits are virtual. but on a day-to-day basis, on a week-to-week basis, we see a positive trend, and i expect us to be sort of 50% very shortly in terms of in-person visits.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
ok. and then just on the priority of the autoimmune disease portfolio.
harlan robins -- chief scientific officer and co-founder
sure. thanks. this is harlan. so we're focusing our resources where our signals are most advanced, and we have the highest quality samples for early diagnosis of disease.
and of course, having a high unmet need, we prioritized ms and crohn's higher than ra simply because we have -- we're a little bit further behind in collecting those ra samples, not for any other particular reason. and the key -- the real key that we're focusing on is our -- as our differentiator is specificity here. so just as a reference, we're aiming to really reduced the number of false positives so that we can hit an earlier diagnostic market. and so that's really been the focus, and that's where we've had the biggest increase in our signals as we go.
and we're going to take the learnings from this and apply it into other diseases as we create panels and, in particular, for ibd, as we're going to initiate a sample collection for a clinical validation study in the coming months.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
we have your next question from derik de bruin with bank of america.  your line is open. excuse me, derick, your line is open. you may ask your question.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
let's go on to the next question.
operator
we have your next question from tejas savant with morgan stanley. your line is open.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hello. this is yuko on the call for tejas. thank you for taking our questions. would you elaborate on the plans to reduce the workforce? are the reduction mostly in administrative, overhead, r&d, or commercial? what projects are you prioritizing? and should we anticipate any delays in key time lines as it relates to clonoseq inflection, expansion into dlbcl? any color around that would be great.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes, sure. yuko, i'll take that. so first, we -- there was many areas affected across the business, but it wasn't uniformly distributed. for example, there were very, very few cuts in the mrd business.
so to your questions about kind of dlbcl or any of the kind of project development pipeline, it's all on track. an additional -- in addition, the -- kind of the cell therapy group in san francisco had very little cuts. so there were cuts across kind of general and administration, project management and, frankly, some kind of duplicative or stacked hiring as well that we had an opportunity where we thought we could gain some efficiencies and leverage in the existing business. so we're moving forward.
and as harlan said, we're being very, very clinical, if you will, to use a pun here, on how we're prioritizing the t-detect program. and we're also being very opportunistic about continued investments for example, in covid, given that's taken more of an endemic state. and we've seen kind of the t-detect orders kind of wane as covid kind of becomes more normalized in the population. so hopefully, that's helpful color to you in terms of kind of how we looked at the reduction in force and prioritization. 
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. no, that's super helpful. and then on the product development expansion efforts into nhl, could you walk us through the rationale for using cell-free dna? is there a specific advantage to using cell-free dna in nhl versus some of the other indications? and could this be a strategy that you would like to deploy on a go-forward basis?
nitin sood -- head of the mrg business
yes. so i'll ask the question -- answer that question. this is nitin. specifically for dlbcl, there have been studies that have been published that demonstrate that cell-free dna is a better [inaudible].
but for other diseases, namely cll, all, and multiple myeloma, our cellular assay does really well. so on an ongoing basis, i don't expect any changes on those three indications, but for non-hodgkin's lymphoma and more specifically for dlbcl, we're going with the like we know has the best performance. and longer term, we'll also look at potentially combining both the analytes, namely the cell free dna analyze and the cellular assay. obviously, we're the one company that can do both.
so we'll potentially look at combining both the analytes.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you so much for that color.
operator
we have your next question from derik de bruin with bank of america. your line is open.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
sorry about that. my phone droid earlier. can you give us some color on the asps for clonoseq? i mean you didn't break out the clinical sequencing revenues like historically. so can you give us some idea on coverage on just the asp and sort of data just to give us a little bit more clarity?
nitin sood -- head of the mrg business
yes. so i think -- this is nitin again. we've seen steady asp growth for clonoseq over the past couple of years, and we're anticipating that the growth will continue in the mid-single-digit range over the next two to three years. we're very close to about $1,000 in asp today.
and our expectation is, in two to three years, we're in the $1,200 to $1,300 range for asp.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and i know this was asked earlier, but i just want to go back and revisit it. i mean, do you expect -- i mean, the cash burn was quite a bit higher in the first quarter. do you expect that to ramp down throughout the rest of the year? basically it's a question on do you have enough cash this year.
kyle piskel -- interim chief financial officer
this is kyle. yes, so a couple of things in q1. obviously, you don't have the full effect of our restructuring efforts and the cash burn because of the timing of when we initiated that was late march. the second thing as it relates to q1, a bit of seasonality, we have our corporate bonus payouts in q1.
so from a cash perspective, i'm generally thinking of the rest of the three quarters is between 50 and 60 million is cash burn.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you. that's helpful. and i guess any -- and i'm sorry, and did you talk about when you expect to see the nhl assay to be commercialized? i know you're in validation and clear validation now?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. with respect to nhl, we're going to launch that later this year in our clia environment. we've submitted our tech assessment to moldx and are waiting to hear back on reimbursement. but as with many of our diagnostics and our assays, we'll launch ahead of reimbursement toward kind of the back half of the year.
i mean it's currently available in our clia environment with a cellular assay. but we've got -- as mentioned earlier, we've got product development efforts on -- i'm going to convert that to incorporate ctdna into the assay as well for -- to enhance the product.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks.
nitin sood -- head of the mrg business
just one more item to that is before ahead of that launch, we'll be doing what we call a clinical experience program with 30 physicians. so that's already underway. and we're pretty confident that, by october, november of this year, we'll have a full commercial launch with [inaudible] ctdna assay by october of this year.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the adaptive biotechnologies first quarter 2022 financial results conference call. [operator instructions]. i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, karina calzadilla, head of investor relations. please go ahead, ma'am.
karina calzadilla -- head of investor relations
thank you, alexandre, and good afternoon, everyone. i would like to welcome you to adaptive biotechnologies first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. earlier today, we issued a press release reporting adaptive financial results for the first quarter of 2022. the press release is available at www.adaptivebiotech.com.
we are conducting a live webcast of this call and will be referencing to a slide presentation that has been posted to the investors section in our corporate website. during the call, management will make projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. these statements reflect management's current perspective of the business as of today. actual results may differ materially from today's forward-looking statements, depending on a number of factors, which are set forth in our public filings with the sec and listed in this presentation.
joining the call today are chad robins, our ceo and co-founder; and kyle piskel, our interim chief financial officer. in addition, harlan robins, adaptive chief scientific officer and co-founder; nitin sood, head of our mrg business; and sharon benzeno, head of the immune medicine business, will be available for q&a. with that, i'll turn the call to chad robins. chad? 
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, karina. good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings call. as always, i want to thank all of our adaptive employees for their dedication and for their solid execution during a quarter in which we completed the reorganization of our business. this strategic restructuring focuses adaptive in two business areas: mrd and immune medicine.
along with our recent head count reduction, these changes will result in a more streamlined organization to fuel growth as we navigate this turbulent market. we continue to hire talent strategically in key growth areas, such as our clonoseq sales team and our cell therapy group in south san francisco. we also look forward to formally welcoming our new cfo, tycho peterson, and leveraging his extensive expertise. tycho will officially start on june 1, following completion of his leave.
we have prioritized product development efforts for each business area, and the teams are in place to execute toward our 2022 goals. slide 3 shows the respective key drivers of our mrd and immune medicine businesses. the value of our mrd business is a combination of the clonoseq test offered to clinicians and the clonoseq mrd assay offered to pharma partners who integrate mrd status in their heme malignancy trials. aligning these synergistic components of the mrd business under the same leadership at adaptive will drive execution and enhance visibility.
the immune medicine business is comprised of pharma, clinical testing, and drug discovery, all of which are driven or informed by our t cell receptor antigen map. as with our mrd business, within immune medicine, there is synergistic value between the utility of the information for clinical diagnostics and to pharma partners in research and drug development. as shown on slide 4, our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year with revenue of $38.6 million. both business areas delivered key achievements and are set up for significant growth in 2022 and beyond.
within the mrd business, clonoseq test volume experienced strong growth of 45% versus prior year. the clonoseq sales team of 70 reps is now fully hired, trained and is being deployed to hit the field. progress continues with payers, data generation and guideline expansion. for mrd pharma, we continue to grow our partnerships.
this quarter, we entered into an expanded mrd pan-portfolio partnership with a major pharma partner in multiple myeloma and cll for the use of mrd as a clinical endpoint. the immune medicine business is also delivering on multiple fronts, generating a total of approximately $21 million this quarter. revenues from pharma partners that use immunoseq and data generated from our tcr antigen map grew 100% versus prior year. we are well positioned for continued growth as we expand the use of immunoseq in multiple therapeutic areas and secure additional t-map deals beyond covid.
for example, this quarter, we entered into a new collaboration with j&j to map t cell responses to rsv for its vaccine program. the clinical diagnostic pipeline with t-detect is advancing in both infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. and in drug discovery, we continue to make good progress with our shared and private product programs under our genentech collaboration. moving on to mrd business on slide 5.
tests delivered grew 12% to 7,698 tests versus prior quarter with double-digit growth observed in all three indications. ordering hcps and ordering accounts experienced significant growth of 53% and 36%, respectively, versus prior year. and unique patients tested also grew 59%. growth in the community setting, although off a small base, was north of 60% during the quarter, demonstrating a strong start by our expanded sales force focused on increasing our reach beyond academic centers.
in addition, about 30% of all mrd tests were delivered in blood with multiple myeloma experiencing the highest uptake versus prior periods. as part of our strategy to cement our leadership in lymphoid malignancies, we plan to expand into non-hodgkin's lymphoma using ctdna, which is the best measure of relapse risk. we have submitted our application for dlbcl coverage to moldx this quarter. we continue to enhance the overall customer experience by investing in the integration of clonoseq into customer ordering systems.
this integration can positively impact both order volume and order pull-through. we're off to a great start and on track to accelerate our growth trajectory for the remainder of the year. i want to share on slide 6 new data about using clonoseq in pediatric all patients. in this published study, 143 pediatric all patients receiving car-t were tested for mrd at multiple time points using  flow and clonoseq.
data show that clonoseq detected disease in blood that flow missed in marrow. furthermore, in bone marrow, the performance of clonoseq was very strong closely detected mrd in 100% of patients prior to relapse with a median lead time of 168 days versus 52 days using flow, giving the clinician significant lead time to inform treatment decisions. i look forward to sharing additional data readouts this year, further demonstrating the increasing utility of clonoseq mrd testing. as mentioned before, our mrd pharma partnerships are a key component of our mrd business.
slide 7 shows our pharma portfolio, which is comprised of partnerships with over 60 companies that integrate clonoseq in their clinical trials. as efficacy of blood cancer drugs continue to improve, pharma companies are looking for more sensitive ways to measure response. of note, our clonoseq mrd assay was used as a clinical endpoint in support of regulatory approval of five drugs to date. almost every major pharma company developing a blood cancer drug is using clonoseq in their trials as a clinical endpoint.
from these partnerships, we have a portfolio of more than $330 million in future eligible milestones based on additional drug approval from ongoing and future studies. we continue to grow and expand our pharma partnerships and look forward to seeing clonoseq data derived from these pharma trials to further drive clinical utility of the clonoseq test to clinicians. now turning to our immune medicine business on slide 8. the immune medicine business is comprised of three growth areas: pharma, clinical testing, and drug discovery.
each of these areas has multiple shots on goal to create value in the short, medium, and long term. this value is predominantly driven by data that we generate through our tcr antigen map. the pharma research area, which includes over 100 companies using our immunoseq or t-map products is expected to continue to grow significantly in the short and medium term. the clinical diagnostic area, or t-detect, is in early innings with his first indication launch last year, which also served to establish t-detect as a new class of molecular t cell diagnostics.
we expect t-detect to be a more meaningful contributor to revenue in the medium to long term as we generate and validate t cell signatures in multiple autoimmune disorders with high unmet need. in the drug discovery area, which is currently focused on our cell therapy collaboration with genentech, is in early stages of development and is expected to be a significant growth contributor in the mid to long term. we aim to secure additional collaborations beyond cancer cell therapy that could further accelerate our growth. let's take a closer look on slide 9 at the immune medicine business performance this quarter.
pharma was the biggest contributor of revenue growth in the quarter and represented 30% of the immune medicine business. our immunoseq t-map product is gaining traction with additional covid studies and a new rsv program, which i mentioned. we expect to expand the use of existing and future t-maps in more disease areas as we continue to generate data from our tcr antigen map. as for t-detect covid, this quarter, orders decreased versus last quarter as we are seeing the virus move from a pandemic to an endemic state.
we continue to offer the test to consumers with modest promotional activities to maintain brand awareness. we are focusing on making t-detect lyme available via our clia lab during this lime season while we accelerate data generation and signal validation in select autoimmune disorders. drug discovery revenue is attributed to the amortization of the genentech upfront payment, which varies quarter over quarter. for our shared product this year, we're on track to deliver up to two additional tcr packages.
we also continue to work closely with genentech to establish the private product specifications and to build our private product data package. zooming into t-detect on slide 10. t-detect in infectious diseases has served as a proof of our t-detect platform. further investments in covid and lyme indications will be pursued opportunistically.
specifically, in covid, our efforts to establish the t cell response as a correlate of protection continue. we have been making progress at a policy level. a couple of weeks ago, adaptive alongside a group of nearly 70 leading academics, industry leaders, and patient advocates, sent a letter to the fda urging the incorporation of t cell response and covid vaccine studies. this could further drive opportunities for t-detect and for t-map covid.
we also expect to make t-detect lyme available in the next quarter. data from our immunoseq lyme study shows t-detect sensitivity of 54%, nearly double that of standard of care serology at 30% when we hold specificity at 99% for both. we anticipate this sensitivity to increase as we identify additional lyme-specific tcrs from new data sets that we will use to update our diagnostic classifier. by making t-detect available in our clear lab, we aim to implement the processes, which will be necessary for all future indications.
in parallel, the team is working on initiating a clinical validation study in ibd and continues to improve our signal in ms. our objective is to launch at least one autoimmune indication test by the end of 2023. we're excited about multiple opportunities stemming from our immune medicine business. i'll now pass it over to kyle piskel for a financial update.
kyle? 
kyle piskel -- interim chief financial officer
thanks, chad. turning to our financial results on slide 11. total revenue in the first quarter was 38.6 million, representing a slight increase from 38.4 million in the same period last year. in prior periods, we've disaggregated revenue into sequencing and development categories, as you can see on the left side of the slide.
this quarter, our revenue reporting is now disaggregated to reflect the reorganization of our business around our mrd and immune medicine market opportunities. immune medicine consists of revenue generated from immunoseq and immunoseq t-map to pharma and research customers, our t-detect covid test clinical customers and our collaboration agreements in drug discovery. mrd consists of revenue generated from clonoseq to clinical customers and our mrd services to pharma and research partners. we have included a revenue bridge for the last eight quarters in our earnings release and 10-q to reflect the revised revenue disaggregation.
our revenue mix for the first quarter consisted of 54% from immune medicine and 46% from mrd. immune medicine revenue in the first quarter was 20.8 million, a 4% increase from the same period in 2021. growth in immune medicine was primarily driven by a 3.4 million increase in revenue from our pharma and research partners partially offset by a 3.3 million reduction in the amortization of our genentech upfront payment. as a reminder, these revenue amortization amounts may vary quarter over quarter.
mrd revenue was 17.8 million in the first quarter down 3% from the same period last year. this change was primarily due to recognizing 7 million in regulatory milestones in q1 of 2021 versus 3 million this quarter. this reduction was partially offset by a 3.6 million increase in revenue from clonoseq clinical testing. clonoseq test funds also increased by 45% versus prior year.
shifting now to our operating costs and guidance on slide 12. total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were 101.7 million representing a 28% increase from 79.7 million in the same quarter last year. cost of revenue was 13.2 million during the first quarter of 2022, compared to 10 million for the first quarter last year, representing a 32% increase. higher cost of revenue was primarily driven by an increase in material costs due to revenue sample volume growth and an increase in labor overhead facility in.
research and development expenses for the first quarter of '22 were 37.8 million, compared to 33.8 million in the first quarter of 2021, representing a 12% increase. this increase is mainly attributable to increased personnel costs, including expenses related to our restructuring activities. sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were 26.1 million, compared to 20.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 27%. this growth was largely due to increased personnel costs primarily due to the expansion of our clonoseq field team and related customer operations teams as well as increased travel and customer event-related expenses.
onetime charges from our restructuring efforts contributed to the growth in expenses. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses due to reduced corporate marketing efforts. general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were 24.1 million, compared to 14.9 million in the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 62%. the increase was primarily driven by expanding our overall facility footprint and higher depreciation expenses.
net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was 62.8 million, compared to the first quarter of 2021 net loss of 40.6 million. with respect to our full year guidance, we are reiterating our revenue range of 185 to 195 million, which already contemplated the mrd milestone we recognized this quarter. both our mrd and immune medicine businesses are off to a great start, and we expect them to contribute to our full year revenue approximately 50-50 at the midpoint of the range. although it is early in the year, we are confident on our ability to achieve our full year commercial and [inaudible] goals.
regarding our operating expenses, we are on track for operating expenses to grow at lower rates than revenue as a result of our restructuring activities and as we continue to prudently manage our investments and improve our operating efficiencies. we are being thoughtful about our cash and expect to deploy capital off our balance sheet to support those projects with the greatest potential while also reducing our burn rate. we look forward to providing you further updates next quarter. i'll now turn the call back to chad.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, kyle. as outlined on the call and listed on slide 13, we executed on key strategic decisions around the restructuring of our business and are on track to achieve important milestones during the rest of the year in both mrd and immune medicine. our capital position is strong, and we continue to manage our investments to fuel growth across the businesses. we're looking forward to a great 2022.
so with that, i'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and open it up for questions.
",2022-Q1,ADPT
0.9996,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from brian weinstein with william blair. please proceed with your question.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking the question. at least i don't have to fight with tycho, obviously, on who's going to get the first question anymore here. so that's a positive.
just a question for you on the sharpening of the focus here with immune medicine. i understand prioritizing pharma partnering and sort of discovery opportunities. so can you just talk about what led to doing this now? what really changed? was it the costing? was it time that it was taking for r&d? was it recognizing the commercial path is going to be a little bit more challenging? can you just talk about why now? and then, can you also help us further understand the growth profile of immune medicine absent the t-detect portion as sort of a first question?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. thanks for the question, brian. and just -- i just want to kind of put out there that we remain committed to the vision of t-detect as a single blood test with multiple answers. however, we realized that our near-term path of commercializing disease by disease is challenging and costly.
and at the same time, we have this incredibly rich immune receptor data that will drive growth in our immune medicine business as we kind of continue to strengthen the signals. and as a matter of fact, we're able to -- in many of these pharma deals, we're able to leverage that data to essentially get paid and increase our signals at the same time. so if you look at kind of the capital efficiency of being able to do that, it just -- as we're developing our long-range plan, it just -- it really came into light to sharpen our focus to say this is a much better path as we look toward profitability. and if you take a look at it, i mean, big picture, pharma is actually the fastest-growing segment of our immune medicine business.
it's grown over 100% so far this year, and we expect it to continue to grow at very healthy rates. so while we're deferring the commercialization of t-detect, we're going to continue to monetize what i'll call our higher-margin profile opportunities from our pharma partners using kind of this really rich and unique immune receptor data set. i think it's a much more efficient way to generate strong signals. and essentially, what we're doing is kind of replacing the revenue with a higher margin profile in the near term.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
got it. and you guys talked about having a number of high-value drug discovery opportunities that you were looking at. i mean, is there a way to kind of give us an idea about when we may hear about some of these newer opportunities? are these things that you would be press releasing? are these smaller types of deals that are kind of going on behind the scenes? just what does that kind of pipeline of opportunities to kind of -- to leverage this look like outside of what you've already disclosed?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes, brian. i think it will be a combination of -- with -- as it's warranted, we'll be -- we'll press release deals. and quarter to quarter, again, as appropriate, we'll be filling in where our pharma partners allow for us for disclosure. we'll be talking more and more about the kind of multiple opportunities.
but really, if you look at that pipeline slide, it's really across the spectra from -- everything from -- on the early research side all the way up through the target discovery, drug discovery on the higher-end side.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
ok. and then, last one for me. tycho, i want to confirm what i thought you said was we'll get some idea about profitability time frames and maybe even some thoughts on some of these non-dilutive options that you guys have teased over the last couple of quarters. what -- we should expect to hear something from you on that here in the back half of the year? nothing to comment on other than that at this point?
tycho peterson -- chief financial officer
yes. so on profitability, it's incredibly important. we're in the midst of our kind of three- to five-year long-range planning kind of updating that. and so, we'll communicate more around the path to profitability in the back half of the year, likely on the third quarter call is how we're thinking about that.
and then, on the financing front, yes, we've publicly said and chad reiterated today, we're looking at non-dilutive financing opportunities to extend our cash runway starting from a position of strength. we've got over $450 million to begin with so two years of cash on hand. but we're looking to shore that up, and we'll have more to talk about it when we can communicate. so hopefully sooner rather than later, but i'm not going to put a time line on that.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
got it. ok. thanks.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, brian.
operator
thank you. one moment for our next question. our next question comes from julia qin with j.p. morgan.
your line is now open.
julia qin -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking a question. so to start off on the clonoseq business.
obviously, it's great to see you get expanded coverage for dlbcl. obviously, we know it's a big market, like you talked about. how quickly do you think you can drive that penetration? do you think the uptake will mirror your historical experiences with the other clonoseq indications? or do you think we could potentially see faster uptake maybe benefiting from the expanded sales force? just help us think through the near-term revenue ramp and how that might change your mrd revenue trajectory in the near term.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure, julia. nitin, do you want to take a crack at that?
nitin sood -- head, mrd business
yes. thanks, julia, for that question. yes, look, we're really excited about the dlbcl coverage. it's the most common subtype of non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
and as you've heard chad say, we're the first and only mrd test for dlbcl to receive medicare coverage. i view that as a clear validation that we continue to extend our leadership position in mrd testing for lymphoid cancers. in terms of dlbcl contributing to growth, we expect this to happen in the second half of 2023. we'll have to do the standard things that we do with all other disease types.
we have to go out there and educate the physicians. we have to change physician behavior. we have to get into guidelines. and i'm very bullish that we'll be able to do that as the therapy landscape for dlbcl has significantly advanced in recent years and is a pretty large unmet need for monitoring disease progression and guiding patient care, similar to what we've seen happen in multiple myeloma recently.
and we have good data. for example, recently, we published that mrd assessment using clonoseq in dlbcl post car-t treatment can be more informative than fcd in identifying patients who are at high risk of relapse. so overall, i expect the mrd business to continue to grow at or above the annual growth rate we're going to see this year but off of a higher base. so in the outer years, we continue this growth trajectory but off a higher base.
and so, in some ways, we're adding more incremental tests every year going forward.
julia qin -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then, one for tycho on the non-dilutive financing. i understand you're planning to save more details for when you're ready to talk about it.
but on a very high level, i was wondering if you can give an update on the kind of deal types or deal structures you're currently exploring. what kind of conversations are you having right now? and are they going to be closely tied to your increased focus on the t-map business with biopharma?
tycho peterson -- chief financial officer
yes. no, it's a fair question. so non-dilutive, meaning equity is kind of off the table here. and i'd say from a kind of high level, we're generally reluctant to issue debt just given the nature of kind of balloon payments.
so we are exploring a potential royalty-type deal. i don't want to give much more detail than that, but this is a well-established model in the therapeutic world with companies that do these kind of type of royalty transactions. so those are the discussions we're having now. still in process.
so again, no firm updates and not specifically tied to the t-map program. i mean, these types of things would generally be done on kind of a basket of revenues, total revenues overall.
julia qin -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got you. that's helpful. and then, a follow-up on the long-range plan. i know you're currently working on it.
without getting into the specific details, can you maybe talk about whether there are any new components to plan or new approaches you're thinking about and the visibility about pharma milestones is something you're working on? so maybe give us some color around how you would approach it.
tycho peterson -- chief financial officer
yes. look, i mean, we're -- the initial cut is kind of build the revenue map and then kind of think about kind of the opex that's going to be required to kind of get us there. i don't envision it involves any kind of significant change in trajectory overall. i mean, i think it's a lot of kind of continuation of stuff that's in progress, obviously continuing to build out the pharma portfolio, for nitin's world, continuing to kind of penetrate the mrd market further.
i don't know, sharon, is there anything you want to add from kind of the pharma immune side that you would highlight on a long-range view?
sharon benzeno -- head, immune medicine business
yes. you highlight exactly the components. and of course, we have -- we take into account prior books, deals and studies and obviously continue our business development efforts, as chad indicated, in the different research uses or regulated uses in the future target discovery in therapeutics that add up to the revenue component as we project three to five years out.
julia qin -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. that's helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from derik de bruin with bank of america. your line is now open.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. so i appreciate the fact that the t-detect landscape was a little bit more complex. but can you give us some sense of timing on when you sort of think the first products could start having some commercial benefit? i mean, we had modeled some lyme and some gi and some stuff into our models. not a lot, but i mean, i just need to know how much of that comes out.
and then also, how should we think about t-detect covid? is that also going to disappear next year?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. derik, why don't i take the first one first, which is t-detect covid. we are going to keep t-detect covid up. we think it's important as a -- this is the first and only t cell test authorized by the eua.
and for cellular immunity, we continue to work closely with pharma partners on a correlative protection study, which we think has the potential to really impact the kind of paradigm here. but there was -- there wasn't a significant amount of kind of revenue in the model. we've talked about it as being a very small contributor from a financial standpoint. that being said, that data is, along with other data sources, is supporting our t-map covid product, which we're partnering on pharma, which is a larger contributor to the revenue source.
so t-detect covid will be left up. we have made the decision to take down the lyme offering. we made it available. we accomplished what we set out to do.
we made it available on our clia lab, which enabled us to put in all the building blocks and infrastructure software, how we validate in a clia lab and have a kind of a self-improving diagnostic with the algorithm, which kind of -- we checked all those boxes for future launches. but -- and again, i think there should have been kind of -- and we guided to very little kind of revenue associated with that. that being said, derik, we are continuing the work on our ptlsd, which is the post-treatment lyme disease syndrome or chronic lyme, because as part of a panel of shared symptomatology, chronic lyme could be confused with many other neurological disorders, including ms, even kind of long-haul covid. so that work is ongoing from an r&d perspective.
and if the data is positive, the other thing we can do, which is -- really goes for every single one of these singles that we're generating is we're going to leverage that data kind of with pharma -- with our pharma partners, and there's kind of -- there's different programs going on kind of across the spectrum from kind of gi to lyme, etc., where we can leverage that immune receptor data to potentially bring in near-term revenue.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. but to the -- then just circling back, though, but then when would be a good time to start thinking about when t-detect would start to contribute to the top line, right, the sort of the revamp and the reset here?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. we're probably a couple of years out, derik, and we'll get back more on when we kind of roll out the three- to five-year long-range plan in the november earnings, but we'll have kind of a more detailed view. but we are going to let the science do the talking here and kind of leverage that data near term. and it's a revamp, but it's really a replacement strategy.
i mean, in some assets, we're kind of replacing those revenues at a kind of higher margin profile with kind of near-term pharma. it's just a different strategy for kind of the r&d development.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and that's where i was going to, right? i think do you sort of see and -- are they enough to offset what you sort of have planned in the models for like these higher revenue ones or something that could drive -- could actually be potentially higher in the near term?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
yes. i'm going to let tycho and karina work with you on the models, derik. but i think the -- we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of kind of replacing kind of those revenues with a higher margin profile, quality of revenue. that's essentially what i'll consider at least paid for r&d are somewhat going to burn off some r&d from our partnerships with pharma to develop those products and get to a panel approach that has kind of multiple indications for earlier detection at the same time.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from david westenberg with piper sandler. your line is now open.
david westenberg -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question and congrats on some of the great clonoseq stuff. so i'll stick with that because i think that was the biggest sequential increase in -- that we've seen. can you give a little bit more color on what exactly might have happened that you finally had this inflection -- on-quarter inflection? and i have a couple more on clonoseq, and i'll stop there for you to answer that.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure. nitin, do you want to take that?
nitin sood -- head, mrd business
yes, i'll take that. i think there's multiple factors. first, our sales team is fully trained and deployed out there. and i think as we've talked about, where our strategy there was to increase penetration in our existing accounts and then also sign up new accounts in the community setting, as well as drive penetration in blood.
so we're seeing all of those factors contribute. our existing institutional accounts, they are still driving growth. we saw sort of 72% growth coming from institutional accounts, but we're also increasing our -- the contribution from the community accounts. the new accounts we're signing up are -- many of them or most of them are in the community setting, that's driving growth.
and then, we continue to see increasing amounts of evidence come out. we talked about the determination trial. i think one of the big decision points for a physician treating multiple myeloma is to -- whether to do stem cell transplant or not. the determination trial really helped highlight the fact that that's an important decision, and mrd can be used to make that decision.
and i think as general awareness in the physician community that the goal of lymphoid cancer treatment should be mrd negativity. so we see that also contributing to growth. so i wouldn't say there's one thing that's contributing to growth. there's a lot of things coming into play that are contributing growth, and we expect this robust growth to continue in the subsequent years as well.
david westenberg -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. got it. i'll ask it, i guess, a little more offline because it does seem like you went 8%, 8%, 12%, 17%. it just seems like there was a big inflection here.
so anyway, we'll look at that. and then, just a couple of questions on nhl. can you remind us why nhl is a little bit more piecemeal in that dlbcl rather than the whole non-hodgkin's lymphoma? i'm sorry, i'm not an oncologist, not a scientist. so just kind of remind me on that.
and then also, can you -- you're talking about this as a 2023 contributor. these are the same oncologists that are ordering blood cancer tests, and we found plenty of our checks with oncologists finding the ones that are ordering even like t cell lymphomas and you're not indicated for that. so why is this a 2023 inflection point? and i'll stop there after that.
nitin sood -- head, mrd business
yes. so first of all, answering your first question, within non-hodgkin's lymphoma, there are multiple subtypes, which each subtype has a slightly different treatment paradigm and, as a result, a different evidence set that's required. there's follicular lymphoma. there's mantle cell lymphoma.
the dlbcl is about 35% of non-hodgkin lymphoma. so we went after dlbcl first, but we will continue to tackle the rest of non-hodgkin's lymphoma subtypes. and we're feeling confident that we'll be able to get medicare reimbursement for those. so we wanted to do it a step at a time because the evidence that's required for each subtype is different.
and then, talking about dlbcl contributing to growth. first of all, our current dlbcl test accepts plasma. and in order to -- for it to be widely used, we needed to accept whole blood in streck tubes. so we've previously talked about that.
we're doing that work. we launched the streck tube assay for dlbcl later in this year. and then, we have to go through the whole education process of convincing physicians, getting into guidelines. and as a result, it's going to really kick in, in the second half of 2023.
even though it's the same physician set, we still need to do the education process. and the use of a blood test in mrd in non-hodgkin's lymphoma isn't established. so we'll do all the work. we have the evidence.
we have the studies. we have expanded sales team and the capability now to do that. but it's going to take time, and that's why we think the real growth is going to kick in, in the second half of 2023.
david westenberg -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. thank you for the color.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
welcome back and congrats on the new post of dave.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dan brennan with cowen & company. your line is now open.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks. thanks for taking the questions. tycho, congrats on first call here. maybe, tycho, maybe i'll start with you.
so on the balance sheet, i guess, the burn guide that you're targeting in the back half of the year is $55 million. that's basically in line with the prior guide, i believe, but you have lower opex. so maybe just kind of help me think through that a little bit. and if we were to plug in the forecast that you guys are giving, where should we be landing at year-end for cash? is it, i think, around $200 million? is that the right zip code?
tycho peterson -- chief financial officer
yes. so yes, we are guiding to $55 million burn in -- quarterly burn in the back half of the year. as i mentioned, we took opex down to $410 million to $415 million. so that kind of reflects the restructuring and some of the other efforts that i kind of highlighted around workflow and things like that.
from a cash position, yes, i don't think that's too far off in terms of where we'll be at year-end. what was the other part of it?
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
no, i just -- i guess, maybe some of the opex cuts are noncash because i know that i think the prior burn guidance was $50 million to $60 million in the back half. and so, capex is coming down. i'm just wondering if the burn reduction could come down more, that's all.
tycho peterson -- chief financial officer
look, we're trying to get more efficient every day, right? we've got other efforts underway to bring down the opex. so that's an ongoing effort and part of our long-range planning, too, right? as we think about the three- to five-year plan, we're generally trying to hold opex if not bring it down annually.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. and then, maybe on clonoseq. just i know there's a few questions asked already, but can you just speak to what the access looks like today? has that changed much? i know different diagnostic companies have discussed access really being stuck. but obviously, you're in a more acute space with cancer.
so maybe that's kind of continuing to improve. so where is access? and i know it was touched upon earlier, maybe to dave's question, but just are we at -- like where are we at in terms of productivity of the expanded sales force? are we halfway there, fully there? is there a lot more to go as they kind of are in the field more?
tycho peterson -- chief financial officer
yes. but before we do that, dave, just on the cash question earlier, $350 million at the end of the year. i think you had said $250 million. but no, it's $350 million.
go ahead, nitin.
nitin sood -- head, mrd business
yes. so i think, unfortunately, the access hasn't changed much in the last few months. i think it seems to be a new normal. but on the other hand, we are able to get ahold of physicians through other channels.
and so, we expect that to not change much in the outer years and in the second half of the year as well. i'm sorry, what was your second question?
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
it was just on the expanded commercial team. just trying to get a sense of kind of the rate of productivity enhancements, how far along the way with that team in place now.
nitin sood -- head, mrd business
yes. so i think there's a lot -- a long way to go in terms of increasing the productivity. i think this is the first quarter where the sales team was trained and deployed. it still takes six to eight months for individuals in new territories to develop their territories to really understand what's going on in each of their territories.
and so, i expect our sales productivity to increase continuously going forward. we're quite a way away from it. i would say, at least 12 to 18 months away from increasing productivity side. i don't expect us to increase our sales footprint going forward.
i think we can drive a lot of increase in business with the current footprint by increasing productivity.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
and then, maybe just one more on t-detect. so for ileal crohn's and colitis, i know you run a fair number of samples at the presentations. so is the idea that you need to have a broader signal across more indications than just something like that, which i think those were maybe targeted to be maybe the first out of the chute? was the idea that the commercial impact of just having those isn't going to be enough so you need to have a broader spectrum of kind of signals? or were the signals not strong enough in those areas? maybe just speak a little bit to the first indication you were initially targeting and kind of how those first indications would evolve into a bigger panel.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure. sharon, do you want to take that?
sharon benzeno -- head, immune medicine business
yes, absolutely. thanks for the question to help clarify. so ibd is still a top priority. in fact, we initiated our clinical study in ibd that covers both crohn's and ulcerative colitis.
and we are aiming, as chad mentioned, in terms of this shift and focus in a panel, which includes not just ibd from ulcerative colitis but also other gi disorders, including enhancing our signal, for example, potentially in celiac disease, and really having a panel of, for example, gi symptomatology that t-detect could help differentially diagnose and diagnose early. so that's one example of a panel. and we are still pursuing ms and neuro as a panel where, as chad indicated, our signal and the strengthening of the signaling lines can also come into play to differentially diagnose. so those are the activities.
and again, we are continuing and are encouraged by the signals that we've generated to date, and that will continue to scale in multiple indications.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. and then, maybe a final one just on kind of the outlook is could you help us think through in the context of the guidance for revenues? i know you said 50-50 between mrd and immune medicine. but when we think about some of the buckets within that, would you be willing to provide some color across a clonoseq clinical and clonoseq pharma mrd development? the different buckets, as you report, how we should think about kind of the trajectory of those businesses implicit in your guidance?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
i don't know, dan. i don't know if we could specifically break it down. i mean, i think you can, frankly, probably back into it. if you have the asp and the test delivered numbers, you can probably get close to that.
i think the first cut, as you know, is you're going to kind of immune medicine and mrd, those broad-based bucket. over time, we may provide kind of further resolution into that. but i think you can get somewhat of a proxy. obviously, the milestones are kind of sitting out there and are probably harder to quantify, but we'll work with you on the model.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
awesome. ok. great. thank you.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
you bet, dan. good talking to.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from salveen richter with goldman sachs. your line is now open.
elizabeth webster -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking our question. this is elizabeth on salveen. this is on the drug discovery vertical.
and i'm just hoping you can help kind of frame the opportunity in target discovery and how much that contributes to the long-term growth.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure. sharon, do you want to take that?
sharon benzeno -- head, immune medicine business
yes, absolutely. so on the heels of the signals that we are generating, we mentioned autoimmune disorders like ibd and ms. there's a lot of opportunity that we and potential partners see there in terms of really validating and discovering novel targets to then pursue as therapeutics in these diseases where there's a high unmet need. and so, that's what we're exploring.
that is the heart and soul of the tcr antigen mapping effort with our microsoft colleagues. and so, we're very excited to continue to pursue that and scale that and really get to these novel targets that we can structure deals around discovery and licensing that could also enable some drug discovery opportunities for us in terms of tcrs against those targets or even antibodies.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from tejas savant with morgan stanley. your line is now open.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. this is yuko on the call for tejas. thank you for taking our questions. with the dlbcl expected to make a more meaningful contribution in the back half of '23, could you elaborate on the potential opportunities on the clinical research side and whether you see that opportunity to be more near term?
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
sure. nitin, you want to take the question?
nitin sood -- head, mrd business
yes, good question. absolutely. so i think we are already working toward increasing our penetration in dlbcl with pharma companies. and as i mentioned, the therapy landscape for dlbcl is very rich.
there's a lot of activity going on there. there's a large number of clinical trials going on, and our penetration in those clinical trials as an endpoint is very low. so we are working with all the major players in that space, and we expect that to be a near-term revenue contributor. we've already heard from a handful of pharma companies that they view the medicare coverage very positively.
the fact this test is very broadly available for patient management is viewed positively by them, and we're already having some conversations about using clonoseq as an endpoint in dlbcl trials.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then, just as an unrelated follow-up, some of the -- some of your peers in the industry noted they're seeing staffing shortages in hospitals and physician offices. is that something you also run into? and if so, has it been a headwind for clonoseq?
nitin sood -- head, mrd business
yes. so i think we are seeing something similar, and we do actually see that we get some order spikes on a couple of days within a week largely because i think they are trying to accumulate orders on two days out of a week and send us those orders. we see sort of that day-to-day variability. and -- but despite that, we saw some very strong performance this quarter, and we hope to continue that in q3 and q4 as well.
yuko oku -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from mark massaro with btig. your line is now open.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
hey, thanks for the questions. i guess, congrats on the reimbursement for non-hodgkin's lymphoma. i guess can you comment about whether or not you've received pricing on the test and how we should think about that? i think in the past, you've received sort of a bundle for four tests. should we think about that as flat to what you already have? and is it fair to think that nhl can be ordered somewhere around two to four times per patient in the blood?
nitin sood -- head, mrd business
yes. thanks for that question, mark. yes, so the pricing is identical through the historic pricing we received for clonoseq, the bundle pricing. and in terms of usage, i think that's going to grow over time.
i think our approach is to tackle the relapsed refractory setting of dlbcl first, which is where we think there is greatest utility in the near term. and then, as we build evidence and as we build familiarity with physicians on using clonoseq on dlbcl, it will also move upstream into frontline treatment. and i think as more and more treatments come online and as people live longer and longer with these diseases, we expect the usage to increase over time.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
ok. and i know you were asked this question earlier, but maybe just can you confirm that pricing, i think, is already effective immediately. so i guess, why won't this have more of an impact in the second half of '22? i understand that it could be small numbers in the early days. but given the size of your sales force and the fact that everyone knows what clonoseq is, are you just being conservative that the bigger uptake is in '23? or maybe just walk us through why you have low expectations for the initial uptake in the first six months.
nitin sood -- head, mrd business
yes. so i think it's a very specific reason. on the current test, i think we talked about this in prior earnings, the current test is based on plasma. and as you know, in the community setting where dlbcl is most frequently treated, the physician's capability to take whole blood, spin that down into plasma and send plasma to us is limited.
so at the end of this year, we're launching a change to the product, where we will be able to accept whole blood in streck tubes, which are very similar to all the other sort of liquid biopsy tests out there. so that's happening at the end of the year. and i think that's going to be a limiting factor for driving growth in the second half. so that's sort of the real discrete reason why we think growth in adoption for dlbcl will be limited.
and again, i just want to emphasize that the medicare coverage is for all without limitations, which covers dlbcl throughout the treatment paradigm for dlbcl. but given that streck tube limitation, which we're addressing, we think the growth will come really in 2023.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
mark, i'll add one comment to that because it's been said a couple of times. but just to clarify, in -- our largest penetration so far is in kind of the academic medical center where there is a lot more specialization between the leukemias, multi myeloma and then kind of lymphoma is a different category. granted in the community, some -- there is still some specialization in the community, but in the community where they do kind of treat all-comers, it's -- we're much more lower penetration rates right now. so this kind of notion that our sales force -- and obviously, that's what we're trying to get to is that one doc who treats all patient understands our test well, but that's a growing but smaller -- off a smaller base right now.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
ok. excellent. one last question on mrd. your press release on nhl sort of referred to the indication as being based on circulating tumor dna.
and i think you've talked about how nhl or dlbcl is almost a borderline heme disorder. so recognizing that you guys certainly are the dominant market leaders in heme, obviously, solid tumors are also a big opportunity. i guess, have you learned anything through the development of nhl or dlbcl that leads you to believe that this may be sort of a potential precursor into solid tumor development?
nitin sood -- head, mrd business
yes. i'll address that. i think the ctdna test that we have developed for dlbcl essentially uses the same underlying technology that we have for dna that originates from whole cells. so in that sense, it's very similar and it leverages the years and years of development effort that we put into that assay, all the ip protection we have, all the controls we have in manufacturing and all the operational excellence we have around that test.
but at the same time, it also demonstrates that, hey, we can leverage our technology and look at different analytes. and in terms of looking at solid tumors, that's something we can -- we haven't talked about it. yes.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
i'll take that one. and mark, it's a good question. it's a natural question, especially as kind of new technology we're developing potentially lends itself to being able to evaluate mrd in solid tumors. and from a corporate development perspective, we're continuing -- we continuously kind of evaluate our opportunities.
and that's obviously something naturally we will evaluate among kind of many other opportunities to expand our franchise.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
awesome. thanks very much for the color.
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
you bet. thank you, mark.

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the adaptive biotechnologies second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, karina calzadilla, head of investor relations.
please go ahead.
karina calzadilla -- head of investor relations
thank you, daniel. thank you, daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. i would like to welcome you to adaptive biotechnologies second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. earlier today, we issued a press release reporting adaptive financial results for the second quarter of 2022.
the press release is available at www.adaptivebiotech.com. we are conducting a live webcast of this call, and we'll be referencing to a slide presentation that has been posted to the investors section in our corporate website. during the call, management will make projections and other forward-looking statements within the meanings of federal security laws regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. these statements reflect management's current perspective of the business as of today.
actual results may differ materially from today's forward-looking statements, depending on a number of factors, which are set forth in our public filings with the sec and listed in this presentation. joining the call today are chad robins, our ceo and co-founder; and tycho peterson, our chief financial officer. in addition, harlan robins, adaptive's chief scientific officer and co-founder; nitin sood, head of the immune medicine -- of the mrd business; and sharon benzeno, head of immune medicine business, will be available for q&a. with that, i'll turn the call to chad robins.
chad? 
chad robins -- chief executive officer and co-founder
thanks, karina. good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 earnings call. first, a big thank you to all our adaptive employees for their continuous dedication and hard work in delivering another strong quarter. we're halfway through the year.
we're on track to achieve our 2022 goals in both our mrd and immune medicine businesses. as outlined on slide 3, this quarter, we executed toward important milestones and delivered key results. revenue for the second quarter was $43.7 million representing strong growth of 13% versus prior year. our mrd business comprised of clonoseq, clinical testing and our pharma partnerships delivered strong performance.
clinical volumes grew 53% versus prior year. we secured a positive coverage decision for medicare in diffuse large b cell lymphoma, the most common type of non-hodgkin's lymphoma. clonoseq is the first and only test to receive medicare coverage for mrd and dlbcl. and our mrd pharma partnerships continue to grow.
this quarter, we entered into yet another pan-portfolio agreement with a major pharma company. our immune medicine business comprised of pharma services, drug discovery and clinical testing opportunities continues to grow as we diversify into multiple applications of our immune receptor data. we experienced significant growth of 123% from pharma research partners. our genentech partnership is on track with both our shared and private cell therapy programs.
we have made a business decision with respect to the commercialization of t-detect. rather than launch diagnostic test disease by disease, we are deferring commercialization until we have multiple signals with strong enough data to change physician behavior with a clear path to reimbursement. the science is working in multiple diseases, and we are confident in our long-term vision for t-detect as a single blood test for multiple indications. however, as we look ahead, we are now focused on pharma partnering and drug discovery while we generate strong clinical utility data around our t-detect multi-test panels.
related to our corporate activities, we continue to manage expenses prudently while exploring non-dilutive financing opportunities that could extend our cash runway. moving on to the mrd business on slide 4. as shown in the graph, our clonoseq clinical testing growth is strong and accelerating quarter over quarter. this quarter, tests delivered grew 17% sequentially to nearly 9,000 tests with double-digit growth observed in all three marketed indications: all, multi myeloma and cll.
all metrics are pointing in the right direction. ordering hcps or healthcare providers and ordering accounts experienced significant growth of 53% and 44% versus prior year, respectively. unique patients tested grew 56%. slide 5 shows our strategy to solidify our leadership in mrd testing for patients with lymphoid malignancies.
first, the team is focused on further penetrating existing institutional accounts and increasing the activation of new community accounts with our expanded field force, which is now fully trained and deployed. 72% of the volume growth this quarter came from established institutional accounts, underscoring the potential to expand usage within existing accounts. we also grew the number of newly activated community accounts by 20%, which is a positive indicator of our sales team expansion. another key driver of growth is blood-based testing, which has the potential to both increase penetration of clonoseq among clinicians and increase the number of tests run per patient.
about 30% of all clonoseq mrd tests are performed using blood, and importantly, multi myeloma in blood increased 33% versus prior quarter. we plan to expand into dlbcl following our positive medicare coverage decision. the policy is effective immediately and extend to all dlbcl patients, 75% of which are medicare-aged, regardless of line of therapy, treatment regimen or testing time point. we continue to build our dlbcl evidence base to support guideline inclusion.
based on these efforts, we expect dlbcl to contribute to clonoseq growth in 2023 and beyond. data continues to emerge strengthening clinical utility and the value of mrd testing for patients. slide 6 highlights data presented at asco from the phase iii determination trial for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. this study was designed to assess the benefit of adding transplant to frontline triple therapy followed by maintenance therapy until progression.
an important result from the study showed that patients who achieved mrd negativity by clonoseq prior to maintenance had similar outcomes independent of transplant. and the authors state that the elimination of mrd is of increasing importance in tailoring treatment, in informing clinical care and as a treatment goal given its prognostic value for better outcomes. let's shift to our mrd pharma portfolio on slide 7. our clonoseq assay is being used in 168 active trials, representing about 21% penetration among active heme pharma trials.
in multi myeloma, we are the gold standard, almost 50% penetration. our goal is to replicate our multi myeloma success in nhl and cll. this quarter, we signed a new pan-portfolio agreement with a major pharma partner, increasing our eligible milestones to over $355 million from ongoing and future studies. now, turning to our immune medicine business on slide 8.
we have proven our ability to map t cell receptors to antigens at scale and can leverage this data for multiple diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. to drive growth for our immune medicine business in the near to midterm, we will focus on pharma partnerships and drug discovery collaborations. clinical testing with t-detect is expected to be a meaningful contributor to revenue in the long term once we establish t cell signatures in multiple indications that can be offered as a reimbursed differentiated diagnostic panel to patients with shared symptomatology. on slide 9, we provide an overview of our growing immune medicine business opportunities in pharma and drug discovery.
from a base level, t cell and b cell receptor sequencing to inform research and development continues to expand in immunoseq as a gold standard. layering on our ability to map disease-specific tcrs to antigens unlock a valuable product offering called t-map that is used to support our pharma partners in measuring the t cell response to various drugs, including vaccines. we are partnering on covid and rsv vaccine programs and expect to drive additional revenue in infectious disease, autoimmunity and oncology. moving up the r&d value chain.
immune response data can be also used as a regulated clinical endpoint with diagnostic applications. in drug discovery, we further characterize antigen-specific tcrs for target and or drug discovery. this is the basis of our partnership with genentech. we are increasing our focus on additional high-value drug discovery opportunities.
turning to our t-detect clinical testing strategy on slide 10. we proved and validated our t-detect clinical testing capability in infectious diseases. specifically, t-detect covid achieved eua and was key to educate the fda about a new class of t cell-based testing. we also made t-detect lyme available in our clia lab, which enabled us to implement end-to-end and clia workflows and to continuously improve the algorithm.
as mentioned previously, our experience showed us that the cost to commercialize and improve signals through self-pay customers disease by disease is high. therefore, we have decided not to launch t-detect test before there is a clear path to reimbursement. we believe we can improve the signals to drive clinical evidence for coverage and commercial uptake by focusing on internal r&d and pharma partnering. this will allow us to drive near-term revenue and generate more signals that support the vision of t-detect.
we are confident that this disciplined approach will enable us to achieve commercial success with t-detect as a differentiated high-value clinical test. we are excited about the multiple business opportunities that we discussed today and look forward to providing additional updates on our progress. i'll now pass it over to tycho for a financial update.
tycho peterson -- chief financial officer
thank you. turning to our financial results, starting with revenue on slide 11. total revenue in the second quarter was $43.7 million, representing a 13% increase from $38.5 million in the same period last year with 51% from immune medicine and 49% from mrd. mrd revenue, which is comprised of clonoseq clinical testing, plus revenues from our mrd pharma and research partnerships, was $21.3 million, an increase of 38% from a year ago.
clonoseq clinical testing and mrd partnerships drove approximately 65% and 35% of the growth, respectively. within our mrd pharma business, we recognized a $1 million regulatory milestone. while we continue to see milestones from our mrd partnerships materializing and accelerating over time, these can vary quarter to quarter. clonoseq test volumes, which include tech transfer, increased by 53% to 8,998 tests delivered from 5,897 in the same period last year.
we expect similar or higher volume growth trends to continue for the remainder of the year. immune medicine revenue was $22.4 million, down 3% from a year ago. the change was driven by a $3.7 million increase from pharma and academic customers using immunoseq and t-map products, as well as a $1 million decrease in revenue from t-detect covid and a $3.4 million decrease from genentech amortization, which as we have noted in the past, varies from quarter to quarter. shifting to our operating costs on slide 12.
total operating expenses were $96.2 million or a 9% increase from $88.3 million last year and a 6% decrease from $102 million last quarter. cost of revenue was $13.2 million compared to $10.8 million last year, representing a 23% increase driven mainly by a mix to higher cost assays. r&d expenses were $37 million compared to $37.8 million a year ago, representing a 2% decrease, which was partially attributable to reduced collaboration and medical advisory costs. sales and marketing expenses were $24.3 million compared to $23.2 million a year ago, representing an increase of 5% due largely to higher t&e and increased personnel costs from the sales force expansion partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses.
g&a expenses were $21.2 million compared to $16.1 million a year ago, representing an increase of 32%. this was primarily driven by the expansion of our facility footprint with the opening of our new headquarters in the back half of 2021, as well as higher depreciation expenses and increased personnel costs. net loss for the second quarter of 2022 was $52.1 million compared to $49.3 million last year. now, turning to full year guidance.
we are reiterating our full year revenue range of $185 million to $195 million. both our mrd and immune medicine businesses have great momentum, and we expect them to still contribute to our full year revenues approximately 50-50 at the midpoint of the range. for operating expenses, we now expect full year -- our full year target to be between $410 million to $415 million as compared to our previous expectation of $425 million to $435 million. this reflects our continuous efforts in managing investments and improving operating efficiencies beyond the restructuring activities that we announced at the beginning of the year.
some of the operating efficiencies we are exploring include real estate consolidation, sequencing and workflow cost reductions and software optimization. importantly, we are being thoughtful about our cash, and we expect to deploy capital off our balance sheet to support operations, and we expect our quarterly burn rate to be approximately $55 million in the back half of the year. our capital position is strong. we ended the quarter with about $450 million in cash and equivalents, which provides us around two years of runway.
as chad mentioned, given current market conditions, we are exploring non-dilutive financing alternatives to extend our cash runway while also working extensively on our long-range plan, and i look forward to providing you with further details on our path to profitability in the back half of the year. with that, i'll hand it back over to chad.

thanks, tycho. as outlined today, we are sharpening our focus and remain disciplined with our investments as we fine-tune our path to profitability. both our immune medicine and our mrd businesses have great momentum and are on track to achieve their respective catalysts listed on slide 13. we're looking to a great second half of the year.
i'd like to turn it back over to the operator and open it up for questions.
