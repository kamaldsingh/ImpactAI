thank you for standing by. we now welcome you to darden restaurants first quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
now, let me hand the call over to your host, kevin kalicak. you may begin.
kevin kalicak -- vice president of investor relations and corporate analysis
thank you, ray. good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. joining me on the call today are gene lee, darden, ceo; and rick cardenas, cfo.
as a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the securities and exchange commission. we are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the investor relations section of our website at darden.com.
today's discussion and presentation include certain non-gaap measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. we plan to release fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings on december 19 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. this morning gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the first quarter.
as a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated knapp-track excluding darden, specifically, olive garden and longhorn. during our first fiscal quarter, industry total sales growth was flat, industry same-restaurant sales declined 1.2% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 3.3%.
now, i'll turn the call over to gene.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, kevin, and good morning, everyone. as you've seen from our press release this morning, we had a solid quarter. total sales from continuing operations were $2.1 billion, an increase of 3.5%. same-restaurant sales increased 0.9% and diluted net earnings per share were $1.38.
comparable same-restaurant sales for the industry continued to weaken during the quarter, as the industry once again faced tougher comparisons. however, the industry comping negative is surprising, considering unemployment remains at all-time low and there continues to be strong wage growth, which is historically has been positive for the industry.
i'm particularly pleased with the performance of olive garden and longhorn steakhouse, given the industry performance and their difficult comparisons over the first quarter of last year. we remain focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy and leveraging our four competitive advantages. and i'm pleased, we continued to take share and protect our margins.
turning to brand highlights for the quarter. olive garden had strong quarter, which resulted in its 20th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth. total sales grew 3.6%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 2.2% and 1.4% growth in new restaurants. olive garden same-restaurant sales gap to the industry was 340 basis points this quarter, representing the largest gap to the industry since the first quarter of fiscal '19. and on a two-year basis olive garden grew total sales by nearly 10%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 840 basis points.
olive garden's results were driven by the team's ongoing focus on flawless execution, everyday value and convenience. guest satisfaction ratings remain impressive and catering delivery metrics reflect the highest intent to recommend within the brand giving us confidence that our teams are delivering great experiences inside and outside the four walls of our restaurant.
the olive garden team made a strategic decision to change the order of their first quarter promotions. this was necessary to separate their two strongest value promotions; buy one take one, and never ending pasta bowl to more evenly deliver the value messaging throughout the year. while this change along with associated media shifts and weakening industry trends resulted in lower traffic than last year, it was the right strategic decision for the long-term. recognizing the strength of buy one take one promotion, olive garden added a $5 take-home entrees to the everyday value lineup, which was supported with national advertising to drive awareness. it has been met with strong guest demand and it will be a catalyst to continue to grow the off-premise business.
everyday value was also strengthened with the introduction of a new weekday lunch menu with 21 options under $10, including guest favorites like chicken parmigiana and items from the taste of the mediterranean menu like chicken margarita. this initiative was supported by integrated marketing and resulted in stronger weekday lunch traffic and guest preference.
finally, the olive garden team remains focused on their off-premise capabilities to meet their guests' needs for convenience. a key part of that focus has been optimizing the digital sales channel for both mobile and desktop. during the quarter, digital sales grew by more than 30% and represented approximately 40% of to go sales. overall, off-premise sales grew 12%, representing 14% of total sales. olive garden remains a truly iconic and broadly appealing brand and the team is doing an excellent job of focusing on their strategy in competing effectively.
longhorn steakhouse had a strong quarter as well. total sales grew 4.6%, driven by 2% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.6%, the 26th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth. on a two-year basis, longhorn grew total sales by 11%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 940 basis points. the longhorn team remains focused on their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution, and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement.
during the quarter, the longhorn team ran two successful menu promotions; grill master favorite and fire crafted flavors, which was supported by their award-winning you can't fake steak advertising campaign. they also supported these promotions by reinforcing their quality storage through multiple guest touch points. the team also continue to focus on ensuring to go experience equals their in-restaurant experience for guests who choose this convenience. the team simplified the online ordering process, which significantly reduced the order time.
during the quarter, digital sales grew almost 50% and represented more than one-third of total to go sales. additionally, they have now completed a dedicated to go area more than half of their restaurants. these actions led to continued improvement in guest satisfaction scores for order accuracy and timeliness and helped to drive to go sales growth nearly 12%.
finally, longhorn's industry-leading retention rates continue to even get better despite the tight labor market. team member turnover during the quarter was 68% compared to approximately 120% for casual dining and management turnover during the quarter was 13% compared to approximately 36% for casual dining. we know that engaged team members provide better guest experiences and the longhorn team's ongoing focus on retention and culture building is a key driver of the strong business performance.
cheddar's scratch kitchen total sales decreased 2%, driven by same-restaurant sales decline of 5.4%, and partially offset by sales growth from new restaurants of 3.4%. the trend change was driven by reduced marketing efforts and overall industry softness in the quarter. in addition, the same-restaurant sales decline continued to be more pronounced in the former franchise locations. these restaurants experienced significant disruption during the quarter as they were the last restaurants to complete the kitchen transformation project.
while it's disappointing to see the sales trend decline, the cheddar's team made significant progress against their priorities during the quarter. at the beginning of the new fiscal year, they established three new strategic priorities; create a people focused results-oriented culture, reduced friction in the guest experience, and build a brand people talk about with the goal of building on the progress that made last year repairing fundamental elements of the business and improving the sales trajectory.
during the quarter, the cheddar's team continue to see improvements in both the manager and team member turnover trends as they implemented initiatives that led to higher retention levels. overall, staffing levels for both the manager and team members improved during the quarter. because of the progress made this quarter in staffing and intention, the cheddar's team was able to better execute operational improvements designed to enhance the guest experience.
for example, they implemented standard that significantly upgraded their abilities to successfully serve large parties. with these and other improvements, they saw a better guest experience results compared to last year across all key metrics. near the end of the quarter, cheddar's introduced the new menu with more price diversity within categories and they launched their quick pick lunch combos starting at $5.99. these combos are generating strong preference at lunch and have led to higher value and intend to return ratings compared to last year. i recognized there's still a lot of work to do, but the progress the cheddar's team has made operationally and their improved hr metrics are encouraging. now that they feel they're moving in the right direction from an operation and staffing perspective, they will begin to increase their working media spend.
cheddar's has the highest guest frequency of any darden brand and this investment is intended to build upon the strong position, improve brand awareness and drive trial. they will be leveraging darden resources and best practices to implement the media plan.
finally, during the quarter, we acquired four previously franchise restaurant locations in texas, and i'm pleased to say that each of these four restaurants is performing at a very high level.
in closing, i'm pleased with the progress our teams made executing against the strategic initiatives. our strategy is working, allowing us to continue to grow sales, increased market share, improve margins and invest in our people and brands, all while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. of course, none of this would be possible of having the best people in the business, so i want to take this opportunity to thank you our 185,000 team members who continued to create memorable dining experiences for our guests.
now, i'll turn it over to rick.
rick cardenas -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, gene, and good morning, everyone. we had another good quarter with total sales growth of 3.5%, driven by 2.6% growth from the addition of 40 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%. first quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, an increase of 3% from last year's diluted net earnings per share. we paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $95 million in shares, returning over $200 million to shareholders this quarter.
before i get into the detailed results from this quarter, i want to mention that we adopted the new accounting standard for leases at the beginning of this fiscal year. consistent with the expectation discussed on last quarter's call, we estimate that this will negatively impact eps by approximately $0.05 in fiscal 2020. however, the more meaningful impact was to our balance sheet, as you saw from this morning's press release.
this quarter, we also updated our segment reporting. beginning in fiscal 2020, our calculation of segment profit now excludes non-cash real estate related expenses and fiscal 2019 has been restated for comparability. this change allows for more consistent evaluation of our business across segments and fiscal periods.
now turning to our detailed margin results. food and beverage costs were flat to last year, as pricing of 2% and continued cost savings initiatives offset commodity inflation of approximately 1.5% and continued investments. i'm impressed with restaurant labor being flat to last year, particularly in light of same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%. total labor inflation of 4% was offset by pricing, check mix and productivity improvements in new and existing restaurants.
restaurant expense was unfavorable 10 basis points due to deleverage, as our comp sales growth was below inflation. as a result, restaurant level ebitda margin of 18.1% was 10 basis points unfavorable to last year. general and administrative expense was 50 basis points lower than last year and favorable mark-to-market expense, which is generally offset in the tax line, lower management incentive expense and sales leverage.
our q1 effective tax rate of 9.8% was slightly below the range in our annual guidance. we still anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11% for the fiscal year. overall, i'm pleased with our performance this quarter and impressed with our strong eat margin of 8.1%.
turning to our segment performance. olive garden grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. segment profit margin increased 40 basis points, by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing cost-effectively. longhorn also grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth.
segment profit margin decreased slightly, due to elevated beef inflation and continued investments during the quarter. fine dining grew sales and profit in the quarter as well, driven by a positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. segment profit margin decreased because of higher pre-opening expense and inefficiencies related to three new restaurants. sales for our other business segment grew 1.8%, driven by net new restaurants. both segment profit dollars and margin decreased this quarter due to margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter.
as you saw in the press release, we reiterated all aspects of our fiscal 2020 outlook. looking ahead at our second quarter performance, there are two things i would like to address before we open up the call for questions. both of which are contemplated in our annual guidance.
first, the timing of the thanksgiving holiday this year, relative to last, is shifting from the second quarter, into the third quarter. since we are closed in the majority of our restaurants on this day, this shift should positively impact darden's second quarter same-restaurant sales, by approximately 80 to 100 basis points with a corresponding offset in the third quarter.
second, given a prolonged media coverage and the storms duration, hurricane dorian had a meaningful impact on the first two weeks of our fiscal second quarter. we are currently estimating a drag of 20 to 30 basis points to same-restaurant sales in the second quarter.
and with that, we'll take your questions.

operator
thank you. we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] thank you. our first question is from matt difrisco from guggenheim securities. your line is open, sir.
matt difrisco -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thank you. my question is with respect to the cheddar's, i guess, lagging in difference between olive garden and longhorn. would you attribute that mostly? it sounds like to the marketing spend; can you sort of bracket or compare how much -- pullbacks of marketing spend there was versus last year in either terms of dollars or terms of weeks of support, so we could get a better understanding of that?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
i'm not -- we're not going to get that granular with our spending in cheddar's. i would just say that we now have enough transactional data to look at some things in cheddar's we haven't had the opportunity to do before. and one of the big insights is that our frequency in cheddar's is higher than any other darden brand. and we married that up with some of the research that we were doing and we recognized that our awareness for this brand is extremely low. and our primary advertising had been more driven toward a frequency play. and we decided, once we have this insight during the quarter, we were pulling -- we pulled back from that type of activity. and now we're going go out and we're going to test and learn and understand how to -- best increase our awareness in markets.
we also recognized the fact that it's going to be more important than ever in this environment to continue to build out our markets, develop our -- become more efficient in those markets from a media standpoint. and i would say more -- use more traditional media to increase our awareness to drive this business. and so it was a really good quarter from that -- from an insight standpoint for us to really recognize. and we decided we were going to change direction and that's where we pulled back a little bit of the media spend during the quarter.
matt difrisco -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
okay. and then, i guess, is there something different to the menu that may be triggered a change in frequency to the heavy, heavy user from the past, or is it new ownership that they noticed or something of that?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's just the fact that we actually have now the transactional data to be able to analyze and have that insight. that's why it's so important when we do an acquisition for us to put our systems in, so that we can get the data and then do our analysis.
matt difrisco -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from david tarantino from baird. sir, your line is open.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
hi. good morning. gene, i just wanted to talk to about the industry trends that you're seeing. it seems like your analysis in the prepared remarks that this was a little surprising that we've seen such soft trends especially in the most recent months. so just curious to get your thoughts on why you think that's happening? and secondly, do you think you need to adjust any of your marketing or promotional strategies to the new environment so to speak? thanks.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yes. good morning, david. as i said in my prepared remarks, the backdrop appears to be very strong for the consumer. we have good wage growth. we have strong employment. historically, that's been really good for us. as we look at the data and we look at behaviors, we look at confidence i have -- i personally believe that there's some uncertainty entering into the consumer and it's impacting their confidence. how long -- i got to believe there with all the media attention around what's happening. how long this does continue -- this environment continue. so there's nothing structural that we see that's changed out there other than it appears to be a little bit more uncertainty today than there was in the future.
as far as what do we need to do? we need to continue to create compelling guest experiences and come up with -- and reinforce our value propositions. i do think that we have to think about, how we're going to market in our smaller brands? and how do we advertise those brands in different channels and become more effective and compete more effectively? i think that's an important change that we need to make in the upcoming quarters.
i think we have the luxury of being patient and test and learn and really make great long-term decisions as we try to figure out how to support those brands and compete more effectively in this marketplace. we're pleased that we're heading into never ending pasta bowl and olive garden, it's a great promotion for us. we had a lot of buzz around our pasta pass this year. and so i think it's a good promotion going into this time of year and where the consumers at.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
and maybe just a follow-up gene, does the current environment, or what you've seen recently make you think differently about the degree of difficulty in hitting our comp guidance for the year? i know you have maybe lost it difficult comparisons coming up. and how should we think about the middle of the comp guidance or the upper end of the comp guidance relative to where you were three months ago?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
well, i guess, we reiterated our guidance today. we believe our same restaurant sales for the year will be somewhere between 1% and 2%.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from will slabaugh from stephens. your line is open.
niall -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hi, guys, this is actually niall on for will. thanks for taking the question. just quick one here. wondering if you can give any insights into commodity costs? you spoke some elevated beef costs there. just wondering how you're feeling about this going forward, whether you've seen any effects from african swine fever?
rick cardenas -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, niall. this is rick. we were about 1.5% inflation in the first quarter, which is around where we expected it to be. we have seen a little bit of elevation in beef, but the boards are coming back down and are a little bit more in our favor. so, we still expect our inflation to be where we thought at the beginning of this fiscal year. as a result, or as an answer to your african swine flu question, we still haven't seen a very big impact in african swine flu. as we mentioned in the last call, pork is really only about 2% of our sales. so, it's a relatively small impact. and we haven't seen the downstream impacts of pork prices yet.
niall -- stephens inc. -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
operator
thank you. next question is from joshua long from piper jaffray. your line is open.
joshua long -- piper jaffray -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my question. i wanted to circle back to the trends you've seen here lately and maybe any sort of regional variations, or any regional variations you've seen across the system? and then, also, in terms of your initiatives and kind of the underlying trends you've seen, any sort of differences in the weekday, weekend trends? you've got some very strong lunch offerings in there, but didn't know if that was may be moving the needle like you expected or may be ahead of expectations?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
no. i really don't have a lot to add to your question. we've really not seen much from a geographic standpoint and there's really been no trend change to any of the weekday, weekday night, weekday lunch or a weekend business. i would say that, the trends have weakened in all areas of the business.
joshua long -- piper jaffray -- analyst
great. thanks. and then one follow-up, if i may, in terms of your work on the to go business, the strength there is still very promising. any sort of learnings you've had as you stuck with this and worked on the fulfillment internally, versus the thought process of working with external partners? i know, you're always testing and always learning. but curious on what you're seeing there, if there's any update.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
i think, the biggest thing our teams are doing is, they're taking friction out of the process. and, i think, we're getting -- it's like anything else, repetition is a great thing. you continued to get better and better with it, as you do more business. so, i think longhorn has made tremendous progress. we've seen their scores go up, their satisfaction scores go up. olive garden has really honed in on this process. they continue to find ways, very, very impressed with the digital growth in both of those businesses. we think that's something to continue to look at. so to me, it's really about making that experience as compelling as we possibly can with great value, right. i think, it's -- and that's been our strategy is, to make sure that we have strong value on the off premise and not have the consumer be willing to come pick it up, versus it being delivered.
joshua long -- piper jaffray -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from brett levy from mkm partners. your line is open.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the call, gentlemen. if we could just hone in a little bit more, i'm going to ask the consumer question a different way and hopefully get some sentiment [phonetic] of a different answer. when you think about --
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
we could try.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
i'll try. when you think about the consumers right now, are you seeing any changes in how they're using you? obviously, take-home is further building out your off premise, but are you seeing any changes in terms of full price value add-ons, size of parties, something like that? thank you.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
no, brett. no, we haven't seen any change at all. and -- when i look at the quarter -- let me put it back to look at the quarter. let's think about what olive garden has done in the last two years. even though the industry has weakened, i'm incredibly impressed that we've grown our business approximately 10% at olive garden with two-year comp that i think is extremely impressive. and so the industry and a lot of the comments that i made today about the industry decelerating, i look at our two large brands; i think they're competing very effectively. the gaps are very, very strong to the industry.
so, i think we have a way to compete very effectively with these two brands and i'm excited. and yes, we watch the industry and we give you some insight to it, but our job and our leaders' jobs are to find a way to compete effectively in any environment and i think that's what our teams have done really well in this first quarter.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question is from john ivankoe from jp morgan. your line is open.
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
yes. hi. thank you. it's also just an industry question for you gene. obviously, knapp all-store traffic has actually been negative and what i think you said to a previous question is a relatively strong underlying consumer environment, especially in terms of some of topline trending. where do you see -- that consumer actually going? i mean where -- if that consumer is working and that consumer has higher income, where is that consumer currently dining -- whether it's in the house or out of the house is kind of the first question?
secondly, do you see independence -- being great cycle as we are as potentially taking care versus chains? and what would you look out to maybe a shake that some supply growth that's been added in the space over the last several years? and then the final point, i think, you kind of you mentioned a few times more value at olive garden and in cheddar's. is there any thought of bringing back couponing and doing other things that are going to be direct call to action for the consumer for you to maintain traffic and what you described earlier as any industry environment?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
john, you get the award for most questions inside a one question.
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
it's all related. i think you can do it in one paragraph.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
so -- i got independence, i got discount. what was the first?
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
the first one was --
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
where are people are going. john we are definitely seeing some strength in limited service both fast casual and quick-serve, there's no doubt about that. and you think about there is good income growth on the lower end of the curve and those folks seem to be trading or dining out a little bit more frequently. and i don't know where people are trading out of in casual when you look at a 10-year period, that's been a big question. i'm not sure we've had -- we as an industry, you have an answer. again, we focused on our brands and we seem to be getting more than our fair share.
the data that we're looking at is saying that large chains are still taking more share and they're taking that share from independence. where you see independence and small regional change are in really what i would call the better, better trade areas, the higher income trade areas, where they are having an impact and i think performing well. but i think on a national scale, when you look at it, independence are still donating share and large brands continue to do better and take share from both smaller probably a little bit older brands and independents.
as far as discounting, we're going to continue to use, whatever levers we can use to grow our business. when you look at -- when we look at incentives, we don't look at just as one piece. we have to look at our overall advertising program. what is going on from a television standpoint, what's going on from a digital and online, what are we doing from an incentive standpoint. we have multiple ways to put incentives out there. and so we have a lot of leverage that we can pull over time depending on the environment. and we will use those appropriately to drive our business in a profitable way.
the one thing that, i think that we are proud of, and i'm very proud of our teams is that we continue to drive our business, while protecting our margins. and we continue to invest in our business, invest in quality, invest in food, invest in portion size, invest in our people, and we're able to do that in a way that has protected our margins. and as rick talked about, our plus 8% eat [phonetic] margins are incredibly impressive in this environment. and so when we think about incentives, we think about it holistically and all that we're doing to build our brands over the long-term.
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
that's great. very helpful. excellent answer.
operator
thank you. our next question is from andrew strelzik from bmo capital markets. your line is open.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking the question. over the last couple of months, we've been hearing a lot more about delivery take rates coming down, being renegotiated lower. wondering if that changes your perspective on the liability of delivery for darden at all, especially as you've kind of highlighted some of the changes on the digital side and the willingness given the numbers that you cited for customers to engage with the brands digitally, if your thoughts are evolving at all on delivery?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
no. we haven't -- we really haven't -- have any -- thoughts haven't evolved at all. we will acknowledge that the cost burden does appear to be shifting from the company to the consumer, and we are going to watch that closely. but i think -- i have a lot of concerns about that. this is still -- we're still -- it's all about value and how much of the overall experience are you willing to dedicate toward convenience? and so it's something to watch. it's definitely a shift that we internally predicted that would happen. and we'll watch it, but i want to pivot back to what i said earlier, our job is to create a compelling off-premise experience right now that -- with so much value that consumer is willing to come and get it. that seems to be working for us and we're going to continue to focus on that.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
if i could just follow-up on the value piece then just quickly. the olive garden price was about 2% for the quarter. was that what the underlying price was? not that it's a huge deviation from where you've been prior, but should be thinking about a little bit more price broadly at olive garden going forward?
rick cardenas -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
andrew, this is rick. the price was 2.2%, i believe in the first quarter and that's just due to timing of pricing year-over-year. we still expect our price to be below 2%, which is our long-term goal to keep pricing below our inflation and below our competitors to increase our value perception in the marketplace, while still making great investments. so, yes, this was just a little bit of a timing anomaly for the quarter.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question is from stephen anderson from maxim. your line is open.
stephen anderson -- maxim -- analyst
yes. good morning. i would actually want to ask about the test you have under way for your rewards programs to see a multi-concept. as i recall, it's about 7% of your storage, you're testing that out right now. i wanted to ask about how the test is progressing? and whether you are ready to roll that out to additional locations, or potentially entire system? thank you.
rick cardenas -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
hey, stephen, this is rick again. thanks for the question. as you said, yes, we have our loyalty program in about 7% of our restaurants and that -- across the nation. we're still monitoring that test. as we have said quite a few times, this is going to take a long time to understand the frequency driving nature of the loyalty program and how much we'd have to provide discounts to our most loyal consumers to come to us, versus other incentives for them to come.
the test is going ok. it's going well, but we're not ready to pull the trigger on adding more restaurants. we're going nationally. and when we do, i am sure all of you will be to first to know. but, right now, we're kind of holding steady on our test. the fact that it's still out there, tells you that it's not going well, but we want to just make sure that it's the right thing to do in the long run, as part of what gene says, our overall strategy of how do we market to our consumers.
stephen anderson -- maxim -- analyst
yes. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] thank you. our next question is from dennis geiger from ubs. your line is open.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you. just wanted to ask about mix, and i guess specifically on olive garden, is the impact that you saw in the quarter was roughly in line with expectation prior to the quarter? and then, more importantly, just looking out over the next few quarters, anything that would make you think the mix contribution could remain above kind of a long-term steady state? i guess if you could just kind of highlight some of the mix considerations this year, some of the puts and takes, thinking about incentives, trade-up promos, catering delivery or catering off-premise, et cetera. thanks.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yes. two things, i think, that will probably drive mix maybe a little bit above our target will be continued growth in catering and catering delivery and the addition of the $5 take homes. those two things probably are going to drive that mix slightly above our long-term expectations. the $5 take home is a great value offering and it's something that we think is a real catalyst to continue to drive the off premise business, which should have a little bit more of a positive mix than what we want to try to do for a long-term.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question is from eric gonzalez from keybanc capital markets. your line is open.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking the question. i think in the first quarter you benefited from a few extra weeks of the buy one take one as you pull that forward. but i think you said in your comment that it was a drag on traffic due to media shift. so i was wondering if you can maybe clarify what you meant there. and i know you had the hurricane impact, but perhaps you can quantify what the impact of not having those extra weeks of the buy one take one in the early part of the second quarter? thanks.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
no. we're not going to talk about the second quarter impact. and we shifted some media; we -- moved things around, which is always going to move our comparisons somewhat. but i'll go back to my statement; this was something we think strategically needed to be done. and -- again, i would also add this also always shifts in our media spending, as we -- it's the only way you can really discern what is working and what is not working and what -- and where to put more weight against, whether it's promotion or lunch or value is that you have to change the media spend to learn. and so we shifted a little bit inside the quarter. i wouldn't get caught up in that i point back to a great two-year stack great our performance in the industry. we made a strategic -- a big strategic choice to separate the two value promotions that gives us more balance in our value messaging throughout the year, which is really important. let's not get hung up on a week-to-week media shifts.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
if i could maybe sneak in a follow-up there. on the $5 take-home and the buy one take one are similar type of -- they are sort of similar programs, are you moving away from buy one take one next year or is that something that's on the table?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think they're similar, but different. and so there are different types of value offering and our team will continue to reenergize buy one take one, it's an important part of our value proposition. and if it's done right, it will continue to support the $5 take-home. it shouldn't be a cannibalistic thing. it should -- it really should support it and move it after you run buy one take one that should be the springboard for a $5 take-home for the rest of the year and you can reenergize the promotion each year. so, that's how we're thinking about that. so, it should be additive not -- it shouldn't be dilutive at all.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks
operator
our next question is from john glass from morgan stanley. your line is open.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. thanks very much. first just on the other brands and the continued softness there. i think you commented last quarter that there is increased competition. so, maybe what we're seeing here is just more of that. but can you talk about how you think about -- what it's a breakthrough strategy to help market those brands better if you can achieve them national advertising scale of those brands? and does delivery makes sense in some -- we talk about delivery holistically, do you like delivery or not. but does it make sense in some brands, may be some of these smaller brands, it's worth giving a try given that they don't have that scale and delivery through the aggregator sort of provide scale that they don't otherwise have?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
well, it's an interesting concept john. as you think about the smaller brands, we've been reluctant to really add a lot of marketing costs to these businesses. they are unique; they've got great strong value propositions. but i think in this environment, i think we finally come to grips with that we're probably going to have to spend a little bit more money and become -- and try to find which channels in the digital environment can work best for them. i think there's not one channel that would work across all our small brands. and so each of them are so unique, we have to figure out what's the best way to talk to the consumer. as far as off-premise, our third-party delivery for the smaller brands, i really don't see that as upside. we do have one of our tests in the majority of the yard house's. we are using a provider.
just think about where yard house is located. it's embedded in a lifestyle center with no parking and so it's more difficult even for the last-mile provider to get in there and pick up the food. so, it's not a big part of the business. so, i don't really think about that as a way to grow the business. i think that, we need to make really good long-term decisions. we've been able to protect our margins in these businesses. we've got to continue to innovate and make them attractive. we also have to recognize -- there's a lot of volatility in these businesses. and it goes back to -- if you open an another restaurant that looks like you are in the same development. it's going to have a one year impact on the comps. and we have that once in a while. these are great brands. we're going to, obviously, try to compete a little differently as we go forward. i wouldn't look for a big change here in the next couple of quarters because we're going to test and learn and we're going to do it responsively. these are strong business models and i'm not going to put the brands on sale to get a headline number. we're going to protect the overall business for the long-term.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. i'm sorry to belabor the value point on olive garden. i just want to make sure i understand this correctly. you spent last year reducing some of the couponing or discounting and reserving that value power if you needed in the future. are you now suggesting you need that today, or is this still, it's in the reserve, but you are not really changing your view on increased value promotions in 2020 as it stands today?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
i mean as it stands today, i think, our position is exactly the same as it was the past couple of quarters that olive garden continues to perform extremely well, in over 300 basis points gap to the industry. we'll continue to look at each promotion, and what kind of support that promotion needs, depending what we're doing from a television standpoint. i do think that the analyst community and investor community is looking at things too much in isolation. and you don't have the whole picture of what's happening from overall media spend.
and because we run a tbi or a tbi test, you read into a situation that things must be bad. i think that's not the way to look -- to analyze our business. it's just one of many levers that we have to pull to support our business. and right now i think, we're looking at the olive garden business as being competing extremely well in the environment.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from jake bartlett from suntrust. your line is open.
jake bartlett -- suntrust -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. my question was about cheddar's, and i'm wondering where you think you are now in the kind of the integration of the business, the turnaround of operations, the improvements. and in the context of your acquisition strategy going forward. do you feel like you're in a position now where you might get more active on acquisitions?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
well, that's a two-part question. i think where are we on cheddar's? i think today, i'm more optimistic than i've ever been. i think, as i acknowledge in my opening comments there's still a ton of work to do there. this is a high volume complex operation that has some operational challenges that aren't systemic. where we have strong leadership and great human resource metrics, we're running great businesses.
we have to stabilize some of these other businesses and start with getting that right general manager in place, managing partner and then building a great team. so, i think that, i'm very encouraged, the hr metrics are really starting to improve. i'm encouraged that our operation metrics are improving. i'm encouraged that our controls are better today than ever. i'm encouraged that our restaurant is staffed. and i'm encouraged with the new insight that we've really uncovered that we've got a real awareness problem. and an awareness problem is with people within 10 miles of our restaurants. so i'm encouraged that we can solve that. but we're going to solve these problems for the long-term. we're going to build a strong foundation and we're going to do it right.
this represents less than 8% of our overall business and i'm really resolute in the fact that i want to fix this and fix it right for the long-term. i think this is still a huge opportunity. and as much urgency as i'm putting behind it, i'm more concerned about doing it right. as far as m&a activity, i use a standard statement. but the management and the board are going to continue to look at opportunities to add to our portfolio when it's appropriate. and i really have no further comment on that at this point in time.
jake bartlett -- suntrust -- analyst
got it. and i had a follow-up question on your level of incentives and your approach to incentives. and your traffic has been negative the last two quarters at olive garden, obviously, outperforming the space significantly. as you look at that, are you focused more on the outperformance or your absolute level? and i'm kind of wondering how long you're going to -- you would kind of tolerate negative traffic versus kind of trying to insert more incentives to try to drive that positive?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yes. first of all, let's look at the magnitude of the negative traffic. i mean half of the negative traffic that we reported last month is just due to catering delivery. and that piece of the off premise business grows -- we're not giving ourselves any guest counts for that. we're not doing that for multiple reasons. and we could go ahead and change our methodology and have positive traffic if we chose to do that.
i think that when we look at traffic and we look at the overall business, there are going to be times that there's traffic available to you and it's worth driving. there are other times when you look at the business, and you say, i'm ok with losing 10, or 15, 20 guests a week and being able to protect our business model. and so, i don't think you can just have, let's do everything we can to grow traffic, or let's do everything we can to protect our business model. i think it all has to be done in balance. and i think our management teams and this leadership team have done an outstanding job over the last four years of really balancing these efforts.
jake bartlett -- suntrust -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question is from chris o'cull from stifel. your line is open.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. good morning. first just a point of clarification and a question. is the $5 take home entree promotion considered a new off premise transaction, or is it just an add-on to the dining check? and then, gene, can you provide some more detail about how cheddar's plans to broaden reach with its advertising? and when we might start to see that investment?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yes. the $5 take home is an off premise transaction. and as far as cheddar's goes, i mean, we're out there testing and learning with different digital vehicles to see and other traditional media to see what we can -- what kind of awareness we can generate with that. so we're out there at a small scale and we'll continue to increase that scale as we learn.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
okay. great. thanks.
operator
our next question is from peter saleh from btig. your line is open.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great. thanks. gene, just a couple of questions on cheddar's, can we just go back and talk about the guest satisfaction scores, may be direction that you're seeing there? are those improving, or have those kind of started to go backwards? and then on the turnover at cheddar's both manager and the crew level, are those -- how far are those off of darden's average? how much more work is yet to be done there? thanks.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
good question, peter. guest satisfaction scores are increasing across the board as we've improved management, employee staffing and there is still opportunity there and i would say that the virgins, the differential between the better operating stores and the one for challenges is still too great and we've got to close that gap down. as far as turnover, the metrics are still outside darden norms, but they are inside industry norms for the first time, which is i think is a really good trend. and it's going to take us a while to get them -- hopefully get them to darden norms, but they are on their way and again inside industry trends at this point in time.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from jeffrey bernstein from barclays. your line is open.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you very much. one clarification first. gene, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the industry comps continued to weaken and then you did mention -- i wasn't -- i'm just trying to gauge whether you think it's older to tough compare because i think that was what you mention initially as a rationale or whether you do see that there is some sort of change in the consumer behavior, because when you look at past couple of quarters, it seems like the two-year trend on comp and traffic seems relatively stable. so, maybe you're looking at broader industry data that we don't get a chance to see more holistically or whether you think it's again more just the two-year comp compare being more difficult or where there's actual change in the consumer?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think that, i think it's a combination of both. i think that's what i was trying to allude to in the comment was that, the industry was facing some tougher comparison, but i think you all talked about that is that overall industry comparisons were little bit more difficult. but i think, what i was trying to get at is, we were surprised that it went all the way to negative. we thought that our view was to the industry would stay positive in this environment. it may not -- the growth rate would've come back just like, if you look at gdp growth, it's still strong, but it has decelerated. so, we were just i think a little surprised that the industry went all the way back to negative.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
understood. and then just want to talk about cheddar's, i'm just wondering things like the under-the-hood metrics are getting better and you seem excited about the opportunity longer term. i was just wondering whether frustration on the sales in the short-term might lead you to delay when you would otherwise ramp-up the new unit growth which seem like that was the big opportunity over time, i'm just wondering whether that timeframe might have changed or have been pushed back at all?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
only the timeframe has changed. i think we've been pretty consistent with our talking point around that is the biggest thing for a new unit ramp-up growth would be human resources and i'm not so sure that i haven't said that we won that battle yet. and so, every time you open a new restaurant, you make that investment, you got to have a great managing partner. and i don't think that we're there at that point yet that we can ramp-up growth. we're still doing five or six a year, which is the right number at this point in time. and i want -- i really want to see the management depth continue to build.
and then when you get to that point that's when you can start to ramp-up growth. but i don't think that's -- we haven't given a timeline to that and i'm going to give a timeline today. i'm focused on really, really getting great managing partners in these restaurants. and i know when we do that our likelihood of success increases dramatically.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst

operator
welcome to the darden fiscal year 2020 second quarter earnings call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to mr. kevin kalicak. you may begin.
kevin kalicak -- senior director of investor relations
thank you. carol. good morning everyone and thank you for participating on today's call. joining me on the call today are gene lee, darden's ceo; and rick cardenas, cfo.
as a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the securities and exchange commission.
we are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the investor relations section of our website at darden.com.
today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-gaap measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. we plan to release fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings on march 19, before the market opens followed by a conference call.
this morning, gene will share some brief remarks about the quarterly performance and business highlights, and then rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the second quarter. as a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated knapp-track excluding darden, specifically, olive garden and longhorn steakhouse.
during our fiscal second quarter industry total sales growth was 1.2%. industry same-restaurant sales increased 0.3%, and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 2.3%.
now i'll turn the call over to gene.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, kevin, and good morning everyone. as you've seen from our press release this morning, we had a good quarter. total sales from continuing operations were $2.06 billion, an increase of 4.2%, same-restaurant sales increased 2% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.12.
looking at the industry overall, we continue to see that consumers are willing to visit brand with compelling value and strong in-restaurant execution. that's why we remain relentlessly focused on executing our back to basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere, and supported with integrated marketing that resonates with our guests. we also continue to strengthen and leverage our four competitive advantages. one of those advantages is our results oriented culture at midst -- record low unemployment, i am proud to see our retention rates continue to improve. we have a compelling employment proposition and our ability to retain and staff our restaurants with the right people is an important driver of our success.
turning to brand highlights for the quarter. olive garden delivered its 21st consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth. total sales grew 2.6% driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 1.5% and 1.1% growth from new restaurants. olive garden outperformed the industry benchmark in same-restaurant sales and traffic by 120 basis points and 110 basis points respectively. as a reminder, olive garden had a difficult promotional ramp to start the quarter with lasagna mia comping over buy one take one for the first four weeks. additionally, we made some changes to our promotional messaging and we reduced marketing spending. as a result, we had to make up some ground from negative same restaurant sales at the beginning of the quarter. sales trends improved as we moved into never ending pasta bowl with more comparable marketing spend.
the olive garden team continues to focus on operational execution, convenience and everyday value, delivering exceptional guest experiences remain a key priority for the restaurant teams. olive garden also continued to meet their guests need for convenience as off-premise sales grew 17% during the quarter, driven by strong preference for the $5 take-home offer. for the quarter, off-premise sales represented 17% of total sales. digital sales grew approximately 33% and represented 38% of total to go sales. finally, as we noted last quarter, olive garden introduced a new weekday lunch menu with 21 options under $10 to strengthen everyday value. this platform continues to perform well and they're seeing meaningful improvements and lunch sales trends.
overall, i'm pleased with olive garden's performance. they have the right strategy in place and i'm confident that they will continue to make the appropriate investments and execute at a high level which will enable them to continue to grow market share.
longhorn steakhouse had an outstanding quarter. total sales grew 8.4% driven by 1.7% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 6.7%. the brands 27th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth. longhorn outperformed the industry benchmark in same-restaurant sales and traffic by 640 basis points and 550 basis points respectively. longhorn performance is a result of adhering to their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement. over the last four years, the team has made significant investments in this strategy and those investments continue to pay-off.
during the quarter, they introduced several enhancements to existing core menu items to further strengthen the quality of their food and beverage. and in order to tell their quality story more effectively, the longhorn team evolved their award winning you can't fake steak advertising campaign to better communicate their expertise and showcase their high quality steaks. the overall longhorn experience is a key differentiator and their distinctive relevant advertising continues to resonate with guest. longhorn, we've designed a very simple business and the operations team has done an excellent job of finding opportunities to simplify, to drive execution.
during the quarter and they implemented a number of ideas that were the result of direct feedback from restaurant teams. additionally, our renewed focus on execution standards led to improved throughput during the busiest weekend hours this quarter. and finally, longhorn continues to leverage the biggest competitive advantage, their unique culture. manager retention reached another all-time high during the quarter and hourly retention rates remained at industry-leading levels. this high level of engagement is further evidenced by the fact that longhorn's guest satisfaction rating for the quarter reached record levels across all key metrics. i'm extremely proud of the discipline, the longhorn leadership team brings to the business and i'm confident that adhering to their long-term strategy will continue to drive their momentum.
cheddar's scratch kitchen total sales increased 4.2% driven by sales growth from new restaurants of 5.4% and partially offset by same-restaurant sales decline of 1.2%. we continue to see improvement in cheddar's hr and operations metrics, which we know are foundational elements of running great restaurants. i'm encouraged by these trends, knowing that the restaurants that have made these improvements are operating successfully. overall staffing levels for manager and team members remained strong during the quarter and retention levels continue to move in the right direction. hourly turnover improved by nearly 20 points compared to last year and management turnover showed meaningful improvement as well.
from an operations perspective, cheddar's is a high volume business that requires efficient throughput. one of the key operations metrics the team focused on during the quarter was speed of service, and they saw a significant improvement versus last year. in fact, they saw strong improvement in the guest experience across all key metrics compared to last year. in addition to strengthening hr and operating fundamentals, the team also worked to improve the appeal of the amazing value cheddar's office. in october, they began providing every guests with their most craveable and higher -- highest-rated menu item, their honey butter croissants. this is an element of guest service that we identify as an opportunity when we acquired the brand. providing every guests with a warm, honey butter croissant reinforces the wow! value cheddar's provides. after making the necessary operational adjustments to facilitate this new step of service, and given the overall improvements in the -- the operations teams have made, this was the right time to roll it out. and the response from the guest and team members has been very positive.
as i shared on the last call, this quarter the cheddar's team increased their working media spend and conducted numerous test and learnings using a variety of marketing channels to drive awareness and trial. they are in the early stages of this learning and still have a lot of work to do. they will continue to invest the time, effort and resources in order to determine the most effective way to market the brand in the future.
while i'm encouraged by the results we're seeing, the work at cheddar's is far from over. the team is working on the right priorities and i'm confident they are moving in the right direction. and finally the holidays is the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they delight our guest and help create lasting holiday memories. this time of the year is also a great reminder that being of service is at the heart of our business. we embrace a higher purpose of enhancing people's lives, which is why we serve with purpose to delight our guest, support our team members and make a better tomorrow. one of the ways we're working to make a better tomorrow is through our harvest program.
one in eight households in our country live without consistent access to food. to help fight hunger, every one of our restaurants donate surplus food to local food banks and non-profits in their communities on a weekly basis. more than 150 million pounds of food has been donated through this program, that's the equivalent of nearly 96 million meals. the impact of our harvest program takes on added significance during the holidays, and i'm so proud of the passion our team members have for it.
on behalf of the management team and the board of directors, i want to thank our 185,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guests and communities. i wish all of you a wonderful holiday season. now i will turn it over to rick.
rick cardenas -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, gene, and good morning everyone. we had another good quarter with second quarter total sales growth of 4.2% driven by 2.2% growth from the addition of 37 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2%. as i mentioned in last quarter's call, same-restaurant sales benefited by about 80 basis points this quarter driven by two factors. first, an increase of approximately 100 basis points due to thanksgiving moving from the second quarter in fiscal 2019 into the third quarter in fiscal 2020. as a reminder, the third quarter should see a corresponding decrease to same-restaurant sales because of this shift. and second, approximately 20 basis points of headwind due to the impact of hurricane dorian early in the second quarter.
second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.12, an increase of 21.7% from last year's diluted net earnings per share. we paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $136 million in shares, returning over $240 million to our shareholders this quarter. additionally, this quarter we had $0.91 of adjustments to our reported diluted net earnings per share. this was primarily the result of a $147 million pre-tax charge related to the termination of our primary non contributory defined benefit pension plan, most of which was non-cash. the termination of this plan and the anticipated expense was previously communicated in our fiscal 2019 form 10-k.
now turning to our detailed margin results. food and beverage costs were 20 basis points favorable to last year as pricing of just over 2% and continued cost savings initiatives offset commodity inflation of approximately 1.7% and continued investments. second quarter restaurant labor was unfavorable at 10 basis point to last year. total labor inflation of 4% was offset by pricing, check mix and productivity improvements in new and existing restaurants. we continue to manage labor well in this environment, given the heightened inflationary pressures we still face.
marketing expense was 30 basis points unfavorable to last year. approximately 40% of this was related to longhorn marketing timing shift from the first to the second quarter, and the remainder was driven by increased media spending in our other segment, primarily cheddar's. as a result, restaurant level ebitda margin of 6. -- 16.5% was 20 basis points lower than last year.
general and administrative expense was 40 basis points better than last year, as we wrapped on higher incentive expense and sales leverage. our second quarter effective tax rate of 5.9% was favorably impacted by the resolution of prior year's tax projects that were contemplated in our earlier guidance. excluding these projects, our effective tax rate would have been closer to 11% for the quarter. all of this culminated in adjusted earnings after tax margin of 6.7%, 90 basis points higher than last year.
turning to our segment performance. olive garden grew sales and profit in the quarter driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. segment profit margin increased by 20 basis points by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing cost effectively.
longhorn, also grew sales and segment profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. however, segment profit margin decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to the marketing timing shift i mentioned earlier, which increased marketing as a percent of sales in the quarter for longhorn. in addition, longhorn continued to have slightly elevated beef inflation while making continued investments during the quarter. the fine dining segment grew sales and profit in the quarter as well, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth.
segment profit margin decreased versus last year 10 basis points due to higher pre-opening expense and inefficiencies related to our four new restaurants opened year-to-date. sales for our other business segment grew at 3.5%, driven by net new restaurants. both segment profit dollars and margin decreased this quarter due to incremental marketing expense primarily at cheddar's and margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales growth.
as you saw in the press release this morning, we reiterated all aspects of our fiscal 2020 outlook. as we look forward to the second half of fiscal 2020, we feel confident in our ability to achieve same-restaurant sales between 1% to 2% for the year resulting in adjusted diluted net earnings per share of between $6.30 and $6.45.
finally, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we will modify the reporting of same-restaurant sales to align with our four reportable business segments. olive garden, longhorn steakhouse, fine dining and other business. this change will better align the current reporting of segment profit with reportable segment sales growth metrics. before i close, i'd like to wish all of 185,000 team members and each of you a safe and happy holiday season.
and with that, we'll take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from brian bittner from oppenheimer. please go ahead.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thank you. good morning guys. my question is just on olive garden. the slowdown in comps in the quarter, it seems like you're saying this is mostly related to tough promotion, tough marketing comparisons early on in the quarter. have you seen performance in the business improve enough to have the confidence to say that these issues are in the transitory at olive garden and maybe even that they're behind you?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think we were pretty clear on how sales performed throughout the quarter. we definitely had a tough ramp and i think that we signaled that at the end of the first quarter that lasagna mia wasn't performing as well as we had hoped. we pulled the promotional advertising for that promotion, and we focused on the introduction of $5 take-homes. i did say -- as i stated, as we introduced never ending pasta bowl, and had comparable marketing trends, trends improved throughout the quarter and i would say is -- how we feel about the business is really in how we think about our guidance for the year. we've come back out and reconfirmed our guidance and we feel as though that that business continues to perform well, it continues to take market share in the industry and we're comfortable with where we are at.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thank you, gene.
operator
our next question comes from sara senatore from bernstein. please go ahead.
sara senatore -- sanford c bernstein & co -- analyst
hi. thank you. i just wanted to ask sort of a bigger picture question about the brands. it sort of looks to me like longhorn and cheddar's, you made investments behind marketing or value, and you saw real improvement in the top line, and i know you talked about the tough lapse from olive garden, but the fact that the margins were better sort of advances a different trade off. so do you have an opportunity to push a little bit harder on value for olive garden, maybe a little more level loaded through the quarter. and when you think about how you value those trade-offs, maybe lower margin, but great concept at longhorn, for example, how do you think about that trade-off generally and then perhaps with each of the brands? thank you.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's a great question sara. when we did know that longhorn was performing really well throughout the quarter and we made the decision not to push extra trps into olive garden to try to make up for the slow start we had in the quarter, we have levers to pull if we need to and we chose not to pull them and decided to let the quarter play out the way it did, and that's the best the beauty of the portfolio. we knew that we had really great strength in longhorn and we didn't up the marketing spend, we actually spent less money in advertising, marketing in the second quarter than we did the prior year. so i think we -- i think that we have always pulled back and say what's going on in the business.
i do think, as we do go forward, we will continue to look at how we use value in olive garden to drive same-restaurant sales, but also compete effectively against our competitors. and we'll have to continue to watch what our competitors are doing, and we'll have to match that intensity. olive garden is -- when you look at what olive garden's accomplished over the last four years, it's incredibly impressive. and we believe that it is positioned to continue to dominate in casual dining, and i believe we have more leverage than most to pull to support that business.

our next question comes from john glass from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much. if i could just follow up on longhorn. maybe i missed just what the combination of things were that really drove that material acceleration, but can you just revisit that specifically. and it sounds like some incremental marketing or something changing the promotional environment and made some promotion with advertising environment. how sustainable is that or is that you put forward so that you can't maybe replicate it in future quarters or is this a new run rate of advertising promotional so we should think about this is maybe -- you've taken a permanent step up in that brand from a sales perspective?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
john we had two extra weeks of media in the quarter. you saw that in the restaurant level expenses. i wouldn't give that a lot of credence for the increase in same-restaurant sales. i think long -- i think, as i said the longhorn team has been investing in this business for four years. every state today is bigger or better than it was four years ago. they have invested in the bread service, they've invested in many other aspects of the overall operation. but i think the most unique thing about longhorn, in this environment is that it is a smaller box with less employees than the average casual dining restaurant. their ability to attract a top quality employee, train them well and retain them, i believe allow enables them to execute at a higher level. and if i was to point to one thing that is driving that business, it's that single attribute right there.
to answer your question, is this a sustainable trend? i don't know -- i know -- all i know is this team has made has had a great discipline for four years, made a lot of really good investments and i believe that they continue to do the right things every single day for their team members and their guests. and again it's a unique operation because it's much smaller and inside of smaller box and they deliver at a high level, and it all came together this quarter, combined with a couple of extra weeks of media and they had a great quarter.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you that's very helpful. and rick just on the commodity front, specifically beef, i know you talked about where inflation is and you given us your coverage through at least may and thinking about low single-digits. but is anything changed on the margin. are you incrementally more concerned about particularly proteins as you think about calendar 2020 in total. and there's obviously been a lot of noise and incremental discussion in the marketplace around asf and how that may impact protein pricing?
rick cardenas -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, john. we still feel comfortable of our guidance for total commodity inflation of 1% or 2%. we were a little higher -- at the higher end of that range of 1.7% this quarter. a couple of things on beef. we're really not seeing significant changes to what we thought would be in the beef market. the only thing we are seeing from asf right now, as we said a couple of quarters ago, we only have about 2% of our port -- of our buyers pork, but there could be an impact 18 months from now in the overall proteins. we are seeing a little bit in ground beef right now, but we're covered for the year on ground beef. so we still feel really good about where we are. chicken, we're starting to see a little bit of inflation, but again we're covered for that as well.

our next question comes from the line of david tarantino from baird. please go ahead.
david tarantino -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
hi. good morning. i'm wondering, just related to further strategy on advertising and media heading into the election year. normally we see media cost increase and just wondering, gene, how the brands are planning to manage through that type of environment. and if you expect any differences there?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yes. great question, david. i think we'll continue to focus on our non working media spend to see how much we can pull that down to help offset the inflation, but we will try to spend from media standpoint at the same level without increasing the overall spend for the brand. i think as you know, as you get around the elections, especially when you're doing a lot of national stuff and some spot television, you can get bumped, and try and make sure that we get our full complement of advertising as we move into the last six months prior to election, depending on the marketplace will be a challenge. we'll try to work around that. we've got other levers that we can pull social, we got tdis, we've got some other things that we can do to help offset that if we're not getting our full complement of advertising. but we'll continue to work and focus on making sure or as lean as we possibly can be on our non-working so that we can maybe shift a little bit more of that into working to offset the inflation.
david tarantino -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
great. and then rick just a quick one on the margins. i think there has been several quarters in a row of productivity and mix cited as a pretty nice offset to the labor inflation you're seeing. just wondering what the sustainability of that looks like and whether you're starting to lap that at any point in the next few quarters?
rick cardenas -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
a couple of things. one, we've said quite a few times that we don't expect to have labor below last year for quite a while as we keep inflation and so this quarter played out, we're about 10 basis points lower than last year in labor. the productivity, if you remember, a lot of that started with new restaurants last year around the third quarter and we started to see a little bit of an increase in productivity from new restaurants. that's just started lapping itself. so we still feel pretty good about managing our labor well, the way based on inflation, what's going on now, and we've all contemplated in that -- in our guidance of 1% to 2% total inflation.
david tarantino -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
all right. thank you.

our next question comes from jeff bernstein from barclays. please go ahead.
jeff bernstein -- barclays capital -- analyst
great. thank you very much. two questions as well. first one, gene, you mentioned watching your competitors closely, i'm just wondering in that being as you think about casual dining broadly, do you think maybe you're seeing an increased promotional activity and maybe that would change your marketing approach in the back half of your fiscal '20, whether it's in response to what competitors are doing or whether you feel the need to be a leader in terms of being more promotional or a change in your promotional cadence. any thoughts on the industry broadly would be great?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think what we're seeing in the industry is that there is more -- there is more pressure on some promotional constructs that have now become permanent parts of menus. you've got a big competitor out there that's stated they're going to be continue to be very, very aggressive. but i continue to look at -- when i look at knapp and black box, i continue to look at the check average is growing north of 2.5%. so the consumer is still paying 2.5% a plus -- or plus more. so i think that you've got to -- we've got to stay on top of what's happening in the industry. we need to make sure that we're offering value in our large brands across the platform. so some value in price, some value in portion, as we try to attract and talk to each and all the different constituents as we have for consumers.
i would say that olive garden is the value leader, and that we need to stay focused on that in making sure that we have the appropriate price point for all the consumers that want to use olive garden. and i think that we have the ability to lead in that, not just follow.
jeff bernstein -- barclays capital -- analyst
got it. and my follow-up is just as we think about the fiscal '20 outlook. rick, you mentioned guidance unchanged and that's now the first two quarters of this year, and it seems like it's contrary to past practice of thinking of darden has gotten conservatively and more from the not beating and raising. so i'm just wondering if maybe you enter this year guiding more aggressively for the year or maybe fundamentals have eased relative to your expectation a little bit. i'm just wondering if maybe you're a little bit more cautious as we move through or into the back half of the fiscal year, what might have changed relative to historical practice of being able to beat the conservative start to the year guidance?
rick cardenas -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. jeff, every year at the beginning of the year when we guide -- we guide what we think is appropriate and we adjust as things play out. and things have been playing out exactly as we thought, which is why we haven't changed our guide. in the past things have been a little bit better than what we thought in the beginning of the year. so that's why we've adjusted up. but i wouldn't say that we are -- we were more aggressive in this year's guide than we have in the past. we use the same philosophy that we always have. it just happens that the first quarter and the second quarter didn't outperform what we thought as much as it has in the prior year, that's why we didn't raise our performance.
and we still have, coming into the back half of this fiscal year chances of weather, chances of election and everything else is going on in talking about consumers having other things to think about. so again we didn't change anything, the way we've done things in the past, and we feel pretty good about where our guide is right now.

our next question comes from chris carril from rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
christopher carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking the question. so i'm curious to hear your current thinking on the off-premise opportunity? and in particular, how the performance of the $5 take-home offer and the sequential acceleration in off-premise growth may impact your thought process on off-premise strategy today? thanks.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think that $5 take-home has been a great addition to the off-premise menu for olive garden. it's been well received from -- by consumers who will continue to evolve that platform over time. we think this continues to upside there. as we focus on off-premise, our biggest initiative is to improve the convenience for our consumer. we go back to, we know the two most important things are on time and accurate. and as we continue to grow this business, we focus on those two things with the addition of ensuring that we have the right capabilities in each one of our restaurants. we're investing capital dollars into our restaurants to ensure that we have the space and the right equipment to handle the additional demand. and that's a big -- that will be a big effort over the next 12 to 18 months. and we think that we can take a little more friction out for the consumer.
this is a very highly rated experience for our consumer, and we'll continue to focus on executing at a high level. as long as the consumer demand is still there, we think there's opportunity to grow it -- grow this space. and i'm really excited about what we're doing. but more importantly what excites me about what we're doing from an off-premise standpoint is the quality of the experience and the quality of the product that's leaving our restaurant. and i believe that's why our business continues to grow.

will slabaugh -- stephens inc -- analyst
yes. thanks guys. i had a question on cheddar's. i know you're not where you want to be quite yet, but it was a nice improvement from what we've seen. and you mentioned some improved turnover and customer metrics that -- but there were something else. i was wondering if you might point to in the quarter that helped improve the two year trend i think well over 400 basis points would love to hear your thoughts there?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yes, well. bottom line is that we're operating better. we've got more stability. i'm starting to see a culture develop inside of cheddar's for the first time, one culture, right. so you go back to when we did the acquisition, we had these three distinct cultures and then for the first time i'm feeling like we're cheddar's of one. and i've said all along, this is not a brand issue, this is an operations issue and i think our teams are making significant progress. and we've got stability in a lot of places for the first time. and again this is the beginning of a journey. but if you look at the power of longhorn, we have the stability and what we're able to accomplish, gaining 20 points a reduction in our employee turnover is huge. and i think we can do -- i think we can continue to do that again. and so that's was -- that's really what's got me excited. i think we're just doing a better job.
i had lunch in cheddar's this week, it was fantastic. it was the best experience i ever had in cheddar's. and so, i mean that's why i think we're starting to make improvement. it is still, as i said, there is still pockets in the company where we don't have that stability yet, we don't have that tenure and we haven't developed that culture but we are in a much better path.

our next question comes from gregory francfort from bank of america. please go ahead.
analyst
hey. thanks for the question. i just had two. the first one was on, you mentioned turnover at longhorn, can you maybe frame that up versus either the industry or versus maybe its historical levels. is it down. is it just may be up less than the industry as i guess, what was the commentary meant to suggest. and then the other question i had was on off-premise. it's been i think a couple of years since, gene, you've given some thoughts on the competitive push into off-premise. and i think a few of your competitors have gone into third-party partnerships. they've grabbed a few points of sales but the profitably is becoming more of a focus. can you maybe give where your updated thoughts are on third-party delivery, particularly small order? thanks.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
sure. when i think of longhorn, i would just say the management turnover is sub 15% and it's less than 10% at the managing partner level, which is very, very important. and i think compared to industry of mid 30s, i mean we're -- that's just it's industry leading, it's leading inside of darden, we have tremendous tenure there and most important, we have tremendous pride in that business. and so that's a big thing. employee turnover is in the low 60s, that's looking much more like one of our upscale businesses and so you can do so many different things. think about the lack of training costs that we have in that business and the rest of our businesses, because we're so far below the industry, but especially that one there, and i think that really leads to great operations. and i think that's what's been driving.
on off-premise, our position hasn't changed on off-premise with the last mile delivery. we believe today we want to control the experience. we do have off-premise last mile delivery in olive garden, again i'll remind everybody $75 -- above $75 and if you let us, if you call it before 5 o'clock and before we will deliver. that's a big business, it's a growing business for us. we've got an average check in the 300s, that's business, it's really worth chasing and doing. so we're in our own way.
but as i think -- as we think about it as a team, we really like controlling that experience and we get back to those two most -- those two critical aspects the consumer is looking for, on-time and accurate. and we control those when we control the overall experience. so our position on the last mile delivery companies has not changed.

dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you. gene, just wanted to ask a bit more about olive garden. looking ahead, good to hear that the trend accelerated through the quarter, but just wondering if you could talk a bit more about contributions from key drivers going forward to continue to support this outperformance. you talked quite a bit about off-premise. is there anything more kind of on the strength of the operational execution, how impact will that continue to be the lunch gains you mentioned thinking ahead, promotional dry powder. maybe your thoughts on the innovation pipeline and just kind of anything else to kind of continue to support the outperformance that you've seen for quite some time now? thanks.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
i think off-premise will continue to be a driver. i think the $5 take-home platform will continue to be a strong driver. there's a lot of innovation that we can still do in that platform. i think that we've got other platforms out there that will continue to strengthen whether it's buy one take one, never ending pasta bowl, i think that the promotional pipeline continues to be strong. and i think that i want to pivot back to, i think this is an important time that we focus on running great restaurant and staffing is the most critical thing that we face today in this employment environment. and so we need to make sure that our olive garden's remain staffed with great people. we need to continue to focus on improving our employment proposition. these are high volume restaurants and we -- and i think that we win if we have the best people inside the box. i'm comfortable with our ability to create a strategy to continue the momentum and i think there are drivers out there.

our next question comes from brett levy from mkm partners. please go ahead.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
great. thank you. good morning, everyone. first, i guess, can you share a little bit more on the granularity of the calendar shift. was that 100 basis points largely split evenly or was that -- did you see any major shift among brands? and then also, did you see anything within the regionality? and then, i know you don't like to give intra-quarter type updates and i know you talked about how you had a softer start to the quarter, but strengthened throughout. is it possible to quantify what the market share gains were versus on the gaap later in the quarter versus earlier. and then finally, is there anything that you saw fundamentally operationally at olive garden from a score relation guest satisfaction, quantifying the turnover that can help substantiate and support just the dominant position that the brand is generally in? thank you.
rick cardenas -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hey, brett. it's rick. in regards to the calendar shift. lot of questions here. but in regards to the calendar shift, they impacted -- it impacted brand differently. so the casual brands were impacted favorably in general and the finer dining brands were impacted unfavorably in general, and each brand was impacted a little differently. within the casual brands cheddar's having the smallest positive impact. the regionality of that really wasn't that different. so it's basically account of thanksgiving shift was no different in one region and another, the only regionality would be whether.
as a -- in market share gap for the quarter by month, we don't really want to get into the change in share gap by months other than what gene said about olive garden being negative in the first month and having to dig out of that a little bit to get to be positive for the quarter. and then on operating metrics for olive garden specifically, they're operating metrics are at all time highs. so there is guest satisfaction, a lot of their different metrics operationally are all-time highs and they were at all-time highs for every month of the quarter. so hopefully that answers those questions, but thanks brett.

our next question comes from nicole miller from piper jaffray. please go ahead.
nicole miller -- piper jaffray -- analyst
thank you. good morning. there is a lot of discussion around value proposition in olive garden. i'm wondering when you do see the value proposition and how you look at your perspective move one way or another and you've in your -- in the dining rooms, does that show up in a demographic shift? does every demographic want or seek value in the same way, or do you see some more or less sensitive to value?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think that nicole, it's an interesting question. i think that for some of our consumer -- because it's such a broad audience, some of our consumer values a lot more about what they pay from a dollar standpoint, and they are looking for that entry level price point for some of our consumers value is more about portion size compared to price. and so we tried to find value for for everybody a little bit differently and i think you have to -- in a brand that has such broad appeal, you have to have value and everything as just which part is important, the numerator, the denominator. we know that there is a guest base inside of olive garden that play -- that price plays a very important part of their decision making, and we have to have an offer out there, a lot of the time, so that they will come to us. if they don't have an offer they will go some place else. we know that through our token analysis.
but we also know that there are folks out there that look at value on say chicken alfredo when we increased the size of the portion of chicken, the value scores went way up and that was very important to them, but that's on an entry level price point in olive garden. and so we've got to think across a broad spectrum and define value different for each opportunity, but we have to have something for that consumer that is very deal oriented and we know we have to have that out -- have to have something out there most of the time.
nicole miller -- piper jaffray -- analyst
that's -- i was thinking about it in that kind of bigger, broader looking forward context of how do you millennial seek value. so i think if you could remind us the prime casual diner olive garden years around the 30 years old age and the millennial population is getting ready to peak in size of being in that age as a demographic cohort, is it too early for olive garden to be thinking about how to to benefit from that, or whether they just actually naturally benefit from that change?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean the prime demographic is 35 to 55 for olive garden, and we've talked about the fact that population for the prime dining out years are going to start to grow and continue to grow for a while. i would say when we think about millennials, i think the one thing that millennials have also see economic background like to do is have a lot of choice. they like to build their own meal that's why cucina mia has worked so well for that cohort. but i would tell you that millennials that are -- have lower incomes are looking for value, just the way other groups look for value at that point in time. and i think we have to be careful with growth generalizations of this cohort as they transition into the next phase of their life. we over indexed with millennials. this is a very millennial friendly brand. it is very -- a very social brand, and i would tell you that millennials love the value of olive garden because they can stretch their dollars.

dan salmon -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. this is actually dan on for andrew today. we saw sort of mixed performance across some of the polished casual where trends have been a bit more challenge recently? you talked about some of the incremental marketing spend at cheddar's and longhorn, but i know last quarter you also spoke about potentially adding some marketing spend around some of those smaller portfolio brands as well. so, you end up doing that and if you did, can you just kind of give us an update on how those initiatives are performing and how you think it will work given the lack of national scale?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think the brand that we made the most progress in was a yard house and the yard house was positive before the thanksgiving shift. so we are very -- we are very pleased to see that, and so we'll continue to find ways to try to use digital to promote these brands. we're doing a lot of test and learn in those brands also to try to be effective. we're trying to make -- we're making progress in all of those brands. i would say that seasons as rick alluded to, seasons was the most impacted by the holiday switch. i think we're making progress in that business.

our next question comes from chris o'cull from stifel. please go ahead.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
yes. thanks, good morning. gene, i know the company had indicated cheddar's would be testing some these various marketing initiatives, but did these test have a material impact on the comp performance during the quarter. and when do you think we could see some of these tests being implemented more broadly?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
i think they have. i don't know if they had a meaningful impact. i mean, they had some sort of impact on the quarter. i would tell you that this -- we're testing some of this activity on a very small scale, trying to get an understanding of what can move the needle. i would say that this is an evolution. i think that we need to continue to use a new store development backfill strategies, so that we can become more efficient in some more markets to really make some of the stuff, pay out a little bit more positively. so i don't know, i can't give you a time to say, hey, this is what we think we're going to have this all figured out.
i would also add that in the digital world today it is very, very dynamic, and i think test and learn and digital is going to be something that companies are going to be doing forever, because there continues to be new avenues and new channels and what you can get to your consumer, and that audience is very fickle today compared to what it used to be with spot tv. so i think test and learn is going to be part of our vernacular for a long time.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
that's great. and then i know you mentioned olive garden's comps improved during the quarter, but i'm curious whether the check benefit from the $5 take-home was somewhat negated by the never ending pasta bowl promotion?
rick cardenas -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
chris, this is rick. the check benefit from the $5 take-home was not negated by the nepb, never ending pasta bowl. it was really the lunch investment that we made earlier in the fiscal year that drove our checked down. if you think about olive garden check, olive garden's check grew by 2.7% for the quarter. 2% of that was pricing, about 80 basis points was catering and everything else washed. so if you think about the 80 basis points of catering you can think about that like guest counts, since we don't talk about -- we don't give them credit for guests. but to answer your question, no $5 take-home was not offset by nepb.

gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
hey peter. we're still testing. there's really no further update. we continue to analyze the results, but at this point in time, we're just in the same 10% and we'll continue to watch how that's maturing.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
is there anything you're looking for in particular before you decide whether it just scrap it all together or move forward?

our next question comes from jeff farmer from gordon haskett. please go ahead.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
great, thanks. on the june earnings call, i believe you commented that your concepts were seeing some, i think you described it as day-to-day and week-to-week sales volatility. i'm just curious if that volatility has continued and if it has what that might signal about the consumer and their demand for casual dining more broadly?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean i think it's -- we've got -- we've had some huge calendar swings. so i think the volatility on a comparative basis is still there. i know, i think the environment is a little bit better than it has been in a while. i think that employment is still strong, confidence is rebounding. i think the near term risk of a recession has receded. so i feel pretty good about the overall environment right now and i don't think that us as a team, we get too worried about day-to-day, week-to-week and volatility. i mean it's still there. there's volatility around what your competitors are doing and what we're doing, and we're not -- we're cognizant of trying to match promotional weeks, but we've had much -- we've been much more willing to make longer term decisions and let there be a little bit of volatility week-to-week with our marketing activities. so it's made some that makes a little harder to read in the short-term. in the long-term it all works out.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
and then just as a follow-up to that in terms of some of the volatility that you've seen with the consumer demand side despite incredibly strong consumer metrics, that sort of break down in that very strong relationship historically, meaning if you saw a good consumer trends, good consumer health metrics. you typically saw a pretty nice casual dining same-store sales. you guys pointed out that that had softened up a little bit, any further comment on that?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's -- my way of a real brief comment on at this marketplace is going to be defined by winners and losers. if you have a strong value proposition and you're executing at a high level, and that execution is going to be driven by your employment proposition, and this environment attracting, retaining great employees has never been more difficult and those that can do that with a strong value proposition are going to win.

katherine fogertey -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great, thank you. i wanted to touch a little bit on the off-premise at olive garden. you talked about overall sales starting the quarter pretty soft and then improving. did you see similar trends in off-premise especially kind of when you take away the $5 take-home, as it kind of focus on the traffic that you're seeing from people placing orders 5:00 pm at a time, $75 and higher threshold. did you see softness there in the beginning of the quarter and that improve or was that business behaving differently?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
again a little too granular, they're all i would say is that our delivery program continues to grow at a good a good pace. and net when we're -- when we're doing never ending pasta bowl that's not a great time. i mean it's not one of our best periods for off-premise comp, it's just not a promotional item that lend itself to that. but overall, i would just say that, if $5 take-home was a big, big piece of what we have for a new offering, it got people excited, but our overall off-premise business continues to grow with consumer demand, and i'm not going to get into a much more detail than that.
katherine fogertey -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then, you gave some good color around the 100 basis point benefit from the thanksgiving shift by some brand. but curious if you would help us understand a little bit more. was it olive garden that benefited more than longhorn, or was that benefit can be equally split?

hi, thank you. i heard your comments that you made on obviously some of the upscale brands actually being hurt by thanksgiving. but could you talk about, are there any other common themes in upscale that are kind of noteworthy at this point. and i guess, gene, would you expect the upscale brands to actually be performing better today for where we are in the economic cycle and we are in the stock market, for example. and is there anything darden can do self-help to improve those?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean let's -- thanksgiving has turned into one of the biggest days and an upscale and they didn't have that in the second quarter. so i think that -- i think these upscale brands are performing really well. i mean we have two of the best upscale brands out there today, very high volume with the capital grille and eddie v's, and they continue to perform at high level. so i'm excited about what they have going forward. as i've said before, i think their books look good through the holidays and these are exciting businesses and i'm very pleased with their overall performance.
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
and i may have missed the number, how big the calendar shift actually was there in the second quarter. and could you also comment on some of the brands between olive garden and longhorn and the two fine dining brands?
rick cardenas -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hey, john, it's rick. the calendar shift for darden was 100 basis points favorable. as i said on the call the casual brands were benefited by that and the upscale fine dining brands were hurt. and the upscale fine dining brands were hurt more than the casual dining brands were helped, but the casual dining brands are bigger, that's why we're at about 100 basis points.
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. all right, understood. thank you for that. and then the brands in the middle?
rick cardenas -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
they weren't really many brands in the middle. we've pretty much have casual. i also mentioned that cheddar's was the least benefited of the casual brands and again, everything is fine dining, the take reservations was hurt.
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, thank you for that. but also, like when we talk about yard house for example, we talked about bahama breeze, even seasons 52. i mean, again, these are higher ticket brands than olive garden and longhorn. one you actually expect that the consumer would trade up to those brands in the current economic environment, current stock market. is there anything as you kind of look at what darden can do on the self-help basis to kind of improve those businesses. is there anything that we should be considering, obviously the brand in itself is that big but together, certainly they are?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yes, john, i think we've talked about in the past. i think that these brands are in some of the best retail trade areas in the united states. they continue to face competitive intrusion. and you have to fight that competitive intrusion off. they are small enough for a one or two restaurants being down a significant number. it can have an impact on the overall business. as i said, i'm pleased with the trends in yard house. seasons we're making progress in seasons. we've been able to pull out of a lot of the discounting that was happening in that business, which we believe was a good long-term decision that's put -- that's had an impact on the headline number. bahama breeze, we've had some competitive intrusion. we've also cannibalized ourselves in our biggest market orlando, opening up a couple of restaurants that have had an impact on the overall system and we know there is -- we know this market. well, those are places where we want to have restaurants, but right now, there has been some cannibalization, i don't really pay a whole lot of attention to some of those top line numbers, i pay a lot of attention to the individual restaurants in each group and i understand how they're performing. these are well positioned brands. i continue to perform well, but they are in the best trade areas in america and they're facing competition.
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from matt difrisco from guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
matt difrisco -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
thank you. just a little bit of a different track here. i guess, on growth, a lot of people always look at sort of the smaller brands cheddar's and others to be the growth vehicle, but longhorns' one that really, you've done a tremendous turnaround on the margin side. roe positioned for a little bit better growth ahead. i think you're maybe eight net stores you've added over the last 12 months seems a little low. you're only in about 13 or 14 states. so there's certainly a lot more room for growth. i'm just curious what has been the governor to that. why can't that brand, go back to its growth, your days and could that be on the cusp ahead?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think that there is a growth opportunity with longhorn, i mean we're concentrating on entering new territory slowly, and we're focused on trying to backfill where we have opportunities. we think the governor to growth is the human capital. this is a brand that is very important how we develop our culture and how we run it, but we are on a path to do 15 to 20 this year, which is a pretty good number. we haven't opened up any longhorn's in california. that's really the last big territory available to us. we are going to open up a restaurant this spring in california, see how the brand is received. we will open a few more and will support that.
but we're very pleased with this and i love the control growth, because to me that's where we're in 43 states. so i don't know where you got your your number from.
matt difrisco -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
i'm sorry about that.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
longhorn's in 43 states today, over 500 units, closing on $2 billion brand. we're going to continue to grow this. this brand has growth opportunity, we're going to grow it responsibly.
matt difrisco -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
sorry about that. i was thinking you have an average of 13 in a state. that's what i was saying. just also i guess, we've been checking a lot -- a lot of these smaller brands have been closing down, is there that opportunity when you look at where you would grow longhorn? does it have to be necessarily a new site or are there opportunities, maybe more in this economic cycle where you could sort of take over an existing restaurant that just won't belly up and it's sitting next to a couple of olive garden's or in a market with a couple of olive garden's where you can get some synergies?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
we look at every real estate opportunities. what is the best way? we will -- if the building has a good enough structure, we will do a rehab. we've done a few of those. if we don't believe the building has the structured to really be a good place for a long run over 30 years, then we'll blow it -- we'll tear it down, but each individual site is evaluated with -- through an economic lines and say, which is the best economic outcome for the investment.
matt difrisco -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
excellent. thank you so much.

our next question comes from stephen anderson from maxim group. please go ahead.
stephen anderson -- maxim group -- analyst
yes. good morning. i wanted to follow up with you on the off-premise opportunity and specifically at cheddar's seeing that you've built out a good infrastructure over at olive garden and at longhorn. just wanted to see what's your thoughts are as three as you build out your marketing capabilities as cheddar's, what role off-premise will play and online mobile ordering will play there?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yes, stephen, good question. we have not had any emphasis on improving our off-premise sales in cheddar's. we believe this to be a big opportunity and it's an opportunity that we will tackle over the next 6 to 18 months. we need to go back and we need to develop good processes, understand what the -- develop good capabilities, implement online ordering which is not accessible today, all those things are growth opportunity in there. it all will be sequenced in when we believe we have the right operational capabilities to handle it. but you have identified a future growth vehicle for cheddar's.
stephen anderson -- maxim group -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from jake bartlett from suntrust. please go ahead.
jake bartlett -- suntrust -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. gene, it was the second quarter of last year that you talked about more explicitly about pulling back on incentives that the consumer was strong enough. you want to kind of have that your pocket if the economy got worse? where do you stand on incentives? have you kicked that up since the second quarter of last year. how do you think your approach on incentives for consumers is going to be going forward this year?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i believe that you'll see us use that lever appropriately. we have been in the marketplace testing some new offers with some relatively short expiration time to see how they -- how the consumer reacts to them. it is just one piece of our overall tool kit to drive the business. now we, again we have identified as we pulled out and slowed down our tdis over last year, there is a consumer out there that will only visit our restaurants when we have an incentive out there. so we need -- we've learned that we need to have something out there for this consumer and we'll continue to -- we talk about one of our focus as we talked about back to basics is our integrated marketing approach. and this is part of our integrated marketing approach is how do we use tdis, how do we use other other discounts or incentives and combined with what we're doing on a promotional level too. we always think about those in unison. so it is not a lever that we can pull, i will say for those that do look at our frequency. i would urge you not to look at that in isolation, because there are other parts of our media spend that have a lot more impact than our tdi spend primarily how many total rating points we have in the marketplace.
jake bartlett -- suntrust -- analyst
great. and then second question is on acquisitions and one is, just if you could talk about your appetite for kind of continuing acquisitions. it's been, i guess, almost two years since acquiring cheddar's, but also the environment whether you're seeing some smaller chains kind of under more pressure given the kind of scale benefits that with technology and with some inflation that's going on. so one, your appetite and the second kind of the environment for acquisitions out there that you're seeing?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, know i going to probably dodge that a little bit and give you the standard answer that we'll continue to to evaluate our current portfolio and evaluate the opportunities to add to the portfolio. as you know we're -- we continue to look at the opportunities out there, we continue to look at the opportunities internally and we'll continue to have those discussions with our management team and our board, and while we're doing that, we're going to do to focus on running the great brands that we have.
jake bartlett -- suntrust -- analyst
great. i appreciate it.
operator
our next question comes from jon tower from wells fargo. please go ahead.
jon tower -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks and happy holidays. just a quick one from me. so based on our work, it looks like you're off-premise business in olive garden was greater than 100% of the comp growth in the period. and i believe that off-premise offers like catering and $5 take-homes only show up in the mix and not traffic and i think rick, you hit on it earlier that lunch might have drove down mix a little bit in the period, but i am curious if you could expand upon the thought that how -- maybe these to go businesses are cannibalizing potential future visits, or maybe you can give us some comfort that it isn't happening in the market?
rick cardenas -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i don't think -- we don't believe that they are cannibalizing future but it's -- i mean, obviously, i think that people make a choice, am i going to eat in or you out tonight, and we want to be in both those decision sets. i go back inside the quarter and say we started off, we had a great promotion last year with buy one take one and we had a promotion that was weaker. i think it's important that we're sitting here today admitting that we didn't hit the mark on lasagna mia and we pulled off the promotional advertising to support that. not everything that we're going to do is going to work, but you got to, we know we recognize that this wasn't -- that something wasn't right with it and we didn't put the promotional dollars behind it, and we pivoted.
and i think that that put us in a hole in the quarter and we decided to let it play out. and that's primarily because we had longhorn doing well. so i don't -- i think that -- i look at it is all one big pool and we've been saying for you and we're going to try to feed people olive garden where and when they want it, and i think that we're doing a great job with that and i'm excited about what we've done at launch. we've definitely improved that trend. we're competing more effectively. and i believe in the future we'll have to make strategic adjustments to compete more effectively at dinner too. you're constantly evolving in this business you're not staying still, and so i'm confident in our team, i'm confident in our insights and all i want to do is sell olive garden food to some -- that want to anywhere they want it.
jon tower -- wells fargo -- analyst
and then just following up on the promotional miss hit or hit -- miss in this quarter. was there anything different about the testing process on this promotion relative to cast past testing that might have altered the go-to-market or seen or what really played out in the market versus what you guys were seeing in test?
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think that anytime you -- testing environments is small and it's always different than a macro test. so we're not sure what else was going on. we made the decision. i think in hindsight, we may have made that decision too quickly. i didn't give a chance to play out, but we do we thought was right, wrong or indifferent. we made a pivot and it's behind us and now we're moving on.
jon tower -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from brian vaccaro from raymond james. please go ahead.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks and good morning. just two quick ones for me, could we circle back on the olive garden incentives in the quarter. and if you look across all marketing channels, how has the mix of value and incentives compare year-on-year?
rick cardenas -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
we were definitely out there with a lot more incentives and that was part of we need to be out there because we pulled back on the advertising spend. so it's just. no, it's, again it's a small channel in which we play in, but we definitely increased and we also we're out there doing a ton of testing. so test and learn just doesn't apply to our smaller brands. it was test and learn inside of olive garden. probably the most test. i'm trying to understand which tdis would resonate with consumers. how long of time that they need to put on those to activate the consumer. so we were definitely in the marketplace and it's a great way for us to talk to our e-club members. so again, i just think it's -- it's a risk for you to look at all of that in isolation because the media spend was down significantly and we were testing and learning in this channel.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. and shifting gears to longhorn. obviously a pretty sharp sequential acceleration that you saw and i know you talked about a few different factors, but could you possibly rank order to the factors that drove that acceleration in your view. and then maybe just a little more color on how you drove that improved throughput during the busiest weekend hours that you referenced? thank you.
gene lee -- president and chief executive officer
i'll answer them backwards. i think it's just focus, i think we're focusing on those busiest hours were asking for our top management person in the restaurant to be at the front door to help with that process. it's like anything else in our business. we focus on something we get it and our management team there has done a great job of focusing on that. i think the beauty of the longhorn quarter is i can't point -- i'm not going to point to anything in specific, i believe this is a quarter where four years of investment, a couple of extra weeks of really, really good advertising that's resonated with the consumer, great stability in the leadership roles in the restaurants, all came together and we had a great quarter. anybody that tries to isolate and to point to one thing other than a one-time promotion, i believe it's very hard, very difficult to do. and i just think everything came together for longhorn, great quarter, great job to the team. anybody that's out there to listen, you guys did a great job.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. thank you.

this morning, gene will share some brief remarks, rick will give an update on our four operating priorities and raj will provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for the fourth quarter and a partial outlook for fiscal 2022.
now i'll turn the call over to gene.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, kevin, and good morning, everyone.
it's hard to believe it's been a year since the pandemic began to significantly impact our business. when i reflect back on everything that has transpired, it is clear to me the strategy we developed six years ago provided a strong foundation to help us navigate this period of unprecedented change and uncertainty. our portfolio of iconic brands has been focused on executing our back to basics operating philosophy while leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results oriented culture.
and while our four competitive advantages were critical to our business and operational success this past year, our significant scale and results oriented culture have played an outsized role in our ability to emerge stronger. our significant scale enabled us to quickly react to the turbulent operating environment. the depth and breadth of our supply chain relationships ensured that we could adjust our product supply as needed without experiencing any significant interruptions. we have our own dedicated distribution network, and the assurance of an uninterrupted supply chain provided consistency and a high level of certainty for our operators. our scale also enabled us to significantly accelerate the development of online ordering and several other digital initiatives and cascade them across our brands quickly and effectively. the robust expansion of our digital platform over the past year has provided us a richer set of first-party data on new and existing guest.
finally, our scale provided us with multiple levers to pull to ensure we have the liquidity we needed during the early days of covid-19. as soon as our liquidity needs were solved for, our brands were able to focus on strengthening their value propositions and transforming their business models. as our founder bill darden said, the greatest competitive advantage our company has is the quality of our employees, evidenced by the excellent job they do every day. throughout this past year, darden and our brands have emerged stronger and our success is a direct result of our team members and their relentless commitment to delivering safe and exceptional guest experiences. that is why we've continued to invest in our team members throughout the past year.
since march of 2020, we have invested more than $200 million in our people through programs such as paid sick leave, covid-19 emergency pay and covering insurance payments and benefit deductions for team members who were furloughed. these investments also include our recent decision to provide all hourly restaurant team members up to four hours of paid time off for the purpose of receiving the covid-19 vaccine. in addition, these investments include the one-time bonus we announced today, totaling approximately $17 million, which will impact nearly 90,000 hourly team members.
as we continue to grow our business and welcome guests back into our restaurants, continuing to attract and retain the best talent in the industry will be critical to our success. while we're proud that on average our hourly restaurant team members earn more than $17 per hour today, which includes our servers and bartenders who earn more than $20 an hour, i'm excited about the announcement we made this morning. beginning monday, every hourly team member, tipped and non-tipped, will earn at least $10 per hour, inclusive of tip income. additionally, we are committed to raising that amount to $11 per hour in january 2022 and to $12 per hour in january 2023. these investments further strengthen our industry-leading employment proposition.
lastly, i continue to be impressed and inspired by our team members who have shown extraordinary resilience and passion during the past year. once again, i thank you for your commitment to delivering exceptional guest experiences in our dining room and through curbside to-go. you are the heart and soul of our company and on behalf of the management team, we're extremely grateful to you.
now i'll turn it over to rick.
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
thank you, gene, and good morning, everyone.
as gene said, it's hard to believe we've been operating in this environment for a year. in addition to executing our back to basics operating philosophy, our restaurant teams have continued to successfully manage through this situation by remaining focused on the four key priorities we established at the onset of the pandemic: one, ensuring the health and safety of our team members and guests; two, simplifying operations and strengthening execution; three, deploying technology to improve the guest experience; and four, transforming our business model.
the health and safety of our team members and guests remains our top priority. throughout the past year, our team members have done a fantastic job of upholding our safety protocols while taking great care of our guests. today, even as restrictions are easing in some parts of the country, we continue to follow our enhanced safety measures. this includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring masks for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols.
our second priority has been to continue finding ways to simplify our operations and drive in-restaurant execution at each of our brands. this environment gave us a once in a lifetime opportunity to evaluate every aspect of how we operate and make decisions we would not have been able to do in a normal operating environment. a good example of this work all of our brands have done to streamline menus and remove low preference or low satisfaction items. this focus makes it easier for our restaurant teams to consistently execute our highest preference items which means we are serving our most popular dishes to more guests. in fact, a year ago, the top 10 entrees at olive garden accounted for about 48% of guest preference, and today they account for approximately 55%. reducing the bottom selling items eliminates distractions and allows us to execute at a high level. we have dramatically reduced low volume items which reduces the need to prepare them, saving time and reducing food waste. for example, at longhorn steakhouse, the number of total items with less than 1% preference is down to eight from more than 25 pre-covid.
third, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience and build on the progress we have made over the last 12 months. when the pandemic began and our dining rooms were closed, we were able to quickly roll out online ordering at our brands that had yet to deploy it. we also streamlined the curbside to-go pickup process by rolling out the curbside i'm here text message notification feature so guests can easily alert us when they arrive. these technology enhancements and other process improvements helped olive garden achieve new all-time high guest satisfaction ratings for delivering on time and accurate off-premise experiences during a quarter that included three busy off-premise days: christmas eve, new year's eve and valentine's day. in fact, valentine's day was our highest sales day since the start of the pandemic. also during the quarter, several brands, including olive garden longhorn implemented enhancements to their websites to streamline the online checkout process. this resulted in a meaningful reduction in order abandonment rates.
our continuous digital transformation is resonating with our guests. in fact, during the quarter, nearly 19% of total sales were digital transactions. further, 50% of all guest checks were settled digitally, either online or on our tabletop tablets or via mobile pay. we have made great strides in our digital journey over the past year and we will continue to strengthen our digital platform and provide our brands with the tools to compete more effectively.
and finally, the investments we've made to simplify our business through menu and process simplification have resulted in significant transformation of our business model. for example, across darden, our hourly labor productivity has improved by over 20%, with some brands improving by well over 30% such as cheddar's. we thought it would be helpful to provide a bit more insight into what the business model transformation has done to cheddar's p&l. year-to-date through the third quarter, cheddar's has grown the restaurant level margins by over 300 basis points on a year-to-date sales retention of 75%. when cheddar's reaches 100% of the pre-covid sales, we expect their restaurant level margins to be well in the high teens. while we don't intend to continue to provide this level of detail in the future, this illustration helps to highlight the business model improvements our brands are making.
as we have mentioned previously, the simplifications across all of our businesses are expected to result in a 150 basis points of margin improvement with 90% of pre-covid sales. our business model transformation also strengthens our belief in our ability to open value creating new restaurants across all of our brands. due to this transformation, the sales required to exceed our return expectations are much lower today. in fact, we opened six new restaurants during the quarter and each is exceeding our expectations.
before i hand it over to raj, i want to conclude by saying thank you to our team members. as gene said, our success is a direct result of their hard work. being of service is at the heart of our business and our team members demonstrate that every day through their commitment to our guests and each other.
raj?
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
thank you, rick, and good morning, everyone.
for the third quarter, total sales were $1.73 billion, a decrease of 26.1%. same restaurant sales decreased 26.7%. ebitda was $236 million, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.98.
turning to this quarter's p&l. food and beverage expenses were 80 basis points higher than last year, primarily driven by investments in food quality and mix. restaurant labor was 20 basis points higher. as gene mentioned, we invested approximately $17 million in team member bonuses this quarter. excluding the team member bonuses, restaurant labor would have been 80 basis points favorable to last year. the favorability to last year was driven by hourly labor improvement of 280 basis points due to efficiencies gained from operational simplifications rick discussed. the hourly labor improvement was partially offset by deleverage in management labor due to sales declines.
restaurant expense per operating week was 16% lower than last year, driven by lower workers' compensation, utilities, repairs and maintenance expense. restaurant expense as a percent of sales was 250 basis points higher than last year due to sales deleverage. marketing spend was $52 million lower than last year, with total marketing 200 basis points favorable to last year.
this all resulted in restaurant level ebitda margin of 18.4%, only 150 basis points below last year. excluding the one-time hourly team member bonus, restaurant level ebitda margin would have been even stronger at 19.4%. we impaired one yard house restaurant this quarter, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $3 million. this location was in portland, oregon, and had been temporarily closed since april.
turning to g&a. we finalized the legal recovery during the quarter, resulting in favorability of $16 million. this favorability was partially offset by $8.8 million of mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. excluding these two items, g&a would have been $86 million this quarter. as a reminder, the mark-to-market expense is related to significant appreciation in both the darden share price and equity market this quarter, and due to the way we hedge this expense, it is mostly offset on an after-tax basis. page 13 of this quarter's presentation illustrates the $8.8 million reduction of operating income and corresponding operating income margin reduction of 50 basis points from mark-to-market expense.
our hedge reduced income tax expense by $7.2 million, resulting in a net reduction to earnings after-tax this quarter of $1.6 million. our effective tax rate of 2.3% this quarter was unusually low due to two factors. first, the tax benefit from the deferred compensation hedge i just mentioned reduced the tax rate by 5 percentage points. second, the stock option exercises this quarter drove approximately $7 million of excess tax benefit, reducing the tax rate by 4.8 percentage points. after adjusting for these factors, our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter would have been 12.1%.
looking at our segment performance this quarter, olive garden saw segment profit margin increase versus last year despite sales declines. our continued focus on simplified operations, which significantly reduced direct labor, combined with lower marketing expenses, drove this margin improvement. segment profit margin declined for longhorn as higher than average beef inflation and other investments drove higher food and beverage expense. in addition, both labor and restaurant expenses were higher as a percent of sales due to sales deleverage. segment profit margin declined for fine dining and other segments due to deleverage across the p&l from the significant sales decline year-over-year.
we generated over $240 million of free cash flow this quarter, ending the third quarter with over $990 million in cash. our recent performance has given us better visibility into the durability of our cash flows. therefore, we will return to our 50% to 60% dividend payout target applied to future earnings to determine our dividend. to that end, the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share, matching our pre-covid dividend level. the ability to resume pre-covid dividend levels just 12 months after suspending it is a testament to the strength of our business model and the durability of our cash flows. and finally, today we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $500 million which replaces all previous authorizations.
turning to the fourth quarter. as of today we have 99% of our dining rooms open with some capacity. this morning, we provided sales trends for the first three weeks of the quarter in which we saw week to week sales improvements as the vaccine rollout progressed, dining room capacity increased and consumers began receiving stimulus checks. taking that all into consideration, we currently expect, for the fourth quarter, total sales of approximately $2.1 billion, ebitda between $345 million and $360 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $1.60 and $1.70 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares. we've also updated our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be between $285 million and $295 million, and we anticipate opening 33 net new restaurants for the year. we continue to believe we can achieve pre-covid ebitda dollars on 90% of pre-covid sales, resulting in 150 basis points of ebitda margin growth, and our q4 outlook falls within this framework.
as we move beyond the fourth quarter, there are additional costs such as training, travel, growth cost, incremental marketing and other investments that we expect will need to come back into the p&l. and while it's too early to provide insights into fiscal '22 sales and earnings, we did want to provide some preliminary guidance for a few items. we expect total capital spending between $350 million and $400 million and open approximately 35 new restaurants in fiscal '22. we also anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of 12% to 13% for fiscal '22.
and with that, we'll open it up for questions.

david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. just a clarification. first, that rubric or thinking about 150 basis points of margin expansion permanently, did that contemplate these labor investments that you're making, that clarification would be helpful. but my question is really about the seating currently and you're thinking about the meaningfulness of recent weeks. the seating capacity -- you mentioned you have partial dining rooms in 99% of the restaurants or locations, but how much of the seating is available currently and how much do you think that that is holding back comps. and gene, my follow-up, which i'll just say right now, it looks like these off-premise numbers are very strong. the mix is very high even as people get more comfortable. are you rethinking the stickiness of that off-premise business? and i'll pass it on. thanks.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, david. yes. the labor investments we've made is embedded in the 150 basis points improvement we think we can make at 90% of sales. so that is inclusive there. let's talk about the dining room capacity. basically the way our dining rooms are laid out, longhorn has an advantage over olive garden in its utilization because of -- because of the number of booths. but the way to think about it is, we're somewhere between 50% and 60% capacity inside the dining room depending on the particular floor plan. and so there are still limitations of availability inside our restaurants as long as we're following the cdc guidelines. it doesn't matter what the local municipalities are doing. and we believe right now it's in our best interest, our team members' best interest, with the priority of their health and safety -- for our team members and our guests, to continue to follow the cdc guidelines. and so we think about our dining room somewhere between 50% and 60%, 65% depending on the individual floor plan.
off-premise stickiness. let me just -- let me start off by saying i am incredibly impressive what our team has done to improve our capabilities in the off-premise experience. the digital experience is getting better every single day. it's being adopted. in rick's prepared remarks, he talked about 19% of our total sales now being digital. i think that's really impressive. i do believe that as more -- as we get to offer more capacity -- and we see this in individual restaurants -- that the off-premise will start to fall off. i think while the capacity is limited and there is still a lot of people out there that are not fully vaccinated, there's still good demand for the off-premise. i believe that because of our capabilities that we've developed during this -- during the pandemic and our vision for how those capabilities will continue to improve in the future, that our off-premise business will still be robust when it's all said and done. i can't tell you today what that percentage is going to be.

dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks for the question. jim, i wanted to ask a bit more about any kind of regional differences that you might be seeing. i think you gave some interesting color there on cdc guidelines being the capacity constraints in most cases for your restaurants. but curious by region, by state, if you're seeing a notable difference in performance based on those state restrictions. and then just kind of following up on that as it relates to off-premise where you do have greater capacity in select restaurants or states, if that off-premise looks a whole lot different than it does across the system on average. thank you.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, obviously we're only a 25% capacity in california, which is, that's pretty restrictive there. so, i will take our percentage as higher in california. so i would say there is still pressure on the coast, both coasts, especially the northeast part of the country, you're still seeing mobility not as great as it is and what i would call from arizona all the way over to carolinas, where i think mobility is much greater and the consumers much more willing to get out and move around. so there is difference in sales there. but every day -- i mean, this is very dynamic, folks. this is changing daily as more and more people get vaccinated, more and more people become confident in their ability to be mobile, and it's getting to a point where i think we're cautiously optimistic and excited about what's going to transpire here over the next few months and maybe few years.

sorry. just looking for a little bit of a follow-up call here. and just in terms of looking at the to-go sales, i'm curious what you've learned in terms of the nature of these customers, are they new customers that are -- are they new customers or are they existing customers driving increased frequency. i'm just curious what you guys are seeing in terms of who is actually driving these very strong to-go sales levels.
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
hey, jeff, it's rick. thanks for the question. in regards to the to-go sales and who is driving it, at the start of the pandemic, we saw a lot of new customers, a lot of new ones coming in than hadn't been to our restaurants before, and the frequency with which they reordered was pretty high. we're still seeing those new customers, but everybody is ordering to-go, right. if you came into the dining room and the dining room is full, you may just walk over to the go station and order. but the frequency of our newer customers was higher and is higher than the frequency of our existing customers. we are really happy with what we've done, as gene mentioned, with the technology that we put in the to go business. it is helping to get some younger people in our restaurants that order to-go. what we've done with curbside to-go and curbside i'm here has made it so much easier for people to come pick up. and so we feel really good about the customers we're getting and the information we're gleaning from them.

jake bartlett with truist securities. your line is open.
jake bartlett -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. gene, my first one is just on the comment about the 50% to 60% capacity in terms of following the cdc guidelines. as we look at restrictions easing across the country, do they really matter or should we just really kind of think about just the overall guidance from the cdc as we think about your capacity increasing?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i think it's a very interesting question. i think we're hoping the cdc comes along with the consumer and the consumer behavior. we feel right now it's still -- it's still prudent to follow that guidance. there may be a point where we determine that guidance is out of date, and i think that with the consumer in a certain marketplace but it's too early to tell. right now, we believe that the best course of action is to continue to follow the cdc guidelines. and just back on the 50% to 60% capacity, one of the things you really lose on longhorn box is that those two or three deep standing at the bar waiting for tables, that's not there. so that's kind of included in that lack of capacity that we have right now. we're still asking guests to wait outside and not quarantining our lobbies, so there is revenue that we're losing and we're losing there too. so i think here in the near term, i think it's let's follow the cdc guidelines and let's see if some other leading indicators around covid cases and the death rate continue to decline, and then we'll continue to reevaluate as we move forward.
jake bartlett -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then i had a question about the fourth quarter guidance. and maybe in the context of the weekly same-store sales that you gave and the last week was obviously very strong and positive. i believe the guidance is implying still lower, i think about 8% or 9% lower average weekly sales in the fourth quarter versus '19. so i think you're expecting a deceleration from current levels. maybe if you can just talk about that and then if there was anything abnormal about this last week in relation to '19.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, yeah, with the government -- the government sent a bunch of checks to a lot of people. i mean, there's a lot of stimulus in the marketplace. there is multiple variables that are transpiring, right. so we've got -- we've got stimulus being sent out, we've got vaccinations increasing, we've got the virus declining. what we can't do is really tease out which one of those variables is driving this. we believe that stimulus is a really big part of maybe the back end of '14, a week ending 14 and a week ending 3/21. and so we don't have that stimulus in our outlook for the rest of the quarter. we know from history that fades. and this was a big -- this was a big stimulus package. so we'll see how long at last, but right now we're thinking that it tails here pretty quickly.
jake bartlett -- truist securities -- analyst

eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks for the question. just maybe a margin question. i think your guidance is implying some of the -- one of the highest ebitda margins we've seen possibly in some time. so can you maybe talk about what's one-time, what's sustainable in terms of that guidance? clearly, there are some marketing -- marketing savings and obviously the 150 basis points that we talked about in g&a savings. but maybe you can go through that and what part of the upside to recent trends -- recent margin trends is sustainable going forward. thanks.
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
yeah. hi, eric. this is raj. thanks for the question. so when you think about the margin, i think it depends on really where the sales levels are. and as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, there are some costs that have to come back into the p&l and that will come back, but it's not like we're going to ramp up those costs as fast as the sales are coming back here, right. so as you look at q4, one, i want to point out, q4 generally is our highest -- is higher an ebitda margin than the annual average. combine that with the fact that we have this decent acceleration in sales from q3 to q4, and some of these costs we're talking about will come back over time as we go beyond q4.
and when you think about at the 90 plus percent sales levels, i'm not saying that is the discrete cutoff, but if you think about it that level, it's really marketing and labor are two big contributors positively as a percent of sales. and then the -- partially offset by food costs going up. that's where we have made some investments. we've all along made investments into the value proposition for the gas, and that will continue to do that too. so we feel like at those levels, marketing and labor will help; food will take away from it. restaurant expenses are probably going to be relatively flat, maybe slightly off by 10 basis points. and then, g&a, we should be flat at 90% given the reduction we have done on the g&a. as we grow from there, we do think some of those sales will come -- some of those costs will come back in. and i think we're still not seeing the margins are going to go down any further, but we do want to maintain the 150 and see what we can do. but some of these things are going to play out based on the environment and the economic backdrop.

jeffrey bernstein with barclays. your line is open.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you very much. the primary question is just on the wage rates. obviously, encouraging to see you seemingly setting a floor for the hourly team members. i'm just wondering how large of an investment is this in dollars to assure people make at least $10 an hour and maybe more broadly, gene, what are your thoughts on the likelihood of more of a national hourly and tipped employee wage increase? maybe you can just share what your approach has been in terms of pricing or profitability in the states that are already at these elevated levels. and then i had one follow-up.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, jeff. we're not going to -- we'll only say about the cost of this. this is covered in our guidance, and we're not going to get into the specific cost of implementing this program. as far as wage rates nationally, i mean, there's a lot of momentum here. i think that there is momentum for a bipartisan group to get to a solution that that i think everybody can live with. i think that our focus is more on protecting the tip wage. we think that is -- we think that is extremely important for the overall restaurant business. we think it's extremely important for both constituents. the server doesn't want that relationship to change with the consumer and the consumer doesn't want that relationship to change with the server. and so our focus in working with the powers to be is explaining how this relationship works and the importance of this relationship.
and i would point to the fact that our average server earn -- our average tipped employee earns greater than $20 per hour, and you think that's -- and that's an average. so you think about as these servers develop their skillset and become -- and their capabilities and become very confident, they have the opportunity to earn well above $20 per hour once they become proficient at what they're doing, and i think that's important to note. i also think it's very important to note that if the tip wage was to be eliminated, the current compensation model for servers would have to change. the industry would change the way people are compensated, and it's my belief over time that those people will be compensated less, not more.
on wage, i would just end with -- i believe that we're really well positioned to manage through any changes here. we've been able -- we've been managing structural wage changes for years, and we do that through improved productivity, we do that through pricing, but we've been able to manage that effectively and i believe that we're well positioned to manage whatever changes come out of washington or out of the individual states as we move forward.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
understood. and then just a follow-up. just as you mentioned, marketing, as one of the big helps in terms of the margin opportunity, i'm just wondering, i think you said it was down $50 million plus in the third quarter or a couple of hundred basis points. i'm just wondering how you're thinking about that recovery, whether it's the fiscal fourth quarter or just qualitatively how you think about fiscal '22. maybe your thoughts on various marketing channels for investment or whether there are some permanent savings opportunities as maybe you shift away from some of the more expensive channels. thank you.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, jeff. i think right now the way we're thinking about it is we don't have any definitive plans as we move forward. we really need to understand what the competitive environment is. and then, we have to really evaluate all the different channels and which is the most effective channel for each of the businesses which i believe are very different. and then we'll have to, if we need to layer back in, we'll have to make the decision on what's the highest roi investment that we can make for each of the businesses. and so we have -- we have some contingency plans already developed.
we know what levers we would pull in different environments. but right now, we think we're spending at the appropriate level. we're still spending some good money in olive garden. we had -- we bought new upfronts, we're still running some very good television. i really like the creative. i think the team has done a very good job on the creative. and so i think we're getting across great messaging. so it's not like we've cut all advertising, and we're still in some digital channels, we're still spending money on search. we think we're spending at the appropriate levels right now, and we'll continue to evaluate as we move forward.

chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. so, clearly, you've used the opportunity over the last year to find efficiencies in the business and lean further into digital. how are you thinking about the composition of your brand portfolio now longer-term in the context of all the improvements that you've discussed recently and again this morning and how at an enterprise level you're positioned to potentially add brands and further leverage the scale advantages you've built?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, we love -- we love our brands today. i think that some of our brands that were maybe -- i wouldn't say they are underperforming, they may be underperforming our expectations because against the broader competitive set, they were -- they were at the midpoint or even better than that. but the moves that were made and the structural changes to these business has us really excited and more -- and we think more about growth for some of our brands that probably didn't have -- hadn't earned the right to have a lot of new capital invested in them because the returns weren't as competitive inside our portfolio and we had better alternatives. that's going to change a little bit. so we're a little -- we're more excited about the potential growth of these brands.
as far as m&a goes, i mean, i'm going to give you the standard answer that we continue to have conversations with the board and look at opportunities, and i really can't say much more than that on that subject at this point.

thanks. gene, as guests have started to come back into your restaurants, have you noticed any differences in their behavior? are they lingering longer, ordering more drinks and appetizers, more or less expensive entrees, etc.? i'm just kind of wondering if there's any noteworthy changes to guest behavior that you're seeing as a pattern.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
no [indecipherable] noteworthy behavior. i mean i think in certain markets, people -- it's amazing, people get their vaccination, and the first thing they do is they go to a restaurant even though they probably should wait a few days for the vaccination to be -- but i mean there is just -- i mean there are a lot of people that this is -- we weren't noticing, especially near vaccination sites, that this is their first time out in a year and they're just so excited to be back and they're just -- you can tell because you've seen some larger groups of senior citizens that are just happy to be back out having a dining experience. so, no major changes other than people are happy. i think people are happy to be out, and it's definitely noticeable. there's a good vibes in our restaurants right now.
james rutherford -- stephens -- analyst
well, that's great to hear. and as a follow-up on curbside, can you give an update on how much of your system is operating curbside today and the initiatives around i think geo-fencing, dedicated doors to the kitchen or any of the things you're doing to make this hyper-convenient channel kind of even better than it is today?
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
yeah, james, this is rick. on the curbside experience, all of our brands are offering curbside. now, there might be a few restaurants here and there that might be within malls, etc., that it's hard to do, but all of our restaurants offer curbside today. they all have the curbside i'm here feature where you can text -- they'll get a text 10 minutes before their pickup time to tell the restaurant that they're here. so they all have that. once we implement a technology that works, we'd roll out in all the restaurants.
as regards to kind of the building design and change, we are looking at some changes to prototypes as we build new restaurants to make it a little bit more convenient for our team, to bring the food out to the cars. but there is still a high percentage of people that are picking up in the restaurant, that maybe order in the restaurant and pick up or they just want to walk in and maybe sit at the bar for a minute to watch tv and while there to-go is being prepared. so we have to keep an in-restaurant type of experience for them as well. so we're looking at that.
in regards to making a bunch of modifications to our existing restaurants, we're thinking about that. as we see our restaurant start to build back up in the dining room, we're just trying to figure out the most efficient way to make changes, whether it's in the kitchen to give them more room for packaging, but maybe not having a side door because we do believe that the guests -- guests may still want to come in. so we're working through that. we don't expect to make huge, huge investments in our restaurants -- existing restaurants for to-go. we do have some investments to make, but they are not that great.
james rutherford -- stephens -- analyst
excellent. thank you very much.

david tarantino with baird. your line is open.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
hi, good morning everyone. my question is for raj. i wanted to come back to your comments about costs coming back into the business after the current quarter. and i wanted to understand the implications of that. and are you saying that the math you've laid out with margins 150 basis points higher at 90% of your prior sales volumes, will that still hold as these costs come back into the business or are you going to need higher volumes after q4 to hit that 150 basis point bogey?
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
no, david. i think we are actually expecting to maintain that margin. so we don't need higher volume to maintain that to get to that. and then as volume grows, we're saying -- we're committed to maintaining that as costs come back in. but we don't think we're going to be diluting margin. that 150 basis points is sticky.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
okay, thanks for that clarification. and then i guess my real question then is, how do you see that developing as sales end up going back to 100% or more of what you had previously? i know you're committed to maintaining the 150 but is there a line of sight or a path to exceeding that as more sales flow through the model and i guess how do you balance that with the investments that you might want to make to sustain the health of the brands longer-term?
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think -- that's a great question, dave. i think the way we're thinking about it is as sales grow we'll find opportunities to make more investments into guest experience, into the food quality, things that we want to do. and we also have talked about trying to price -- continuing to price below inflation and below competition. that's one of our bigger investments that we'd make. could you see for a time period where our margins exceed and build off of that? absolutely. but i think longer-term, i think the way we're thinking about it is we don't want to grow it too much. we want to just kind of find ways to set us up for longer-term market share gains, but still have a pretty robust business model.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst

john glass with morgan stanley. your line is open.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much. i had a question about unit development in your '22 outlook. given what you said about your success of margin improvement at cheddar's, what you've seen at olive garden, why wouldn't development be faster? i guess specifically as you look at '22 as sort of a stepping stone to faster in '23, is there external constraints on development [indecipherable] internal business as fast as you want to grow? and since you brought up cheddar's specifically, right, the thesis of buying it was a really big growth vehicle for the company. how do you think about development now that cheddar's margins are better? how many of those 35 are cheddar's and where do you think that brand can -- what the pace of that brand growth can be thereafter?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, there's a couple of factors, john, driving our ability to only get 35 restaurants next year. number one, as we entered into covid, we dismantled our whole development team. and so we spent the last 90 to 120 days rebuilding that. but that's really not the driving and limiting factor as we move forward next year. the limiting factor is that after we get past letter of intent, every step along the way in that development process has pretty much slowed down significantly, and it has a lot to do with people working remotely and we're not -- we're not be able to negotiate a lease as quickly as we once were, but the biggest hangup right now is permitting and getting your plans to permit and getting approvals that you need, getting people out to do inspections so that you can move along.
so i think the way i would answer is external factors that are limiting us being able to open more restaurants. we have the letters of intent signed. we're just -- we just struggle past that point. and we hope that we can get to '23. we can get to the higher end of our 2% to 3%. we believe our pipeline is in good enough shape to get there, there is enough availability out there, and we're happy with the construct of the deals. but once we get past letter of intent this thing really slows down significantly and really out of our control. now, i'll just add that over the last couple of weeks, things are starting the pick up a little bit in the local municipalities and we're starting to get some things done. but we're sitting on a restaurant today that we can't get open because we're waiting on that last inspection and there is no sense of urgency in that local community to get out there and make that last inspection.
as far as cheddar's go, i think the limiter on -- we're thrilled with the business model. the limiter on cheddar's will still be the human resources. we've got to build the bench strength so that we can get that system up and running. there is a tremendous amount of backfill opportunity. we're seeing the benefits of the backfill opportunity as we're opening some of these new restaurants that we've opened here recently. and so we're hopeful we can get cheddar's somewhere between 7% and 10% unit growth once we get -- we get everything to where we want it to be. i think the benefit of our platform is that we don't have to overtax one of our businesses to get growth. and i always say speed kills, and we want to be able to grow this thing responsibly and open great restaurants with great operations, high volume concept that we've simplified but still difficult to run.
i mean, just one last comment on the growth is that with the transformation of the business model, we think the big upside now is that there is more olive gardens than we may have originally thought. we can handle the cannibalization a lot better today than we could before. and therefore, we want to push a little bit harder on olive garden, and we think -- and the returns are just fantastic in that business. so that's the best place to put our capital.

lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks for the question. i also wanted to ask about the labor investments that you announced specific to the hourly wage increase to at least $10. what percentage of your hourly employee base will be impacted by this initiative? what percentage is currently below $10? and does this affect only non-tipped employees? and then are you increasing wages at a commensurate rate across the board?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
we don't plan to -- i think i'll start backwards on this. we don't think that's going to be a big compression issue. the amount of people this impacts is small. we're not going to give the exact number. and again, as i talked about earlier, it's included in our guidance for the quarter and we include it for next year. and we'll disclose what our wage inflation project it to be when we give you '22 guidance. and it's for all employees. it's -- it's basically if you are a tipped employee and your tips and your wage doesn't get you to $10, we'll bring you to $10 an hour.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, yeah. i just -- i figured that this was primarily going to impact non-tipped because tipped i think generally makes more. so to kind of confirm that, but -- my follow-up question to that is, how does your hourly staffing level today compare to pre-covid levels. so i guess what percentage of your hourly employees you have in the restaurants right now?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
we have -- i haven't seen the number for last week, but the week before we were at a about 115,000 versus 165,000 active pre-covid, and that number is increasing every week. and i think our greatest challenge right now is staffing. it's staffing, trying to attract people to come to work. that's why we're strengthening our employment proposition which is already strong. we've got to staff it, we've got to train people, we're training people now in a very high volume environment, and so as i really think about what we're focused on is really back to basic restaurant operations, and part of that, one of those -- one of those things that we focus on there is hiring great people and having great certified trainers that are able to train those people to bring our brands to life. and so that's our number one -- that's really our number one priority right now.

gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll just comment on fine fining. obviously, that's going back a little bit slower. i would say that fine dining in suburbia is performing much better than fine dining in the central business districts. we are incredibly impressed with the weekend business in fine dining even in the central business districts. so this business is coming back. it's going -- we're going to be extremely profitable in this business. but this is going to definitely come back slower than casual. and so there is -- i will just add that we've been pretty impressed the last couple of weeks how this business has rebounded.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
and then just other -- for rick or for raj. when you think about the structural margin pre-crisis, obviously you were one of the industry stalwarts and you've found efficiencies within the model. when you think two, three, five years out, what do you think is the potential for where you can get to versus where you were pre? and thank you.
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think it would be tough for me to sit here and project out five years from now, what we think the number could be. but all i will say is, we are definitely committed to getting to this 150. and then beyond that, we still go back to our long-term framework. once the -- once we get back to the sales levels we had before, it's about that 10 to 30 basis points margin improvement every year. and we think we can still do that.

great. thank you and good morning. on the capex guidance, if i have this right, the number of new stores came down a little bit, but the capex is going to be toward the high end of the range. are you finding incremental projects to spend behind this year? i'm just looking for a little bit of color there. and then somewhat related, a question on technology. given all the success you've had on the digital side and the ability to kind of look at the business holistically through this last year, are you identifying or exploring different ways to leverage technology kind of going forward? i'm just curious how we should expect technology to be implemented, either from a guest facing or kind of internal perspective over time. thanks.
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
all right. just let me answer the capex one, and i'll hand it over to rick on the technology stuff. so from a capex perspective, when you think about our annual capex, we're already spending money for next year's new units, right. so that's why you don't really see capex move much because we're still working on our pipeline, we're still working on next year. the other thing i want to remind you is, this year spend is relatively low because some of these units were already built earlier. we had already spent a lot of capex last year and then we were sitting on these restaurants because -- when the pandemic hit. so that's the color on capex. and then rick?
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
yeah, thanks, raj. on the technology front, we are in the process of doing another three year roadmap for technology. we're going to continue to invest in technology to reduce friction and the guest experience and reduce friction and team member experience. we've given you some examples of what we've already done this year with shifting everything to curbside, going to curbside i'm here. we're actually going to make that process even easier as we keep going forward. we're going to make the process of checking into the restaurant easier. we're doing a lot of things going forward. without getting into too much detail, we expect to spend more money in technology than we have this year, and we'll continue to invest in technology. we think it's an advantage for us. it gives us better access to data, and because of our scale, we can do it.

thank you. good morning. two quick questions. the first on being data rich. typically guest satisfaction scores are a leading indicator of comp, but if we back that up, i guess i can imagine it's satisfied employees serving that guest. so maybe you could compare and contrast the metrics that you look at that are i guess external for guest satisfaction versus internal for employee satisfaction and perhaps it was tied to a grounded hourly wage changes that you discussed today. thanks.
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
hey, nicole, this is rick. i'll start with the guest satisfaction metrics. all our brands are improving their guest satisfaction year-over-year from pre-covid even with -- especially because of all of the things that we've done to simplify our business, to make it easier for our restaurants, to get the product to what -- get the product to the consumer in the way they want it. we're shifting more of our sales to our top 10 items, which are high satisfaction items. we've improved significantly to-go experience, which at the beginning was a pretty low satisfying experience. it's getting better every week. so on the guest side, all the satisfaction measures look great. and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks on to-go, olive garden was at an all-time high for on-time and accurate off-premise experience for the third quarter, even though it was a really high off-premise quarter for them with three big, big holidays.
in the employee metrics, the metric that we look at the most is turnover, and our turnover has been great over the last -- over the last year. and as gene mentioned, we just introduced another thing to help the employee experience and their process of coming to work for us. we're going to simplify the hiring process as we go forward, but we have just a great employee proposition, which leads to our turnover. those are the two metrics we look at the most. the last thing i'll say is there are some internal metrics that we're really proud of for longhorn. they're now number one in food quality and food taste with all of the investments they've made over the last few years. and that's a pretty high bar for us, and we feel really good about the investments they've made and that's what's driving our performance.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you for that color. and then i think you had mentioned six openings as i wrote that down. i think the question still stands. you talked about exceeding expectations. and i want to understand how much of that is the strategic operational control and excellence you have and how much was that influenced by the external competitive landscape. and when you first looked at those stores, perhaps there is competitors that just didn't make it across the finish line and didn't open. so how would you compare and contrast that? thank you.
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
yeah, nicole. thanks for that. if we look at the fixed restaurants that we opened in the quarter and actually restaurants we've opened this year, their sales levels have been higher than we thought, considering we opened some of these restaurants at really hard 50% capacity limitations. now, that could be because other restaurants didn't open, but we've been performing really well. if you look at our guest satisfaction measures in those restaurants, we've done a really good job in training our people and getting open. and then the other thing, though, i think a bigger part of our performance is actually at the bottom line of the p&l, and these restaurants are performing much better on their p&l than restaurants that we opened a year or two before, and that's because of the simplifications we've made.
whenever you simplify, you really make it easy for new restaurants, right? when they open, if they open with a full menu and a pretty big dining room, it's hard for them. when they open with a menu that we have today with a dining room that's a little bit constrained, it makes it easier. but we have also changed some of our training programs, especially in the fine dining brands, to make it almost like you're coming into a restaurant that's always been there. and so we've done a really good job in improving the process to open new restaurants. so i would give it -- i would give that much more of the benefit than another restaurant or two that didn't open during that time.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
excellent. thank you.

jared garber with goldman sachs. your line is open.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the question. i wanted to circle back on maybe comments from last quarter, and as we're thinking about market share opportunities going forward. gene, are you still thinking that 5% to 15% closure rate on the independent side makes sense? and just wanted to get your thoughts on three months later on how that that environment continues to kind of play out. and relatedly, you made some comments on olive garden and maybe some more opportunities there. several years ago, you guys put out some data on a longer-term tam of, i think, it was 900 to 950 and some tam on longhorn as well. how should we be thinking about those opportunities going forward over the long term?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, first of all, on capacity. i think the last printed thing i saw from technomic was still 5% to 15% tilted toward the higher end. it's my belief that the restaurants in central business districts will get recapitalized a lot -- and be able to come back a lot quicker than what we'll see in suburbia. and so, i think that there's population is still growing. and just the fact that a lot of new restaurants are going to -- aren't going to be added are also a benefit as we go forward. so i think as far as the capacity part of it, it's still a real good tailwind for the industry. as far as -- what was the -- number of olive gardens.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, the tam opportunity. yeah.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think that would -- as you think about that, we're not ready to put a number out there right now. we want to -- the way we think about development is we find the best piece of property that we can find and then we try to put what do we think is the best -- which restaurant in our brand and our portfolio will maximize the opportunity of that piece of land. and so i think numbers will ebb and flow, but we believe in the next few out years, we're going to get closer to 3% of our framework. that's where we want to be.
operator
john ivankoe with jpmorgan. your line is open.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, thank you. obviously, you guys accomplished so much in 2020 around digital efficient marketing, restaurant operations, reorganization, g&a efficiency, so much, maybe that would have taken you three to five years of [indecipherable] of the metrics that you got. so, gene, maybe this is a question for you and the board. how are your strategic priorities changing if at all? i mean, as you accomplish so much, that you hope to accomplish over the next three to five years, that some of these initiatives are, if not fully behind you, at least partially behind you, what might be like the next big ideas that darden is working on?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i'm not sure what the next big idea is. i think the big thing that we're really cognizant of is how do we fight the gravity to pull us back -- pulling us back toward, what had worked extremely well for us and staying, keeping our eye on the prize of all the gains that we made over the last few year. so i think right now, more importantly than ever, the way i'm thinking about it is back-to-basics. we've got to run great restaurants. we've got to be able to execute our food, our service and great atmosphere. if we can do that, i think -- i always say this simple term. how do we do less better? and i think right now we put our businesses through significant change and i'm in this do less better framework. i want to make sure that we're running great, great restaurants.
strategically, i think the way we continue to think about it is how do we ensure we get, take this opportunity to get our top line growth to 3%, which is a number we haven't really achieved yet. and 3% doesn't sound like a lot, but that's a lot of new restaurants in our system, absolute numbers, right. when you start adding 50 to 70 restaurants a year, that puts a lot of strain on your organization and puts a lot of strain on your human resources. so i like this whole notion of getting narrower, not a lot of strategic change, but let's get into execute, execute, execute. i believe our brands are differentiated enough right now to compete effectively, and there's not a lot of work to be done there.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great answer. thanks, gene.
operator
andy barish with jefferies. your line is open.
andrew barish -- jefferies -- analyst
hey guys. i'm sorry if i missed it. but i know you've kind of taken a look at the fluid competitive situation, and it doesn't appear as if it's changing your philosophy on kind of using price as an investment or pricing below the industry. can you give us what you're maybe looking at going forward for '22 or so for the two big brands at least in terms of menu pricing?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
andy, i think it's a little premature to signal what we think that is. i think i would -- based on what [indecipherable] now, i would look at what our norms have been. but one of the things that we'll have to consider is in this dynamic environment, is what do we think inflation is going to be. and it's too early for us to really understand what we think inflation is going to be in our fiscal '22. so i would just look -- if you're looking for guidance on that, i would look more toward our historical norms at this point.
andrew barish -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then a quick follow-up to raj. just on the underlying kind of g&a number, last couple of quarters it's been that $85 million to $90 million. is that a decent run rate going forward at this point, or are we missing some reinvestment back into the business that may come into that line?
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
i'd say at this point, think up somewhere around $90 million as a good run rate to start with. and then if that changes, we'll let you know in june. but i think at that point somewhere around $90 million is a good number.
andrew barish -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thanks, folks.
operator
howard penney with hedgeye. your line is open.
howard penney -- hedgeye -- analyst
thank you so much for the question. the second -- the next quarter, you -- this consensus estimate is for somewhere around 65% comp, which implies sort of a two year 10% stack. managing the business in a normal year, to see 10% growth would be incredible. i would love to hear about how you're managing that kind of acceleration in -- i'm not asking about the comp number but just sort of from a middle of the p&l, how do you hire for that, how do you purchase for that, how do you manage a business that goes from sort of zero to 60 if you will in comps? thank you.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. good morning, howard. i think that's why i'm trying to narrow the focus of the organization and then really focusing on the back-to-basics and trying to eliminate any distraction at all. and i believe that, the priorities right now, especially over the next six to nine months is staffing. how do you ensure your supply chain is growing with the demand and all those other basic things that go on every day. and part of why we're making this investment today in our people is to say, thank you, and also to recruit. we know the people best. the teams with the best people will win in this environment. and we need to attract great people, offer them great opportunities, provide careers for them. but you've identified what our operating priorities are. rick [indecipherable] really need to focus on this. we're monitoring the number of employees in each restaurant every single week. we're monitoring today the number of servers in each restaurant every day. so we understand what our staffing levels are and what we need to do to support that.
doug milanes, our head of supply chain has done an incredible job of keeping the supply chain full and keeping that continuity. we also have a lot of sensitive products that we serve. they have to be aged appropriately, which they've done a great job on. and so, we're focused on -- you highlighted our biggest challenge. it's not strategic today, it's operational.
howard penney -- hedgeye -- analyst
and you didn't mention training. is there any incremental training associated with that? are you going to bring back people that knew, familiar with the organization? thank you.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think we're going to do both. we're going to try to bring back anybody that's familiar with the organization. but right now i think most of who we're bringing back, well, maybe the exception of california is new people. and so what we do in that circumstance is, we've really -- we have a certified trainer program that we were able to really energize and connect with these people that are actually doing the training of the new employees in every one of our brands. and they're the key. we've got to give them the tools and the time and the compensation in order to be able to train these new people effectively. and you're pressing on some of the biggest operational challenges as we've ramped this back up. and i think it's right to highlight that. and we're -- our teams are going to be up for the task.

brian vaccaro with raymond james. your line is open.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. just two quick ones for me. on advertising, i'm curious if there's been any change in your thinking as to when it makes sense to begin increasing your spend again. it's not many, but it seems like a few chains have either have or soon will be ramping their spend. so just wondering if that is at all impacting your thinking. and sorry if i missed it, raj, but can you ballpark the level of spend that's embedded in your fiscal 4q guide?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
as far as -- i mean, and i've talked a little bit about this earlier, brian, is we just have no definitive plans right now. and on what we're going to put back in or how we're going to put back in and which channel we're going to put back in advertising. we've got to look at the competitive environment. we've got to see where we're at. i think each brand will come back differently and use different channels that are more effective for them. we're still spending a good amount of money in olive garden on advertising today. we bought a lot of television in the upfront. we think that's an effective medium for us. and so we'll continue to spend that. i'm very happy with the creative. and so this is what i would call a game time decision. when it's right to call that play, we'll call that play. but right now we have no definitive plans to do that.
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
and brian, just for q4 ballpark, i would expect similar levels as q3, somewhere around $25 million.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, great. and then i also just wanted to touch base on the commodity outlook. what are your expectations over the next few quarters from an inflation perspective? and you can touch on some of the more significant puts and takes within your basket.
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
yeah. we're not ready to get into fiscal '22 yet, but i will tell you in fiscal -- for q4, we do expect our commodity inflation to be a little bit higher at around 2% for the entire basket with, i think there's a little bit more in chicken, and there's a little bit more in -- actually oil is one where we think it's going to be pretty high. there are multitude of factors that are impacting oil, as you might already be aware, but those are the ones i'd call out.

operator
welcome to the darden fiscal year 2021 fourth quarter earnings call. [operator instructions] the conference is being recorded. if you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
i will now turn the call over to mr. kevin kalicak. thank you. you may begin.
kevin kalicak -- senior director of investor relations
thank you, regina. good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call.
joining me on the call today are gene lee, darden's chairman and ceo; rick cardenas, president and coo; and raj vennam, cfo. as a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning, and in its filings with the securities and exchange commission.
we are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the investor relations section of our website at darden.com. these discussion and presentation includes certain non-gaap measurements, and reconciliations of those measurements are included in the presentation. any reference to the pre-covid when discussing fourth quarter performance is a comparison to our fourth quarter of fiscal '19. and anyone -- annual reference to pre-covid is the trailing 12 months -- ending february of fiscal '20. this is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic's impact on the business as dining rooms closed and we pivoted to go-only model during the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. we plan to release fiscal '22 first quarter earnings on september 23 before the market opens followed by a conference call.
this morning, gene will share some brief remarks, rick will give an update on our operating performance and raj will provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for fiscal '22.
now i'll turn the call over to gene.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, kevin. good morning, everyone.
as you saw from our release this morning, we had a very strong quarter that exceeded our expectations as sales quickly accelerated from the third quarter. during our call a year ago, i talked about the resiliency of the full-service dining segment and the confidence we had in the industry's ability to bounce back from the impacts of the pandemic. and we've begun to see demand come back at strong levels.
as we think about the industry, our consumer insights team has done a lot of good work to better understand the size of the full-service dining segment. there are multiple sources of data that offers sales estimates for the restaurant industry and the size of the industry and the full service industry specifically varies considerably across these sources. this year we are adopting technomic as our data source, which we believe better reflects the sales contribution from independent operators, provides a broader view of the restaurant industry and aligns more closely with the census data. going forward, we will be referencing industry data provided by technomic which sizes the casual dining and fine dining categories for fiscal 2020 at $189 billion and for fiscal 2019 at $222 billion.
given the strong demand we're seeing in the financial health of the consumer, we believe the categories will return to that size or greater, it's quite having approximately 10% fewer units than before the onset of the pandemic. over the last 15 months, we have made numerous strategic investments. at the restaurant level, we've invested in food quality and portion size that will help strengthen the long-term value perceptions for each brand. we also made considerable investments in our team members to ensure our employment proposition remains a competitive advantage. and we invest in technology, particularly within our to go capabilities, i mean our guest growing need for convenience and desire for the off-premise experience.
our business model has evolved and is much stronger today. as we begin our new fiscal year, we will remain disciplined in our approach to growing sales. more specifically, our focus is on driving profitable sales growth. given the business transformation work we have done and the demand we are seeing from the consumer, we are well positioned to thrive in this operating environment.
before i turn it over to rick, i want to say thank you to our team members in our restaurants and our support center. this was without a doubt the most challenging year in our company's history. but thanks to dedication, perseverance, we have emerged stronger. on behalf of the board of directors and the senior leadership team, thank you for all you do to take care of our guests and each other. rick?
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
thank you, gene, and good morning, everyone. our results this quarter are a combination of the business model transformation work that gene referenced as well as a simplification efforts we implemented throughout the year. significant process in menu simplification at each brand has enabled us to drive high levels of execution and strengthen margins, further positioning our brands for long-term success.
as we began the quarter, our restaurant teams remain disciplined, while continuing to operate in a difficult and unpredictable environment. as restrictions continue to ease and dining traffic increased, our teams successfully managed through it, thanks to their focus on being brilliant with the basics, ensuring we provided great food with outstanding service and an enjoyable atmosphere for all of our guests. this enabled us to deliver record setting results.
for example olive garden broke its all-time single day sales record on mother's day. additionally, both olive garden and longhorn steakhouse achieved the highest quarterly segment profit in their history. even as capacity restrictions eased and we were able to utilize more of our dining rooms, off-premise sales remained strong during the quarter. off-premise sales accounted for 33% of total sales at olive garden, 19% at longhorn and 16% at cheddar's scratch kitchen.
guest demand for off-premise has been stickier than we originally thought, and this is driven by the focus of our restaurant teams and the investments we made to improve our digital platform throughout the year. technology enhancements to online ordering and the introduction of new capabilities such as to go capacity management and curbside i'm here notification improved the experience for our guests, while making it easier for our operators to execute. as a result, during the quarter, 64% of olive garden's to go orders were placed online, and 14% of darden's total sales were digital transactions. thanks to additional technology enhancements, we continue to see guests to utilize our digital tools, even when they were dining in our restaurants.
nearly half of our guest checks were settled digitally, either online on our tabletop tablets or via mobile pay. the business model improvements we have made also reinforce our ability to open value creating new restaurants across all of our brands. during the quarter, we opened 14 new restaurants and these restaurants are outperforming our expectations. while, raj will discuss specific new restaurant targets for fiscal '22, we are working to develop a pipeline of restaurants and future leaders that would put us at the higher end of our long-term framework of 2 %to 3% sales growth from new units as we enter fiscal 2023.
finally, the strength of the darden platform has helped our brands navigate near term external challenges. the employment environment has been an issue for the industry. however, the power of our employment proposition strengthened by the investments we have made in our people continue to pay off as we retain our best talent and recruit new team members to more fully staff our restaurants. so, while there are staffing challenges in some areas, we are not experiencing systematic issues. additionally, the strength of our platform has helped us avoid significant supply chain interruptions. our supply chain team continues to leverage our scale to ensure our restaurant teams have the key products they need to serve our guests.
notably, the few spot outages we have experienced are related to warehouse staffing and driver shortages, not product availability. to wrap up, i also want to recognize our outstanding team members. during my restaurant visits, i'm inspired by the positive attitude and flexibility you demonstrate every day. thank you for all you have done and continue to do to deliver great experiences for our guests.
now, i'll turn it over to raj.
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
thank you, rick and good morning everyone.
total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.3 billion, 79.5% higher than last year, driven by 90.4% same restaurant sales growth and the addition of 30 net new restaurants, partially offset by one less week of operations this year. the improvements we made to our business model combined with fourth quarter sales accelerating faster than cost grows strong profitability, resulting in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.03.
our reported earnings were $0.76 higher due to a non-recurring tax benefit of $99.7 million. this benefit primarily relates to our estimated federal net operating loss for fiscal year 2021, which we will carry back in the preceding five years. looking at our performance throughout the quarter, we saw same restaurant sales versus pre-covid improving from negative 4.1% in march, positive 2.4% in may. and same restaurant sales for the first three weeks of june were positive 2.5% compared to two years ago.
to go sales for olive garden and longhorn continue to be significantly higher than pre-covid levels. we have seen a gradual decline in weekly to go sales, however that decline is being more than offset by an increasing dining sales.
turning to the fourth quarter p&l, compared to pre-covid results, food and beverage expenses were 90 basis points higher, driven by investments in both food quality and pricing below inflation. for reference, food inflation in q4 was 4.3% versus last year. restaurant labor was 190 basis points lower driven by hourly labor improvement of 320 basis points due to efficiencies gained from the operational simplification and was partially offset by continued wage pressures. marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 200 basis points of favorability. g&a expense was 30 basis points lower driven primarily by savings from the corporate restructuring earlier in the year.
as a result, we achieved record restaurant level ebitda margin for darden of 22.6%, 310 basis points above pre-covid levels and record quarterly ebitda of $412 million. we had $5 million in impairments due to the write-off of multiple restaurant-related assets and our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12% excluding the impact of the non-recurring tax benefit i previously mentioned.
looking at our segments. we achieved record segment profit dollars and margins at olive garden, longhorn, and the other business segment this quarter. fine dining improved segment profit margins versus pre-covid despite sales declines. these results were driven by reduced labor and marketing expenses as we continue to focus on simplified operations while also continuing to invest in food quality and pricing below inflation.
fiscal 2021 was a year like no other and despite the challenges of constantly shifting capacity restrictions and an uncertain guest demand, we delivered $7.2 billion in total sales. the actions we took in response to covid-19 to solidify our cash position and transform our business model help build a solid foundation for recovery and resulted in over $1 billion in adjusted ebitda and over $920 million of free cash flow.
as a result, we repaid our term loan, reinstated our pre-covid dividend and quickly built up our cash position. our disciplined approach to simplifying operations and driving profitable sales growth positions us well for the future. as a result of our strong performance, cash position and the fiscal 2022 outlook, this morning, we also announced our board approved a 25% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share, implying an annual dividend of $4.40. this results in a yield of 3.2% based on yesterday's closing share price.
finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022, we assume full operating capacity for essentially all restaurants and we do not anticipate any significant business interruptions related to covid-19. based on these assumptions, we expect total sales of $9.2 billion to $9.5 billion, representing growth of 5% to 8% from pre-covid levels, same restaurant sales growth of 25% to 29% and 35 to 40 new restaurants. capital spending of $375 million to $425 million, total inflation of approximately 3% with commodities inflation of approximately 2.5%, and hourly labor inflation of approximately 6%. ebitda of $1.5 billion to $1.59 billion, and annual effective tax rate of 13% to 14% and approximately 131 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. all resulting in a diluted net earnings per share between $7 and $7.50.
and with that, we'll open it up for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of brian bittner with oppenheimer. please go ahead.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you. good morning. gene, you stated that darden is well positioned to thrive in this operating environment and i think that's just a pretty powerful statement giving all the labor challenges and cost issues that we're hearing from all of your peers. what is your reaction to these dynamics and why specifically, do you believe darden is standing out from the crowd as it relates to the near-term impacts from these issues?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
let's start with, on the labor front, i mean, we've made significant investments over time in our people starting way back when we had the tax reform. we made the choice to invest in our people at that point in time. we've invested in our people throughout the pandemic. our best people have stayed with us through this. we have an attractive employment proposition, we're able to attract people to our businesses to work for us. we think that we're fairly well staffed right now, and as the environment continues to improve, we see no reason why we are not the employer of choice in our businesses. and i've been pretty clear saying i think the restaurant industry has got -- is going to continue to struggle attracting workers but there is enough great hospitality workers out there to staff all at darden restaurants if we provide the best employment proposition.
and not just in employment proposition, today it's about potential growth. our ability to promote from within, we're promoting 1,000 team members a year into management. we're providing other opportunities through training and going out in opening new restaurants. i think our team members royal love the experience. and so i think that we're in great shape from an employment standpoint. we'll continue to invest, we'll manage, we'll do great salary administration, ensure that we are paying competitive wages. and i think that we have the flexibility to manage the wage inflation because of our margin structure and combined with our pricing philosophy, i think we have some room there, if need be to offset that and to be able to increase wages if we need to.
as far as food inflation goes, i mean, our team has done a fantastic job, we're fairly long on the things that we need to be long on and i think using our platform and our scale to our advantage. through this has been a big advantage. and we feel like we're very well positioned to manage whatever inflation comes our way in the near term and even in the long term.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks, gene. and just quick follow-up for raj. we're no longer talking about 90% sales recapture thankfully, we're on the other side, does it feels in your guidance for '22 is 5% to 8% above pre-covid level. so obviously over 100% recapture. and i believe the ebitda margins at the midpoint of that guidance are 16.5%, so 250 basis points above pre-covid. so what is the philosophy on communicating investments to us now and the philosophy on communicating how you're thinking about ebitda margins, now that this path for sales above pre-covid levels is so much more clear?
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
yeah, brian, i think as we look at where our guidance is, let me just start with that. when you think about what we guided this morning for fiscal 2022, that implies ebitda margin growth of between $200 million on the lower end to $250 million on the higher end. and so clearly our sales have recovered. some of the flow through we're letting it flow to the bottom line, but we have made some investments, continue to make investments and as gene mentioned, we are -- we are pricing well below inflation and in fact as i think this morning, we said we expect overall inflation to be around 3% and our pricing is in the middle of our 1% to 2% target. so we are pricing well below inflation, that's a biggest investment we're making. and but also gives us some extra dry powder if there was additional inflation that was to come our way.
so we do think the $200 million to $250 million is a good target for us now, but as we think beyond that i think we need to better understand the economic and competitive environment as we hone in on the business model, and i would say, based on where we are today, we expect to retain most of that margin improvement we seen -- we'll see in fy '22.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer -- analyst

hey, thanks for the question. my question is on the inflation outlook. clearly there have been some big moves in commodities in recent weeks. can you talk about some of the key variables including that 3% inflation, i think you said 2.5% on the food side and perhaps how that might stage throughout the year? do you expect inflation to be higher in the beginning of the fiscal year before perhaps leveling out toward the end. thanks.
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
yeah. hi, rick. so yes, as you look at inflation, we said commodities is around 2.5% for the full year, but it is the front -- the front half of the year is somewhere between 3.5% to 4% and then -- then it is a little bit -- it tapers off a little bit as we go into the back. and as i said in my prepared remarks, q4 this year was 4.3% which implies -- which is where we think as we wrap on our next year, we expect q4 to be more closer to flat. and so that's kind of the cadence and then as you -- about the drivers of commodity inflation, i'd say chicken and seafood are high. and we're also seeing significant inflation in cooking oil, a little bit in dairy and i'd say the other thing is packaging.
packaging continues to be, especially with resin cost going up, packaging is another factor. so all in all, those are the big drivers of inflation on the commodity side. and on the labor side, overall labor we expect to be somewhere between 4%, 4.5% but wage rate itself, we expect that to be around 6%.

your next question comes from the line of david tarantino with baird.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
hi, good morning. i'm wondering related to olive garden or perhaps your overall sales, how much do you think capacity constraints are still in play in terms of weighing down the performance? and i guess relatedly, what do you think the upside of as you see the restaurants come back to full capacity now that you're seeing some of these to go sales stick more than you thought they would?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, david, good morning. and it is very limited capacity restrictions out there. there are few -- still a few states and municipalities that have some restrictions on us, but we got california back last week and we got new york back. so the big, there is not major market has restrictions. i think that when i think -- when we think about where we're at from a sales perspective, we think there is still more room inside the restaurants as we continue to work on. we think that work we do it with our -- all our menus in our business model is going to help us with throughput, which is going to enable us to in these high-volume periods get more volume to the restaurant, i think rick's comment in his prepared remarks about what the teams were able to do and execute on mother's day to have the biggest and the best mother's day we've ever had before.
so there's a lot of our ability to execute and get more people through our restaurant in a limited time period. so i don't think we have any capacity restrictions. obviously we're seeing less sales growth on the weekends than we are, than we are mid week, just because there's less opportunity in a lot of our high volume restaurants to get through extra volume. so i mean there is still, the word i use a lot is we're still in search equilibrium and we're not there yet. and i don't know when we're going to be there when we see consumers really get into what i would call a normal behavior pattern. and we kind of get to where we understand what the in-restaurant dining is going to be, what the off-premise is going to be. rick in his comments talked about that, we're pleased with where the off-premise is leveling out even though is declining slightly, but we know and i said this a while ago, and i think you guys -- a lot of you guys disagree with me. i think you're right, and i was wrong that some of this off-premise was stickier than what we thought.
and i think a lot has to do with the capabilities we created through the pandemic and make it a lot less friction, but i'm searching -- we're searching for equilibrium, understanding when and where the business is going to is going to come from. i think we're still in the early innings of that. i think we still got a lot more upside.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
thanks. thanks for that gene. and then i guess one other follow-up question on this point is the gap between how longhorn is performing and how olive garden is performing relative to pre-covid is very significant. i was wondering if you could give your thoughts on why either longhorn has outperformed by so much or olive garden's kind of lagging the performances in -- for longhorn?
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
well, the first thing i would say is, olive garden is not lagging. i mean just thrilled with their performance. when you're looking at 25.5% restaurant-level margins and getting back to pre-covid sales levels, that's just amazing. that performance is unbelievable. when you look at what's going on in longhorn, we've been investing in that business for five years since todd's come back and he and his team have just done a great job of improving the value perception. when we look at where they are in technomic and the ratings, they are number one in most categories. they moved from middle of the pack to number one, and so i think longhorn's performance is just a combination of a lot of work over a great period of time. and i also -- i want to also recognize that the whole steakhouse segment is moving. the whole steakhouse segment has outperformed the other segments. and i believe that because they have -- the segment has high-value perceptions. so they're definitely getting the segment lift, but they've also done a great job and they're executing at an extremely high level.

your next question comes from the line of jeffrey bernstein with barclays.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
great, thank you very much. two quick ones, actually. the first one just on the first quarter as we now seemingly exit hopefully the pandemic, i think you said june, your month-to-date comps were up 2.5%. i think that's actually identical to what you said for may. i'm just wondering how does that compared to expectation, whether you would have expected further acceleration with additional markets like you said having recently reopened or any kind of thoughts you can give us having given us full-year guidance, just wondering, want to make sure with this being the first quarter of lapping full covid. any thoughts on those sales or whether there's any parameters around the earnings that you want us to think about? and then, one follow-up.
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
hey, jeff. this is raj. so when you think about the cadence, i mean i think may to june, i mean, three weeks, 2.5%, that's -- we feel pretty good about where we are on that in terms of same restaurant sales. i would argue they are actually a little bit better than what we would -- we had expected going into the fiscal year. and then as you look at the cadence of some these -- as the markets open up, as the capacity restrictions are lifted, we are seeing some movement, especially in california and places like that, but when you blend everything at the darden level, some of these brands that are impacted the most are brands that are not a big portion -- a big part of our overall portfolio. so it takes a lot to move the needle on our blended same-restaurant sales.
and then, there are other factors you got to take into consideration, especially as you look at versus fiscal '19, because we're not doing some of the promotional activity, we're not doing things that would have stimulated demand in the past that we're doing now, right. so there is that. we are basically comparing to a level that was different when we had a lot more spend in marketing and other stuff. but as gene said, i think this is continuation of the same theme that we are thrilled with where we are and we're also thrilled with our business model. however -- and the fact that we're able to make investments not only in our people, but also in our guests through food quality, food portion and pricing. so we're giving a lot back to the guests, while giving -- while actually getting a strong business model. and so i think that's how i would, i guess, address the question.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
great. and then just my follow up, just wondering, as you think about fiscal '22, what do you think is the greatest risk? i mean, seemingly, you're feeling quite good about current quarter-to-date trends and thriving in the outlook commentary. but in terms of risks to fiscal '22, would you say it's more on the sales, or the cost side, maybe where you think yourself and/or the industry would be most vulnerable as we come out on the other side? thank you.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think the greatest risk is covid. i mean we're -- i think we're again in a point where we think -- we're getting to the other side of that, but when i look at what we've put out there for guidance, i think that -- i think we -- obviously, we think we can achieve that, but i look at the greatest risks is being as external, not internal, and i don't see risk from a sales perspective or a cost perspective. i think we've got the flexibility and we've set this up to have the flexibility to deal with almost anything that is thrown at us with the exception of another out-breaking covid where we had to have some restrictions on our business. to me, that's the greatest risk that what we put forth.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst

your next question will come from the line of chris carril with rbc capital markets.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning and thanks for the question. so just -- and looking at the segment margins, holding aside the performance at olive garden and longhorn, the other business segment margin was particularly strong and well above 2019. so curious to hear what some of the key drivers of the performance were in that segment and maybe how much of a factor that segment's improvement is contributing to your '22 outlook? and i know last quarter you had discussed the improvements at cheddar's. so any additional color or update there would be great as well.
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i think as we look at our -- chris, when we -- as we look at the other segment, i'd point out a couple of brands, where the business model transformation was significant. i'll say cheddar's is big part of that and bahama breeze is another brand where we saw a significant improvement in the business model and part of this is going back to the simplification. we had a chance to kind of break down everything, rebuilt back up and to kind of figure out a way to transform the business model. so those two brands are primarily contributing the significant -- the growth we have in the other segment.
and as we look at next fiscal year, they still play a decent role, right. i mean, when you look at the other segment is about 20% of it, so they are not going to be a huge contributor, but rated to their size, they are going to be outperforming on the segments -- segment margin.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, chris, on cheddar's, i would just say that we're extremely pleased with this business at this point. as raj indicated, the biggest improvement in the business model in all of our business came in cheddar's. we continue to focus on strengthening the restaurant leadership teams to be able to handle the future growth. but overall, we are -- we're very pleased with where this business is at today and very excited about the potential.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks for that detail. and i'll just pass it along here.

your next question will come from the line of james rutherford with stephens. please go ahead.
james rutherford -- stephens -- analyst
yeah, thanks. i wanted to start off with a technology question for rick. last quarter, you mentioned being in the middle of developing a new three-year roadmap for technology and i wanted -- just curious if you -- where you expect to see the biggest returns, whether it's consumer facing in the box, online, back of the house, support center kind of -- or in some other area? i mean, where are the biggest opportunities and priorities for the next three years on the tech side?
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
yeah, james, thanks for the question. we have completed our three-year roadmap and what we're working on and we look at it in a few places, but the primary -- i would say the primary theme is reducing friction. so what we're doing with technology is reducing friction in the guest experience, in the team member experience and in the manager experience and what we do. and so that would mean continuing to enhance our premise capabilities, to make it easier for guests to order, to order repeat orders and to pick up their off-premise experience. in the restaurant, we're looking at a revamp of our point-of-sale system. it's a pretty old system that we developed years ago. we're going to revamp that to make it much easier for our team members to handle our guest experience -- to handle the guest experience and to handle off-premise.
and for the managers, we're simplifying the way things look in the back of the house. so a lot of our systems, while they have great back-ends, very great back-ends, the user interface isn't as great. so we're working on improving the user interface. but all of those are under the theme of reducing friction.
james rutherford -- stephens -- analyst
okay, excellent. and then, raj, just want one follow-up. i think last quarter you said you were sitting at 115,000 hourly employees across the company. could you update us on where you stand today and where you view full employment, given the demand environment here today?
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
i don't know that we're comfortable sharing the total number of employees at this point, but i would just say we have made significant progress. in fact, going back, i don't know that we -- i don't remember if we said 115,000. i think it was a little bit more than that, but anyway, at this point, i'm not so sure we want to get into the exact number of employees other than just -- but we feel pretty good with where we're staffed and we don't see any gaps.
james rutherford -- stephens -- analyst
okay. excellent. thank you so much and congratulations.

your next question comes from the line of andrew charles with cowen.
andrew charles -- cowen -- analyst
great, thanks. raj, you guys impressively raised your dividend 25% to $1.10 and if you think about the historical 50% to 60% target payout ratio, this would imply eps of $7.33 to $8.80 versus the former guidance of $7 to $7.50. can you help rectify that a little bit? is it just conservatism reflected in the former guidance?
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
okay, great question. let me -- let me start with. when you think about how we look at our dividend. the 50% to 60% is our target range, right. but in this point -- at this point given where we are with our cash on the balance sheet, we feel pretty good about going to the higher end of that range. so as you pointed out, if you look at 60%, then we're right, it is closer to the middle of our guidance. so if you take the middle of our guidance we are basically a 60% payout. so that's not that -- i would argue that's not that different from the 50% to 60% especially given we're sitting on a $1.2 billion cash flow and we expect to still generate significant free cash flow.
and at the end of the day when we look at our business model, this will -- only the proposed dividend out of the dividend that we actually announced this morning only it's up about 50% of our free cash flow. so it feels really good about where we are and also just remember the target is over time, we had a year where we were below the target. so think of this as a way to kind of make up for a little bit of that.
andrew charles -- cowen -- analyst
that's fair. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of jeff farmer with gordon haskett.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
thank you. on the march earnings call, you reported that hourly labor productivity had improved, but i think you said over 20% for the system. so i'm just curious two things, how are you measuring labor productivity and i think you touched on it a little bit earlier, but how have you driven this level of improvement in productivity?
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
hey, jeff, this is rick. yes, we did mention that productivity was about 20% better across the system and we measured on an hours per guests basis. so how many, how many guests can we serve per hour per labor hour. and we're still seeing significant labor productivity improvements as raj mentioned, we had a significant improvement in labor per -- labor margin even with inflation. and the way we did it with what we've been talking about for the last year is continue to improve our processes from the food coming into the back door to getting to the table, which means significant menu design work, significant prep work design work, which took a lot of the steps and procedures out of the kitchen.
and what i would say is we are never done with that. we redesigned our processes. over the last year, we have to look at them again and we have to redesign again. so we're going to continue to do that to drive efficiencies, where we should drive efficiencies, so that we can reinvest those savings in our plate and give a better experience for our guests.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
and then just as a quick follow-up and i might have missed this earlier, i apologize, but of the 25 states or so that have ended the supplemental unemployment benefits early, what has the hiring or staffing dynamic looked like since that's happened in those states?
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
yeah, jeff, a lot of those states announced something either late may, early june, that would take effect sometime in june. and i think the first state took effect maybe last week. and you know, anecdotally, we've seen a little bit of an improvement in the trends of applicant flow, but we've seen it all across the country, not just states that have eliminated the ui. but even states that haven't yet, it could because the states that haven't yet are actually starting to open up and so you're going to see applicant flow. but we feel really good about our applicant flow into our restaurants. we are hiring, we're net hiring a lot of people every week, we had a record hiring quarter in the fourth quarter and we feel really good about where we are.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of brett levy with mkm partners.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
great, thanks for taking the call and good morning. i guess just two separate questions. you're obviously talking about some significant ebitda margin expansion. how should we be thinking about that from a split between the recovery of g&a spending as well as the unit level profitability? and does this, does the progress you've seen of late change what you think the longer-term ceilings are for your restaurant-level margin?
and then the second question is on the development side, we've obviously seen a lot of news out there, delays of inflation of labor availability. are you -- what are you seeing on those fronts and how confident are you about either the cadence of the 35 to 40 year or the ability to reach the higher end. thank you.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, brett, let me start and then i'll hand it over to rick for the development question. so as you look at our margins, i would argue a lot, obviously the margin that you saw in q4 where bulk of it came from the restaurant level, there is a little bit at the g&a, i see a little bit, it's actually 30 basis points, 40 basis points, which is huge. so i think as you look forward, i think the way to think about it is, g&a is probably going to be in that somewhere around 40 basis points of favorability. but then the rest is going to come from the restaurant level margins.
and the way i would kind of categorize that is that really restaurant labor and marketing are going to have -- to see an improvement. however, you're going to, we're going to continue to see some increase in food costs because of the investments. that's a deliberate choice we made. and then, so that's how i'd kind of categorize that. and then the restaurant expenses line should be a little bit better, but not a significant because that's one especially because we are not pricing in line with overall inflation, you got to have an impact on all the line items across the p&l. rick?
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
brett, on the development side, this is rick. on the development side, we have a couple of things, one is we said in our pipeline at the beginning of covid and we restarted the pipeline during this fiscal year as we saw us coming out of that. we feel really good about the 14 restaurants reopened, but i would say, you hear a lot about labor shortages in construction and about product shortages in construction, we're getting out in front of that. so we're ordering product a lot farther in advance than we used to. so to make sure that we've got the stainless steel in the kitchen to do the things that we need to do.
the good news is, you're seeing some of these input costs come down. so, hopefully by the time we're starting to build our restaurants those input costs are back to more reasonable level. that said, the margin improvements we've made in our restaurants, in our restaurant profitability has really helped even if the inflation was where people are hearing about it. in terms of the cadence of openings, as i said, we got in front of this and started ordering product earlier for our restaurants, but we typically opened mid teens, the restaurants in the fourth quarter and of our 35 to 40 restaurants. we're going to open this year, we'll probably have mid teens in the fourth quarter and the other ones will be kind of spread throughout this fiscal year.

your next question will come from the line of lauren silberman with credit suisse. lauren, you may be on mute. we can hear you now.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
you can hear me? okay, great. so on the to go. you talked about to go being stickier than perhaps you originally thought. so are you seeing any discernible differences across markets that have recaptured more on-premise sales? and then, is there anything that you can share on how consumers are using multiple occasion and whether that's a replacement for on-premise versus an at home meal?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think for off-premise, they're using it as a home meal replacement or maybe in the workplace during the day. i think there is no behavioral change there at all. and there is no, there is really no difference than what's happening throughout the country as more restaurants, more dining rooms open. it's been the kind of the same kind of shift. you ticked down a couple of hundred basis points and you pick more of that up in the dining room. again i think that, as i said earlier, i just think this, i think i'll give the analyst community credit on this. this was, this was stickier than what we thought, we know we've reached some new consumers here and the experience is very, very good.
and so i think that we don't know where it's going to net out. it's going to net out a lot higher than it was pre-covid and i think it's something that's part of our business, we will have to pay a lot more attention to as we move forward.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. and just if i could do a follow up on june running the 2.5%. are there any seasonality considerations in june relative to may or are you largely seeing similar average weekly sales?
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
i'd say, yeah, the similar average weekly sales, once you take out the noise of the holidays.

your next question will come from the line of chris o'cull with stifel.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
thanks, good morning guys. raj, i believe you stated that demand came back at a faster pace than cost. i was hoping you could elaborate on what those costs were given staffing hasn't been an issue and maybe the impact of that timing dynamic?
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
well, i'd say a little bit of it is -- was staff -- we had to catch up on staffing to the -- through the quarter as they accelerated faster than we hired. but by the end of the quarter we're in a good place. so there was, there was a little bit of that. but beyond that it's, i think as you look at our p&l, you can see obviously the marketing didn't grow as we grew as we had sales come in. we didn't have the level of travel was lot less. some of these costs that we have, the other cost is really more around growth costs that we said we're going to want to bring back, especially because we want to kind of have the right pipeline of talent for new openings and those costs are -- we were holding off on some of these to wait for the sales to get back to the levels where we thought. we were delivering the right level of the returns. and so, now that the sales are at the levels that are above the pre-covid, some of these costs will have -- we want to put that back into the p&l and that's part of the guidance that we provided this morning.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
can you quantify the impact to the store-level labor that from that timing mismatched during the quarter?
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
i'd say it's in the 10 basis points, 20 basis points. not huge.

your next question comes from the line of jon tower with wells fargo.
jon tower -- wells fargo -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my question. rick, i just wanted to circle back on a comment you made about unit growth in fiscal '23, potentially being above or -- sorry, toward the higher end of that 2% to 3% range that you've historically guided to. i'm just curious how sustainable do you feel that level of growth is into the future beyond just fiscal '23 in terms of that potentially being a catch-up year of growth from this kind of more disrupted period? and then, perhaps you can dig into the components of that growth. obviously, olive garden's done a bigger piece of the growth new [phonetic] store -- excuse me, bigger piece of growth historically. but going forward, how should we think of that relative to the other brands in the portfolio?
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
jon, thanks. first of all, on the sustainability of the growth going forward, the only thing that's going to slow us down in growth after this kind of ramp up is having enough people to open our restaurants, right, having enough general managers ready and able to open our restaurants. we believe that we can stay in the higher end of our range for a little while now. the economic environment could be different in a year or two. that might change that, but we feel really confident that we can get closer to the higher end of our range, because of the business model improvements we have made and it gives us the ability to open even more olive gardens, right. then we were opening an olive garden before we would impact many olive gardens around them, but with the business model enhancements olive garden has made, we feel even more confident being able to open some of those.
raj had already mentioned cheddar's and how much they've improved their business model. that has given us more confidence in being able to open more cheddar's, so that gives us the ability to get toward the higher end of that range. every one of our brands has the ability to grow and that's the important thing. we've made significant improvements in the business model bahama breeze. while someone asked about the other segment, i wanted to tell you the seasons 52 has also made a huge model improvement even though their sales growth wasn't as strong as the bahama breeze because of their clientele. that's all coming back. we've opened some pretty darn good seasons 52s recently and we opened a great bahama breeze recently. so we feel really good about our ability to open all of our brands and be at the higher end of our range for the foreseeable future unless the economic environment changes.
jon tower -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. and then just following up to the comments on the to go business, i think you'd mentioned that 64% of the to go orders were online and i'm just curious to get your thoughts on how you're communicating with those customers today. i mean, is this essentially opening up a new channel of marketing that you've already put in place or is that something that you're not necessarily even doing today, but down the line could harvest as a new marketing channel?
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
hey, jon. because they're ordering online, we do get a little bit more information about them than we would on a phone order or other orders. and that gives us the ability to market to them in the future. we haven't really done a whole lot of marketing in the last year, right. olive garden has done their tv because we have bought that media already. we've done some digital marketing just to keep the digital marketing moving, but we haven't really started focusing on those new customers and speaking directly to them. and as we start thinking that we need to ramp things up, that's a great source of people to market to now that weren't coming to us before.

your next question comes from the line of dennis geiger with ubs.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great, thanks. gene, i appreciate the commentary on the industry and the industry size and then shrinking supply. just wondering if there's anything more that you can share on whether you've been able to identify gains for your brands from the restaurants that have permanently closed or if you have any updated thoughts going forward on how you're thinking about your opportunity to gain share from that percentage of supply that's going away?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think -- dennis, i think our opportunity to gain share is back to our ability to execute at a really high level and the fact that we have continued to invest in portion size and quality, and i think that's the key. i think this is all about running great restaurants and executing at a high level and i think we have a huge opportunity to gain share in all of our restaurants through comp store sales growth and through organic growth. that's why we're excited about the ability -- our ability to add a lot of new restaurants.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
that's great and then just kind of building on that, just one more if i could on olive garden, kind of just following up on the solid recovery that the brand has seen already, if you could talk just a bit more about some of the drivers of the continued auv growth over, let's say, the near to medium term. just want to make sure that i understand correctly that it's probably not really a function of further capacity increases from the brand from here, but if it's kind of specific drivers, if it's the marketing that you were just talking about turning that on, if its potential promotional activities that you have in your back pocket, if it's digital, it's probably all of that and more, but just curious if you could kind of speak to just some of those drivers perhaps?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think it's only -- i think it's one significant driver and that's we have to improve the craveability of the food and we continue to do that by investing in portions and quality. the team is laser-focused on this and i think that's the best driver of overall profitable sales growth.

great, thanks. yeah, i just wanted to follow up on dennis' question, gene, around the industry, and you said there's been about 10% fewer units coming out of the industry. we're seeing labor shortage and just curious if you're seeing any sort of benefits on rent or availability of real estate, or anything more specific around development that may be a benefit to darden.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, there is tremendous speculation in the real estate market driving prices up.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
okay and then just lastly on menu and menu innovation, how are you guys thinking about menu innovation and expanding the menu? is the labor squeeze right now? and i know you guys said it's not really as much impact on you guys, but is that keeping a lid a little bit on menu innovation? you guys still focusing on some of the core? any thoughts there?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're focused on the core. we're -- all innovation right now is trying to improve the products the majority of our consumers buy. we love that focus. we think we're improving craveability. we continue to keep our restaurants simplifying and we're sticking to one on, one off. the teams have great discipline around that right now, and i think that that's key to our ability to execute at a high level and as rick talked about the improvement in productivity and it's the resulting in these record-level restaurant level margins.

well, i don't think there's any reason why demand with pullback. i mean, demand might shift from suburban to urban a little bit as business travel starts to reignite. i've been thrilled with the recovery in the last six weeks to seven weeks in fine dining. i was surprised how resilient the business was in suburbia through the pandemic. we've still got a seven or eight really large restaurant in what i would call the heavy urban core that are starting to come back slowly, but overall, i think this business is doing really, really well. and the one business that has started to come back the last couple of weeks was seasons 52, which was hit pretty hard when you think about who their consumer was. and so, upscale fine dining is performing well above what we thought it would be and is coming back very quickly as we get our three major restaurant in new york city back up and running in downtown boston and downtown dc. those five restaurants a quarter of what we do and they're starting to come back quickly.
nicole miller regan -- piper sandler -- analyst
and anything you would change in the, excuse me comment briefly on the customer profile same guest, different guest eating differently coming at different times, just more of the same like it used to be. thank you.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think, i think again, we're seeing a little bit on the suburban business, we're seeing a little bit more weakened business than what we, what we did, we've seen a little bit of shift without the business travel on what mid-week looks like, but overall that dynamic and i go back to the, to my overused word is equilibrium, not trying to detour. equilibrium, we wait for equilibrium in that business and we're going to get there over the next six months to understand what the new norms are. but i think we've exposed, a lot of people to our fine dining brands through this and i think that they really love the experience.
nicole miller regan -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks again. appreciate it.

your next question comes from the line of andrew strelzik with bmo.
andrew strelzik -- bmo -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my question. first, i wanted to just clarify quickly on the margin commentary. the 200 to 250 basis point improvement, is that from an ev perspective relative to pre-covid levels, is that fiscal '22 levels. just some context around that. and then my other question is just on the off-premise business. yeah, i think there is some uncertainty about how to think about the growth of that channel after kind of a step function we've seen over the last 12 plus months. so what's the growth rate that you would expect from to go over the next 18 to 24 months, or maybe longer time whatever, you want to think about that and the drivers behind it. thanks.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll take the off-premise question, then raj can take the margin question, i think on off-premise until we understand where equilibrium is and where do we get the balance where is the new level, then we can think about growth. we do think we have more avenues to grow that business. we've learned a lot about that business through the pandemic that we can use. so i think grow it into the future. convenience -- consumers' desire for convenient is not going away. and i think we can fulfill that need with our, with our brands in our technology.
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
and andrew on the margin question, we are referring -- referencing pre-covid. so i think the way to think about it is our ebitda margin at the pre-covid was around 14%. i call, i think it was actually 14.1%. so the 200 basis points to 250 basis points is related to that.
andrew strelzik -- bmo -- analyst
great, thank you very much.

your next question comes from the line of john ivankoe with jp morgan.
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
hi, thank you. obviously you have doubled your off-premise sales per unit at olive garden, basically, fourth quarter '21 versus fourth quarter of '19. so that does leave a pretty substantial amount of capacity that kind of remains for on-premise dining. so i wanted to ask a few points on that. you mentioned that much of off-premise is being used as a home meal replacement that would suggest, i guess, the lack of cannibalization for on-premise dining, but can you possibly update those if you know the cannibalization numbers between is the percentage of off-premise sales that are coming from on-premise.
and i guess at this point, i mean do you think it's opportunity and necessity to basically bring back those on premise customers who were resolved or just so busy before that maybe people weren't getting to at times that they want. but just think about, you're getting that off-premise sales per on-premise sales per unit, back to the 100% level that you previously had in 2019. and if there is anything that you can talk about whether it's age cohort that level of vaccination state by state what have you that shows different levels of success of achieving on-premise sales '21 versus '19. thanks.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
john, that was a lot in there. i would say i want to be brief here is, and we're going to do whatever we can to drive as much on premise dining inside olive garden as we can be profitable and profitable sales in the dining room and we're going to try to grow as profitably as we can in the off-premise channel. we also have to recognize that at this point in time there is still a lot of people out there in our trade areas that aren't comfortable going into restaurants yet. and so we still have a ways to go to understand where that natural sales level for olive garden is going to level out and a lot to learn.
and so we haven't been got granular yet to understand who the consumer is, we will get there once we reach this new place. but our goal is to drive as much business as we possibly can profitable business as we can in restaurant and do as much profitably as we possibly can off-premise.
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
and do you have a sense of the amount of sales transfer between on premise and off-premise or is that, is that data that still needs to come?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
the best out of that needs to come, the environment is so dynamic and we will need to analyze that we've got the analytics to be able to really look at that, once we've got to this equilibrium that i'm talking about.
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
fair enough. thank you, gene.

your next question comes from the line of david palmer with evercore isi.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. i'm actually going to follow up on that. if we assume the 15% sales mix at olive garden pre-covid was off-premise you're looking at something like down high teens on premise and on a two-year basis. if that sounds about right what constraints, do you think were on the on-premise business in may and is it, is it really this consumer comfort that that's driving that decline and how are you thinking about those factors as we go through 2022, i'd be curious to hear whether you think there are any constraints that you would imagine, to the on-premise business getting back to say flat or even higher than 2019.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i mean, i think you have to, you have to think about what our promotional and marketing strategy was right now we're just, we're out there on television, just doing some brand advertising. we've been able to remove all incentives and all discounts from the business and will continue to analyze when might be right opportunity to put some of that back in. i mean this is a complicated question olive garden is never ever operated at these margin levels at this sales volume and so we need to, we need to move slowly.
i don't think that we're looking at what capacity was in '19 and try to triangulate as to where you guys are talking about it, we're trying to drive as much profitable sales as we possibly can. and so you know and we're just extremely pleased where this business is and we're not going to, we're not going to run the business and try to chase an index and get back to some level and deal with, look at our business, when i look at our business differently than maybe others are looking at it and i just couldn't be happier where we've repositioned the olive garden business and the record profitability, this business is throwing off.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
i'm thinking back to some of our earlier conversations on these earnings calls and i know you were thinking that that you might actually have this on premise swell, where you would overshoot on the on-premise, i wonder if we might be a couple of quarters away from that if the comfort levels continue to build. if that happens, do you think the capacity in terms of labor the seats, the lack of cannibalization from off-premise. i mean do you think that that could happen? do you still see that potential?

your next question comes from the line of john glass with morgan stanley.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much. first just gene, back on the industry and your outlook capacity is being reduced, your margins are high. how do you think about m&a in the portfolio right now, is this a good time to think about adding brands or is pricing difficult or you just very pleased with the current business and portfolio that you really don't think about m&a in this environment.
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
we always are talking with the board and the senior management about what the possibilities are to add a brand to our portfolio that would benefit from being on our platform, being on our platform and we would benefit that they would come onto our platform. so we're always thinking about that, but more so today, we're thrilled with the business model transformations in our business and we're very happy to invest our capital into our businesses and capture the return that we're getting today on those new businesses.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. and raj, if i could just clarify, you said you thought in '23, you could hold most of the gains in margins that you got this year. historically, darden has talked about 20 basis points to 40 basis points maybe of margin gain year-on-year just on natural leverage. is there some reason why '23 and beyond may be different like you may be marketing, may be a risk that you've got to add some of that back? how do we think about beyond the current year in terms of margin expansion?
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think, john, that's where i think there is still some time until we get to fiscal '23 and beyond. and really i think we need to better understand the economic and competitive environment and just -- we got to get hone in on this business model where we -- were the real -- i will use of gene's term of equilibrium is. i'm just kind of really want to get to find that. but i think where we are today, given the dry powder we have, whether it's with pricing or other levers we can pull, i -- we do feel confident we'll be able to keep most of the margin gains and i -- like i said, we're kind of -- we'll let it play out and we'll have more to share next time.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of jake bartlett with truist securities.
jake bartlett -- truist securities -- analyst
great, thanks for taking the question. gene, i was wondering, it's great to see the recovery with olive garden, but as their percentage increase versus '19, it is less than some of the other publicly traded companies that have reported. can you just maybe give us a couple of the reasons why you think that is? i imagine because you're at high capacity in '19 or are you have less marketing, but maybe just help us understand why olive garden has recovered i think to a less degree than a lot of the others?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
because we're not participating in giving away our food through third-party channels. we're not discounting heavily, we're not discounting our cash like others are through selling gift cards and we're running a business here to try to drive profitable sales growth. we've got our businesses doing over $5 million for average unit volumes. in the fourth quarter, we put up 25% restaurant level margins. isn't our job to try to drive profitable sales growth? and that's what we're focused on. and so there are a lot of reasons why we're not keeping up with where some of the other people are going. there's a lot that's changed in two years and how they're handling their businesses. some of them have virtual brands and all this other stuff that's out there. i mean, guys, you got to get off this. i mean, this is the best business in casual dining, not even by a little bit anymore, by a lot.
and we're doing $5 million in average unit volume with 25% plus restaurant-level margins and growing, and we've got -- our guests are loving the experience. they love the craveability of the food. they love the changes that we made. and we're executing at a very, very high level. i think we're going to continue to grow. but i'm not...
jake bartlett -- truist securities -- analyst
great, no, i really...
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm not chasing an index, so we're not chasing where we were in the past. we loved our position today.
jake bartlett -- truist securities -- analyst
great. i appreciate that. and i guess also just a question about the industry and about the kind of the cadence of the comps from april to may to june. we've seen people getting vaccinated, capacity restrictions being lifted. why do you think the cadence is not increasing? why don't you think may versus -- june versus may versus april is increasing? what are the offsets to some of the benefits which are capacity restrictions being lifted and people getting vaccinated?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm not sure i understand. we did see sequential improvement throughout these months. these look like pretty strong numbers as i look at them across. we saw fine dining go from 12%, down to 6% in may, that's without our new york restaurants. we've gone from other business 8% to 4% from 14% in march. i mean, we're seeing sequential improvement. and again, i think that as we think about it, this has been a very, very fast recovery. and as people start to live more normal -- get back to some normal behaviors, we think it's implied in our guidance that we're going to get back to a pretty good level here.
jake bartlett -- truist securities -- analyst
great. i appreciate it.

your next question will come from the line of jared garber with goldman sachs.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks for the question. gene and rick, you talked a little bit about the technology initiatives and some of the success you're having with the tabletop tablets. and i think, last quarter, you talked also about how this is maybe attracting a younger consumer to some of the brands. i just wanted to know if you had any update there on what you're seeing on a consumer side related to some of this technology? and maybe if you think the next kind of several years out, what are some of the consumer-facing technologies do you think you'll see or we'll see enter the restaurant space in the in-dining room part of the business? thanks.
rick cardenas -- chief operating officer
hey, jared. thanks. this is rick. the investments that we've made really recently is more about the off-premise experience, right. and so, there are -- just anybody who has come into our restaurants off-premise, the people that used to come inside, that may not still feel comfortable to come inside are going to off-premise and we are getting a new consumer. at cheddar's, we have a new consumer that didn't come to cheddar's before. i don't want to get into the details on that, which gives us more confidence in their ability. they do have the tabletop tablet. i am not going to say that their consumer is younger or older because of the tabletop tablet. it's because they're learning about cheddar's. and so, we're going to continue to invest as i said in removing friction to make it easier for our guests to eat where they want, when they want, and how they want and make it easier for our team members to serve them. and so, that's what we're going to continue to do without getting into the detail on the new guests or if technology is driving new guests. i'm not going to say technology is driving the guests.

our next question will come from the line of brian vaccaro with raymond james.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, thanks and good morning. gene, i just wanted to quickly circle back on the positive industry view in a post-covid world and kind of ask specifically how do you expect consumer behavior to normalize as it relates specifically to cooking at home versus ordering in? and also, how you see that consideration set that may have expanded for the average consumer to utilize casual dining for an off-premise occasion where that was not in the consideration set pre-covid? anything in the technomic data or other data to sort of size that opportunity to capture share of previously at-home cooking occasions?
gene lee -- chairman and chief executive officer
brian, i'm not sure i can quantify that, but i think you answered -- maybe you answered your question and your question is that the casual dining off-premise experience definitely got more exposure through covid. and i think people that would have never used that experience probably because they weren't casual dining users and now determined that's a really good option for home meal replacement. so i think that's an area where you're going to be able to hold on to this new consumer and maybe continue to market to them effectively. we don't have a whole lot of insight on cooking at home and home meal replacement. i do think that -- you're seeing mobility increase significantly, especially in the states that were heavily locked down. i mean i spent a lot of time in the northeast the last couple of weeks. it's still very quiet compared to what i see in georgia and florida when i travel. so, mobility still has the opportunity to increase in these marketplaces.
i don't know where -- i think we've still got another six months to nine months to understand if we don't have any more problems with covid, what are going to be the normal behaviors that are going to develop out of this and what was an adaptive behavior and what was normal? and we'll get there over the next six months to 12 months and we'll have a better understanding of consumer behaviors. and then i think you start developing your marketing plans and you get tactical on how to get to these folks and try to get them into your restaurants or use you as an off-premise dining occasion.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
that makes total sense. and a quick follow-up on the guidance. and raj, sorry if i missed it, but what does the guidance embed in terms of g&a and marketing spend in fiscal '22? thank you.
raj vennam -- chief financial officer
we did not necessarily share that detail, but i'll just tell you, like i think the g&a is expect -- you could expect to get some leverage on g&a and we expect marketing to be significantly reduced from pre-covid. without getting into the exact numbers, that's what i'd tell you.

operator
welcome to the darden fiscal year 2022 first quarter earnings call. [operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to mr. kevin kalicak. you may begin.
kevin kalicak -- senior director of investor relations
thank you, kevin. good morning everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. joining me on the call today are gene lee, darden's chairman and ceo; rick cardenas, president and coo; and raj vennam, cfo.
as a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the securities and exchange commission. we are simultaneously broadcasting presentation during this call, which is posted in the investor relations section of our website at darden.com.
today's discussion and presentation will include certain non-gaap measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. any reference to pre-covid when discussing first quarter performance is a comparison of the first quarter of fiscal 2020. this is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic's impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during the first quarter of fiscal '21.
we plan to release fiscal 2022 second quarter earnings on friday, december 17 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. this morning, gene will share some brief remarks on the first quarter results. rick will give an update on our operating performance, and raj will provide more detail on our financial results and an update of our fiscal '22 financial outlook.
now, i will turn the call over to gene.
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, kevin and good morning everyone. as you saw from our release this morning, we had a very good quarter. our teams continue to operate effectively in a challenging environment. and i'm proud of their focus and ability to deliver another quarter of strong sales and profitability. all of our segments delivered record first quarter profit. our ability to drive profitable sales growth is a testament to the strength of our business model and our continued to adherence this strategy we implemented six years ago. our brands remain laser focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere, while at the darden level, we concentrate on strengthening and leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented culture.
our first quarter sales trends started strong. this momentum carried over from the fourth quarter, and they further strengthened and peaked in july. however, in august, sales slowed due to the impact of the delta variant, but remained positive relative to pre-covid levels. for the first quarter, sales per operating week were up 4.8% relative to pre-covid. and through the first three weeks in september, sales per operating week were up approximately 7% relative to pre-covid.
regardless of the operating environment, our unwavering commitment to our strategy ensures we will stay focused on what we do best, providing exceptional guest experiences. throughout this unique period, our operators have shown tremendous flexibility, while remaining locked in on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. at the same time, our focus helps us continue to find ways to make our competitive advantages work even harder for us.
one of the ways we do this is by leveraging our ability to open value-creating new restaurants. we opened seven new restaurants during the quarter, all of which are exceeding our expectations. and we remain on track to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year. a long-term framework calls for 2% to 3% sales growth from new restaurants. given our stronger unit economics, our development team is working hard to build out a pipeline of locations for fiscal '23 and beyond that would put us at or above the higher end of our framework.
before i turn it over to rick, i want to thank our team members in our restaurants and our support center. as i visit our restaurants and talk with our teams, i'm constantly reminded why our people are our greatest competitive advantage. their passion for being of service to our guests and each other fuels our success. rick?
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
thank you, gene. and good morning everyone. our success this quarter was driven by the work we have done to simplify our processes and our menus to drive execution at the highest level. we also paused any new initiatives in order to further eliminate distractions for our restaurant teams and allow them to focus on what it takes to run 14 great shifts a week. in addition, to-go sales continue to benefit from the ongoing evolution of our digital platform. this platform makes it simpler for our guests to visit, order, pay and pick up, all while making it easier for our teams to execute at the highest level, both in the dining room and off-premise. this served our teams well, as to-go sales remained high through the quarter.
for the quarter, off-premise sales accounted for 27% of total sales at olive garden and 15% of total sales at longhorn steakhouse. digital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales during the quarter, and guest satisfaction metrics for off-premise experiences remained strong. as we navigate short-term external pressures, our focus is simple. we must continue to win when it comes to our people and product.
from a people perspective, the employment environment is challenging. that's why our top priority during the quarter was staffing our restaurants. our operators and hr teams have done a great job sourcing talent. we recently launched a new talent acquisition system that helps increase our pool of candidates by allowing applicants to apply and schedule an interview in five minutes or less. additionally, our brands are successfully utilizing their digital platforms, including social media to promote our employment proposition and drive applications. as a result, we are netting more than 1,000 new team members per week, and our team member count is approximately 90% of our pre-covid levels.
the biggest operational challenge we've been dealing with is a temporary exclusion of team members identified through contact tracing. given our commitment to health and safety, we are diligent about exclusions, but they create sudden staffing disruptions for our operators. despite being appropriately staffed in the majority of our restaurants, these exclusions reduce the number of available team members with little notice for our operators to prepare. this volatility can negatively impact sales in these restaurants for the duration of the exclusion period. getting and staying staffed also requires a strong focus on training. as we continue to hire, it is critical that we have the right training in place to ensure we continue to execute at a high level. that's why our operations leaders are validating the quality of our training during their restaurant visits, ensuring new team members receive the appropriate amount of training and successfully complete the required assessments.
our team members are the heart and soul of our business, and we are constantly focused on our employment proposition. the investments we have made and continue to make in our people are helping us retain and attract top talent, and i'm confident in our ability to address our staffing needs. when it comes to product, our significant scale, including our dedicated distribution capabilities, enables us to manage through the challenges affecting the global supply chain and maintain continuity for our restaurants. our supply chain team continues to work hard to ensure we successfully manage through any spot outages we encounter, and our restaurants have the key products they need to serve our guests.
during the quarter, we had to secure more product than usual on the spot market, because our brands exceeded sales expectations and some of our suppliers experienced capacity challenges. raj will share more details in a moment, but these higher sales volumes, as well as freight costs have contributed to higher-than-expected inflation. our scale advantage provides the opportunity for us to price below our competition and inflation, which is a strategy we have executed successfully. our competitive advantage of extensive data and insights allows us to be surgical in our pricing approach, positioning us well to deal with these higher costs and maintain our value leadership. the rich insights we gather from our analytics help us find the right opportunities to price in ways that minimize impact to traffic over time. we still expect pricing to be well below the rate of inflation for the year, further strengthening our value proposition.
ensuring our restaurants are appropriately staffed and our supply chain continues to avoid significant disruptions, will be the most important factors of our continued success in the short term.
to wrap up, i also want to recognize our outstanding team. i'm inspired by the dedication and winning spirit that our leaders and team members, both in our restaurants and in our support center continue to demonstrate. thanks to each of you for all that you do to continue to create exceptional experiences for our guests.
now, i'll turn it over to raj.
raj vennam -- senior vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
thank you, rick and good morning everyone. total sales for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, 51% higher than last year, driven by 47.5% same restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.76. we returned approximately $330 million to our shareholders this quarter, paying $144 million in dividends and repurchasing $186 million in shares.
we had strong performance this quarter, despite increased inflationary pressures with ebitda of $370 million and ebitda margin of 16%, 250 basis points higher than pre-covid. our sales results were better than expected requiring us to go out and purchase more product on the spot market, in particular, proteins, as our longhorn and fine dining segments had the largest sales outperformance versus our expectations. the market for proteins this quarter was very strong with spot premiums as high as 30% above our contracted rates. this resulted in higher average cost per pound for our proteins contributing to total commodities' inflation for the quarter of approximately 5.5%.
given the heightened attention on inflation, i want to clarify that we use a conventional approach to calculating the rate of inflation. we're only measuring change in average price holding product mix and usage constant. we follow the same approach for calculating wage inflation rate, in which we keep the hour and job mix constant and only look at change in wage. while we expect higher rates of inflation to persist for the remainder of the year versus what we initially planned, we believe our scale and recent enhancements to our business model enable us to deliver significant margin expansion, while still adhering to our strategy of pricing below inflation.
now looking at the p&l for the first quarter of 2022, we're providing a comparison against pre-covid results in the first quarter of 2020, which we believe is a more comparable to normal business operations and with how we've been talking about our margin expansion. for the first quarter, food and beverage expenses were 150 basis points higher, driven by investments in both food quality and pricing significantly below inflation. restaurant labor was 110 basis points lower, driven primarily by hourly labor improvement, due to efficiencies gained from operational simplifications and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures. restaurant expenses were also 110 basis points lower due to sales leverage. marketing spend was $45 million lower, resulting in 220 basis points of favorability. as a result, restaurant-level ebitda margin for darden was 20.9%, 290 basis points better than pre-covid levels.
g&a expense was 30 basis points higher, driven primarily by approximately $10 million of stock compensation expenses related to the immediate expensing of equity awards for retirement eligible employees. additionally, we had approximately $5 million of expense related to mark-to-market on our deferred compensation. as a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, it's largely offset on the tax line. these impacts were partially offset by savings from corporate restructuring implemented in fiscal 2021
our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.6%, which benefited from the deferred compensation hedge i just mentioned. excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate would have been closer to the top end of our guidance range for the year.
turning to our segment performance. first quarter sales at olive garden were flat to pre-covid, while segment profit margin increased 220 basis points. this was strong performance despite elevated inflation and two-year check growth of only 2.4%. longhorn had the best sales performance across our segments with sales increasing by 26% versus pre-covid, while growing segment profit margin by 250 basis points. sales at our fine dining segment increased 24% versus pre-covid in what's traditionally their slowest quarter from a seasonal perspective. segment profit margin grew by 490 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodity inflation. our other segment grew sales by nearly 5% and segment profit margin by 360 basis points. we continue to be excited about the long-term prospects of this segment, as it's driving the strongest underlying business model improvement of all our segments.
finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. based on our performance this quarter and expected performance for the remainder of the year, we increased our outlook for the full year. we now expect total sales of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, representing growth of 7% to 9% from pre-covid levels; same restaurant sales growth of 27% to 30% and 35 to 40 new restaurants; capital spending of $375 million to $425 million; total inflation of approximately 4% with commodities inflation of 4.5% and total restaurant labor inflation of 5.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation of about 7%; ebitda of $1.54 billion to $1.60 billion; and annual effective tax rate of 13% to 14% and approximately 131 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.25 and $7.60. this outlook implies ebitda margin growth versus pre-covid, in line with our previous outlook as higher sales are helping offset elevated inflation.
before we open it up for questions, i want to remind you about a calendar shift next quarter. thanksgiving falls in our fiscal second quarter this year, whereas it was in the fiscal third quarter pre-covid. this will be a net negative to second quarter from a sales perspective.
now, we'll take your questions.

[operator instructions] thank you. and our first question today comes from john glass of morgan stanley.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. good morning. gene or whoever, could you please, first, just talk about the impact of the reduction of couponing at olive garden? i think that probably has adversely impacted sales. that obviously has a huge positive impact on margin. but can you just sort of quantify what you think the foregone sales were for that, so as we think about that brand versus peers we have the right context?
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. let me take a stab at this a little broader, john in just the coupon. i'm not sure we can get right to the number that you're looking for. i think the coupon number probably was about 1% of sales. and so -- and you're trying to say, ok, what's that driving guest count, i think that's a little bit harder to get at. when i look at that line in the p&l, it's about -- it was about 1%. let me just put olive garden's performance in context for everybody. obviously, i'm thrilled with their performance. we only have 2.5% check in the business over the last two years. that's compared to a little over 5% for the industry. i mean, that's a strategic choice that we continue to make. we think it's the right choice. and if you just assume that the marketing was breakeven and you got to add another 10 points to the sales and so basically, they are flat -- flattish and then, you take out that marketing, that's a big number.
the other thing and then, rick alluded to this in his script, i mean we're still struggling from a staffing standpoint, primarily because of the exclusions. and if you think about that, that's limiting our sales, and just in the way i think about it, it's just another way of capacity limitation. and just if you just think about it on average, i guess we have one or two sections closed in most of our restaurants, most nights. so we are losing 60 tables. so there is, especially in olive garden, that's putting a cap on what we can do for sales. and so, when i think about the overall and i sum up olive garden's performance, i just think that we're doing unbelievable. we've got a 23.2% restaurant-level earnings percentage. our profit grew $25 million over pre-covid. this is just -- this is an impressive business, and we're just -- we're reevaluating over time, how we're going to take this business to market. when we think about couponing, we think about overall promotional activity and full marketing.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you for that. if i could just ask one follow-up, raj, on your commodity comments, it sounds like you would still expect maybe better commodity inflation later in the year. do you have better visibility than you did before? what would prevent you from having to go to the spot market more often if sales continue to go away? how much visibility do you have on that inflation for the full year now versus last quarter?
raj vennam -- senior vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
sure, john. let me start by saying, we have -- you saw us, we increased our forecast for sales. so that gives us a little bit of -- i guess, less need to have to go back into the market than what we're already anticipating. so some of that increased sales impact is baked into our estimate. as we look at q2 and q3, we have more visibility clearly into a lot more into q2 and some decent visibility into q3. q4 is one that's probably, we'll have to figure out where things shake out, but we do -- we did have higher inflation last year in q4, but all in all, the way we're thinking about it is q1, we had about 5.5%. we have about 80% contracted for q2 based on the updated volume and then for q3, i think we have around 60% contracted out. so we feel pretty good about that. could there be some movement? absolutely. but i think that's where we showed you, i think, in the first quarter how we have the ability to manage through that. i mean, i think the fact i mentioned about the business model improvements as well as other levers we have at our disposable are -- at our disposal to help us manage through that fairly well.
operator
and our next question comes from andrew charles of cowen.
andrew charles -- cowen & co. -- analyst
great. rick, i appreciate the commentary on the labor and staffing challenges. what have you seen over the last two weeks since that $300 a week supplemental unemployment insurance expired? has there been as large of a tailwind as you previously anticipated, and perhaps you can speak to what you're seeing in states that curtail benefits earlier this summer as a leading indicator? and then, i have a follow-up. thanks.
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
hey, andrew, thanks for the question. i would say is, we've done a lot of things to help increase staff flow or applicant flow and one of those that i talked about was the new system we put in place. we haven't really seen a dramatic change in staffing flow from when we put that new system in place to when the unemployment benefit started to eliminate. so we think we've been getting staffing flow even before that happened. we have, as we said, staffing challenges, and the challenges are a little bit more in certain parts of the country, but not necessarily driven by unemployment benefits. it's just driven by when they've opened up versus not when they've opened up. we're not so worried about getting great applicants because we are getting them right now.
andrew charles -- cowen & co. -- analyst
yep. and then my follow-up question is that you've called out prior to the pandemic that olive garden could reach 20% of sales off-premise and obviously with the rebound in the dining business, you're seeing that off-premise mix come down a bit, still sticky. you're now accounting for about 27% of the brand sales. do you think this is a fair mix of sales that you can sustainably see going forward or is it likely to further come down as staffing challenges ultimately ease and you can fulfill more on-premise dining?
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
andrew, i still think that the off-premise mix will come down at olive garden and at longhorn as the dining rooms continue to fill and people feel more comfortable going out to eat in a restaurant. we were starting to see that some when covid was winding down before the delta variant spiked. we were starting to see our percent of sales go down. and then, when the delta variant spike came back, we started to see that percent go back up. so we don't believe that 27% is where we will be in the immediate long term after covid is over. we still think somewhere in the 20s, but that all depends. and we've made a lot of great investments in our technology. we've made it easier for our team members to handle all of the orders. we've made it easier for our guests to order, to pay, to do the things that i mentioned in the earnings -- in the call. and so, we do believe that our to-go as a percent of sales is going to be greater than it was than we ever thought it would be before covid. that's because we're getting a lot of people that have come to olive garden and to longhorn that hadn't done that -- hadn't done to-go before. so -- and they're getting great experience.
andrew charles -- cowen & co. -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question today comes from jared garber of goldman sachs.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. obviously, the longhorn trends remain very robust, and i think it was really encouraging to see the fine dining segment turned positive this quarter. can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of pent-up demand and consumer trade-up? it seems like the state category remains really strong maybe even relative to some of the other brands. and i wonder if some of that trade-up is sort of not benefiting olive garden as much despite some of the reduced promo activities in that brand?
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. i think that might be overthinking it just a little bit. i mean, the steakhouse category has been strengthening even the pre-covid, strengthened through covid. i think that longhorn is, as we've discussed, has benefited somewhat from geographical footprint. that has been -- when you think their footprint heavy, heavy georgia, heavy florida, i also think that we've made a lot of investments in longhorn, over the last five or six years. and i think that really they've come through.
i would also say that operating these smaller footprints has been easier through -- a little bit easier to recover. we need a lot less employees to run a longhorn. i think we're fully -- basically fully staffed in that business. and so, i think it's all come together and running really well. as far as fine dining goes, i mean, we're thrilled to see the level -- the sales volumes we did this summer in fine dining. i will tell you that, there is still a heavy drag on fine dining in the major cities. we're still down 40% in our three manhattan locations, a little bit less than that in the other major cities, but we're seeing a big uptick in suburbia in fine dining, which has been fantastic. and so, that business has been robust. i never thought in my wildest dreams, i'd see the kind of absolute numbers that we saw this summer in fine dining, which has been fantastic.
so, i think there is some salvatory [phonetic] out there i think that -- i think people who aren't traveling for business as much as they used to are using fine dining restaurants, maybe a bit more on the weekend, which has been great to see. and i think the only other thing i would say on fine dining is sunday has become a legitimate sales day in fine dining, which was really pre-covid kind of a throw away day unless you're in a convention city and a convention start on sunday. but sundays are real legitimate day now, which is taking operationally and has taken some adjustments for us to get used to.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. i appreciate the color there. and it's fun to follow up on the unit growth commentary that you made earlier, gene. i think it was really encouraging to hear you will likely be ahead of that at the top end or ahead of that 2% to 3% range in '23. can you talk a little bit about the adjustments or the impacts you've seen in the other segment and maybe some of the opportunities coming out of the pandemic in that segment for the restaurants within there?
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. i think the biggest impact has been, we transform those business models. and we've talked about the transformation we've made it at cheddar's. also bahama breeze had a significant transformation there. we're doing some good work in yard house. we're making some more investments in the food. we've got that business model in a good place. so we think there is good outsize -- hopefully, good growth in that business. so we have got a lot more confidence in investing new capital into these segments. i mean, we've also -- seasons is another business that has really made significant improvement, so that we're confident to reinvest in that business.
so as the real estate becomes available, we have more options. we're confident in more options to use that real estate. so if we go into a market where we already have a great olive garden and great longhorn, we have a property or a brand that we can put on top of that great piece of real estate and confident that we're going to get a really good return from that. and so, it's given our real estate development team a little bit more flexibility. now that we have the confidence -- to have this confidence in these businesses that we can grow on.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks so much for the color. appreciate it.

the next question comes from jake bartlett of truist securities.
jake bartlett -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. my question is on the limited menu in olive garden. i'm just wondering whether you have any concern that's impacting the recovery, the pace of the recovery at olive garden, whether that's impacting the sales? it has been great for margins. in the context of that question, and there has been commentary from some of the distributors that independents are reexpanding their menus. is there a concern that as others kind of reexpand the menus that you guys might be missing on sales? and then, i have a follow-up.
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
jake, i think that the limited menu is not impacting olive garden at all. and i'll go back to the context i provided in the beginning. if you just use the breakeven on the advertising, we'd be up double-digits in this business. and we don't do advertising to breakeven. again the recovery in olive garden, i think, has been stronger than most. and i define recovery based on how much profit we make. and i keep looking at that profitability number, and i'm really pleased. so, i don't think the limited menu is having any impact on our ability to drive top line in that business. so, i'd go back to some of the things i outlined in the beginning. as far as independents adding menu items, more power to if they think that's what's going to drive their business, let them make those decisions. we're very comfortable where we are with our menus at this point in time.
jake bartlett -- truist securities -- analyst
great. i appreciate that. and following up on that, your selling expense has been about 1% of sales for the last three quarters now. is that the right level we should think about for the rest of the year? and maybe just share any thoughts you have on longer term, significant change from historical? so where should we be thinking that more than here in the long term in terms of marketing as a percentage of sales?
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, i think, for the short term i think -- i don't think you'll see us change our marketing strategies at all or i guess, our tactics at all at this point in time. i think longer term, i think i'm going to go back to what i talked about last call was, we're still waiting to determine what is the equilibrium of this business, what's going to be on-premise, what's going to be off-premise, what's the competitive set look like. this additional you kind of ramp up in covid i think is, it's stressing out more restaurants. so maybe there could be some more closures, i don't know -- we don't know. and so, we're just searching for equilibrium. and once we get to that equilibrium, we will develop a strategy and implement tactics that we think will best position our brands to be able to grow profitably into the future. but at this point for us to talk about that and kind of say, where we think that's going to end up, that would be -- that's just a huge mistake, because we just don't know what environment we're going to be operating in.
jake bartlett -- truist securities -- analyst

our next question comes from jeffrey bernstein of barclays.
jeff bernstein -- barclays capital -- analyst
great. thank you very much. two questions. one, gene, i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, specific to august, that trend slowed versus june and july, but still up versus pre-covid. i'm just wondering how much of that you maybe attribute to the staffing shortage versus maybe the spike from a delta variant perspective? just trying to gauge the impact from each. and i think you said september was up 7% per operating week versus the first quarter up only 4.8%. so i'm just wondering what your assumption is for the rest of fiscal 2q relative to that september comment? and then, one follow-up.
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
good try, jeff. i'm not going to comment on forward-looking on sales. i'll just say that -- i will say in our commentary about the trends is that, as covid started to pick up, especially in the southeast and florida was hard hit, where we have a huge footprint. you've got -- you had the impact of the delta variant and you also had back-to-school in a lot of these territories at that time. so we're having a hard time teasing out, what was seasonality, what was the impact of the variant? and that's one of the reasons why we gave -- we're not going to get in the habit of given quarter-to-date sales at this call, but we felt that there was enough change in the sales environment that we want to be explicit that our sales have come back a little bit in september after falling a little bit in august. we think some of that has to do with covid. some of that has to do, maybe there is a little bit less seasonality in the business. there is so many different variables impacting us week-to-week, month-to-month right now. it's very difficult to tease out. and so, we're just being as transparent as we possibly can. we know -- you know where we're at quarter-to-date. and i'm not going to comment on what -- we've given you guidance for the rest of the year and that's what we think we're going to be able to do.
jeff bernstein -- barclays capital -- analyst
understood. and then, just the follow-up more broadly on inflation, i'm just wondering how you think about the restaurant industry and maybe even retail more broadly. i mean, it seems like inflation is elevated. all industries seem to be raising prices and not getting much pushback from the consumer. i'm just wondering maybe in your view, how does this end, whether for the industry or just for darden when you think about inflation versus pricing in the context of trying to drive traffic. thank you.
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you. it's a very good question, right. so, i think, first of all, i think we can all agree that lower income consumer is going to be disproportionately impacted by increases in inflation. and that consumer is a big part of our guests make up for our casual brands. so we're incredibly focused on the longer-term pushback, not so much short term. people are saying, well, we're pushing this off and i guess, no one is pushing back. eventually, it's going to be pushed back.
and so, we're making the strategic choice, especially in olive garden, and i'll say for cheddar's, is that we're being very cautious with the pricing. and we want to make sure this big group of consumers that we service feel as though they can still come into our restaurants and getting extremely great value for what they have to pay. and so, i think that those who manage through this prudently, those who -- to really take a longer look, we'll get through this, ok. i think those who pass through a lot of price, they aren't really managing their costs effectively. i think we've got to really think about how we manage our costs going forward, because at some point, your average consumer could get priced out of casual dining if it cost too much. and i'm -- i think myself and my -- and the entire team is really, really concerned about that. and that's why we've made the strategic choice that we've made with pricing. and so, i think -- we're thinking about how do we position ourselves to excel in an inflationary environment.

our next question comes from david tarantino of baird.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
hi, good morning. gene, a question on olive garden and the performance there, and i appreciate all the factors that you mentioned on that may have weighed on the sales to that brand. but i was just curious to get your thoughts on whether you think that was particularly acute in the quarter you just reported, and some of those factors could ease as the year goes on or how are you thinking about that? are you assuming those factors continue for the rest of the year or not?
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. i think the one piece -- one thing i would add that i did not mention in the comparables for this first quarter was two years ago, we were going in buy one take one, which is a significant traffic driving promotion. and we believe it does have some profitability tied to it. so that was weighing on the comparable performance in q1. david, i really don't know. i mean, i think that we're looking at olive garden more on a bottom line perspective and just the top line at this point in time. it makes no sense at all, any business today.
to be advertised and driving sales in the restaurants that are -- you aren't assured that you do a 100% fully staffing and can provide a great dining experience. until we get to that and we feel certain that we have that every single day without having to deal with exclusions, we're not going to get out there and try to push people into these restaurants. it just makes no sense to me. and so, when i look at what we're doing in olive garden, i continue to just be thrilled and they continue exceeding my expectations. and it seems as though we continue to disappoint the sell-side expectations on this. but this is a very, very difficult operating environment. and i think that some of those things if covid -- if you can tell me what's going to happen with covid moving forward, then well, i can tell you that some of the stuff will ease. but when covid store prevalent in our communities, we're going to -- we're not going to know what the full potential or what i referred to as equilibrium is for a while.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
understood. and on the staffing level, i just wanted to clarify, i think you might have said that you're running at about 90% of pre-covid levels, if i heard that right. what is the targeted level? how does that compare to what you would ideally like to be? because i think you had some efficiency gains that might lead to, i guess, lower levels when you had pre-covid optimally, but i guess where are you relative to optimal levels?
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
yeah. david, this is rick. yeah, i did say 90% of pre-covid staffing levels. assuming the volume that we have today, right. so volume will drive how much staffing you need, so think about that. we probably need somewhere in the single-digit number of team members in our restaurants. we have some restaurants that need a little bit more because of the location they're in. but as i said, most of our restaurants are fairly well staffed. and so, as the volumes start to increase, we continue to hire. and so, it really depends on where the volumes end up. but we don't believe that we would need the same number of people that we did before covid at the same volume levels with these new venues.
yeah. and the other thing that's happening now is we've got team members that are coming into the industry that may not be able to work the same number of hours. so it really all depends on the hours that people can work and the days they can work. so staffing levels in number of people versus where we were pre-covid probably isn't the best indicator, but it's a pretty good one. and again, as i said, we've been very -- we've increased our productivity. so all equal, same number of hours for a person, same number of guest count for someone, we would need fewer people.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

our next question today comes from brett levy of mkm partners.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. i guess, if we could just go both big picture and then more specific to you guys, if you could just parse out a little bit more on the competitive landscape, maybe a little bit more on the regionality and what you're seeing out there as well as if you're willing to share the market share data of how much share you gained in the quarter? and then, also specifically for you, you had great successes on the margins both through your planning, but just also through your execution, where do you see margins really hitting a ceiling? and i guess, we can either do that for darden consolidated or at longhorn and olive garden, specifically. thanks guys.
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
good morning, brett. i think, let me just comment on, so maybe some regionality more so, then get into the competitive situation. i think that we've been very pleased with how california has come back. i spent some time in california this quarter. it was a lot different than what i thought it was going to be. so, i think that our sales have come back there since the middle of july, very strong. so, we're very pleased what's happening out there. we have felt some pressure in georgia and florida over the last six to eight weeks with the delta variant. texas didn't have much impact and texas seems to have a mind of its own. the northeast has never really come back from where it was. it's still performing, ok, but hasn't really rebounded.
and then, we've got pockets today where you just -- you can just look at the heat map for covid, you know that you're going to have some sales statistics [phonetic] problems. you got some tennessee, kentucky, west virginia issues today. but overall, i mean, i would say, there is not a tremendous amount of difference in regionality.
as far as margins go, the way i would think about that is, we will eventually get back to our framework, where we think we can get the 10% to 30%, once we figure out where equilibrium is. and i'm not -- i don't think any of us should sit here today and say, what's the ceiling or where these businesses run long term. we do think that we've made some really great strategic choices over the last couple of years. we've transformed our business models. we've learned a lot -- we've learned a real lot through this on how to be more efficient. and i don't think you will see us give that up. and as long as we can continue to drive the top line, there is no reason why we can't hang on to these margins.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst

our next question comes from eric gonzalez of keybanc capital markets.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks for the question. i just want to go back to the comments about the quarter-to-date trends. and i don't want to beat a dead horse here, but i'm just wondering if you can maybe talk about the different -- performance of the different brands. did you see acceleration across -- broadly across all your major brands, or was it just maybe specific to one or two of them?
and then, my real question here is on the off-premise business, recognizing that you don't want to overwhelm the staff by drawing in traffic with advertising. i was wondering maybe there is an opportunity to push harder on that off-premise strategy with marketing and promotions, given that channel likely requires less labor? thanks.
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. no comments on quarter-to-date. we gave you a number, which i don't like to do, and then that's i'm not going to talk about it anymore. as far as off-prem goes and trying to drive that, it's very, very difficult to drive that business, specifically without discounting. and we don't want to discount. and this -- part of the labor problems and dealing with the exceptions and impacts off-premise, it takes less labor. but you still need to be cautious, you still need all these people to produce the food. and so, we're trying to -- when we think about this, we're trying to create great guest experiences, whether it's on-prem or off-prem.
and as rick outlined in his prepared remarks, dealing with these exclusions, i mean, it's not like we get a lot of notice, that we got seven people that are excluded from the restaurant. and all of sudden your seven people short for the night. you got to adapt and try to overcome those challenges. and so, i think, that we're -- where we're at right now, we are doing some things off-premise without discounting. and on the weekends, we have to throttle the off-premise business. in other words, we can't -- we've got to control how many orders we do every 15 minutes. each brand has a different way of throttling. each restaurant can throttle differently. but on average, i'll give you an idea is that we only take forward is to go every 15 minutes. and there are a lot more orders than that. and so -- and i think that's something that we know we have excess demand, but we've got to be able to service the dining room and service the off-prem.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
from a margin perspective, the exclusion payer [phonetic], are you able to maybe talk about what that might be just from a -- from expense perspective, recognizing that the sales have an impact? but maybe there is an expense there from paying labor that's not present.
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
it's not big enough. it's not meaningful impact on the p&l.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst

our next question comes from brian bittner of oppenheimer & co.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys. just going back to the staffing issues, you talked about it, olive garden that clearly are restricting the sales capacity. when you look at longhorn, are they dealing with the same or similar issues from a staffing perspective? obviously, it doesn't look like it when you look through the lens of just looking at numbers. so if they are dealing with those staffing issues, can you just talk about why and the primary difference going on there between the two brands?
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
hey, brian, it's rick. a couple of things about longhorn. one is they have a smaller total team than olive garden does, right. so -- and they actually were in parts of the country early in the pandemic that opened up a lot faster. so, their staffing challenges aren't nearly where olive garden would be. and actually, right now, they have more team members than they did pre-covid, but they're doing a lot more volume. so their staffing challenges are really the same thing on exclusions.
and if you think about the exclusions, a lot of it impacts the kitchen. and so, as long as they've got enough people working in the kitchen that they have an exclusion, they can continue to drive sales through that, it's not as big an issue for them. so, you think about longhorn, probably 60% of the total team members of the restaurant than an olive garden does. and so, when you have exclusions, it's not that -- it's not as big of an impact for longhorn.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
okay. great. thanks, rick. and just with olive garden, aside from the staffing issues, how do you want to thinking about your ability to proactively drive the business in the future with more marketing and more promos? meaning, are you just so pleased with this new profitability profile of olive garden that you really want this to kind of be the new base case strategy moving forward and how the brand operates, or do you want us, analysts, thinking that you have this unused weapons that you could potentially deploy if you want?
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
i think, this is -- brian, this is the way to think about. this is the base business. and what we're going to try to do is, once we figure out where equilibrium is, we will develop a strategy and implement tactics to be able to drive the business profitably. what we want to do is put back in another $100 million of marketing, you only get $400 million in sales. and you go back to some of the comments i made earlier is that, we want to make sure that we're focused on value.
we think that, with this inflation going through, there is going to be -- longer term, there is going to be -- the winners are going to be the ones you provide exceptional value to the consumer. and we're trying to position olive garden to be that brand. it's historically done well in downturns. and if we have a downturn, we want to position it just to do really well. i think we will promote again. don't get me wrong, we will promote again. we just think we will do it differently. and we are thinking -- we think a lot more about the opportunity cost around the value of that table when we're extremely busy and how not to have, just sitting at that table, paying less than full price. even though it's a value proposition, we don't -- if we want to revalue and focus on value, we don't want to be discounting off of value platform. and i think that's really important. and so, we got to figure that out once we get there. we've got contingency plans right now. we think we know we want to do, but we need to see what the competitive environment is, and we need to see what the economic backdrop is.

our next question comes from lauren silberman of credit suisse.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you. just looking at trends across the brands on a two-year basis, comps accelerated from the fourth quarter in may, all the segments except for olive garden. and i appreciate all the commentary on the differences on an absolute basis, but from a sequential perspective, is the dynamics the same? i'm just trying to understand why there is no change there.
raj vennam -- senior vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
hi, lauren. let's make sure we understand the question. can you repeat the question?
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
sure. so, just looking at a two-year basis, comps for the quarter accelerated from the fourth quarter for longhorn, fine dining and the other business, reasonably flat for olive garden. so, i understand all the commentary on an absolute basis on two-year comps across the brands. just to understand from a sequential perspective from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, if there is anything to call out regarding, sort of, the factors on the acceleration versus for the other brands versus reasonably flat for olive garden?
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah, i'll just make a couple of quick things. i mean, when you think about like the other business, we got all of -- mostly yard house back in the quarter. and fine dining, we got a lot more full capacity back in the second quarter. longhorn has just the -- steakhouse segment has just done extremely well. so i think that's really the big change.
raj vennam -- senior vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
yes. and i think the other thing is really the starting point is not apples-to-apples. that's what we keep trying to come back to is olive garden had a lot of -- we talked about the promotion in q1. we had a lot of market -- the best -- one of their best promotions and we had a lot of marketing dollars in there. so when you're trying to compare it to the two years ago number, your starting point is off. that's where we would argue, that's 10 points lower or more. so if you start with that, olive garden accelerated. and that's where there's some volatility when you look at that by brand because of the promotional differences.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. very helpful. and then just on loyalty. you previously tested a loyalty program across select restaurants. i think we've seen a lot of brands implementing them or looking to in the full service space. do you have any updated thoughts on the potential for a loyalty program across the system or what you saw in tests as you think about it?
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
lauren, it's rick. yes, we eliminated -- well, we stopped the test of loyalty right when covid started. we didn't believe it was the right thing to do during the time that we were making sure that we can get our restaurants open and up and running. we are working right now on everyday value. as we've talked about for olive garden, we want to make sure that our value perception continues to improve. it's already great in all of our brands. and so right now, we haven't decided to even test again. that may come down to -- may happen someday. but what we don't want to do is provide a loyalty program that provides a discount to the highest used consumer. so if we have a loyalty program, we'll work on something that's different.
now i will say, we were seeing positive trends in our loyalty program before. but that was a point-based discounted program that in the long run, we don't think is the right way to do loyalty in the restaurant business.
operator
and we can move on to dennis geiger of ubs.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you. first, raj, just wanted to see if you could quantify the impact of the thanksgiving shift on the quarter by chance?
raj vennam -- senior vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
yes. i would say at a high level, it's probably, think of it as about a 1% impact on a two-year -- because we're comparing to pre-covid, as you look at it, yes, think of it as about a point impact. on a normalized level [phonetic].
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
[speech overlap] thank you very much. great. and then just wanted to come back on the technology front, some impressive digital results as it relates to the digital mix of off-premise. so just wanted to get a sense for any additional opportunities that you can share that can support either that off-premise business or even the dine-in business as it relates to the top line or even some additional margin efficiency opportunities. i think geofencing is kind of an interesting one that you've highlighted. so curious if there's anything to share there and how close that might be or any other opportunities on the tech side? thank you.
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
dennis, this is rick. just a broad message on technology first is our goal is to implement technology really that reduces friction across every part of the value chain and while we respond to growing desire for choice and personalization from our guests. they want choice, they want to be personal -- they want personal experiences. and so one of -- a few of the things that we did in the first quarter, just to give you an idea, we added apple pay and google pay to olivegarden.com. we were already able to use paypal to pay for your to go order. and now over 25% of our mobile app transactions are paid via paypal and these other wallets, where it's much more convenient to our guests to pay. we've updated the curbside i'm here experience for our guests when they have to go. still not including geofencing, but it's coming as well. and we've just started a/b testing for olive garden on online recommendations for items.
i'm not going to talk about what we're doing in future quarters, but we have more improvements. we continue to invest in this digital platform. our goal for guest facing is to lead our segment when it comes to relevance and convenience for our guests. and we will continue to do that. will we lead the restaurant industry? no, the quick service players are going to probably spend more and do more things in technology, but we're going to learn what they're doing and see what we can bring to our space. but we are going to lead the full-service restaurant space in technology for guest facing.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
that's great. thank you.

we can go to nicole miller of piper sandler.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good morning. two quick ones on off-premise. can you talk about catering as an underlying trend in what you're seeing in catering?
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
yes, nicole. we haven't seen a whole lot of pickup back in catering yet. we did see during covid more catering to homes than to businesses. but since business spending and people still haven't gone back to offices, we haven't seen a huge pickup, but we are seeing some. we are seeing some growth in catering, but it hasn't been dramatic. we'll see what happens during the holiday season this year. but right now, not a huge, huge jump in catering from what happened while covid was going on.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
and then just a really high-level question around fine dining. your numbers are up like the industry peers, if not better. what is a fair assessment of some of the pluses and minuses of what we might think about for social or corporate gatherings coming up for the holiday season?
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. i think it's all going to depend on where we are with this variant and what the levels are, especially in some of the bigger markets. i would sit here today and say i think it's going to be a robust holiday season. i think we have a robust holiday season for all our restaurants and all of retail. i think that the consumer is still fairly healthy from a financial standpoint. and we'll know more in the next six to eight weeks as we start thinking about we start seeing the bookings.
one trend that we have seen over the last six to eight weeks is we've seen a lot of cancellations of larger parties or gatherings inside the fine dining restaurants as people aren't as comfortable gathering in big groups as they may have been in the mid-summer. but i would expect this to be a robust holiday season if the variant is under control.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you.
operator
we can now move on to jeff farmer of gordon haskett.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
good morning. thanks, guys. just quickly wanted to follow-up on some of the menu pricing and value questions that you guys received. i think you pointed to holding menu pricing obviously well below inflation levels, but that has moved higher for you. so i think menu pricing sit at roughly 1.5% in the last quarter. where do you think menu pricing could go this quarter and over the balance of the year considering that, that inflation -- total inflation number has ticked up for you?
raj vennam -- senior vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
yes. hi, jeff. i'll speak to the year. what's contemplated in our guidance is pricing just under 2%. so if you think about our total inflation being 4% in this -- in the forecast we provided or outlook we provided, we're assuming pricing just under 2% for the year.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. and then -- that's helpful. and then different topic. a lot of your peers, casual dining peers have been pretty aggressive in taking these delivery menu pricing premiums, which have improved the margin structure profile for that delivery offering. i'm just curious, has that changed your opinion about potentially pursuing delivery, considering that there's a little bit better margin profile out there for that sales channel?
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
no.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
all right. easy enough. all right. thank you, guys.
operator
our next question comes from brian mullan of deutsche bank.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, thank you. just a question on the long-term development opportunity for olive garden. you made commentary in recent quarters, a bit less worried about cannibalization you might have been in the past, more optimistic on the number of units. so this question is, what's your current thinking on the long-term potential here? is there an actual number you have in mind? could there be 1,000 restaurants? could there be more? just any color on your updated thinking.
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. i don't think we want to put a number. i will say more, more than 1,000. and we think that there's a pathway to get there. i think it's dangerous to say -- i've been in this business -- i've been doing this for a long time, and every time we run a brand, we put out numbers that we think are potential. the brand is really strong. we kind of get through those numbers pretty easily.
so let's just say we -- one of our underlying beliefs is that convenience is going to continue to matter. we're going to need to build restaurants closer to where people live. and we also believe in -- especially in olive garden that we can build in more remote areas that have these large, what i would call these like 60-mile trade areas where people travel in and out to get things and dine. and so we're pretty excited about where we can take olive garden. especially if we can maintain over 20% off-premise, that opens up some more trade areas.
we just continue to open olive gardens and amazed. and we continue to be amazed at the volumes we do and then the returns that we're getting. so we definitely think we can get over 1,000 fairly easily.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
that's it from me. thanks for that.
operator
our next question comes from chris o'cull of stifel.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys. gene, i wanted to get your perspective on what you think is driving the industry labor shortage and how the industry can create maybe a stronger employee proposition to attract talent?
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. first of all, i don't think the labor shortage is just the restaurant industry, i think it's a national problem. i think that we see it with our vendors. we see it in other places. we all have associated maybe with some other companies that we see this challenge every single day. so i do think that as we think about the restaurant proposition, i think we have to all understand what do restaurant team members want? i mean they want an opportunity to be able to work in an environment that is well run. they want flexibility. they want growth, depending on what they're using the job for. and a lot of restaurant jobs are pass-through. they're kind of, let's get from point a to point b. and i think as we have to continue to find ways to improve that proposition, i think that one of the things that i'm really most proud of is how many people that come into us as an hourly employee and that were able to get into management. we got -- in the last three or four months, we've got almost 500 team members we've taken from our hourly ranks and moved them into management ranks. and i love that growth. i love that opportunity. when i'm in the field, i love to meet these people and they're just -- they're so excited about their future and their potential.
so i think it's -- i think those who have resources -- and i think this is where scale is going to matter too. those who have resources that can create employment proposition that's stronger than others will attract people. there's no doubt that i think that we're in a lot better shape than others in this -- with labor at this point in time. i don't think it's something -- i think it's going to come down to be an individual situation, which company and, more importantly, it gets down to the restaurant manager, the gm and inside each of that box, can they create an environment where people want to work? and that's how we'll attract people. where we have our best leadership, we do not have people problems.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
one thing you didn't mention was pay. and i'm just curious if you think continuing increasing pay at kind of healthier rates or the rates that we've seen recently, if you think that will address the employment issue at all.
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
no, i think you got to have competitive pay. and i think that's only one aspect of the employment proposition. there's been pressure on wage now for a few years, even before covid. i think there'll be pressure on wage as we move forward. but i don't think it all comes down to just pay. i mean, i think if you -- i don't think the problems for the industry go away just because we're going to -- if we pay more.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from david palmer of evercore isi.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i think the restaurant expense line was down 110 basis points on a two-year basis in the quarter with comps up 5% over that time. could you talk about how the company is doing this? and how much of that do you think is sustainable productivity longer term in your view? and i have a follow-up.
raj vennam -- senior vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
hi, david, this is raj. hi, david. yes, so restaurant expenses per operating week on an absolute basis were slightly below. i think we're at about 1 point below where we were pre-covid. we have found some efficiencies through the pandemic on some contract services and some r&m. i do think some of the costs will come back in a little bit, but it's still going to be a point of leverage. i mean, a line that we're going to continue to see some improvement versus pre-covid.
is it going to stay at the 110, 120 range? probably not. it all -- again, also it depends on where the sales are. but we are managing -- that's one line where we've been able to manage well and keep it fairly flat or actually slightly below where we were pre-covid.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
just a quick follow-up on that part is what are some specific things that are going on there? and then i just -- separate question on the marketing and promotion side. i'm wondering how you're thinking about marketing and promotion spending as you see some of these covid era forces easing, a variety of them. so more specifically, do you anticipate marketing and promotion spending returning to fiscal '19 levels in fiscal '23? thanks.
raj vennam -- senior vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
so let me answer the last question first. no, we don't expect it to get back to that at this point. but then on the restaurant expense line, like i said, it's really contract services. we continue to look at our vendors and continue to work with them on how to kind of optimize, streamline some of this, and that's part of that. there was a little bit less r&m that has been catching up. and i think by q1, we're more closer to pre-covid levels on that line. but there's a little bit more on that line that i think will come back. but beyond that, there's really no specific one item here or there. i mean there's music, there's other stuff that we talk about, but these are -- it's in multiple places.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from andy barish of jefferies.
andy barish -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. just a couple of kind of short-term questions, which i'm sure you love. on the september numbers that you talked about, can you just give us a sense of the noise in the quarter so far? i know there was a labor day shift, i think, with two years ago, obviously, weather. just trying to get a sense of what you can tease out given all the other variables.
raj vennam -- senior vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
yes. hi, andy. so we actually don't have a labor day shift because our fiscal years -- we're giving you comps and our labor -- because of the 53 weeks that we had in fiscal '19, we actually have apples-to-apples for labor day. there was clearly some impact from hurricane dorian that about two years ago that we had talked about that impacted the first few weeks a little bit. high level, maybe 1 point or so at the time, i can't recall exactly, but that's what i'd say.
andy barish -- jefferies -- analyst
and then just finally on the margins sequentially. this is usually a quarter where you see a couple of hundred basis points of sequential decline in margins given the volumes are usually the lowest. is that somewhat predictable this year? or just too tough to tell given everything going on out there?
raj vennam -- senior vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
so let me answer it without getting to the specifics on that. q2 is one where we do think because of the low volumes and low margins to begin with, you're probably going to have a little bit more improvement than a typical quarter, but i would say that q2 is also one quarter where we're probably going to have the highest inflation as we look at where we are sitting, right? so it's going to be higher than q1 in terms of inflation.
andy barish -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. helpful. thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from john ivankoe of jpmorgan.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. thank you. i wanted to get back to labor and staffing in particular. i heard you were adding 1,000 net new employees per week, i think you said, which obviously is a great achievement. can you talk about the quits rate at darden just overall turnover. and just as you are kind of hiring 1,000 people net, which obviously is much more than that gross, how you're feeling about some of the real-time operating metrics that you look at in terms of where those are versus standard? and assuming there might be a tick below, how quickly you think you can ramp back up to where you'd like to be?
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
yes, john, this is rick. on the turnover front, we are actually starting to see our turnover get improved dramatically from where it was kind of during covid and even coming right out of covid. we're still well better than the casual dining industry in turnover and especially in the first 90-day turnover, right? and that really is a testament to the training that we're doing to these new team members when they're coming in. now turnover is still higher than it was pre-covid, but it's getting much better, and it's still much better than the industry.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and on the operating side?
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
say it again?
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
sorry. and on the operating side, i mean, considering you are hiring so many new employees, i mean, 1,000 net is obviously much more than that gross. i mean if that -- what that's translating in terms of some of your real-time operating metrics relative to the past? and if there's an opportunity to maybe improve on the margin given how new your overall staff is?
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
yes. i would say if you think about the percent of our team members that are in the first 90 days, they're not as productive as team members that are -- have been with us for a year. and we do have a higher percentage of team members that are with us for the first 90 days than we were two years ago. so there are some productivity improvements that we can do for those new team members. and we are spending a little bit more in training than we did two years ago because of that. and so there might be some chance to offset some of those things. but that will just come from inflation down the road. but yes, operating, we're operating well all of our operating metrics. if you think about our guest satisfaction metrics, they're still at the same level as they were over the last three or four months, even with these new team members.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from jon tower of wells fargo.
jon tower -- wells fargo -- analyst
awesome. thanks for taking the questions. first -- and i apologize if i missed this one. but raj, did you quantify the headwind that the exclusions had on og sales during the quarter? and then second, rick and gene, throughout this call, you hit on the benefits of scale and how important that is to your overall business and frankly, how well your business has been doing despite the challenges that the industry has been facing. i would assume that many of your smaller competitors in the category are feeling the pain more acutely than you are. so i'm curious, given the benefits of scale your company could bring to the table, has your appetite for adding brands to the portfolio grown at all over the past six months or so?
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
we did not quantify the -- any impact on sales from the exclusions. that's something that -- we're not -- we can't do that. we have no methodology to do that. as far as m&a goes, i mean, we're at the same place. we're a platform company. management and the board continue to evaluate options. and when we find an option that we think that makes sense, maybe we'll do some. right now, i would just pivot to say that we're extreme -- as i talked about in my prepared remarks, we're really focused on growing our existing brands. we love how healthy our brands are, vibrant and how good, strong the business models are. we think opening our own restaurants right now is the best way to create value for our shareholders.
jon tower -- wells fargo -- analyst

our next question comes from brian vaccaro of raymond james.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. just two quick ones for me. on the quarter-to-date, can you confirm that average weekly sales volumes also improved sequentially? or was the percent increase kind of more driven by lapping easier seasonal comparisons? september is usually lower back-to-school. and then raj, what level of g&a is embedded in your fiscal '22 guidance? thank you.
raj vennam -- senior vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
okay. hi, brian. for september quarter-to-date, the numbers we're referencing are versus pre-covid. so as you rightly pointed out, there is a seasonality as you come into september. september is, i think, generally the lowest seasonal month for us and the industry in casual space. but with that said, on the g&a front, like i said, if you take out the $15 million of the unique items that we had this quarter, that would be a good run rate to use as you look forward.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from andrew strelzik of bmo.
andrew strelzik -- bmo -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. i just had two quick ones on unit growth and real estate. it feels like similar to yourselves, there's a number of brands that are talking about accelerating unit growth kind of coming out of the pandemic. so i'm just curious for your perspective on the real estate environment in terms of availability, price. are you seeing that kind of competition play out?
and then secondarily, you've given several eloquent answers about why it makes so much sense to put up your own new units. i'm just curious why you think 3-ish percent is kind of the right level at this point. thanks.
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. unit growth, it's -- acquiring sites is just as hard as it was, pre-covid. i mean it's -- people are out there competing not just -- restaurants are not just -- it's just not restaurants competing for space. i mean, retailers use the spaces that we use. banks use the spaces that we use. there are a lot -- there's a lot of competition out there. it's definitely getting more expensive. we are seeing construction costs start to moderate. i will tell you that having been an investment-grade credit does help with landlords. and how we behaved through the crisis and how we paid our rent is not forgotten with these landlords. so i think that we have a very exciting group of brands to put on pieces of property and people are excited as darden as the tenant.
as far as why is 3% where we believe the right number to be, it comes down to people. i think that the most important decision we make on running this kind of business is who's going to be the management team in that restaurant. and we need to make sure we have people that can handle that responsibility. especially in our smaller brands, it's really tough to really ramp up that growth because you rip through your human resources quickly.
every time you open a restaurant, you really have two new general managers. you're taking an existing general manager and managing partner from an existing business, putting them in a new business and then you got somebody new in the existing business. so you have two businesses at risk. and through doing this for the amount of years that i've done it, i think that for darden, 3% growth rate is really maxing out our human resources and our ability to do this correctly.
and it takes a lot to open a restaurant. it takes a real lot to open a restaurant. and we need to do it right. and if you don't open a restaurant right and get it right in that first six months, they tend to be a problem for up to three years. and that's why we're pretty conservative on how we think about this.
andrew strelzik -- bmo -- analyst
great. very helpful. thank you very much.

we can go to chris carril of rbc capital markets.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for the question. so you offered some commentary around guest-facing technology, but curious to hear your thoughts on investing in technology that helps on the labor side. i believe you mentioned tech related to aiding in-restaurant operations, but maybe anything else that's related to hiring or related to scheduling? any additional detail on tech focused on labor and staffing would be helpful. thanks.
rick cardenas -- president & chief operating officer
yes, chris, this is rick. we do -- in the restaurant-facing things that aren't guest-facing, our primary goal is to improve productivity and simplify processes. we believe we have a world-class scheduling system, and that does a great job taking the general manager's forecast and scheduling a great schedule.
what isn't world-class, and it is the user interface for the manager to make it easier for them. so we continue to do things to make it easier for managers to do things faster so they can get with guests and they can train their team members and be with guests more.
we have some things for our team members and what we've done with to go in the kitchen. and we are looking at machine learning and ai to do better forecasting. so there's a lot of things that we're working on, especially in the kitchen, making it easier to order and receive product, do inventory and those kind of things.
on the service side, we are testing a few things that may make it easier for them. but what we don't want to do is have technology override the experience for the guests. so we'll continue to make these investments in our technology, in our kitchen technology, in our to go technology to help improve productivity.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. that's helpful. thank you. and then just quickly, just following back up on the topic of reduced industry supply from competitor closures. just curious if you have any observations you can share from markets where perhaps you saw more competitor closures versus markets where there were less closures, right? just really just trying to get a sense of to what extent there's been any -- or to what extent there has been a benefit from industry closures. thanks.
gene lee -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes, i would say there's two ways to think about it. number one, in your tier 1 trade areas, you're not going to see a lot of closures, right? so even a below average restaurant can make it in a tier 1 environment, unless the rent is too onerous. so you're seeing more of the closures in your secondary and tertiary sites, especially from independents in the casual space and some chain restaurants.
now in some of the tier 1 sites, you are seeing some independent closure on fine dining. i believe that those will be the first to come back. those are built out as restaurants. they'll get recapitalized very quickly when there's a chef and then other owners. so i do think those will come back. but i would summarize this by saying you're not seeing it in your tier 1. you're seeing it more in your tertiary areas where you've seen a lot of closures.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. okay. thanks for the all the detail today.
