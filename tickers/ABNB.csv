[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of mark mahaney with evercore isi.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok, thanks. you just talked about having this record day. i think you said last saturday and i think you're also maybe appropriately cautioning about third-quarter trends and variance and delta. so just kind of put those things together.
record day still sounds like things are good, but i'm sure there are some warnings out there. can you be more specific about you're seeing that's causing you to be just a little more cautious about q3 and the back half of the year?
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
yes, mark, thank you for the question. before i hand it over to dave, let me just say that, yes, we had a record night. there was more than 4 million guests staying with hosts all over the world. and we're really encouraged that this is the biggest night we've had since the pandemic began.
and the one other thing i'll just say is that we have an incredibly adaptable model. so however, travel changes, we'll be able to meet that demand. but dave, why don't we talk about what we're seeing right now?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
a lot of the trends we're seeing in q2 are consistent with some of the trends we saw in q1 and q4. people continue to be flexible. that's why we built all these flexible tools where because 40% of searchers are showing flexibility in either the data location and people are traveling to more destinations and people are staying longer. and one of the elements is that we're seeing the trends of long-term stays, which we highlighted as a key strength in q1, stays at 28 days or longer, remain being one of the largest and strongest growing parts of our business.
so that was 19% of our nights booked in q2, following being 24% in q1, just as the mix of short-term stays kind of rebounded strongly in q2. we've seen a strong increase in month-over-month performance across q2. so april to may to june nights booked, all were strong leading in anticipation of the summer peak travel. now in july, we've seen some of the pullback in demand, but it's likely due to summer peak and possibly partial to the delta variant.
but all of those lead to still being the q3 revenue, the nights that people stay and the revenue that we recognize will be the strongest ever. and concurrently, our profit in q3 will be the strongest ever.
ok. thanks, brian. thanks, dave.

your next question comes from the line of stephen ju with credit suisse.
stephen ju -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you, much. so brian, as a follow-up to the product announcement that you had, i think this was late may when you hosted that session and it seems like to me you're giving consumers broader recommendations. and if this is really successful, hopefully, it's something that they really didn't know that they even really wanted.
so i know it's probably really early, but anything you can share in terms of what their response has been? are they delighted with what you're showing them or do you still think you have some tinkering that you need to do? thanks.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
yes, stephen -- yes, stephen, thanks. it's a great question. let me like preface this by saying the following. there's been a major paradigm shift in how people search for travel on the internet.
before the pandemic, the way search was on the internet for travel was the vast, vast majority of people came to a website, a travel website, typically an ota and they would type in a location. they have a location in mind and they go to date and they check -- type a date to check-in and a date to check-out. so this is really fixed search. people know where they're going to go.
with the pandemic, i think it's safe to say the world is never going back to the way it was and that means travel isn't going back to the way it was. and the way travel is evolving is that people because they're able to work more remotely, they're more flexible. and what we are seeing, stephen, is that 40% of our guests have flexibility about where or when they travel. and to give you one example of one of the things we've done, flexible dates.
we have a couple of flexible date features. we have a feature that you can tap, i'm flexible and you can say i'm looking for a place for a weekend, a week or a month, sometime in the next few months. and what we have seen is with our flexible date feature, it's being used more than 500 million times. this is a feature that's been used 0.5 billion times since we launched this feature in the beginning of the year.
we've also seen a very big uptick in the use of flexible destinations as well, where people -- if they're flexible about where they travel, we can recommend them to where to go. now these features are really important. the reason they're really important isn't just because this is the paradigm shift and how people are searching for travel, but it's also important because this means that we can point demand to where we have supply. and this is a major, major shift for our business.
and so we are going to continue to tweak the products. when you have hundreds of millions of data points on a feature, you learn and we're continually innovating. but i will also just say that this is just the very beginning because our team is not going to rest on their laurels. we are working really, really hard to continue to offer more flexibility to guests and continue to be able to inspire them and point them to where we have available supply.
stephen ju -- credit suisse -- analyst

next question from the line of jed kelly with oppenheimer.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
hey. great. thanks for taking my question. just on the work-from-anywhere trends you were just mentioning, brian, can you survive anything you're seeing in sort of the shoulder season that kind of gives you confidence? are you seeing any improvement there? and then on the yield management capabilities, you're providing the host of the new tools, any of that providing the adr uplift?
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
yeah, dave, actually, you want to take these questions?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. maybe i'll start with the yield management. the majority of the adr uplift that we're seeing is being driven by mix. it continues to be mix.
the strength of our rebound has been in north america and europe. those have higher adrs. it's been in nonurban, which is higher adr than urban and in larger kind of whole home, larger homes. so the majority of the adr has been driven by that.
to a lesser extent, a newer trend that we saw in q2 was the impact of some pricing pressure in peak markets that are highly constrained for the summer, but that was still assuming the minority relative to the overall mix. so adr is not really being driven by features. over time, our adr on a revenue to gross booking value adjusted basis where you line them up at the same time of booking has been very consistent. over time, i think there are opportunities for us to increase our monetization through new opportunities, whether that be test travel insurance, maybe promoted listings or other things that we could do, but we don't see those as perishable opportunities as your kind of evergreen opportunities.
and instead, what we're focusing on right now, as brian has talked about, is the travel rebound and making sure that we are addressing the needs of travelers today. and their needs today are the additional flexibility that they have in where and when they travel. so 40% of our searches in q2 actually had flexible dates or flexible destinations, which is why we built those tools and capabilities and seeing that strength. and so in terms of the work-from-anywhere trends, i think that we're seeing people are continuing to find airbnb is the best place for them to be able to both live and work.
and one of the things that we launched in q2 is directly in response to people's demand there. it sounds small, but i think it's a really unique item, which is it allows hosts to measure the speed of their wifi and then actually post it on their listing. and that's because guests were wanting to know how easy will it be for me to -- how good is the wifi here? can i work from this location? so i think that's kind of a unique small element that can just show us how we're innovating in order to kind of support these broader travel trends. so what we do know is just that people are incrementally more flexible.
if we can a take one hour zoom call on a thursday, you're likely to be able to do a longer weekend with the family than maybe historically you've been kind of struck in the office to kind of go do. and so we believe that all of these kind of trends will just continue to accrete to airbnb and be tailwinds to our business going forward.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
and i'll just add one more really interesting fact. not long ago, we did a contest online, on social, a contest that allowed people to apply to be able to live on airbnb. and to be able to be part of this contest, you have to fill out an application and it takes a while to fill out. we got 315,000 applications for people wanting to live on airbnb, 315,000.
and i think what this says is that travel is never going to be the same again because it's completely opened up now. when we started airbnb, like stays of longer than a month really wasn't a major part of our business. it really wasn't a major use case for us to be able to serve. but flexibility is now a permanent part of travel.
it's just a permanent part now because it's all we have to believe is that zoom is here to stay. and if we believe that zoom is here to stay, we believe that flexibility in remote living is here to stay. and therefore, it's pretty obvious that what would happen is that we are going to continue to see more and more longer-term stays. and i think this is going to help us smooth out our seasonality over the coming years to come.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst

next question comes from the line of naved khan with truist securities.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks a lot. so you guys mentioned some slowdown in the nights booked in the third quarter. just wanted to get some color on how that looks like.
maybe can you talk about july and how it compared to the second quarter? and how does this look across different regions? is it more pronounced in the u.s. versus europe or are they about the same?
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
dave, do you want to take this one?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. i mean, again, what we saw in q2 is very strong bookings growth in advance of the third quarter kind of pre-travel season. we saw this kind of in the depths of covid in 2020 as well. people are wanting to travel.
they want to get out of their homes and they especially want to do that in the summer. and so we saw a lot of peak travel demand coming in q2. so as we exit q2 and come into q3, we have a combination of fewer bookings for the fall, just given the nature of some of the seasonality and any kind of impact potentially on covid concerns going into early q3. so we're not seeing a substantial deceleration.
always identified in the outlook is that our nights and experiences booked in q3 will be lower than in q2, given just the extreme strength that we saw in the business in q2, but we continue to be very bullish on the business. as i said, the revenue that we're going to have in q3 will be the highest ever, while the profits are going to be the highest ever. and so the business remains very strong. and what we've seen is that people want to travel and they are really resilient in finding ways to travel.
one of the benefits that we see with airbnb is that you don't actually have to hop on a plane always or cross a border in order to travel with airbnb. the big part of our strength has been in nights with less than 300 miles, that continues to be one of the strongest parts of our business. and then in q2, we saw strengthening where the faster parts are growing was growing of 300 miles longer and we saw an increase of urban nights booked. and so some of those trends have continue -- started to pick up to more kind of historic levels.
so i'm very bullish on the long-term view of our business overall.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and maybe just a clarification on this, maybe slowdown with the delta variant covid spreading, is this possible that with people getting more cautious and maybe having or wanting to optionality to maybe cancel even last minute. could that be delivering some demand away to maybe more like traditional hotel types where you could cancel like literally the day before or something like that?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
again, we feel like the ability for airbnb to provide the kinds of stays and experiences that people desire all around the world, it remains incredibly strong. we've been the best way for people to kind of travel and live through airbnb throughout the pandemic. and i think that the tailwinds that we've talked about, the tailwinds of flexibility, the tailwinds of people staying longer, the tailwinds of even how people are traveling for business in the future are always that they will travel more likely with airbnb for the longer term. these travel trends are directly supporting the strength of airbnb's business.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of brian fitzgerald with wells fargo.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, guys. we want to ask about the growth you're seeing in hosts, maybe particularly -- in particular high-demand locations. any way to characterize the new hosts who are coming online, maybe the level of professionalism -- professionalization, maybe is a better word -- versus the rest of your base? and how much of their calendar they're making available to you? are these pros or are these people who are looking at doing this seasonally or opportunistically? just trying to get a feel for that.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
thank you, brian, for the questions. dave, before i hand over to you, let me just kind of recap a couple of high-level things about our host community. number one, we have more than 4 million hosts. 90% of them are individuals and most of them couldn't have hosted, if not for the tools we provide.
and what we saw in q2 was that we had the fastest listing growth where we had demand. and the reason why is because we have individual hosts, as they get booked, word of mouth typically increases and they often tell their friends. but the other thing that we've often seen is that as more guests become flexible, we're able to point demand where you have supply. now, specific to your question about the nature of the host that we did add in q2 and whether they were individuals or professionals dave do you want to take that?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes, we continue to see 90% of our hosts are individual hosts and that remains to be the case. so as we continue to add new individuals and this is where we focus on, we focus our tools and capabilities to uniquely enable individual hosts to be successful in hosting airbnb. and when they come on airbnb, the vast majority of their listings are unique to airbnb and that has remained the case in q2 where the vast majority of our new hosts coming on are also individuals. that's our focus, but -- so we're going to build the tools and capabilities and those are the results that we're continuing to see.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, brian and thanks, dave. appreciate it.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer

your next question comes from the line of colin sebastian with baird.
colin sebastian -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks guys and nice to see the progress on listings growth. but first off, just in terms of the trend in adrs and the commentary in the letter, is that something -- is the moderation there? is that something you're already seeing in terms of bookings or is this more of a seasonal trend you expect to happen as summer holidays give way to a different profile of travel? and then, secondly, on the ebitda margins, should we think about the sustainability of those in context of a step function higher from this point or are there other investments in the quarters a year ahead that will moderate some of that near-term leverage we're seeing? thanks.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
dave, do you want to take one of these?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. on the trend in adr, again, the vast majority of the adr has been driven by mix. and so as other parts of the mix toward urban and maybe toward latin america and asia changes and reverts to more historic levels, we will see adrs moderate, but that will be purely as part of mix and as the other parts of the business come back and they have that lower overall kind of adr rates. so the strength of north america and europe, we believe to continue to remain strong.
and then as other parts of the business come back then the mix comes out and the adrs moderate. so that's all we're kind of indicating. and in terms of the ebitda margins, i think we're all -- we're proud of the progress we're making in ebitda and that accelerating toward our long term. we've stated that we could achieve 30% or more ebitda margins over time.
clearly, we've accelerated our way there. i think that a piece of that is clearly the improvements we've done on fixed costs, marketing costs, improvements in our variable costs. we also see some benefits on the higher adr rates as well. and so over time, we will see some variation in our ebitda margins kind of over time, but i think what we've demonstrated is the capability to dramatically expand those margins.
and i think it just proves the point that we've kind of talked about more verbally, which is we can achieve this 30% margin or more. and now we're actually showing how we can do that.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
and i think the one thing i'll just add on -- the one thing i'd just add on, the efficiency of our business. and we've said this in the letter. i also mentioned this in the opening comments. but covid was a crucible moment for the company.
and in that moment, this company, we've gotten significantly more disciplined and much more efficient. and i think that we've all seen the incredible benefits and focus because we've put our very best people on the most important problems in the company. and because what we've seen does not only have margins improved but actually, we're able to move much more quickly. we can pivot and i think this explains why we were able to announce and launch more than 100 upgrades on the heels of our ipo in time for the travel season.
and so i think that you're going to see a continued acceleration of product innovation because of our discipline and because of our focus. these are lessons that we will never ever forget. these are lessons that will leave indelible marks for this company.

and your next question comes from the line of justin patterson with keybanc capital markets.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
all right. thank you very much. great. with flexible dates rolling out, how has the booking window changed? are there more instances of last minute stays coming into play? and then the second question, you provided a lot more value to hosts this year.
conceptually, how are you thinking about factors behind when the right time it is to increase take rate? thank you.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
thank you for the question. so why don't -- justin, why don't, dave, i take the second question around take rate for hosts and then you can take the first question about flexible dates and how that has affected the booking window. so with regards to factors to be able to increase take rate, as -- and i'll kind of say what dave said before, we think there's -- one -- our guiding principle is that we want to make sure that every single year, we are providing incrementally more value to hosts than we're charging them because the name of the game is to make sure that our really strong business model continues to grow and that means that hosts feel like they have the very best opportunity to host on airbnb. we want them to always feel like we're giving them more value than we're taking away -- so taking.
so that's number one. number two, i do think there's a lot of opportunities for us to be able to increase take rate. and if we do that, i think the way we would think about that is by charging for some incremental services that we can provide for hosts. and the more that hosts really rely on airbnb to be able to continue to grow their business, the more we think they're going to be willing to be able to buy or participate in new services and offerings.
but the way we think about this is a nonperishable opportunity. so as dave said, we have a number of years in front of us where we can continue to look at offering new services. but what we have focused on this year is this unprecedented travel rebound that's upon us. and so we've worked really, really hard to simplify the guest experience to introduce more flexibility for guests to make it much easier for hosts to come on the platform so that we get thousands and thousands more hosts in time for the travel season.
so with that, i don't know if, dave, you want to talk about the booking window for flexible dates.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. what we saw in q2 is actually a fairly stable booking new window in line with our q2 of 2019. it was actually a little bit shorter booking window than q1 of this year, but that's largely been due to seasonality. so yes, you're right, that during covid, we've seen variations in booking windows where last year in covid, the booking windows would shorten when people felt more only would book when they felt more confident in staying.
but it's interesting, in q2, the booking window has been consistent with more historic levels.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of justin post with bofa.
justin post -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks. a couple of questions. you mentioned a lot of positive trends for the company.
i wonder if you have any thoughts on the market opportunity or the tam for alternative accommodations versus hotel nights, is that changing? and do you think alternative accommodations is growing? maybe any thoughts also on your opportunity within hotel bookings. and then second, i'll take a swing at this. any updates on actual supply metrics like hosts or active listings or is that something we'll get once a year? thank you.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
dave?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. on the latter, on supply metrics, i think we've highlighted what's really important. remember that we do not need to grow supply one-to-one for revenue growth. and why is that? it's because we have millions of listings all around the world.
and what we need to do is have the right listing for the right guest at the right time. and as people continue to get more flexible on when and where they travel as we get better focusing those hosts on the flexible locations and dates that they have in mind, we're going to get better at utilizing the supply we have all around the world. but what we have highlighted is that when there is great demand in specific areas and that was in north america and europe nonurban, we are very effective at growing at supply and that's what we saw in q2. we had some of the strongest growth of our supply specifically in the areas of our strongest areas of demand.
and we do that both organically and then inorganically through all the actions that brian talked about, about making inspiring hosts and what the benefits are being of hosted or being a host, talking to them about how they can make it easier for them to host and then having existing hosts help new hosts be successful. so those are all the ways that we'll be driving it. so i think we will be talking about listing infrequently as it is helpful to guide the overall direction of the business, but not as a routine measure because it's not the primary driver of revenue growth. in terms of tam for alternatives versus hotels, if you really think about airbnb, it's -- we're not just a travel company.
we're -- if it's all about travel and living. and really, any kind of stay, any kind of accommodation, really short of kind of a full-year lease can be accommodated in airbnb. and that's what we're seeing with the fact that we're seeing such strong growth in stays of 28 days or longer. and that, that was 19% of nights in q2.
and we highlighted in the letter the fact that even the nights of seven days or longer were 50% of our nights. and so that is not hotels. hotels average much lower, maybe one to two nights on average. we're going to be four plus and 50% of our nights were of seven days or longer.
so clearly, during this time period, we have taken share from traditional accommodations. and i think that a lot of these changes that we've talked about on the call today, the increased flexibility of how people are traveling and living, i think that just actually increases the overall tam of what airbnb is able to address because if you're going to be staying longer, if you're going to have more flexibility, you're much more likely to want to stay in a hosted airbnb with the amenities that you have in airbnb versus being in a hotel room.
justin post -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
and i'll just kind of just add to that just a little bit. in addition to long-term stays, which is essentially an entirely new category that is not even really traveling, it's living, which has, i think, been significantly expanded by covid, you have a number of other dynamics happening. people are traveling to many more locations. and oftentimes, people are now traveling to places that don't even have hotels.
so that would explain some expansion of tam there. there's also a general shift from business travel to leisure travel because we think that as fewer people travel for business in their home, they're going to have a greater desire to travel for leisure. and airbnb obviously is a disproportionately offering new to travel. and again, over the course of the pandemic, many people, millions of people, in fact, have tried airbnb for the first time.
and the most important thing about growth for airbnb is you just got to try it because our retention is really strong. and i think what this says is that airbnb is no longer an alternative way to travel. i think the term alternative accommodations might be a dated term because maybe it was appropriate 10 years ago. 10 years ago, the tam was significantly smaller.
if you see what it is today, just imagine what it could be 10 years from now. and that's what we're focused on is continually increasing the market by continually adding more categories of travel we can offer and making sure that more people know about this, the new way of traveling.
justin post -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of james lee with mizuho.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. on the hosts acquisition side, obviously, you guys did a lot of upgrades there and did a great job ramping up listings in the quarter. and just curious, what other areas of hosts acquisition are you looking to improve kind of going forward? and also secondly, in apac, where you are more dependent on cross-border travel, how are you making any adjustments there to shift your demand to these domestic states?
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
james, i'll answer the first question and dave can answer the second question about apac. so with regards to host acquisition, there's a number of things we've done. one of the things you mentioned is making it easier to host. and so what we've done, as i said, is we've reduced the number of steps to 10 really simple steps to become a host.
and this means that now the amount of time it takes to be able to list on airbnb is reduced in half. now this is a really, really big deal because the thing we know is that the easier you make a conversion funnel, the more people get through the funnel. and we're talking about very small optimizations could yield thousands and thousands of new hosts. but in addition to that, we've also been increasing the top of funnel.
we've been doing a brand marketing campaign. the company -- our made possible by hosts campaign, to target and recruit more hosts and what we've seen in the five countries where we've run this campaign, traffic to the hosts -- to become a host page has more than doubled. and so this has worked really, really well. and finally, one of the things that dave mentioned is, number one, we got to make sure we get a host in the funnel.
number two, we have to reduce the number of steps. but three, we want to make sure that we provide help if anyone has any questions about hosting. and so we've created is a host ambassador program. we have many of our superhosts who now are able to provide assistance to a new host.
so when they go through the funnel, they go through the conversion flow to become a host. if they have a question, we say, hey, would you like to talk to a superhost? and so we find that one of the strongest factors we've seen, our hosts recruiting other hosts. and this is in addition to the fact that the bigger we grow and the bigger our guest base, the more that we get host because many of our guests also become host. in fact, the no.
1 source of new host are prior guests. over 30% of our hosts were guests and that number is continually increasing. so these are some of the things we're doing to continue to increase the number of hosts around the world. and obviously, we're going to continue to do a lot more in the coming years ahead.
dave?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. in regards to apac, i mean it's amazing how resilient the domestic business has been all around the world. so we're actually seeing have seen strength in domestic business in all regions. i think the issue has been in asia and latin america have typically been more reliant on outbound and international travel to come back.
and so -- but the domestic business is within those countries has actually been quite strong. so we're very happy with the performance of domestic. we just need more borders to open for those businesses to return to kind of pre-pandemic levels.

and your next question will come from the line of brent thill with jefferies.
brent thill -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. i was curious if you could just talk a little bit about europe in more detail and kind of what you're seeing in that region and any other observations you have as it relates to cross-border?
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
dave?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. europe, what we've seen over the last several months is that the pent-up demand that people have had to travel, it kind of varies a bit by the travel restrictions within those countries. we saw increase in the people's willingness to book in q2, they were ready for their summer travel. and we saw a particular kind of strength in areas of spain and france throughout the year, throughout the quarter as people want to kind of travel for the summer season.
so i don't have much more to say about europe than kind of what we've included in the letter here.
brent thill -- jefferies -- analyst
dave, did you see -- when you're talking about all the decel, did you see emea drop off more or less? was this consistent across regions when you saw a little bit of a pullback that you've been talking about?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
well, again, the pullback we're seeing has been -- is incredibly modest. i really don't want to overstate it. i mean what we're seeing is that q2 was incredibly strong as people want to travel for q3 and that our stays in q3 are incredibly strong, which is driving our strength in revenue and why we articulated that q3 revenue and profit will be the highest ever. so all that is incredibly strong.
and then it is -- we're kind of waiting and seeing to see what the rest of the impact of travel expectations are in q3 for the back half of the year. so i don't really have much more that i can share.
brent thill -- jefferies -- analyst
ok, thank you.

and your next question comes from the line of mario lu with barclays.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. the first one on listings. you guys grew that sequentially this quarter.
so just trying to think through where the scores of new license growth will come over the next few quarters. is there a component of, say, like urban and cross-border listings that were deactivated during the pandemic that will be reactivated as mobile travel resumes? any color there?
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
dave?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean if you think about it, we have 4 million hosts around the world. 90% of those are individual hosts. then the vast majority of those individual hosts lists only on airbnb.
and most of their listings are their own personal property or maybe a second home that they have. and so i think one of the benefits we have is that people don't get rid of their primary home and not always their secondary home just because of the near-term impacts of what we're seeing with covid. and so i think that fact, that resilience of our individual hosts is what's leading to the fact that we have had stable overall listings growth. i think that's why we're quite proud about it in q1 and then while we're seeing increases from q1 to q2 in the areas where we have the most demand.
and so as people are ready to travel back to urban locations and as people are going back to the kind of the historic strengths of airbnb, our hosts are ready to and bring them back. and i think that's been the power. the inverse could have easily been true, where if you're more reliant on professional hosts, they may be delisting, not ready for the travel rebound and not ready to accept our guests. that's not the case of airbnb.
our airbnb hosts are ready to accept travelers whenever they're ready to travel.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
and i think the key point again is that we've seen, as demand in markets increase, supply in those markets correspondingly increase.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
got it. and just a quick follow-up. in terms of the hosts campaign, you guys mentioned there's early signs of success there. anything to talk about in terms of existing hosts and whether there's any actions on your end to kind of retain them to prevent competitors from onboarding them to their platforms as well?
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
yeah, i can just share and dave, if you're going to add as well. number one, what we've seen is that the vast majority of hosts on airbnb, because they're individuals, what they really just want to do is make sure they get enough bookings to fill their calendar and we found that we can get them enough bookings to fill their calendar. that's not been a problem this year. and the other thing about our hosts is they care about the quality of guest on airbnb.
because these are mostly people's real homes, their primary home or their secondary home, they care a lot about who's in their home. and we provide a huge amount of trust and safety features and protocols to be able to give them peace of mind. and this is what they tell us. and we've really also worked on providing best-in-class customer service.
for example, on may 24, one of the things we announced is the dedicated superhosts line. this is something that our very best host, our superhosts, have been asking for. and i think the reception was very, very positive. and so in addition to investing in our hosts, one of the most important thing we can do is to continue and invest in our superhosts.
and if we continue to invest in our superhosts, there will be no reason for them to list anywhere else.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. the superhosts program is really -- that is a loyalty program for hosts, right? and that's why we continue to invest. those are our best hosts. we have over 800,000 around the world.
i think that's really key. and then, actually, what we've seen with our hosts churn has actually decreased from what we saw pre-covid. so it was lower in 2020 than it was in 2019 and it's lower in 2021 than it was in 2020. so we're -- would be overall certainly continue to actually decline right now.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you.

and your next question line of kevin kopelman with cowen and company.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
great and thanks a lot. a quick one. can you just give us an update on where your revenue take rate is today as a percentage of gpv just given all the timing differences? it's hard to tell from the outside where that is. thanks.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
kevin, dave can take this.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. our take rate has actually been very consistent. so if you time adjust our revenue to gross booking value, the take rate is approximately 15% and it's been very stable during -- so when you time adjust it.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks, dave. thanks, brian.

[operator instructions] your next question is from the line of deepak mathivanan with wolfe.
deepak mathivanan -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. i wanted to ask about how you think about the travel demand trends. i know there's covid uncertainty near term.
but as you think about the sustained benefit of pent-up travel demand, there's still a lot of unspent travel dollars out there even in markets where we've seen good recovery like u.s. and parts of europe. so as you think about second half and then even into 2022, do you think this incremental benefit that we're seeing near term from pent-up travel demand likely to sustain or you think we'll go through a period where the activity rebound to normal travel levels and the recovery moderates to some extent? not looking for any specific guidance, but curious to hear your thoughts on how you think about this.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you very much, deepak. i think i can maybe take this at a high level. and dave, feel free to chime in as well.
i think there's been a number of lessons from this pandemic. and i think one of the general lessons is we tend to appreciate things more when they're taken away from us. and i think that not everything that was taken away from us during the pandemic did people appreciate. but i think that travel was one of the things that people miss the most from the pandemic.
in fact, we did surveys of travelers around the world and travel was the out-of-home activity that people miss the most. they missed it more than going to sport events, more than going to restaurants, out-of-home dining and other opportunities. and we think that we've not even obviously tapped into the pent-up demand because, obviously, not everyone has been able to travel. and also remember that before the pandemic, about 50 -- just almost 50% of our business, was cross-border travel and urban travel.
there hasn't been nearly the cross-border travel recovery yet that is possible in the coming year. so i think what we're going to see is you can only imagine that as things get more under control in the coming travel seasons, people will once again be more comfortable crossing borders, but will be different this time is that people will have flexibility they didn't have before. and so i think that we're very, very bullish about the future for cross-border travel. a lot of people haven't left their country in quite a long time and we think they're going to desire to do so.
and this is in addition to many new opportunities to be able to travel the city. so i think there's a lot of reason to be extremely optimistic in the coming years about what's going to happen to travel. there's many things that may not come back to levels before the pandemic. but one thing i think we know for certain is that travel will and it will probably be bigger than ever.
dave, do you want to add anything else?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. i guess i just will add that remember that we're not really just a travel company. we are about stays of any kind. and i think we talked about a lot on the call today, the fact of the trends of 28-day stays and longer, even seven days and longer, the flexibility that people have when they travel, the fact that travel and living is blurring, i think all of these are kind of incremental ways in which people will travel and can travel on airbnb.
and so clearly, there's this pent-up demand and people are yearning to travel again. but i just think all of these other tailwinds of travel trends are really benefiting our business over the long term.
deepak mathivanan -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. thanks, brian. thanks, david.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer

and your final question comes from the line of rob sanderson with loop capital.
rob sanderson -- loop capital markets -- analyst
hello. great. thanks for squeezing me in. a question for brian.
so this year, you've been very clear in your focus and that's, of course, to position for recovery. so you'll basically be two years now when we finally get through this where your priorities have been shifted and dislocated. so how would you expect to focus to shift as we get back to this new normal? i know development of experiences was really hamstrung and put on hold. but what are some of the more important focus areas that you would like to be spending time on or what's -- and maybe how the pandemic may have shifted those goals from what they may have been otherwise?
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
it's a great question, rob. i think there's four things. number one, i think what the pandemic has shown in this travel recovery that is upon us is that i think the opportunity, number one, for our core business is probably greater than anyone ever really imagined before the pandemic. and part of this is just because, again, more people are traveling to more locations, many of which don't even have hotels, millions of people have been introduced to airbnb.
and i think as cross-border and urban travel recover, you're going to see the huge amount of strength in our core. so number one, we have a lot of opportunity in our core and i want to make sure our team is really focused. number two, as we said, long-term stays is a huge boon to our business. this is an entire category of travel that really wasn't -- didn't really exist when joe, nate and i started this company more than 13 years ago.
but i think there's this entire new category of travel where travel and living is blurring, so that will be number two. three, you mentioned experiences. we thought last year could be a breakout year for experiences. obviously, the opposite happened.
we had to put the product on pause. but i think that people are going to be yearning for experiences. and the reason why is a very simple one. i think people are yearning to have a meaningful experience.
i think you can only sit at home and watch netflix or streaming services for so many nights in a row before you actually want to get out of house and do something and be with other people. and i think there's going to be a huge amount of pent-up demand for people having authentic experiences all over the world. and then finally, number four, i think there's a huge number of opportunities to unlock more hosting. we are now living in a world where there's still great economic distress all over the world.
and take one example, women have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. and 55% of our hosts are women all over the world. and so we think there's a huge opportunity to continue to unlock more hosting. and we're going to take guidance from the creativity of our community.
when we started the airbnb, it was really just a way to rent your living room or your bedroom, but our hosts and their creativity started listing entire homes. and not only did they list entire homes, they started listing castles and boats and tree houses. and so we're going to continue to take guidance from our host community as well and they will continue to point the way toward where we go and we're going to continue to innovate to unlock more hosting. so those are some of our priorities.
the good news is they're not really different. it's what we've always been focused on. i think it's just a renewed focus on our core, this amazing new opportunity around long-term stays. we're continuing to double down on experiences and we'll continue to unlock hosting.
we do all those things. and i think we're going to look back on this is still the very early innings of a much, much bigger business. we're 13 years old, but i think -- as a founder, i say you don't raise a 13-year old to be a great 14-year-old. you raise them to be a great adult many years from now.
and i think that there's a lot of opportunities in this coming decade for us.
rob sanderson -- loop capital markets -- analyst
excellent. thanks so much and enjoy italy.

and i will now turn the call back over to brian chesky for final remarks.
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
well, thank you, everyone for joining us today. i just wanted to say, once again, it was -- we're very, very proud of the results for this quarter. i think what this proves is that number one, our model is inherently adaptable. we can adapt to the changing use cases of guests and that's because we have hosted nearly every community offering nearly any type of space at every price point.
and number two, we're continuing to focus on product innovation. we're going to continue to build new products. and these two things, i think, have demonstrated that this pandemic, as hard as it's been for us and hard as it's been for everyone all around the world, it's made us a stronger, more efficient and a better company. and we are prepared for what's to come and for the future of travel and the future of living.
so with that, thank you all very much for joining us today. we'll talk to you next quarter.

good afternoon and thank you for joining airbnb's earnings conference call for the second-quarter of 2021. as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the investor relations section of airbnb's website following this call. i will now hand the call over to ellie mertz, vp of finance. please go ahead.
ellie mertz -- vice president of finance
good afternoon and welcome to airbnb's second-quarter of 2021 earnings call. thank you for joining us today. on the call today, we have airbnb's co-founder and ceo, brian chesky and our chief financial officer, dave stephenson. earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of 2021.
these items were also posted on the investor relations section of airbnb's website. during the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on q&a. before i turn it over to brian, i'd like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.
these factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the securities and exchange commission. we urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. you should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. also during this call, we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures.
we provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our investor relations website. these non-gaap measures are not intended to be a substitute for our gaap results. and with that, i will pass the call to brian. 
brian chesky -- chief financial officer
all right. thank you, ellie and hey, everyone, thanks for joining us today. i'm dialing in from an airbnb listing in italy and i'm very excited to share our q2 results with you. since the beginning of the year, we've been preparing for the travel rebound.
after months of being stuck at home, millions of people have been yearning to travel, explore the world and connect with others. and we anticipated a travel rebound unlike any other in history. and in q1, we saw the start of this rebound. and now that q2 is behind us, we can definitively say that the travel rebound is upon us and airbnb is leading the way.
but as we predicted, travel is different than before. airbnb has benefited from our adaptable business model, which is able to meet the changing needs of our guests. we haven't just been sitting passively around waiting for travel to return. for the past year, we've been relentlessly driving product innovations to meet this historic moment.
and as a result, airbnb has emerged from this crisis faster than others and we're better positioned for the future of travel. now, while we recognize the persistence of covid and the delta variant, we expect q3 to be our strongest revenue quarter ever. the fact that we expect q3 revenue to be our highest revenue quarter ever speaks to the inherent resiliency of our business. so now, turning to our q2 results.
as vaccination rates increased and travel restrictions lifted in q2, we saw consistent strength in north america, followed by significant recovery in europe. one year ago in q2, our business was significantly impacted with the onset of covid. now like many others, our year-over-year comparison to 2020 does show a dramatic improvement. but what is most notable are our results relative to pre-covid levels.
across all key metrics, we nearly met or exceeded our q2 2019 performance. q2 nights and experiences booked nearly tripled from a year ago. more importantly, q2 nights and experiences booked nearly matched pre-covid levels in 2019. gross booking value of $13.4 billion, more than quadrupled from a year ago and also shot up above 2019 levels by 37% based on the recovery of nights, combined with the strength of our adr.
meanwhile, q2 revenue of $1.335 billion, also nearly quadrupled from a year ago and it exceeded 2019 levels by 10%. what this demonstrates is an acceleration in our recovery from q1. our q2 results not only demonstrate our leadership in the travel rebound, but also our continued operating discipline. our adjusted ebitda profit was $217 million.
now this represents a 16% ebitda margin. this was more than $600 million of improvement in ebitda from a year ago and it represents 20% or 2,000 basis points margin expansion from 2019. and this is on a similar level of revenue. now over the past year, as our top line recovered, we consistently focused on improving our profitability.
for example, over the last four quarters, we've improved ebitda margins on average more than 20% every quarter as compared to periods in 2019. now that is a 2,000-basis-point improvement on average, every single quarter. and we've done this by improving our variable cost by driving up marketing efficiency and by very tightly managing our fixed cost. now i'm really proud of these results.
and what they demonstrate is that we are emerging from this crisis as a stronger and more efficient company. now, turning to business highlights and travel trends. despite the continued impact of covid around the world, we have seen clear evidence that travel is recovering. we're incredibly encouraged by what we've seen in q2.
and what we've seen is an accelerating pace of global travel, particularly in europe, as well as continued popularity of nonurban and domestic destinations. in q2, we had the highest number of gross nights booked of any quarter in our history. and we just had the biggest night on airbnb since the pandemic began. last saturday night, more than 4 million guests from around the world, were staying in an airbnb.
that is more people than the entire population of los angeles. and we're also seeing travelers once again cross borders and business cities. these two categories of travel have been historic strengths of airbnb and we're really excited to see them begin to recover. but at the same time, the way that people travel and live continues to change.
we believe that many of the new booking trends that emerge over the past year are here to stay. people are traveling to many more destinations than before. and when they travel, they're staying longer. we believe these two categories of travel are in fact here to stay.
and as a result, what we focused on are product innovations that support these new ways that people travel. you see many people have a greater freedom about where and when they travel and we've improved our product to better meet their needs. our new search products offer guests the flexibility that they want when planning and booking trips. and finally, we're seeing more people around the world consider hosting.
we ended q2 with the largest number of active listings in airbnb's history. now, there are a couple of reasons for this. first, our demand is driving supply. this is what's so powerful about our model.
for example, in q2, our highest supply growth was actually in high-demand destination. and second, our marketing and product initiatives have been really accelerating to support host recruitment and they're working. so now let me go into a little more detail on what we've been doing to prepare for and support this travel recovery. now, as a reminder, our single priority in 2021 has been to prepare for the travel rebound.
to do this, we've been perfecting the end-to-end experience of our core service. and this includes four themes: first, educating the world about hosting; second, recruiting more hosts; third, simplifying the guest journey; and finally, delivering world-class service. so let me just briefly give you an update on how we're executing on each of these four areas. so first, educating the world about what makes airbnb different and that is hosting.
in q1, we launched our first large-scale marketing campaign in five years, made possible by hosts and we expanded this campaign in q2. we're educating guests about the benefits of being hosted and we're also people to become hosts. now, we continue to be really encouraged by the result of this campaign in terms of traffic, first-time bookers, interest in hosting and brand favorability. second, we are recruiting more hosts and we are setting them up for success.
on may 24, just a few months ago, we launched a completely redesigned host onboarding flow that makes it simpler for anyone to start hosting. this new flow has made it faster to become a host, which has helped drive our listings growth in q2. third, we are simplifying every part of the guest experience. on may 24, we expanded the tools for guests to offer more flexibility when they're searching for a place to stay.
we announced flexible dates, flexible destinations and flexible matching. and all three of these features are to support the new ways that guests are looking to plan and book trips. and finally, whenever our host or guests need us, we must deliver world-class service. so we recently launched a redesigned help center.
we've more than tripled our supported languages and we've updated our safety resources. and all of it is to ensure that we are supporting our guests and hosts whenever they need us. so to summarize, travel is recovering and our q2 results show that airbnb's leading the way. for the past year, we've been preparing for this rebound.
we've driven product innovation to support changes to the way people are traveling and living all over the world. and as a result, we've emerged from this crisis faster than others and as a stronger, more efficient company. so with that, we look forward to answering your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from eric sheridan from goldman sachs. eric, please go ahead.
eric sheridan -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks so much for taking the questions. it's been a big year in terms of innovation and investing behind supply. brian, would love to get a little bit more color on what you see as the key learnings from rolling some of those investments out into the marketplace. and how they can inform the way investors should be thinking about supply growth and innovation in the years ahead.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. thank you very much, eric. so yes, this has been a really great year for supply growth. we have more active listings on airbnb today than we ever have.
and it's important to just share a few thoughts on supply. number one, we are quite different than our competitors. airbnb, we have 4 million hosts, and 90% of our hosts are individual. that means they could never have hosted, if not for the tools that we provide.
the vast majority are only listed on airbnb. and we find that if we make hosting easier and as more people know about hosting and we give hosting more support, more people will become hosts. and so our strategy is a full life cycle. it starts with making sure more people know about hosting.
you see, the airbnb brand is very mainstream. our brand is a noun and verb used all over the world, but hosting is not as mainstream. and so the first thing we're doing is we're raising awareness about hosting. this year, we did our first brand campaign in five years, made possible by hosts.
it uses real photos from real trips to highlight what makes airbnb different in that host. the great thing about that ad is that also it's able to attract more hosts to airbnb as well. so once we're able to increase awareness of hosting, then the name of the game is making it easier to host. and on may 24, we showed a simple 10-step process to become a host where we've radically reduced the number of steps and made it easier to host and conversion rate for people starting to lease their space flow is up.
third, if a host needs help, we're going to give them support. so we launched ask a superhost. ask a superhost pairs prospective hosts with our very best superhosts on airbnb. and since we launched this feature in may, more than 50,000 prospective hosts have used this, and we're now expanding this to 196 countries globally.
and finally, we're continually investing more tools to allow hosts to expand their business. and what all this means is that you're going to see continued innovation from us. what we've seen is an increase in the trajectory of number of people becoming a host. the other point, though, eric, i just want to make is the following.
on no night, are we ever supply constrained globally on airbnb. the vast majority of hosts only rent occasionally. and so the holy grail of travel is pointing demand to where we have supply. before the pandemic, most people were very fixed in their search parameters.
they had a destination in mind and they had dates in mind. but now, because many people don't have to go back to an office, they're more flexible. and this means that we can point them to where we have supply. and this is the power of i'm flexible.
over 500 million searches have used flexibility. more than 40% of our searches, guests are flexible on where or when they're traveling. so this is what we're doing. we're focused on a full-funnel approach to supply acquisition, and we're pointing demand to where we have supply.
and i expect that we'll have plenty of supply for years to come.
operator
our next question comes from mario lu from barclays. mario, please proceed.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. i have a couple on the long-term stays of 28 days or more. you guys mentioned that it was roughly 20% of nights spent in 3q.
but i think in the first quarter, it was around 24%. was this mostly seasonality that it declined slightly since then? and then at a higher level, any update and views on how large a channel these longer stays could attract over time?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes, mario. why don't i give the mix shift to dave and i can talk a little bit more broadly about the strategy. dave?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. the majority of the decrease is simply the increase of short-term stays kind of coming back. it still remains to be -- long-term stay has been one of the fastest-growing parts of our business, pre-covid. that is a trend that we are seeing in the pre-covid era, it just continued to be strong during covid, and it remains strong today.
and so yes, the decrease is just the fact that short-term stays continue to come back. and in terms of the market opportunity of long-term stays -- market opportunity in long-term stays, we think this adds hundreds of billions of dollars to our overall long-term tam opportunity with long-term stays.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and i'll just share a few more thoughts, mario. we've just seen a major paradigm shift in travel. before the pandemic, short-term stays is really the primary business that we were in. what we actually saw was that long-term stays was our fastest-growing segment of business even before the pandemic.
so i think what the pandemic did is it accelerated an inevitable trend. there was already this emerging category between classic traveling and really kind of permanent housing which was people seeking stays of weeks at a time or even months at a time. and i think what the pandemic has done has just accelerated this. we're going to see a lot more people going away as they have newfound flexibility.
even people with families who can't go away during the year, they may be able to travel a little bit longer during summers as well. so this is really exciting. and the only other thing i'd just add is nearly half of our business is for more than a week as well. so these are really exciting categories.
i think there's a huge amount of growth going forward for these different segments.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from the line of jen shi from bank of america. jen, please go ahead.
jen shi -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. this is jen on for justin. just wondering, so you guys mentioned that with the host initiatives, you're gaining supply in very popular areas like north america and europe. just wondering, are you seeing supply opening up in urban areas? and as the mix shift kind of comes back to urban and cross-border travel, how should we think about the impact on adrs, take rate, and maybe margins in future years? and then just one follow-up on marketing spend.
looking at marketing spend trends, obviously, this year has been super positive compared to pre-pandemic spending. you have a lot of leverage there. just wondering, do you see a scenario where maybe you would have to be more aggressive on marketing if hotel travel was coming back?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. so thank you, jen. i heard three questions. one is about supply growth in urban.
the next is mix shift's impact on adr and then marketing spend. dave, do you want to take these? i think these would be great for you to take.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. in terms -- again, one of the things to remember is -- and the reason why we kind of highlighted on the call that the growth in our supply in the non-urban areas of north america and europe is that we get the supply when we have the demand, and that's why it's gone up 15% since the beginning of the year because that's also where there's biggest demand. now we're obviously seeing greater demand pickup in our more urban areas. so the percentage of nights in the urban area has started to increase, are now maybe 46% of our nights, which is still down from maybe 60% of our nights kind of pre-covid.
and so we'll continue to see listings growth in those more urban areas as the demand kind of keeps coming back. so until i think we're back to full demand, we actually don't need incremental growth because we're still below our nights that we had back in 2019. but again, the important part is that we get the supply when we need it because the supply will follow that demand and we'll continue to make it easier for new supply to come on board. in terms of forward-looking adrs, the high average daily rate we've seen throughout this last year has been primarily driven by the mix of types of space and the location.
so it's a mix of europe and north america have higher average daily rates. non-urban whole home, larger homes, all those reasons have been driving up the rates overall. and the other thing we started seeing a little bit more in q3 was some price appreciation in high-demand areas. and so it was a combination in q3 of both the mix of types of stays and some of the price appreciation.
and what we do anticipate is as urban comes back, and more markets like asia and latin america, which have lower average daily rates, we anticipate the overall adr to moderate some but we also believe that some of the higher adr will sustain for the future. so in terms of -- and then what we did say also in our shareholder letter is that we anticipate that the adrs in q4 should be relatively consistent with the adrs we had here in q3. in terms of marketing, we're really happy with the adjusted marketing approach that we've taken. now again, this was a pre-covid change that we made, where we were -- began to invest in our strength.
and our strength is the brand of airbnb. and we modified that marketing approach pre-covid. we reduced our reliance on search engine marketing. and then in covid, we have shifted even just more significantly more quickly, and we're really pleased with those results.
as brian mentioned, this broader brand campaign, talking about made possible by hosts, it gets to us talk to both sides of our marketplace. it both recruits new hosts to airbnb, and talks to guests about why you'd want to stay at an airbnb, and we're really happy with those results and plan to continue the strength of that. we've increased our relative marketing rate this year, just given the fact that our -- the business has been going quite well. and so -- but on a relative basis, our marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue are down from levels we had in 2019.
and we should anticipate that this -- it will be in this kind of range for the foreseeable future.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and i can just share just to really recap briefly our marketing strategy, we take a really different approach than our competitors. it's a full-funnel integrated marketing strategy. and it really starts with pr and word of mouth. and really word of mouth and pr's how we built the brand for the vast majority of the years before you even have enough money to have a marketing budget.
and because of that, airbnb is a really well-known brand that's a noun and a verb used all over the world. and because of this, more than 90% of our traffic was free or unpaid in q3. and so we think of marketing is really education. brand marketing is really about educating people about our highly differentiated product.
and then performance marketing for us isn't really a way to buy customers. it's the way to laser in on balancing supply and demand. so we think this is a really unique approach. and i think that it's just really all about continually investing in our brand.
and over time, we think the amount of -- the loyalty to the brand will only increase.
jen shi -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks a lot. it's kevin from cowen. can you give us a sense of the booking trends in the fourth quarter, quarter to date? you mentioned acceleration in the shareholder letter, are you seeing that back to q2 levels yet in terms of growth as compared to the same quarter in 2019, just given kind of the delta slowdown? that would be helpful.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
kevin, thanks for the question. dave, do you want to take this?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. what we're seeing is continued strength in -- growing strength in the business as borders are starting to open up, people are more vaccinated, more willing to kind of travel. we're continuing to see bookings strength, and that's why we're going to be seeing gross booking -- rate of gross booking value growth increasing from q3 to q4. i don't have a specific percentage that we're sharing on the call today.
there can be some variability on the overall growth, but it is accelerating. and that's what's included in our guidance estimate that we've shared.

our next question comes from stephen ju from credit suisse. stephen, your line is now open.
stephen ju -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. brian, i don't know if you have data -- this data, but i'll go ahead and ask anyway. but are you able to say perhaps what percentage of your registered users perhaps have younger children who until now were not able to get vaccinated? i'm just trying to get a sense for how much incremental pent-up demand you may have waiting for you as parents start to feel better about traveling more with their younger kids?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks for the question, stephen. i don't think we have that data specifically, but i can just share a couple of high-level thoughts with you. i think that we're going to be entering a new golden age of travel. i tend to think that the last 18 months have been -- the world has been turned on its head.
and i think that many people yearned for what was taken away from them. now not everything that was taken away from us, do i think we all want back. but i think one of the things that was taken away from a lot of people they want back is the ability to travel and the ability to travel freely and the ability to travel freely across borders. and just to give you one anecdote or one data point, on october 15, i believe it was that date that president biden announced the reopening of the borders for international travelers coming to the united states.
within one week of that announcement, we saw a 44% spike in nights booked for stays, crossing borders coming into united states on airbnb for stays november 9 and later, which is when the borders would open. so what we are seeing kind of across the board is evidence of pent-up demand. i think all the new emerging use cases that exist in airbnb are here to stay because i think flexibility is here to stay. so i think a lot of the nearby destinations with people getting cars are here to stay.
i think the longer stays, people living in airbnbs are here to stay. but i think what i'm really excited about is the emergence of cross-border travel. cross-border travel is now 80% of what it was at its peak in airbnb. it used to be half of our business.
it went down quite a bit. now it's about one-third of our business and growing again. so yes, we are seeing a lot of pent-up demand. and dave, i don't know if you want to add anything to this.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
no. i think that's the key. our cross-border travel, it's 33% here in q3, but we're continuing to see strengthening here in october. more continued -- countries are reducing their travel restrictions and the travel trends continue to improve.
stephen ju -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of brent thill from jefferies. brent, please go ahead.
brent thill -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. just on the cross-border, and when you think of europe and what you're seeing there, can you drill in and give us a sense of what's starting to happen inside the countries there?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave, do you want to take that?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. we're continuing to see sequential improvement in the net nights booked in october relative to september. so travel restrictions as they come off, we're continuing to see that sequential increase. we have more global net nights booked in october 21 than we did in 2019.
so i think that's a really positive sign for europe. and there are some week-to-week variations, but the trends continue to be up and to the right.
brent thill -- jefferies -- analyst
and as just a follow on, has there been anything surprising to you through this recovery in europe that -- just anything that you've seen in underlying trends? or is it just continued strengthening as you've been mentioning?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
well, the reality is it tends to vary by country, right? different countries will have different levels of restrictions and opening. there's obviously a lot of pent-up demand for kind of peak kind of travel. we saw that in q3. it's a big part of the strength of our results in q3 -- are europeans wanting to get into their traditional kind of summer holidays in spain and italy and other places.
and so there can be some variation by country throughout, but the strengthening of the business in europe just kind of continues. we're seeing a nice uptick in bookings, especially even leading into 2022. so some of the bookings growth that we're seeing now is going to obviously be for travel in early next year and throughout 2022.

we now have a question from doug anmuth from j.p. morgan. doug, your line is now open.
dae lee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
this is dae lee on for doug. the first one, so based on your conversations with your hosts, what do you think is the biggest friction point that prevented them from becoming a host for the first time? and along that line, among the initiatives that you've rolled out for them this year, what resonated the most? and as a follow-up, how are these newer host cohorts performing versus your historical cohorts who didn't have the upgrade that now hosts have today?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. thank you for the question, dave -- doug. why don't i take the first part of the question about what the biggest friction points for hosts are and then dave can have the follow-on. now a really, really great question.
there's really three parts of the funnel. number one, do people know about hosting. number two, is it easy? and number three, can they get help. to me, those are the three parts of the funnel.
so number one, do people even know about hosting? well, airbnb's brand is very much mainstream. so we've seen a huge opportunity in people being able to host. i don't think most people realize that the average host can make $9,600, which is more than the stimulus check they've been getting the united states and the amount of effort is surprisingly easy. and so the first thing we have to do is continue to tell story of hosting, and we've been doing that, and that is working.
the next thing we have to do is make it easier to host. the easier we make something, the more people do it. airbnb really innovated and built a lot of custom tools to make it easier to host than ever before. this was really the core innovation we had.
we built a system of trust where we're continually making it easier to host. we obviously simplified the number of steps to become a host to 10 really simple basic steps. you can do it now quite quickly from your phone or a desktop device. and we have more innovations that are going to make it even easier that we're showing next tuesday, november 9.
so that's the second part, making it easier. as we do that, conversion rate goes up. and then finally, sometimes people like say, this is -- some people want to talk to other hosts. they want to know what it's like, what's it like to let a stranger in your home? how much should i charge? what are the local rules and regulations? and so having another host to talk to is really important.
now this is the power of the airbnb model. one of the things that makes me so special is we're a community. and we're a community where hosts tell other hosts about airbnb and they bring them on to the platform. and so what i'm really excited about is the ask a superhost program.
we've had more than 50,000 prospective hosts sign up to use that. and we're going to continue to scale that, and we're announcing on november 9 that we're going to be scaling the ask a superhost program. so these are three parts of the journey. we continue to focus on these, we're going to get a lot more hosts.
dave, you want to take the next part on the host retention?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. what we're seeing -- i can step back -- some of the new host acquisition that it makes it a little too early to tell exactly how the retention and things are going to work for all the new hosts. but let me step back and broadly share that overall, we're seeing churn rate of our hosts or -- has improved. it's lower than it had been historically that the actual success rate of new hosts is increasing, like 50% of new listings receiving a booking in three days.
75% of new listings are receiving a booking within 8 days. so they're actually more successful more quickly. we're seeing of the new hosts that are coming on, that they are -- the traditional hosts that have been successful in airbnb, individual hosts that are largely -- have exclusive to airbnb that may only have a property or two, it's that core individual host. that's still the majority of the host that we're kind of bringing on.
and the cross listing of our host is actually down from where it was in kind of pre-covid times. so i think the overall health of our hosting community is quite strong, and the growth that we're seeing in new hosts is very consistent with the historic types of hosts that we've had in the past.

our next question comes from the line of justin patterson from keybanc capital markets. justin, please go ahead.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you. brian, you've clearly had a lot of success with flexible stays. what have your learnings been around that, the marketing of that feature to consumers? and what do you think the next steps are to make this a broader consumer behavior? is that more brand marketing? or is that something within the app? that's question one.
and then for dave's question, two, how should i think about the pace of the urban recovery going forward?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. yes. thank you very much for the question, justin. i'm really excited with i'm flexible.
so just to recap what this feature is, on may 24, we announced i'm flexible, a new search tool that allows people to search on airbnb if they're flexible about where or when they're traveling. and so to go to airbnb's home page right now, actually, if you do it, you'll see a really big button, it says i'm flexible. if you click on that button, it now takes you to a whole new view of airbnb, where you can completely browse. now this is a really special new product we built.
we actually went through millions of listings, and we had to do this really extensive process of organizing our structured data, essentially getting an organized catalog of all of our inventory. if something says it's a treehouse, is it a treehouse? we made sure every photo is properly labeled. and this feature has been really, really successful. we also have flexible dates.
flexible dates allows people who are flexible about when they're traveling to say, i'm looking for a place for a weekend, for a week or a month any time over the next six months. well, that -- those features have been used more than 0.5 billion times. so what are our lessons? well, the first lesson is conversion rate is up. the more people use i'm flexible, the more likely they're going to book on airbnb because they're more likely to find a property.
number two, what it's showing is we're able to point demand to where we have supply. there's a lot of really unique listings that are in locations that people wouldn't have thought to type in, right? it might be in a small town you never heard of. with i'm flexible, it really levels the playing field and allows many more properties to be discovered. maybe another way of thinking about it is i'm flexible turns the home into the destination, so you don't have to type in the destination.
and i'm really excited about this. so this tells us that we're on to something. it also tells us that there's a new paradigm in travel. and so i think that this flexibility is here to stay.
i think one of the holy grails in travel is to answer a question for a guest of where should i go and when should i go. and by having these new flexible features, we're able to really be able to do that. so what's next for us is that we're going to continue to invest in this feature. on november 9, we're announcing four new categories of i'm flexible.
there's going to be some really cool features that we can show. so i hope you tune in. we're also expanding the flexible date feature from 6 months to 12 months. so now you can see when these really incredible properties are available anytime in the next 12 months.
and we're going to continue to invest in this feature. and i think down the road, this will be a major way that people are searching on airbnb, and it's so important because, again, it allows us to balance supply and demand. dave, do you want to take the second question?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. i think one thing to kind of step back and remember is that airbnb's strength has traditionally been cross-border and more urban. i mean, that's traditionally where our business strength has been, right? cross-border has been 50% of our business. the urban has been about 60% and yet our really strong q3 results happened while even those two parts of the business have not yet returned to kind of pre-pandemic levels, right? cross-border is still at 33%, the urban -- high-density urban is at 46%.
so it's not quite back, but it's growing nicely. so i think what you'd say about the pace of urban recovery is that that will continue to be additive to our business and the strength that we're seeing overall. i think what's also interesting about the pace of the urban recovery is that the nature of it is even a little bit different. historically, our top 10 cities in the world contributed approximately 11% of revenue.
and now the top 10 cities are kind of comprising about 6%. so it's just getting more diverse, more spread in terms of where our distribution of travel is. so as urban comes back, i think it's still going to be even a more broad spread version of the revenue across the world.

our next question comes from the line of jed kelly from oppenheimer. jed, please go ahead.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. we've seen a couple larger, call them property managers and urban accommodation providers, start to scale up inventory and will probably use your platform for bookings. so, brian, can you just provide us an update on how you're working with some of the larger property managers? and then in your opening remarks, you did call out some major companies on the work from anywhere trend.
is there any way for you to work closer to them and provide benefits to their workers?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. thank you for the question, jed. yes, let me take both of these. large property managers and work from anywhere trends and how -- opportunities to work with companies.
so on the first one, though our platform is 90% individuals, the 10% of our hosts who are professionals are very important to airbnb, and we continue to build new tools for them. and so this just past year alone, we've had 150 upgrades and innovations, and around half of those happened for a host. and many of the upgrades we have also applied to the more professional host as well. and so we're going to be showing off a number of features on november 9, and many of these are going to be innovations for professional hosts in addition to individual hosts.
so we're still very focused in this area, and i continue to believe that we're going to be growing really quickly. and just to give you an example, as dave said, we've seen our fastest-growing areas of inventory in north america and europe in nonurban areas. and certainly, professional hosts are a part of this. and i think they really love the amount of demand that we provide for them.
now as far as the work from anywhere approach. yes, i think this is a really exciting area. i mean, as we said, amazon, ford, pwc, procter & gamble are just the beginning of the number of companies that have offered a more remote policy. i think it's safe to say that very few companies that have office workers are going to be asking those workers to come back to an office five days a week.
and all you have to believe is that people don't come back five days a week, maybe they come back four days a week, maybe they come back three days a week, maybe they have even more flexible policies. and all we have to do is believe that, to believe that zoom is here to stay, to believe that work from anywhere is here to stay. and so we're starting to see a lot of companies certainly reach out to us. we don't have anything to announce right now, but we are going to continually make it easier for people to be able to live anywhere and work anywhere on airbnb.
and integrating with companies, if that's what it takes, of course, it would be something that we continue to do more of.

our next question comes from the line of colin sebastian from baird. colin, your line is now open.
unknown speaker
this is reese on for colin. i was just wondering if you could talk about kind of the trends you're seeing between the growth in nights booked versus adoption of experiences? and is there any difference in the trajectory of recovery there? and then maybe just how your relationships with communities are doing.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. i can take these. so obviously, the growth of our core business of homes has been very, very strong. with experiences, i really expected last year to be a breakout year for airbnb experiences.
and of course, the opposite happened. the pandemic put that product on pause. that being said, it's now been more than 1.5 years, and i feel like people can only stay home so many nights watching netflix. and eventually, they want to get out of house.
and i do think people want alternative things like restaurants, especially when they're traveling. and airbnb experiences are very popular among our guests. they actually love even more than homes statistically from a five-star standpoint. in other words, more guests leave a five-star review for experiences in the homes after they stay.
so i'm very bullish on this product. it's been gradually ramping back up and reopening. we've seen strong growth over the last couple of quarters, and i'm expecting this to be a big area of growth over the coming five years or so. so that's what we're seeing with experiences.
now with regards to our relationship with communities, let me just start by saying this. even before the pandemic, we worked with thousands of cities all over the world. you see we created this new category of travel, and we had to work with cities to educate them and work collaboratively with them to be able to really make sure everybody works best for these communities. to give you a stat, we have to date, collected $4 billion in hotel occupancy tax or transient occupancy tax.
you can't collect hotel tax without working with those cities and jurisdictions. so we've had really close relationships with them. and what i've seen in the last year is that the pandemic has actually been a bit of a reset for our relationship with cities. and reset probably in a good way because what we're seeing is a lot of cities that were concerned with tourism in their markets are having a different concern now.
now over tourism the number of cities have to under tourism. the reduction of business travel, fewer international travelers crossing borders going into big cities means that many of these cities and destinations have revenue shortfalls and just general travel shortfalls. and so what's happened is we've had a lot of cities reaching out to us to collaborate. and in fact, we've done 100 partnerships with destination marketing organizations around the world.
and i think our new i'm flexible features where we can point demand to where we have supply also means we can point demand to cities that want it. and so i think this is a really exciting period for us to really renew a great relationship with cities all over the world.

our next question is from brian fitzgerald from wells fargo. brian, please go ahead.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, guys. on the cross-border travel, the open up, we're just wondering if you could comment on lengths of stay trends there. our intuition is that if people are going to get on a plane in the current environment, they probably want to amortize that across a longer stay. but just wondering what you're seeing there.
and then second thing on about the length of stay more generally. you spoke to 28-days plus, and just wondering if you could talk to what you're seeing in terms of maybe a seven-day stay becoming a 14-day and any trends there? and any thoughts on how the competitiveness of airbnb increases versus hotels as one-week stays become two-week stays.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. why don't i start with that very last question, brian. and then, dave, i can hand over to you. you can talk a little bit more about cross-border, its impact on length of stay and just the growth of maybe weekly stays is what i think brian's asking.
but let me start with this question of the competitiveness of long-term stays. it's really quite interesting to think about how we started airbnb. i started the company when i was 26 years old with two of my friends, and the category we entered was hotels. that was the incumbent industry.
an industry that most people liked, and travelers had a lot of other options. if you were to try to stay somewhere for two weeks, three weeks, a month or multiple months, and let's say you're staying somewhere other than the city you live, what are your current options? there's not a lot of players doing this. there's a lot of friction. so we think essentially, the longer the length of stay, the more compelling it is to stay in a home.
it gets very expensive to stay in a hotel for weeks at a time. and the longer you're away from home, the more i think you want to be in a home. you want a kitchen, you might want a backyard, you want to be able to cook. you just want to feel like you're home and you're not like an outsider.
and so i think that this is going to be a really big opportunity for us. and this is partly why i'm really excited about long-term stays or even stays that are for a week or longer. dave, do you want to talk about some of the stats we're seeing?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. we highlighted on the shareholder letter that 45% of our nights were from stays of at least seven nights. and this is the trend that we're seeing is that the length of stay continues to increase. the number of use cases that people find working with airbnb in the same way that brian just mentioned, it's just a better way to travel for longer.
you're not going to want to stay in a hotel room for 28 nights, but those trends are continuing. and i don't have anything specific to say about cross-border and the length of stay directly related to that. but just more broadly that the length of stay continues to increase. and to the extent that it does, it accretes to airbnb.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo securities -- analyst

naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thank you. two questions. did you see any impact on the apple ios changes on your social ad campaigns? and then the second question i had is just around some news articles we saw that showed that you continue to work on technology to basically help onboard hotels.
maybe just talk about where it sits in your list of priorities.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. i can take both of those, naved. number one, just in apple, their ios changes. no.
we've not seen any impact on airbnb, and that's not really the business we're in. with regards to our efforts to invest in technology to onboard hotels. let's just talk a little bit about our strategy with hotels. last year, we had to make some difficult decisions to put a number of initiatives on pause, like transportation, and scale back some others.
and one of the initiatives that we had to scale back a bit was our investment in hotels. that being said, hotels are still a very important part of airbnb's strategy. we believe that people come to airbnb because we have something unique. we have unique hosts that offer something you can't get anywhere else.
and so we think that the majority of people come to airbnb direct to book individual hosts. that being said, we want to make sure that people come to airbnb, they always find a place to stay. and sometimes we have network gaps. and we think that hotels are really great ways to fill a network gap.
so when somebody comes to airbnb, they can always find a place to stay. hoteltonight has been growing really steadily in the last couple of years. i'm very excited about the progress, and we're continually investing in this area. now it's not as big a priority as our core business of supporting individual hosts, but we're continually supporting them.
we're continually investing in this area.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
maybe just to follow up on that, brian, would we be seeing hotels on the core airbnb in the future or anytime soon?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
will we be seeing what?
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
would we see hotels on core airbnb or --
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, yes. and we have tens of thousands of hotels now on airbnb, and i expect you to see more in the future for sure. and it's just -- it's really just a matter of prioritization.
right now, we are focused on the most perishable opportunities. the most perishable opportunities right now are scaling as quickly as possible to get as many hosts ready to host as many guests as possible. and so our big priorities are recruiting hosts, simplifying the guest experience, educating the world about what makes airbnb different -- that's hosting -- and getting world-class service to -- getting our service to be at a world-class level. those are our major priorities, but we are continually investing in hotels.

our next question comes from the line of deepak mathivanan from wolfe research. deepak, please go ahead.
zach morrissey -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks. this is zach on from deepak. just first on adrs, i know you kind of called out that the primary driver so far has been this kind of mix shift. but you also noted that you're starting to see some price appreciation in certain high-demand areas.
just curious if you can kind of parse this out a little further. and is that trend kind of concerning to you in the context of airbnb's long-term growth? and then second, just related to covid, i know it's very dynamic and hard to predict. but the restrictions seem to be generally easing, but we are seeing pockets of rising cases and some kind of impediments to travel demand. do you see any kind of differences in the restrictions today and the impediment to demand behavior today versus six or 12 months ago?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave, do you want to take these?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. let me start with the adr. the trend that we saw in adr late last year, the increase in adr was almost exclusively driven by mix. and so that was the regional mix, urban, nonurban mix, size of home.
and then what we saw earlier in the year is some price appreciation as a larger portion of the adr increase. and that increased a little bit further here in q3, kind of the peak kind of summer trial season. and then what we're seeing, as i said in q4, is our adrs are relatively stable with what they were in q3. even with these elevated adrs, again, the majority of the increase has been just on a relative basis due to mix.
so there's really no change in the price -- where there is some price appreciation, i think we still have a great value. we're still able to give people, homes and stays that they find very valuable in terms of all the amenities they get. maybe a larger place, more amenities, kitchen, more bedrooms, more space to be. and so we think we continue to give a great value.
and so we'll continue to monitor it and be mindful of it. but i don't think it's an existential threat to us. and then the second question is just rising cases, any differences versus earlier in the pandemic. i guess i think what we've seen is just a bit more resilience in guests being willing to travel around the world, right? there's a little bit of -- there could be pockets of variation depending on what governments frankly do in terms of opening up borders.
and -- but the general trend has continued to be more positive, more up into the right and more consistent. and i think people, even in the face of various strains of covid, continue to be wanting to travel, and they find that doing that on airbnb is the best way to do it.
zach morrissey -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks for the color.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
i'll just add one last comment. we're living in a really fast-changing world. and i don't think we've seen the end of big existential changes in the world. and if you can't predict the future, the best thing to do is adapt to it.
and i think our business model is incredibly adaptable to whatever changes are to come.

our next question comes from the line of mark mahaney from evercore isi. mark, please go ahead.
ben wheeler -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks a lot. this is ben on for mark. so in the last 18 months, covid has allowed airbnb to really pivot their product priorities to refocus on the core business. as you look to next year, do you anticipate your investment priorities to change somewhat? are you going to start focusing on stuff a little bit outside of your core business? and then the second question, if i could.
just in the letter you talked about in relation to apac, just the short-term rental restrictions as being somewhat of a drag on the recovery in that region. are those new restrictions versus 2019? and how significant are they? do you expect them to be a permanent drag?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks for the question. dave, do you want to take apac and start with that and then i can lead to talk about new investments.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. on apac, we're not anticipating that any short-term rental regulation changes as being a major negative drag on our business over time. we're just mindful that there can be some variation in what governments are wanting to do, especially during this kind of covid crisis time, and it varies by area. and we saw a little more restrictions in apac than we did elsewhere.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and then on your question of new investments. here's what i would say. i mean, we learned some very valuable lessons last year about focus. i remember once i was in college and my teachers told me, ""brian, you can do everything you want in your life just not all at the same time."" yes, we certainly learned that lesson last year.
we had to scale back initiatives. but one of the benefits of all that, we took our very best people and we focused them only on a few problems, including recruiting more hosts, simplifying the guest journey, improving our world-class service, and educating the world about airbnb. and as we've done that, we've not only reduced costs in the business, but we've actually been growing even faster. and so this year has been a year of a relentless innovation to perfect our core service -- nearly one innovation every 48 hours on our core service.
that being said, we are going to do new things at airbnb. we created this category of travel. and i think there's a lot more categories that we can create in airbnb. and so we've done two releases this year.
we did one in may and one in november, and we're going to do a couple more again next year. and so november will not be the last time you hear from us. you'll hear from us again in the spring, where we'll introduce a summer release for the summer, and we're going to have some really big new offerings as well. and again, the really big areas i'm excited about that we're currently doing, short-term stays.
i think we're realizing that we are just scratching the surface of this incredibly huge opportunity as home sharing continues to grow. long-term stays is an entirely new category for airbnb. and i think now that people are getting comfortable crossing borders, getting outside, and gathering with other people, experience will be a big opportunity. but this is just the beginning.
we have many more innovations in front of us, and we will continue to use our creativity to design new possibilities for people.
ben wheeler -- evercore isi -- analyst

good afternoon, and thank you for joining airbnb's earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2021. as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the investor relations section of airbnb's website following this call. i will now hand the call over to ellie mertz, vice president of finance. please go ahead.
ellie mertz -- vice president, finance
good afternoon, and welcome to airbnb's third quarter of 2021 earnings call. thank you for joining us today. on the call today, we have airbnb's co-founder and ceo, brian chesky; and our chief financial officer, dave stephenson. earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of 2021.
these items were also posted on the investor relations section of airbnb's website. during the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and spend the remainder of time on q&a. before i turn it over to brian, i would like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.
these factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the securities and exchange commission. we urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. you should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. also, during this call, we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures.
we've provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our investor relations website. these non-gaap measures are not intended to be a substitute for our gaap results. and with that, i'll pass the call to brian. 
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. thank you, ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. thanks for joining us today. i'm really excited to share our results with you.
the travel rebound that began earlier this year accelerated in the third quarter. q3 was airbnb's best quarter yet. revenue of $2.2 billion was our highest ever, surpassing 2019 by 36%. net income of $834 million was our highest ever, nearly four times larger than a year ago.
adjusted ebitda exceeded $1 billion, also our best ever. our ebitda margin was 49%, an increase of 30%, or 3,000 basis points, compared to q3 2019. over the summer, we also reached a major milestone with 1 billion cumulative guest arrivals. this means that airbnb has been used more than 1 billion times since we started.
now finally, i'm delighted to report that our hosts earned a record $12.8 billion in the quarter. our results show that the growing strength of the travel rebound is here despite the continued pandemic. we saw continued strength in north america and emea and an acceleration in latin america despite sequential increase of cancellations. now excluding apac, our total global nights and experiences booked exceeded 2019 levels.
gross booking value of $11.9 billion shot above 2019's levels by 23%, driven by the strength of adr. but something bigger than a travel rebound that's happening. the world is undergoing a revolution in how we live and work. the pandemic has suddenly untethered tens of millions of people from the need to go into an office.
technologies like zoom make it possible to work from home. airbnb makes it possible to work from any home. and this newfound flexibility is bringing about a revolution in how we travel because for the first time ever, millions of people can now travel anytime, anywhere for any length, and even live anywhere on airbnb. and we believe that this trend toward more flexibility will only accelerate.
in recent months, some of the world's largest companies -- procter & gamble, amazon, ford, pricewaterhousecoopers -- have announced increased flexibility for employees to work remotely. and we expect many more companies to follow their lead. and so what we're seeing are several trends as a result of this travel revolution. first, people can travel any time.
because many people don't have to be in the office at specific times, they have more flexibility on when they can travel. so families are increasingly traveling outside the traditional week -- weekend trip. and in fact, mondays and tuesdays are currently our highest growing days of the week to travel. this is really interesting.
the second trend we're seeing is that people are traveling everywhere, literally everywhere. during the pandemic, over 100,000 cities have had at least one booking on airbnb. and that includes 6,000 towns and cities that received their first booking ever on airbnb. the third trend we're seeing is people aren't just traveling in airbnb, they're now living on airbnb.
long-term stays, up 28 days or more, remained our fastest-growing category by trip length. people are traveling with airbnb for extended vacations, relocation, temporary housing, student housing, and many other reasons. now finally, more people were also interested in hosting than ever before. we ended q3 with the most active listings ever, and there are two reasons for this.
first, our demand is driving more supply. in fact, our highest supply growth is in our highest demand destinations, particularly in north america and emea. and second, our marketing and product initiatives to attract new hosts are working. now we're constantly improving our service to meet this new way of traveling and the wave of guests it will bring.
on may 24, we introduced the airbnb 2021 release, which included more than 100 upgrades across every aspect of the airbnb service. on november 9, which is next tuesday, we'll be announcing the airbnb 2021 winter release. and this release will include another 50 upgrades and innovations that will make it easier to host and support the changing needs of guests. and you can watch it right on our homepage next tuesday at 8pm -- 8am pst.
so i hope you can tune in to see it. i'm really excited about what we have to share. so now let's turn to our progress on our 2021 plan. now as a reminder, our single priority in 2021 has been to prepare for the travel rebound.
to do this, we've been perfecting the end-to-end experience of our core service. and this includes educating the world about hosting, recruiting more hosts, simplifying the guest experience, and delivering world-class service. so let me give you an update on each of these. first, we are educating the world about what makes airbnb different, and that is hosting.
earlier this year, we launched our first large-scale marketing campaign in five years, made possible by hosts. we're educating guests about the benefits of being hosted, and we're also inspiring more people to become hosts, and we continue to be encouraged by the results of this campaign. second, we're recruiting more hosts and setting them up for success. on may 24, we launched a completely redesigned host onboarding flow that makes it simpler for anyone to start hosting.
throughout the process, potential hosts can now be paired with superhosts to answer their questions or concerns. we began ask a superhost in nine countries, and we've since expanded the program to over 30 languages in 196 countries. third, we're simplifying every part of the guest experience. earlier this year, we introduced i'm flexible, a whole new way to search on airbnb when guests are flexible about where or when they're traveling.
now since launch, guests have used i'm flexible more than 500 million times. now due to the popularity of this feature, we're soon making it even more flexible by expanding the date range of this feature as well as adding more categories of unique space. we're really excited about the progress of this feature. and finally, fourth, whenever a host or guest need us, we must deliver world-class service.
in september, we launched dedicated superhost support in north america, giving our most experienced hosts priority access to our most experienced support agents. we're expanding the support to all superhosts globally by the end of the year. so that is our plan for 2021. now before i go to questions, i have one update that's bittersweet.
three years ago, ann mather became the second independent director to join our board after ken chenault. since then, our team has benefited from her guidance. now ann recently made the decision to reduce the number of boards she sits on, and sadly for us that means she'll be departing our board of directors on december 15. now ann has been a critical member of our team as we transition from a private to a public company, and we appreciate everything she's done.
we look forward to adding another independent director as soon as possible. i know that being on the airbnb board in the midst of a global pandemic is no easy task. and i want to once again thank you, ann, for everything you've done. so to recap, q3 was airbnb's best quarter ever.
revenue, adjusted ebitda and net income were our highest ever. travel is undergoing a revolution. people are now taking longer trips, traveling to more locations and even living on airbnb. as the world changes, we continue to innovate.
we've made more than 150 upgrades and innovations this year alone. so with that, dave and i look forward to answering your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from colin sebastian from baird. colin, your line is now open.
colin sebastian -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks. good afternoon. two questions from me.
i guess, first off, brian, you recently posted on twitter the most popular requests for new functionality or services on the platform for this year. i think crypto payments might have been a tough request. but, when you talk about acceleration in the pace of innovation, what should we think about in terms of the key areas of focus and how that impacts, you know, where you're spending money? and then, secondly, maybe just one clarification on the ebitda outlook for the full year. i think, there was commentary on flat margins.
is the context for that a seasonal -- or return to seasonal booking trends and adrs normalizing, or if that's not right, if you could add some context? thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks very much, colin. so, why don't i take the first question? and obviously, dave, i think you could take the second question on ebitda. so, colin, with regards to the pace of innovation, just to kind of create a contrast, last year, we created 150 upgrades in innovation.
so, it was the most innovation we've ever delivered in any year of our history. and i think this explains why it was probably the best year in our company's history. but this year, we intend to create even bigger leads with our product. and just to give you a sense of how we're thinking about it.
going back to our priorities. we're seeing that millions of people are not tethered to have to go back to an office five days a week. and what this means is guests are spreading out to thousands of communities all over the world, and they're also staying longer. and so, we want to design for this world, both people just living on airbnb or just traveling and having more extended vacations.
we also launched i'm flexible last year, and that product has been used 800 million times. now, this is a really key feature because, since the advent of the internet, almost every travel website asked you two questions: where are you going? and when are you traveling? and suddenly, i'm flexible gets us further up the funnel. this allows us to be in the inspiration business. and it's ultimately strategic for airbnb because if you're flexible about where and when you can travel, we can point demand to where we have supply.
so, we're going to continue to upgrade our product. and we're going to continue to be better hosts to our guests in those communities by providing even better world-class service for them each step of the way. so, what we're going to do is continue to invest in the guest experience to adapt to these new behaviors, provide world-class service for them. and then, once again, we want to unlock the next generation of hosts.
so, we have a whole road map where we understand each of the obstacles for people to host, and we're going to launch products and features this year that will unlock those obstacles. and i'm sure that's going to create a huge plethora of new supply in airbnb. dave, do you want to get the second question on ebitda?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure, yeah. we're very proud of the progress we've made in our margins in 2021. i mean, we increased them from minus 5% back in 2019 to 27% in 2021. and so, it's obviously a huge improvement, and very proud of the work that we've done across the board.
but also, remember that we're managing for profitability while investing for growth. we're still very much in the growth mode investing for the future, and that's key for us. and what we saw in 2021 was that we had a step-change in our marketing expenses and achieved a new level of overall marketing investment as a percentage of revenue. and we've already achieved that new baseline and likely not to achieve substantial improvement in the marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue this year.
and we also made a step-change in our fixed costs and continue to improving our variable costs. we'll continue to do that. we'll get more leverage on fixed and keep improving our variable costs. but last year, we also saw the tailwind of average daily rate which definitely helped our margins.
and as adrs may moderate this year and as a mix of our business changes, that will be an offset to some of the further improvements in our fixed cost leverage and variable costs. so, if adrs moderate a little bit less, there's room for some upside in ebitda. but that's why we've given the guidance we have.
colin sebastian -- baird -- analyst
ok, great. thanks, guys.

our next question comes from naved khan from truist securities. naved, your line is now open.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks a lot. two questions. one for brian, one for dave.
so, brian, how are you thinking about growth in experiences for 2022 as travel comes back and people engage in more activities and experiences? and dave, on the margin question, again, how should we think about the growth in other expenses outside of marketing and available costs, namely operations support and product development. is there supposed to be a significant ramp up or is adr the primary explanation for why margins can be flat year on year?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. hey, naved. so, i will take the first question, and dave, you can take the second question on expenses. with regards to experiences, we are very bullish on this product.
it should be noted, for example, that the percentage of people that leave five-star reviews for experiences is even higher as a percentage of people who leave five-star reviews for homes. so, what guests have told us is they love experiences, and i think hosts really depend on the economic income that it offers. now, in 2020, before the pandemic, we thought that year was going to be a breakout year for experiences. instead, we had to pause the product.
but now, we are going to be ramping the product back up. it's going to be a multiyear journey, but i'm really excited about the potential for this product. and i think the reason is really simple. i think you can only like play so many video games and stay home and watch so many shows on netflix before you want to get out of the house and you want to do an activity with other people, whether it's traveling or even in your own area.
and so, we think this is going to be a great way to meet other people and also connect with people you care about over an activity. dave, do you want to talk about expenses?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. you know, so we -- like i said just a minute ago, we achieved a new baseline in our marketing expense as a percentage of revenue. we already achieved that in 2021. so, there isn't as much opportunity for improvement in that particular line item going forward.
on the operation support area, we're continuing to invest in the community and growth for the support of our guest and host community. so, underlying, we're making improvements in the underlying rate of our operational support, but we still have other investments on top of that in order to drive those underlying improvements. and so, that one will have a few -- would be relatively flat for this year. and on the product development expenses, again, we're growing our product development expenses more slowly than we're growing revenue.
so, we're going to continue to get leverage and discipline on our focused kind of product development efforts. it, again, will just be a less of an improvement than what you saw in 2021. and then, adr is a little bit of the challenge to forecast. if adrs remain higher and stronger, that's a tailwind to ebitda; if they -- as the business rebounds more urban, more lower adr regions and adrs moderate some, that will be a continued headwind for our margins.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you, brian. thank you, dave.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer

our next question comes from stephen ju from credit suisse. stephen, please go ahead.
stephen ju -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you so much. so, brian, i think you rightly called out the longer-term stays as your fastest-growing category, and you're going to be in the roster as well. so, thinking about the other side of the equation and i guess, the supply side of the equation.
so, how are your hosts responding to the rise in this type of demand? and are there any sort of supply and demand imbalance considerations we should be thinking about or worrying about? because it seems like the pandemic has definitely taught the consumer that they can work and stay anywhere. thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
hey, stephen. this is a really, really great question. and you are correct that there -- that -- just let me preface our supply question by saying that there's this entire acceleration in this new category of travel, which is that people are less tethered to an office, so they can now live anywhere, not everyone but a lot of people. additionally, we are really optimistic about cross-border travel rebounding and urban travel rebounding.
so, all of the original airbnb use cases from pre-pandemic are going to come back, i think, in full throttle, probably better than before because of pent-up demand. now, because of that, we need to make sure we have enough supply. so, let's talk about how we get that. well, the first thing i'd say is that one of the great things about our business is we have a global network.
and so, what that means is the number one source of host on airbnb are prior guests. in fact, in q4, 33% of hosts were prior guests, and that number has been going up over the last couple of years. the other really interesting phenomenon we see is the markets, the fastest supply growth are also the markets have a static demand growth. that's really interesting.
and we think the reason why is most of our community are regular everyday people. they're teachers, their healthcare workers, they're students and really everyday people. and as they make money and they get a lot of bookings, we think what's happening is they're telling their friends in their neighborhood and community, and they are also listing, and then some other people are expanding their business. so, that's the first thing is our global network.
next, we have a full-funnel approach to recruiting hosts. first, stephen, we need to make sure that more people know about hosting. we want the brand of hosting to be as mainstream as the brand of airbnb, which is a noun, a verb used all over the world. so, we did two major host brand campaigns last year, made possible by hosting and a stranger campaign, and both campaigns have driven a lot more traffic and a lot prospective people to airbnb.
next, we want to make sure it's easier to become a host. so, what we did last year is we reduced the number of steps down to 10 easy steps to become a host. one of the things we've learned over the course of starting airbnb and growing airbnb is the number of -- the less friction, the better the conversion funnel. and so, as we make something easier, more people do it.
and we also know that hosting is something that makes people ask questions about. and so, what we wanted to do is match our very best prospective host with their very best superhost, so they can ask questions and get their questions answered. and this has led to a higher conversion rate of people becoming host. and then finally, we wanted to start addressing the obstacles that people are hosting.
now, one of the most common obstacles we heard are people were nervous about their home being damaged when they rented out to guests. and so, we launched last year with aircover, top-to-bottom protection, free for every host only in our airbnb, and this included $1 million damage protection and liability insurance. the last thing i'd say, though, is in addition to our global network, in addition to our supply strategy, is this other real important point. this is kind of the holy grail, which is that because more people are flexible about where and when they're traveling, it means we're further up funnel.
800 million searches have used i'm flexible. and this means that we can start to point demand where we have supply because we are not supply constrained globally on any night of the year. the challenge is just that too many people go to too few places at the same time. but as the world gets more flexible, we can balance supply demand in addition to our other strategies.
so, that's the answer, global network, a full host recruitment strategy, and pointing demand to where we have supply.

we now turn to bernie mcternan from needham and company. bernie, please go ahead.
bernie mcternan -- needham & company -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. maybe just a follow-up on that with the supply and demand imbalance in the marketplace. do you see the price appreciation as a problem for demand or an opportunity for the hosts?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave, do you want to take this one?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
i think you would see a bit of both. i mean, if you go back to what we've seen for the average daily rate throughout 2021, early in the year, it was almost exclusively driven by mix. so, it's the rebound of u.s. and european travel.
it's been a rebound in nonurban whole home, larger homes. so, the adr was almost entirely mix. in the year, especially around the peak travel season around the summer, we started seeing some price appreciation in high-demand locations, think mid-summer. and so, there was more price appreciation in those areas.
and it was about equal price appreciation to mix, both in q3 and that stabilized relatively in q4. and so, with the amount of demand for travel, the adrs, we've not seen it take a significant tamper down on demand for people who travel. i think there's a lot of pent-up demand for people to get out of their homes to travel and live. and i think they're just constantly looking for the opportunity to kind of travel.
in terms of the opportunity for host to earn more money, i mean, as there could be challenges in inflation driving up costs for individuals, they can certainly be empowered to become host as a source of earning additional income. and so, we see that airbnb actually could be a solve for that. airbnb have had hosts earn $150 billion as hosts on airbnb, and i think continue to use us as a great way to earn additional income going forward.
bernie mcternan -- needham & company -- analyst

our next question comes from deepak mathivanan from wolfe. deepak, please go ahead.
deepak mathivanan -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. two quick ones, one for brian and one for dave. brian, you noted that airbnb would want to become the ultimate host and offer a more personalized service for guests.
can you elaborate on some of those efforts? and what type of incremental opportunities do you envision kind of unlock from this in the next few years? and then, dave, i just wanted to ask on the marketing spend. it seems like you noted that you found new baseline. but as some of these volume scales in the next few years, a lot of it is driven by kind of a macro recovery of the travel spend incrementally and then also in some of these use cases like long-term stays remaining strong. why shouldn't we kind of expect additional leverage on marketing, or is this an effort by you to sort of step up investments, so you can keep marketing spend relatively flat as a percent of revenues and bookings? thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. awesome. well, thanks, deepak. obviously, i'll take the first question, dave, and then i'll let you take the second.
so, airbnb becoming the ultimate host. what i would say, let me point you to two things that we're seeing, just to give you a sense of where we're going. let me start by saying airbnb is really a design-driven company at the very beginning. we have a unique design-driven approach, and i think that is a source of much of our innovation.
and that's allowed us to create this new category of travel, and it's allowed us to make over 150 upgrades innovations in the last year. we have some really huge things that we're going to be launching in the coming months that i'm really excited about. a couple of schemes that we're thinking about. number one, as i said, more and more guests are coming to airbnb with flexibility, right? so typically, the way it used to work is people would come to airbnb or an ota, and you'd ask them where are you traveling, and most people knew where they're traveling.
you'd asked them when you're travelling, they say, ""i know where i'm traveling. so, maybe i'm going to miami this week."" the more guests are flexible, the more you want to start learning more about why they're traveling and what they're interested in, so you can point demand where you have supply. so, the first thing we want to do is provide a more personalized shopping experience. i think that we can go beyond the classic e-commerce paradigm where anonymous customer comes to a website, they type something into search, they get a list of search results and then they book something.
we think that we can provide an even more personalized service. and because we have a huge amount of repeat guests and we're a community and we know quite a lot about our guests, i think we can provide a deeply personal service. and that will increase conversion and really unlock a lot more opportunities for guests. that's just one example.
one other example i'm going to give to you is on customer service. one of the things we noticed is when we offer dedicated superhost support for a superhost and then aircover, which is the industry-first protection for host, it has massively increased host sentiment. and we think this is critical. and we think we can do quite similar things for guests.
we think that we can provide just the ultimate customer service to our guests and be there with them and go above and beyond each step of the way, just like a good host. and as far as does this offer an opportunity for incremental new offerings and services, the answer is absolutely yes. the more we know about our guests, the better service we provide, the more opportunities we have to promote new offerings to them as well. dave, do you want to take marketing?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. just to step back, remember that in 2019, kind of before the pandemic, we shifted our marketing strategy to be more brand-driven and even less dependent on search engine marketing. and so, we made that shift, and it kind of was proven to be the right shift to be made not only in 2019 but obviously in 2020 and 2021. and what we're currently seeing is still 90% of our traffic remaining to be direct and unpaid.
and so, we're continuing to focus more of our spend in brand marketing and less on the search engine marketing. and you are right that the brand marketing then should be more fixed, it's more of a fixed investment. but what we're seeing is great success in the brand marketing that we did last year, and we're going to be expanding it to more countries. and so, to the extent that we expand into additional countries, there will be some incremental more brand marketing spend in this year.
but you're right, once we are penetrated in most of the countries around the world, we can see more leverage because it becomes more of a fixed cost. and as you grow revenue, you can kind of grow revenue out above the marketing. i just -- we don't expect to see that additional leverage in 2022, but we could see it in 2023 and beyond.
deepak mathivanan -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks for the elaborate answer. really appreciate it.

we now turn to mario lu from barclays. mario, please go ahead.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. the first one is on one of your top priorities for '22 and beyond. you mentioned unlocking the next generation of hosts.
so, it's been pretty clear that your hosts have been growing in regions that are seeing the largest demand. so, just curious if there's a certain demographic or host that you feel you're currently under indexing and look to unlock? and then, secondly, on service fees or take rate. i understand this is not reported, but with half of the elevated adrs is due to pent-up demand, does that give you confidence that you could potentially increase the service fee at some point in the future? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. hey, mario, i can take both, and then, dave, you can feel free to elaborate on anything i didn't get to. but i'll do both of these. all right.
so, let's talk about unlocking the next generation of hosts. and the question is, is there any area that we're under-indexing in? i don't know if i'd say there's an area we're under-indexing in, but i can tell you where i see the biggest opportunity. airbnb, we started because my roommate and i were living in san francisco, we couldn't afford to pay rent. so, in other words, we weren't a small business.
we weren't a vacation rental owner. we were just kind of everyday people. we weren't a property management company. and we started airbnb, the real innovation was we created tools to allow everyday people to be able to become host for the very first time.
and because of that, nearly 90% of our hosts are individuals. they're school features, healthcare workers, students. our hosts have earned over $150 billion since we started and 55% of them are women. so, what we're going to do is continue to focus on individuals.
we're going to continue to support property managers. we're continuing to invest in them. we also have hotels, but we think probably the biggest growth area is going to be individuals. and the reason why is because things like inflation are providing more pressure on families all over the world and they're going to require economic opportunity to be able to make it through this difficult time.
and we saw that we started airbnb during the 2008 recession. and many people were turning to airbnb because the economic empowerment provided. so, i think that most people don't realize that they can make an incremental $9,000, $10,000 a year by hosting occasionally. and then there are a number of people that are incredibly successful.
we see people renting unique properties that are making tens of thousands of dollars, even hundreds of thousand dollars a year. so, we think just getting the message out to everyday people, they can become a host, making it easier and addressing the obstacle systematically is the key opportunity. and this is true in geographies, all of the world, from north america, europe, latin america, africa, and apac. so, that's what we're really seeing.
and then on the service fees and take rate, let me just say this. there is no question that we have obviously the opportunity to increase take rate on the guest side and the host side. now, we don't want to just increase the tax for the service. we want to make sure that we're going to increase our prices that -- or if we're going to increase fees, that's going to be because we're offering services that our guests or hosts want to pay for.
we want to make sure that every single year, the value listing is increased. right now, those opportunities to increase monetization efforts are not the most perishable opportunities right now. and the reason why is we think this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for this huge travel rebound. we have these new use cases.
people are living anywhere all over the world. but we also have the return of cross-border travel, the return of urban travel. so, we are totally focused on responding to this travel market share as possible. now, the bigger we get and the more scale we get, the more services we could potentially offer to guests and hosts.
and what we've seen is there's a lot of services that you can offer to host. i think alibaba, amazon, etsy, shopify, and others have proven that there's a huge opportunity in this area. it's just not the most perishable opportunity right now, so we're focused on market share.

we now turn to jed kelly from oppenheimer. jed, please go ahead.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks. thanks for taking my question. two if i may. you said your listings were up 20% in nonurban north america.
is that coming from primarily individuals or property managers? and then, as we think out to 2022 as more people return to urban destinations, how should we think about competition, specifically from hotels and more commoditized inventory? thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
great. thanks, jed. why don't, dave, you take the first question, growth of individuals versus property managers in nonurban areas?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. broadly, what we're seeing is that our growth in new supply has been relatively consistent with the distribution of individual versus professional hosts that we've seen typically. like, the majority of our listings are unique to airbnb and from our individual host community. and so, we're continuing to see the growth in our overall number of listings to be consistent with the relative distribution that we've historically seen.
we don't specifically break out the individual versus professional host by geography. i'll just tell you that broadly, we are continuing to see that we focus on the unique needs of the individual hosts, individual host community. that's what we're focused on, and that's where we're continuing to see the growth. so, the mix overall has remained relatively stable between individuals and professional hosts during this most recent period.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and then, jed, why don't i take the question about competition, hotels, and more commodity offerings? so, i think the important thing -- i mean, this is just one thing to think about. the longer you're away from a home, the more i think you want to be in a home. and if you actually look at the growth of airbnb by length of stay, every length of stay segment, except for one grew from this time in 2019, q4 2019. for example, one-month stays grew, one-week stays grew, three-nights stays, five-nights stays grew.
the only stay category that didn't grow were one-night stays. presumably, these are business travel stays. i don't think that business travel is going to ever come back the way it was before the pandemic. it doesn't mean business travel is not going to back.
i just think it's going to be different because the way we work is different. and i think that the bar to get on an airplane to travel for a meeting will just be a little higher than before. now, i do think that the travel market is so big that i think there's so much room for both, airbnb and hotels. and actually, i think many hotels are going to consider it to be a very important distribution platform for them.
the bigger we get, the more important we actually are to them. i also think the hotels are going to have a really great opportunity with a lot of group travel conferences, like really large like events and offsites. so, they're going to have their area where i think they're going to thrive, and i think we are going to have ours as well. but i don't actually see like a massive overlap.
i do think there are some very distinct use cases that are great for airbnb and some others that are great for hotels and hotels exist on airbnb.

we now turn to brian nowak from morgan stanley. brian, please go ahead.
brian nowak -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. i have two on the bookers. you guys have had incredible bookings growth the last couple of years.
i'd be curious to hear about what you know, what you've learned about the demographics of your bookers and how it's changed, age, income? what does the base of your bookers look like now as opposed to pre-pandemic? how has that sort of changed your view of the world? and then secondly, about all the new bookers that came to the platform in 2020 in 2021, what can you tell us about their user behavior from a frequency or booking perspective at this point versus earlier cohorts, just so we get sort of an idea of how these users may or may not be different from what you've added historically? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. thank you very much, brian. and, dave, why don't you take these? so, the first question is bookings growth, what are the demographic of bookers, especially new bookers and then new user behavior compared to earlier cohorts.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
i think broadly, the good news is that we're really not seeing a major shift in change overall. the demographics have been relatively consistent throughout this rebound and our new cohorts have -- it's early, but our new cohorts are still aging consistently with what we've seen new booking cohorts age in the past, the repeat booking rates, and things. so, i think that's a nice opportunity for us to introduce airbnb to millions of new guests and it's great that those guests at least in the early days, are having similar rebooking rates as what we've seen historically.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and maybe i'll just -- maybe -- and maybe, brian, i'll just say one other thing. i think the thing that's like really quite unique about airbnb is we're not just a brand for young travelers or old travelers. we're not just a budget brand or a luxury brand. we are really -- we range from budget to luxury, young travelers to retirees.
we're in u.s., also in europe. we're in every continent in the world, and we're not just urban, we're urban and nonurban. and so, i think the adaptability of our model and the incredible selection that we have really brings the kind of the whole world to airbnb. and so, we're seeing -- and i think i continue to expect that really all demographics are going to continue on airbnb.
it's a pretty unique brand that can really flex in that way. and so, i think it's one of the great points of our global network.

we now turn to brian fitzgerald from wells fargo. brian, please go ahead.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, guys. a couple of questions on the length of stay. as you continue to see the strong growth in longer stay. just wondering if you could walk us through some of the take rate dynamics of that.
and when you talk about addressing the key pain points of hosts, just wondering if you could share what some of the ongoing points of friction are there and preventing people from hosting on the platform?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. that's great. so, dave, why don't you take the length of stay, take rate dynamics? and i can talk about the key obstacles people have for hosting.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. on the take rates, the long-term stays, they have a moderately lower take rate because the guest needs are a little bit lower. and the adrs or the average daily rates are just staying for longer because hosts often offer a discount. but those lower take rates and adrs are offset by the fact that they're longer than short-term stays and the costs actually support them.
so, lower customer support costs another -- and actually have a more nights booked. those are benefit and become a tailwind and we generate similar contribution margins from a long-term stay booking relative to the short-term stay bookings. so, the dynamic is a little bit different on the top, but the bottom-line contribution is more similar.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and as far as addressing the obstacles, brian, what we've seen is we've listened to thousands of hosts and we took a very systematic approach to the journey from people learning about airbnb hosting to listing to going through the entire process. and the first thing we want to make sure is people know the benefits of hosting. most people don't realize the economic opportunity the hosting provides. they don't realize that you can host in 10 easy steps.
they don't realize that the vast majority of people get their first booking within three days. we want to make sure that if they have any problems they can get help they need, so we're going to continue to expand the ask a superhost program. we have some ideas to reduce the effort to hosting even further, and we want to continue to provide more protection like aircover to get even more people a peace of mind. i think the thing about airbnb hosting, that's pretty unique compared to other marketplaces is almost any type of person can be a host.
most of the people listening to this call could be a host. you could be renting your second home. people rent their primary home. people can rent their homes when they're gone.
and so, i think there's something about hosting that can apply to people of all walks of life. and that's what we're going to be focused on.

we now turn to doug anmuth from j.p. morgan. doug, please go ahead.
doug anmuth -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. i was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about adrs and just what you're seeing so far for bookings in '22? and just curious, just your view of the degree of decline for this year has changed at all. and then, dave, just on capital allocation, just curious if there's any changes or anything different to call out now just given, obviously, a lot more discipline in the business and a very different degree of profitability versus a couple of years ago. thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. obviously, dave, why don't you take both of these, adr in 2022 and capital allocation?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. like i said earlier in the call, the average daily rate early in 2021 was almost exclusively driven by mix, country mix, urban versus nonurban and whole homes or whole home nonurban, europe, u.s., just has a higher daily rate. and then toward the back half of the year, both in q3 and q4, we saw some price appreciation in high-demand markets and kind of peak periods.
and so, then it was more equally weighted between the two. and so, then, what we've seen kind of coming in and we expect that as urban comes back, and we are continuing to see urban accelerate every quarter and some of our lower adr markets start coming back, and we have seen places like latin america now well above 2019 rates. so, we would see some moderation in the adrs. what we're seeing early in 2022 and included in this -- in the letter is we anticipate about a 4% increase still year over year, so q1 '22 over q1 '21 in adr.
so, we're still seeing strong adr rates and anticipate that will be the case here early in the year. and what's tougher to forecast is the rate of return of those lower adr segments and then how much of the price appreciation kind of steps. but we would anticipate some moderation of adrs through the back half of the year. we just don't know exactly how much.
and then, on the capital allocation, i do tell you that i sleep better at night now that we have $8 billion of cash in the bank relative to the position we were in -- prior to covid or midst of covid. and it enables us to have the flexibility to continue to invest in growth because that's what we're focused on is to grow this business. and we can continue to use some of that cash in case we wanted to use it for any kind of acquisitions, although acquisition is not our primary kind of growth driver. and one change that we did announce here in the letter of this quarter is that we are planning to pay for our rsu tax obligations for employees with cash rather than selling to cover.
so, we will be net settling those shares, and that will be a use of about a little more than $1 billion of cash during the year. but i'm very proud about how -- with our investments. so, thank you.

we now turn to lloyd walmsley from ubs. lloyd, please go ahead.
lloyd walmsley -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. i had a couple. first, just on the host supply, it sounds like you're seeing good traffic gains in regions where you're advertising, but the aggregate listings number is only up something like 7% from the last disclosure, despite a pretty good environment. so, just wondering what gives you the confidence that you can continue to grow supply to meet demand on kind of a multiyear basis? and is there -- do you have visibility into the backlog of hosts just going through that process that gives you that confidence it can accelerate? and then a second one on kind of adrs, the shareholder letter mentioned having over 25% more nights booked for the summer than this time in 2019.
can you talk about what that looks like kind of on a gross bookings basis? and as we think about adrs, you know, if you put aside the geographical format mix shift, like where do you think like-for-like pricing is moving up for this year as it seems like some folks are pushing price?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
ok. yeah. thanks very much, lloyd. so, dave, i think you can take both of them, and i'm happy to round up the answers.
the first one is obviously on host supply, how we're feeling about the environment on a multiyear basis, and the backlog of hosts. and second, obviously, summer demand, what that means for gbv adr.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. you know, as we kind of mentioned earlier, the key is that -- on the supply side, remember that we have 4 million hosts. the vast majority of those are individual hosts, 90% of those are individual hosts. and the individual hosts hosting their own home or often the second home.
and so, what we found kind of during the pandemic is people don't get rid of their own or their second home just because there's a global pandemic and they're not having hosting. when people are ready to travel, they're there and ready to travel again. so, actually, we've been quite proud of the fact we're pleased that our actual supply has remained as stable as it has throughout this pandemic. and i think that's what you're seeing in regions outside of where we're seeing a lot of the rebounds, u.s.
and europe, while there could be softness or not as much growth there. that growth would be there when the demand comes back. and that's why we're highlighting the growth that we saw in the high-demand areas. we did grow 20% in the u.s.
nonurban because that's where we're seeing a greater amount of demand. airbnb is amazingly self-healing dynamic with the approach to how we add supply to our environment. so, i think as the market comes back, we'll continue to do it. and then go ahead, brian.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and again, maybe i'll just, lloyd, round out a little bit of this answer. i just wanted to just really underline this. we designed the airbnb in the very beginning so that guests attract hosts and hosts attract guests. and this is 14 years later, more than 1 billion guest arrivals later.
it's working obviously pretty well. and again, i think one of the -- a couple of reasons. number one, guests become hosts. and so, as we get more hosts, a percentage of them -- as we get more guests, a percentage of them become hosts.
and we're going to continue to focus on converting as many guests to hosts as possible. this is a really interesting flywheel. number two, the way we grow primarily is word of mouth. so, as regular people get more bookings, they tend to tell other regular people about it.
if a hotel gets a lot of bookings, they're not going to tell the next hotel who's a competitor. most regular people don't think of themselves that way. so, word of mouth starts to spread. but the other thing, once again, i also want to underline is the holy grail of supply is also being able to point demand where you have supply.
and we are not even close to supply constraints any night of the year if you take a global average of every city, all 100,000 cities around the world. and so, what we want to do is as people are more flexible, and we are moving top of funnel, we want to continue to point demand where you have supply -- and all of that is in addition to our very specific efforts to continue to recruit hosts, which we're really focused on. so, i think dave nailed it. it's all about the global network.
and, dave, why don't you take the second question about summer demand?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah, summer demand and adrs. i mean, i think we're just seeing strong demand for travel. people are ready to travel this summer. we have 25% more nights booked for the summer travel season than we did in 2019.
they're ready to get out and do that travel. and obviously, we are seeing that adrs are higher. but as i mentioned earlier in the call, both in q3 and q4, a portion of that was mix, and about an equal portion was due to price appreciation. so, that stayed relatively stable.
in other words, we didn't see price appreciation go up higher as a driver in q4. it was fairly stable. so, that's kind of what we have currently forecasted for what we've shared in our guide here in q1.

we now turn to andrew boone from jmp securities. andrew, please go ahead.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. two, please. first, can you just talk about your progress with hotels on the platform? brian, i think you mentioned that briefly earlier. and then, secondly, going back to marketing, do we start to think about brand marketing as being more connected to the supply side of the equation, meaning that there's going to be continued pressure as you guys grow the network more broadly, but rather than focus on the demand side, focusing more on the listing side and thinking about that as it is connected to marketing? thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks, andrew. why don't we do this? why don't i, dave, take marketing? i'll start there because i wanted to just recap how we're thinking about marketing over the coming years. and then you can take our progress with hotels and the platform. let me just back up and just talk about how we're thinking about marketing, andrew.
we have a pretty different marketing approach than our competitors because we take a full-funnel approach to marketing. and it combines pr with brand marketing and performance marketing, and pr is actually probably the most important channel to build the brand of airbnb. and that is because airbnb has got an offering that's really unique. and so, because of that, people are deeply passionate about, they tell one another, and every airbnb's become a noun and a verb used all over the world.
we got more than half a million articles on airbnb just last year alone. so, it's been a very important part of our marketing strategy. and i think this explains why nearly 90% of our traffic remains direct or on pace. now, we take brand marketing, we think of as really investment in educating the world about airbnb.
so, it's not really about buying customers but educating people what makes airbnb special. and then we think of performance marketing as really a laser, to laser in on balancing supply and demand. now with regards to brand marketing going forward, it's a great question. i think we're going to focus on a couple of big areas.
number one, yes, we think the area that needs a little more investment is the brand of hosting. the brand of airbnb is noun and verb used all over the world. and very few people at this point who travel regularly and book travel on internet don't know about airbnb. but we don't think enough people know about the incredible economic benefits to hosting and just be incredible, like what it brings to people's lives to be able to bring the world to their home.
but the other thing is we have a lot of really big innovations that we're going to be launching this year. and so, we want to actually put some of our brand marketing dollars behind some of the new product innovations that i'm incredibly excited to deal this year. and so, those are two of the areas that we're going to continue to invest in. again, we think of marketing as education, education, and what we have that's unique and different, and we're going to educate the world about hosting, and we're going to educate the world about our new products and innovations this year.
with that, why don't i hand it over to dave? maybe the only other thing i'd say of hotel before we talk about how they're doing on our platform is, again, the core of our community are individual hosts. but the great thing of our platform is property managers and hotels are great ways to fill the network gap. we think most people come to airbnb to book something unique, one-of-a-kind stay from an everyday host. but we always want to make sure we never have any network gaps.
we never want somebody come to airbnb and leave having not found a place to stay. and so, we think hotels and property managers continue to be a very important part of our strategy. and the more demand we give them, the more they will continue to come on our platform. i don't know, dave, you want to talk a little bit about the progress of hotels on our platform.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
we notice that in 2020 and 2021, we did scale back our investment in those areas. i mean, it's key to have hotels still in the network gaps. but as cities are starting to return and we're getting urban coming back, that's when the time we'll need to fill those network gaps with hotels. and so, what we've seen in q4 is that the nights remain depressed here over two years, and they're slightly down kind of quarter over quarter due to omicron.
but our revenue's a little bit stronger relative to that due to a little bit higher adrs, which we're seeing in hotels, similar to what we're seeing in other parts of the business. so, we'll invest in hotels over the long term. it's just not our immediate focus.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
thank you.

we now turn to mark mahaney from evercore isi. mark, please go ahead.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. thanks. i just wanted to clarify something on marketing. it does sound like you've run a few campaigns toward hosts and toward i think you called them shaggy strangers that you were pretty happy about.
so, do you want to lean more into marketing you talked about expenses levering or not -- leveraging or not leveraging in '22, should we expect sales and marketing to show some deleverage as you kind of lean more into those marketing plans? and then, could you also talk a little bit more about adrs? and i forget what the impact of the longer-term stays, what impact that's had on adr? so, forget about the urban, forget about the pricing, just that impact itself of longer-term stays. is that accretive or dilutive to adrs, what kind of impact does that have? thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. thanks very much, mark, for both questions. dave, i'll hand it over to you. sorry.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
great. on the marketing campaign, you know, as i said earlier, we anticipate our marketing expense as a percentage of revenue in 2022 to be relatively consistent with that in 2021. so, i'm not anticipating further deleverage and also not anticipating a lot of incremental leverage. as we're growing this year, we'll be expanding the investment to more countries.
and as you noted, like our -- some of the brand marketing that we're doing in support of host. i think one of the powers to remember of our marketing is that we can speak to both sides of the marketplace. so, anytime we market airbnb, we can actually talk to both guests and hosts. and as brian mentioned earlier, one of our single largest sources of new hosts are our formal guests.
on the adr, long-term stays are dilutive on the adr as a percentage goes up. but it's kind of offset by some other -- the other factors that we talked about on the call today, both mix shift and price appreciation is what continues to buoy the adr rates overall.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst

kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks a lot. i just had a follow-up on some of the recent booking trends you're seeing. so, looking at the q1 revenue guide at the midpoint there, it would be 70% higher than in q1 '19. and that's higher than any of the gbv stats you've given out so far.
so, is that revenue growth all gbv-driven, or there other -- the take rate or other components in there as well? and if so, what are they? thanks.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. the gbv is primarily driven by the -- relative to nights is driven by the increase in adrs. so, our absolute kind of take rate on a percentage of gbv is actually remaining fairly stable.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst

we hit new highs of gross booking value, revenue, net income, and adjusted ebitda. we made more than 150 upgrades and innovations across every aspect of our service. but we're not stopping there. in 2022 and beyond, the world will continue to change as millions of people choose to live anywhere.
and airbnb will relentlessly innovate to support this new world. we've now been a public company for more than a year. and i want to end today by thanking our employees who worked tirelessly to make all of this innovation possible. and to our millions of guests and hosts around the world, i want to thank you for trusting us in helping build airbnb into what it is today.
thank you all. and i'm going to speak to you again soon from a number airbnb somewhere around the world. see you.

good afternoon, and thank you for joining airbnb's earnings conference call for the fourth quarter of 2021. as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the investor relations section of airbnb's website following this call. i'll now hand over to ellie mertz, vice president of finance. please go ahead.
ellie mertz -- vice president of finance and investor relations
good afternoon, and welcome to airbnb's fourth quarter of 2021 earnings call. thank you for joining us today. on the call today, we have airbnb's co-founder and ceo, brian chesky; and our chief financial officer, dave stephenson. earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter and full year of 2021.
these items were also posted on the investor relations section of airbnb's website. during the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on q&a. before i turn it over to brian, i would like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.
these factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the securities and exchange commission. we urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. you should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. also, during this call, we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures.
we've provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our investor relations website. these non-gaap measures are not intended to be a substitute for our gaap results. with that, i'll pass the call to brian. 
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. thank you very much, ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. thanks for joining. i'm excited to share our q4 results with you.
q4 was another record quarter, and 2021 was the best year in airbnb's history. in q4, revenue was $1.5 billion, our best fourth quarter ever, and exceeded 2019 by 38%. net income was $55 million, our best q4 ever compared to a loss in 2019. and adjusted ebitda was $333 million, also our best q4 ever.
our adjusted ebitda margin was a positive 22%, compared to a negative 25% in q4 of 2019, this is a huge improvement obviously. now, in q4, gbv was $11 billion, which surpassed 2019 levels by 32% and was driven by strong adr. now, even with omicron, q4 nights and experiences booked were only down 3% compared to 2019. and when you exclude apac, it was actually up 8%.
winter results show that we've been able to respond to this changing world of travel. nearly two years into the pandemic, it's clear that we are undergoing the biggest change to travel since the advent of commercial flying. remote work has untethered many people from the need to be in an office. and as a result, people are spreading out to thousands of towns and cities, staying for weeks, months, or even entire seasons at a time.
for the first time ever, millions of people can now live anywhere. and we've been able to respond to these changes because our model is inherently adaptable. our millions of hosts offer nearly every type of home in nearly every community around the world. but it's not just a model.
it's also our culture of relentless innovation. in the last year alone, we made more than 150 upgrades and innovations across every aspect of the airbnb service. this explains why we had our best year in our company's history, despite still being in the midst of a pandemic. now, there are a number of business trends that have been driving the strong performance.
first, guests are staying in thousands of small towns and rural communities on airbnb. throughout the pandemic, we've seen growing demand for domestic and nonurban travels. in q4, gross nights booked in nonurban markets was up nearly 45% from q4 2019. and in the past year alone, airbnb guests stayed in nearly 100,000 towns and cities all around the world.
second, guests are also returning to cities. q4 nights booked at urban destinations have recovered to -- nearly recovered to q4 2019 levels. and cross border travel also continues to recover and improved each quarter in 2021. guests are planning to travel despite variants and surges.
despite the impact of omicron, in december, gross nights booked were up 40% and the cancellation rate was lower than a year ago. in q1, we're already seeing strong demand for the summer travel season compared to 2019. and finally, guests are not just traveling airbnb, they're now living on airbnb. nearly half of our nights booked in q4 were for stays of a week or longer.
one in five nights were for stays of a month or longer. and in the past year alone, nearly 175,000 guests stayed for three months or longer. so, i'm going to follow on the footsteps of our community. recently, i shared that i too am going to live on airbnb.
right now, i'm doing this call from airbnb in miami. and i'll be staying in a different town or city every couple of weeks. i've always wanted to do this. but before the pandemic, i had to be in office every day.
now, i have the flexibility that millions of other guests do on airbnb. and i also think it's important that as ceo, i deeply understand the nuances and unique opportunities that this use case on airbnb will provide. so now, i want to recap how we did on last year's priorities. as you recall, for 2021, our single priority last year was to prepare for the incoming travel rebound.
and to do this, we focused on perfecting the end-to-end experience all of our core service. this meant educating the world about hosting, recruiting more hosts and setting them up for success, simplifying the guest journey, and delivering world-class service. so, let me just give you a really quick update on each. first, we've been educating the world of what makes airbnb different, and that is hosting.
in 2021, we launched our first large-scale marketing campaign in five years to educate guests about the benefits of being hosted and inspire more guests to become hosts. it worked. we've seen an increase in traffic to our platform in countries we ran the campaign, and this was significantly ahead of noncampaign countries where we didn't run the campaign. second, we've been recruiting more hosts and setting them up for success.
last year, we redesigned the host onboarding flow, making it easier for new hosts to get started. and we also introduced our ask a superhost program, pairing potential hosts with superhosts to answer their questions. and finally, we created aircover top-to-bottom protection, free for every airbnb host and only offered on airbnb. third, we've been simplifying every part of the guest experience.
last year, we introduced i'm flexible, a whole new way to search on airbnb when guests are flexible about where and when they're traveling. and guests, since we've launched these features, have used i'm flexible nearly 800 million times. we've also chipped dozens of other product features to improve the guest experience. and finally, fourth, we've been focused on delivering world-class service to our guests and our hosts.
now, in addition to providing protection for our hosts through aircover, we launched dedicated superhost support. now, dedicated superhost support provides our most experienced host priority access to our most experienced support agents. and as a result, we've seen fewer escalations and faster resolution times, increasing overall superhost satisfaction. now, i'm incredibly proud of everything we deliver to our guests and hosts in 2021.
but it's important to note we are not stopping here because in 2022 and beyond, what we're going to do is accelerate our pace of innovation. and we're going to focus on three key priorities: live anywhere on airbnb; unlock the next generation of hosts; and airbnb becoming the ultimate host to our community. so, let me just give you a quick preview of each. first, live anywhere on airbnb.
as a result of pandemic, millions of people can now live anywhere. they're now using airbnb to travel to thousands of towns and cities staying for weeks, months, or even entire seasons at a time. some people without families, like me, i can kind of live a bit nomadically, staying in different airbnb's every week or every month. now, people who have families probably can't do that.
but we're seeing people who have family going to have a lot more flexibility over the summer, and i think this is why bookings in january for this summer by nights booked are up 25% from this time in 2019. another people are just going to take some more extended weekends. the key point is that every length of stay on airbnb is going up, whether it's two nights, three nights, a week, a month, or a season, all lengths of stay except for single nights are up on airbnb. and we want to design for this new world by making it even easier for guests to live on airbnb.
the second priority is we will unlock the next generation of hosts. with 4 million hosts on airbnb, we believe we've just scratched the surface in growing our host community. so, what we've done is we listen to thousands of people who think -- who are thinking about hosting to understand what obstacles there are for them to become a host. and what we're going to do is systematically address each of these obstacles in order to attract the next generation of hosts on airbnb.
and finally, airbnb will become the ultimate host. we believe that airbnb can be much more than a marketplace that merely connects guests and hosts. our goal is to provide the ultimate service to our guests, anticipating their needs and going above and beyond just like a good host. now, by offering a more personalized service, we can dramatically improve the experience for millions of guests around the world.
so, that's it. just to summarize. q4 was airbnb's best quarter ever. revenues, adjusted ebitda, and net income were all records.
we're in the midst of a revolution in travel because people have newfound flexibility in how they live and work. our adaptable model and our relentless innovation have allowed us to respond to this moment. and in 2022, we're going to accelerate our pace of innovation and continue to support this new world of travel. so, with that, dave and i look forward to answering your questions.

[operator instructions] we will pause you briefly as questions are registered. the first question comes from colin sebastian with baird. please proceed.
colin sebastian -- baird -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon and congrats on the strong quarter. a couple of questions for me. i guess, first off, brian, drilling down a bit on some of the broader use cases that emerged through the pandemic.
at a high level, the trends clearly sounds very good. i'm hoping you could unpack that a little bit more in terms of the sustainability of longer stays and other use cases in markets that are furthest along in the recovery where offices are reopening and lives are sort of getting back to normal, if you could able to break that down a bit more. and then secondly, on the plans for advertising and marketing, you're keeping that, it looks like fixed as a percentage of revenues, so a little bit higher spend on marketing and advertising. can you talk about that? is that with all the product updates, the rebound in travel, maybe the competitive landscape? if you could talk about the strategy with respect to the advertising and marketing.
thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, excellent. thanks, colin. so why don't i answer these at a high level? and dave, feel free to jump in with some more specifics. so let's start with the question of, colin, some of the broader use cases you talked about.
and let's back up. so when we started airbnb, it was really just a way for people to book a home for just a few days at a time. but even before the pandemic, actually, long-term stays of a month or longer were our fastest-growing category or segment of trip by tripling. some of these were already growing very quickly before the pandemic.
and i think what the pandemic did is, i think, it accelerated the adoption of longer-term stays in airbnb by hard to say how many, but certainly by years. and i think it's important to understand why this is happening. right now, what's happened is that for millions of people, they don't need to go back to an office five days a week. and the vast majority of companies are not requiring employees to come back to an office.
many have moved to a hybrid or entirely remote model. and i think that what we're going to see going forward is we're going to see more and more flexibility because i think companies ultimately want to retract the very best people and the best people are going to be everywhere. and so, so long as we believe that people don't need to go back to an office five days a week, millions of people, then we believe in a world of more flexibility. so long as we believe in a world where people will continue to dial in on zoom, we will, again, believe in a world of more flexibility.
and so what we are going to continue to see, we think, over the coming years as continued and sustained growth for stays of longer than a month and stays of longer than a week. i don't think this is a temporary phenomenon. i think that the genie's out of the bottle and flexibility is here to stay. and i think flexibility after compensation will probably be the most important benefit that an employer can offer.
and just to give you a small anecdote, last week, last thursday, we announced that airbnb employees can live and work anywhere in the world. the response internally was great, but even more impressive with the response externally because our career page was visited 800,000 times after that announcement. and so i think that this just speaks to the durability of this use case, and i think that it's going to continue. now with regards to advertising, i think it's just important that i share a little bit of a recap of how we think about marketing.
and dave, feel free to talk a little more detail. so, we've, colin, a little bit, obviously, different approach to marketing and advertising than our peers. we take a full funnel approach to marketing that combines pr, brand marketing, and performance marketing. and we're not really focused on buying customers.
we're focused primarily in investing in our brand and educating the world about what makes airbnb unique. so, we think of marketing primarily as education. and i think this explains why 90% of our traffic or more is direct or unpaid. airbnb is a noun or verb used all over the world, and it was really not advertising, but pr and word-of-mouth that built our brand.
and just to give you an example, and -- since the pandemic started, there have been more than 1 million articles written about airbnb. 55% of articles that used to have the word travel in it, also have the word airbnb in it. so, it's pretty -- so advertising is really a form of supplemental education for us. it's not the core driver of growth.
we think the core driver of growth, airbnb is innovation. it's about building a product that people love. and the role of marketing isn't to buy customers. the role of marketing for us is to educate people about our new features and our new offerings.
dave, do you want to -- i don' know if you want to go into a little more detail about advertising.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
i think you've covered it incredibly well. i mean we're very proud of the approach to marketing. this -- the full funnel approach is working probably well for us. as you said, we are actually increasing our marketing dollars.
we're just keeping the marketing expenses as a percent of revenue relatively consistent to the level we had in 2021, and we think it's being really effective for us.
colin sebastian -- baird -- analyst
thanks very much.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from bernie mcternan with needham and company. please proceed.
bernie mcternan -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thank you so much for taking the questions. i guess, first, just wanted to get any insights on how supply and demand are growing relative to each other versus what was happening before the pandemic. so maybe even just utilization, how it's trending, how it was trending before the pandemic, and how it's trending now? and then secondly, on capital allocation, with over $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, $9 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
can you remind us on just your thoughts on if there's any sort of capital allocation, whether it's returning it to shareholders, m&a, continuing to invest in the product, would love to hear your thoughts there.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
great, bernie. so why don't i do this? well, let me just talk at a high level about the first question. and then, dave, why don't you take both questions at a more specific level. so let me just say at a high level around supply and demand.
number one, i think we're going to have plenty of supply this summer for the demand. we're expecting a lot of demand for the summer. but we are not supply constrained, any night of the year, not even close at a global level. the challenge of most travel companies is that a lot of people try to go to the same place, the same city on the same day, and cities essentially like travel otas typically get sold out.
so like a lot of people try to go to new york city on new year's eve and there's only so many places to stay in new york and so you tend to get sold out. now key is airbnb. we're in 100,000 towns and cities all over the world. and we see a couple of phenomenon.
i think it's important to point out. the first thing we see is that fastest-growing supply markets are actually our fastest-growing demand markets. so as the market experiences more demand, more supply gets unlocked. and i think the reason why is primarily because the vast majority of host of airbnb are individuals.
the vast majority of new host get a booking within three days. and when a regular person gets a booking and the booking might be $300, $400, $500, they tend to tell their friends about it. and so as more people get booked, they create more word-of-mouth and this unlocks more supply. so we have a global network where demand in a sense stimulates more supply.
additionally, the i'm flexible feature is critical because it allows us to point demand to where we have supply. so, if somebody types in paris on june 1 to 5, we are limited to the properties in paris on those dates. but if somebody says, we're flexible, we can point them to other dates in paris that are a little lower season or other towns around paris that have available supply. so, i think these are really important.
but dave, i don't know if you want to go into a little more specifics about either utilization and also kind of the capital-allocation theory.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. just to double click on a couple of areas. i mean, one is we just have more supply than we've ever had in our history. and as brian kind of mentioned on the call, the fact that we grow more supply in the areas that we have the greatest demand, like nonurban active listings grew 21% in north america and 15% globally, it's the area where it's kind of self-healing, where we have the demand is where we end up having the supply.
and this redistribution is also incredibly important because we have listings in all types of markets. we're not globally constrained at any given night which is different than if you only had supply in one type of market. and then when demand spikes in that particular more narrowing market type like vacation rentals, you don't have anywhere else to distribute demand. but because we're all around the world, in every kind of community, we end up with the benefit of being able to redistribute demand to other places.
so i think that's been incredibly strong for us. regarding the capital allocation, yeah, we have $9.3 billion. i mean i think as a cfo and the continued pandemic having a strong balance sheet continues to allow us to sleep well at night. we have noted previously that we're going to use about $1 billion of our cash to pay for employee tax obligations as they exercise their shares.
and so that will be a use of cash this year. and beyond that, we're continuing to be in growth mode. we will continue to have a balance sheet that enables us to be ready to invest, win, and where we find it is appropriate. it does enable us to do m&a in the future if desired, although m&a is not our primary driver of growth, we still plan to grow organically as our primary means.
but we'll continue to evaluate our balance sheet use and make sure that we are deploying capital appropriately.
bernie mcternan -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thank you both.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from mario lu with barclays. please proceed.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. the first one is for brian. it's a high-level strategic question.
so now that the total room nights has fully recovered versus 2019, how do you decide when is the right time to extend the company's focus to other potential growth areas such as experiences, hotels, and flights versus continuing to hone in on the core product?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
great. yeah. so let me take that. so thanks, mario.
so basically, we learned some really important lessons during the pandemic. i started this company with my two friends when i was 26, i just turned 26 and i started this company. and we had this enormous amount of success. and one of the things that happens when you're a first time in your enormous amount of success is you do something well, and you think you can kind of do everything well.
and we pursued a lot of things before the pandemic. and i remember growing up at a teacher said, you can do everything you want in your life, not at the same time, though. and i think that when the pandemic happened, there was a silver lining to the crisis for us, which is we got really focused. we took all of our best people, we paused a lot of new initiatives.
and we put our very best people on the most important problem for the company, which was stimulating core business. but i think what we saw is not only did that happen, but the total addressable market for short-term stays is bigger than we ever imagined, and we are also able to extend it to long-term stays. our general approach now going forward is to be incredibly focused. we're going to absolutely be pursuing new opportunities, but we want to focus on the most perishable opportunities right now.
and right now, the most perishable opportunity is this. last year, we had what was probably the travel rebound in the century. certainly, i've never seen travel rebound like last year since i started airbnb. and i think this year is going to be even bigger than last year because last year, it was a little bit tempered by the delta and other strains.
and i think what you're going to see this year is the true pickup of demand and cross-border travel. so we're focused on this year is the perishable opportunity of trying to capture as much market share as possible and get as many people who haven't traveled a couple of years to try airbnb because, for many people, airbnb is no longer an alternative way to travel, it's the default. with that being said, we are absolutely looking at new opportunities and new services. nothing we paused from the pandemic that is out of -- is off the table to resume.
and airbnb experiences, for example, is a big area of investment in the coming years. and so we're starting to ramp up that product this year, i think more -- even more next year, you're going to see some major new offerings around airbnb experiences and a significant demand. and i think that some of our best ideas are ahead of us. i'm 40, and i don't want to feel like the best ideas we had were in my 20s or 30s.
so i think that there's some really big opportunities going forward. but the name of game is focused, just a few things at a time, the most perishable opportunities get as much scale as possible to get that scale into an ecosystem, and then you can do a variety of line extensions for guest and for host.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks a lot. and then just one on the travel demand post the summer months. i know you guys talked about the fourth quarter being a little bit higher than historical, but how do we compare that versus the 30% figure that you provided in terms of the summer travel season? is it higher or lower? anything you can say in terms of the demand for the summer?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, dave, i'll let you take that.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
i'd say that with the 30% in the summer periods, we're seeing consistent -- that strong or stronger on a relative basis in q4. i think that's the fact that people are willing to plan out into the fourth quarter that far in the higher rates than they've done in the past. it just shows the resilience that people have for traveling. so now the q4 demand is as strong relative to the q3 demand or stronger.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks, dave.
operator
thank you. the next question come from brian nowak with morgan stanley. please proceed.
brian nowak -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. brian, i have a couple for you. the $2 billion -- $2 billion -- the 2 billion i'm flexible searches, that's up quite a bit from $800 million last time around.
i guess i'd be curious to hear about what are you seeing when people use that i'm flexible? is that leading to higher conversion? is that leading to higher utilization of some radius of the search? sort of what are you seeing that sort of driving that quick inflection in that product? and then to go back to your earlier answers about your innovation in your 40s now, what are still the areas on the host front where you see sort of low-hanging fruit opportunities to improve it to drive more host growth?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, those are great questions, brian, and good to talk to you again. so yes, let me start with guests and let me then go to host. so you're right. i think that -- i do [inaudible] by saying that last year, we launched i'm flexible.
the reason we launched it is we saw more people were flexible. and the challenge is this for 25 years, travel search has basically been the same. there's a search box. and the search box ask you where you're going and it presumes that you know where you're going.
in fact, you have to come to these websites for intent. and then it ask you, when are you going? and so most the otas aren't really in the business inspiration. they're in business of converting traffic into bookings. and this is good, but we always thought this -- the holy grail of like online travel was to inspire people about where to go.
now the results of i'm flexible has exceeded our expectations. it's been used 2 billion times and for a travel product to be used 2 billion times and people only use the trial product typically a couple of times a year is pretty unusual. so what are we seeing the results? i think the primary thing we're seeing with i'm flexible is we're seeing a very strong amount of engagement with i'm flexible people see a lot more properties in a lot more markets. we're seeing people book properties outside of a lot of the popular tourist destinations, and we're seeing an ability to redistribute travel demand beyond the top popular hotspots like rome, paris, las vegas, new york, los angeles.
so that's really the most important thing that i'm flexible can do. i'm flexible can be in the inspiration game and point demands where you already have supply. and so our measures of success are how often do people come back to the website, how many properties do they wish list, how frequently they are engaged in the product on the inspiration side and on the demand side, how well are you pointing demand to where we have available supply rather than just kind of being at the mercy of wherever they think they want to go and when they want to go when they come to airbnb. and so i think that what you're seeing in the q1 results is that clearly, the product is working, because i think that i'm flexible as a feature has helped drive a fair amount of that growth.
now with regards to the host front, you're right, it's very important that we continue to innovate on the host side. last year, we made a number of improvements to the host side of our product. number one, our general principle is the easier you make something, the more people do it. that's a really basic principle of the internet.
if you make something easy, you reduce friction where people do it. in hosting, the easier we make it, the more people become a host. so what we did last year is we reduced the number of steps to being a host to 10 easy steps. we added a new product called ask a superhost.
i think 170,000 perspective hosts have used the products so where they have a question, they can ask one of our very best host. and then probably most importantly, brian, last year, we launched aircover for host. aircover provides $1 million protection against property damage, $1 million personal liability coverage, and it's free. we do not charge anything incremental to our transaction fee, and we're the only company in travel that offers this for free, all these feature sets to our host.
now going forward this year, we have a number of new innovations that i'm really excited about. i'm not going to go into all the details, i'd like to kind of save it until we announce it, but i'll stay at a high level. we are looking at features that bring more people into hosting ecosystem. so we want to provide even more ways to make it easier for host to list.
we want to provide more support for them to make it easier to host and we want to provide even more kind of control, so people can decide who sees their property, when it's available, things like that. so we have some really exciting announcements on may 11. you'll hear some interesting features that are going to be launching. and then we're also going to have a product release later in the year in november as well.
so we'll have a couple of big updates on those two fronts. but again, it's all about making hosting easier and making it even more appealing for people who aren't host to become host. and if we can do that and make cost a mainstream, that will fulfill our growth for years to come.

thank you. the next question comes from naved khan with truist. please proceed.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah, thanks a lot. a question for dave. so, dave, last time around you kind of set expectations for adrs to be down for the year in aggregate. is that still where you expect to be? and then what are you baking in, in terms of this new product release that's coming up next week?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
right. on adr, what we've shown in the past is that adrs are up substantially from where they were back in 2019. so they were up 37% year over three years. and what we saw throughout the time in 2021 was that by q4, about half of that adr increase was driven by just mix.
so regional mix, like north america and europe, and the type of home, so non-urban whole home. and so mix was driving about half of the price appreciation. and then the other half was driven by price appreciation itself. so about half and half on the drivers or adr.
here in q1, price appreciation has become a larger percentage overall of the driver of adr, and mix has been a little bit less than half. so it shifted even a little bit more. so what we're going to see, and we've shown this in the outlook is that q2 of this year, adrs will be relatively flat with q2 of the prior year. and so that will give you a sense that adrs were remaining elevated, both due to mix and due to price appreciation.
we think that they will likely moderate throughout the back half of the year as mix continues to adjust more toward cities, more cross border, which have lower average daily rates, but price appreciation has remained to be high and stickier. and so i think the level of decrease in adr, i think, will be maybe lower than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year. and then i think -- i don't know, give me more on your question around new product introductions that we'll be talking about next week? we'll give you those details in may.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
just what are you making in terms of contribution? no, just the contribution -- does your outlook can compare to any contribution from those products?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean our outlook for q2 clearly includes a lot of the results from the investments we've made to date, and we're very bullish on these continued improvements to continue to drive the strong results that you've seen. so we're not giving kind of guidance out beyond q2 at this time.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from stephen ju with credit suisse. please proceed.
stephen ju -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you. so, brian, the rising consumer demand for longer-term stays has been something you've been highlighting in terms of a fundamental change in behavior for some time now. so -- can you share with us how the reception from the host has been in terms of their willingness to accept longer-term stays versus the more traditional shorter burst because i guess what i'm trying to get at is whether there's any sort of extra push you guys may need to do in order to enable that longer duration supply with the 6 million hosts you have now? or is this just a matter of demand, as you say, lighting up the supply? and i guess, second, i get that things are pretty depressed right now.
but going back to the world pre-pandemic, like what were some of the bigger corridors of travel in asia so we can start thinking about what the shape of the recovery there can be? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you very much, stephen. now yes, so let's start with rising demand for long-term stays. what has been the reception of host? now, this is actually one of the most interesting point, i would say, which is i think when we really started looking at this category, my assumption was it would be a different type of host, right? some host wanted to list their place for short-term basis and other different host wanted to list their properties for a long-term basis.
and this is what you say -- see on craigslist, right? there's a short-term stay category, and there's apartment categories and they're not the same people. and airbnb is totally different. the vast majority of host on airbnb, who initially list their homes for a short-term basis have now included a monthly stay discount. and that's critical.
so we have a large percent of people to have a monthly stay discount or are available to host on a long-term basis. so i think that's the most important thing, i would say, which is that they obviously are interested in it. now, why are host interested in this? well, there's a number of reasons. one is seasonality.
some people live in highly seasonal areas. where on high season, they want to rent by the night because they have a really great yield, but during low season, they held low occupancy, so they'll move toward the month. in some markets, in urban markets, there are some restrictions on the number of nights you can rent on a short-term basis below 30 days, but they don't have restrictions on 30-plus days. so for the most part, what hosts long-term stays as is a way to increase their annual occupancy, and they generally want to go nightly to get as many bookings as possible, but during low season or where there's limits they go to monthly and they're really the same host.
now there are some hosts that only do short term. there are some hosts that only do long term, but what we see as generally open-mindedness from most host to offer bulk. and the great thing about our product is you hardly had to do anything different to offer long-term stays. having long-term discounts is key.
there's some new amenities, having verified wi-fi is [inaudible] if you're going to live someplace. so there's a number of like tactical things. but i think, generally speaking, the product as it exists, work for short-term or long-term stays, the vast majority of hosts are open to it. so the answer is they're very receptive.
now i think your second question was what were the biggest corridors in asia? well, yes, so let's start. asia is a highly cross-border market. let's kind of break it out, asia pacific, or start actually with australia, which is, of course, part of asia pacific. australia is a primarily outbound market, and it's very much a cross-border international market because obviously, australia is very much in the kind of [inaudible] and so we're seeing a real rapid recovery in our australian demand business.
japan has historically been an inbound business and a lot of our demand in japan has come from other countries. that is starting to see some uptick, but that's going to take a little bit of time. china is primarily an outbound business. people go to china, but primarily, they travel in lead china and they go to other communities, especially around asia.
and what we see in southeast asia, primarily is these are absolutely inbound and outbound markets. they're very much cross-border. so i guess the high level is the vast majority of the markets in asia pacific are cross-border. a lot of the travel is intra-asia travel.
there's a fair amount of travel, though, where it's inside and outside of asia. and i'm very, very optimistic about the ability of our asia business to more than fully recover because what we've seen is the longer people can travel, the more pent-up demand there is. i don't think travel ever is going to go out of style. people are going to continue to travel.
and so i think that we're very, very optimistic that asia is going to follow the recovery curves of europe, north america, and latin america just on a little different time scale. and sorry, just to give you one step, just to give you a couple of steps on the first question, 87% of all available listings on airbnb except long-term stays. 52% of host offer a monthly discount, and these discounts are 85% of our long-term stays.

thank you. the next question comes from james lee with mizuho. please proceed.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. two here. just curious, is inflation having an impact on consumer behavior, maybe, for example, consumer trading down from hotels to home accommodation? and also, in terms of market share within home accommodation, as you see mix shift to urban markets, where you have strength in supply how that compared versus your peers who may be more nonurban focused?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. maybe why don't we do this, dave, why don't i answer a high level of the second question because i just wanted to share a point about our urban business. and then maybe you can go into the details about both the inflation, impact on consumer behavior, and kind of how we're comparing to our peers in urban markets. james, the thing i would just say about our business is i think that our business is uniquely resilient in a uniquely adaptable model.
and the reason our model is adaptable is because we're not just the u.s. business. we're not just a european business. we're a global business, and we're strong in europe, north america, asia, latin america, africa, we're global.
we're in 220 countries and regions, one of those global companies in the world. we're not just a vacation rental business, more vacation rental markets. so, our bread and butter is urban. crossborder was really how we got our start.
so, we're very much a urban, a rural, a vacation rental, and an off the grid. we even have homes totally off the grid. we have homes that are $20, $30 a night, and tens of thousands of dollars a night. so, we're really at all price points.
we had catered to families and individuals. so, we have nearly every type of home at every price point in every type of space and nearly every type of community around the world, and so i think that we've been able to be uniquely resilient. and the other thing i would just say about our urban market business is we're seeing record long-term stays. i'm doing this call, for example, from new york city and at airbnb, where i have for a month.
and we're seeing in new york city, for example, a huge uptick in long-term stays because a lot of people have to come here working remotely for months at a time. so that's just a little bit of how we think about it. but dave, i'll hand it over to you and go into a little bit more detail.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, we're just not seeing price appreciation impact our business negatively. we had our strongest quarter ever. we have even stronger demand for q3 and q4 than we've ever had.
and i think brian hit right on the head, because we have every type of home and every type of community, everything from budget, each shared homes to luxury homes, people can make a choice about what kind of property gets their particular budget and their needs. and so i think it's that strength of diversity of product that will continue to support our business going forward. and then i think you also hit on it, which is this mix shift to urban markets, which has traditionally been our strength at airbnb. when you compare it to others, who don't have the same amount of supply and capabilities built in those cities, it's going to give us kind of a further tailwind.
and really, what we're seeing right now is continued strength of the domestic business that was up 65% versus 2019, strength in our nonurban business that was up 80% versus 2019, q1 '19, and that remains incredibly strong. and now we're seeing the mix shift toward urban markets back toward 2019 and the cross-border back to 2019. and so i think that tailwind is going to continue to help our business going forward.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from jed kelly with oppenheimer. please proceed.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
great. great. thanks for taking my question. just thinking about on how higher interest rates in like a potential recession, how do you think that would impact your supply, and then just thinking about the top line for the back half of the year, with apac opening up and more cross-border, more urban, do you think revenue or, i guess, bookings will be driven more by volume or by adrs? thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. so why don't i take the first question about higher interest rates or recession's impact on supply, and dave can take the second question. jed, no way to know for sure on your question, but i'm pretty sure i have a sense of it, airbnb, we launched on august 11, 2008. and so you'll remember what the world was like in august 2008.
and we really got going january, february, march of 2009 in the depths of the great recession. and the reason that airbnb initially grew was that people were having trouble paying their rent, having trouble keeping their homes and people turned to airbnb to list their homes. and what we generally see is in recession, people change their behavior. and they change their behavior based on kind of price considerations.
and so we'll generally expect in a recession, if that were to happen, is that probably more people would turn to hosting. that will be number one. so that we would expect. and number two, travelers would probably become more budget-conscious and that would probably have a benefit to airbnb as well.
now the downside, of course, the recession is oftentimes fewer people travel. but again, i think we're a pretty resistant business, whether its economy is good or bad, we're a pretty adaptable model. so that's what i would expect on the supply side. that the more difficult the economy is, the more people are going to need supplemental income and a handful of them will turn to hosting.
dave, i'll hand it over to you.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. and just to double-click on that. i think in a recessionary environment, if people are more constrained on the dollars, they have to spend to travel, therefore will come back to airbnb because we're a better value in that travel. and going back to the earlier point, we have all types of price points, budget deluxe and consumers can figure out what meets their best budget needs.
and so i think it actually -- we are a better option than any other alternatives in recessionary environment. and then in terms of the back half of the year expectations, the revenue will be driven more by volume than adrs. we give our outlook on adrs for q2 of being flat year over year. they may moderate a little bit in the back half depending on mix.
but i think that the biggest driver of revenue may be outperforming current expectations would be maybe further strengthening of the european business or acceleration of that maybe normalization of cancellation rates across the globe could also be a tailwind. apac coming back more strongly, more quickly will certainly help the results. but i don't think it will be the major driver this year. north america and european travel is still just such the large percentage of our business at the moment.
apac will be super important over the long term, but less of an immediate driver here in 2022.

thank you. the next question comes from mark mahaney with evercore. please proceed.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. hey, brian, i want to applaud you, by the way, for your efforts with the ukraine. you came up with a creative and direct way for people to help out. so i applaud you for that.
and then i also want to give you some comfort in terms of your thoughts on innovation and age. i think most studies show that peak innovation occurs when people reach 50. so if you can just make it through the next 10 years, you'll be good. and then finally, just because you touched on most of the questions i thought about where have already been asked, but let's get back to experiences.
so it sounded like maybe your -- i know you got the core business, and that's what you're really focused on. but it sounds like you may start leaning in a little bit more to experiences. so just flesh that out a little bit. and i know relatively small versus the core opportunity now.
but at some point, i assume you're going to lean more aggressively into experiences, and i assume that there'll be host demand to do that, because there's probably a lot of win-wins all around that. so just talk about the timing of when you think you may want to lean more aggressively into experiences.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. well, thanks, mark. it's great to hear from you again. first of all, yes, i'm 40.
i hope i got a good 10 years in me, and i think i'm a pretty late bloomer, so maybe give me even more than 10 years. and so what do i want to do at that time? well, one of the things i want to do is experiences. i think that experiences is a massive, massive opportunity. when we started airbnb, homes took off.
and i remember saying at the time, mark, while will we monetize people's biggest asset already, which is their home, what do we do next? we go to the next largest asset. and it actually turns out your home is not your largest asset from a latency standpoint. i think it's your time for most people. your time ultimately can generate more revenue for the average person than their property can.
and so that's a bit of an insight of where experiences came. it also came from the fact that a lot of people look at me not just to save money, but to have a local travel experience. and i think experience is a great way to do that. and so i was expecting 2020 to be the breakout year for experiences, and we prepared for that.
and of course, the opposite happened, the pandemic occurred and we put the product on hold. in the last two years, when people aren't really comfortable leaving their house, they have to have mask on. it's not really been the right conditions to double down on experiences. but now the light is at the end of the tunnel of the pandemic, we think people's first trips won't be to meet strangers and go on experiences.
we think the first trips we want to have are to reunite with family, reunite with friends, get a big home together. and so, we think that this summer, though people will book experiences, i think the summer is still a little more about homes just because people are getting comfortable getting out of their house. that being said, i think this summer, you're going to start to see a ramp-up of experiences. and i think next year and beyond, it's going to be a massive opportunity, and i am incredibly excited about it.
and one of the reasons i'm so excited about it is that our guests actually from a customer satisfactory standpoint, like experience more than homes, they actually leave a significantly higher five-star rating as a percentage of the ratings for experiences at home, but people like homes. the retention is really good. so we think this is just scratching the surface. and so to answer your question definitively, we are going to be ramping up.
we're going to be getting more aggressive experiences. it will be a slower on-ramp in this year. but by next year, we're going to be going full throttle and i'm really excited about this opportunity. and it's a little hard.
i don't want to make too many predictions about how big it will become. but my general sense is it's kind of probably bigger than most of us imagined just because i think people are looking for interesting things to do with people. people are lonely. they want to meet one another.
they want to do activities. they can only go to so many restaurants. they can only watch so many shows on netflix and many physical communities are being digitized. and so people ultimately want to have real experience in the real world.
i think travel is a great way to do that. and the final thing i'd say, mark, is increasingly, people aren't just booking homes in paris. you go to paris, you can see the eiffel tower, you can go to louvre. but if you go to a small town in france, what do you do other than go to a restaurant, experience is a great way to do something interesting in nearly every community in the world, especially ones that don't have the eiffel tower.
so those are just some of the reasons why i'm incredibly bullish about this product, but it's going to take some time to really ramp up.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. thank you, brian.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from justin post with bank of america. please proceed.
justin post -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you. lot of my questions have been answered, but on the urban supply side, i imagine you had some churn on health issues and other factors. what are you seeing in urban markets? and could you see a big uptick there as demand comes back? how are you thinking about that? and then maybe one follow-up.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, dave, do you want to take this one?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. i think one of the key things to remember about our supply is that the vast majority of our hosts are individual hosts. and they don't get rid of their home and they're using their own home or maybe a second home to host. and so even in the midst of a pandemic or other kind of recessionary environment, they're not getting rid of their own home or their second home, which means that they're ready for hosts and they'll be there when the demand is coming back.
and that's what we're seeing now with our urban demand. so the urban demand is starting to come back. it's now back toward 2019 levels and our hosts are ready for them. and our growth in hosts in the urban markets has also increased.
so we're seeing an increase in our listings for both our high-density and urban markets overall. and that's where we kind of continue to see as the demand comes back, the supply is there to meet it.
justin post -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and then a follow-up on adrs. i think you're saying around flat year over year. can you just talk about the normal seasonality for adrs? why -- is it mix could that cause them to down? and how does it -- how do you think about the back half seasonality on adrs?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think if you could -- you know, again, we've been up 5% year over year in q1. it's going to be flat relative on a year-over-year basis in q2. you can kind of see a little bit of a decrease of seasonality for q3 and q4. you could maybe look at some of the seasonality back to '19, which will show you that q3 and q4 have moderately lower adrs, not substantially.
i think you could use that as a little bit of a guide. and then just know that the mix change is being offset a lot by strong price appreciation that is continuing to prop up the adr overall. so i think it is a bit of the unknown for exactly where adr is going to land in the back half of the year. what i can see is very clearly what's going to happen in q2, which will be flat year over year.
justin post -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from ron josey with citi. please proceed.
ron josey -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. i wanted to ask a little bit more about cross-border, just given the rebound that we saw this quarter and the rebound in fees, can you talk about the dynamics, maybe, brian, on whether these cross-borders mostly, call it, north america users going overseas? or are we seeing more emea users come into the u.s. or any sort of insights around there? and then, dave, on just overall ebitda understood more leverage and margin expansion in the first half.
but it's really impressive to see the continued, call it, leverage across most of your line items. can you just remind us ops and support in gross margin, what's driving that? thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, ron, i can just start. the cross-border is, i would say, north america, europe, australia, latin america, pretty much everywhere but asia and it's really going in all directions. so, people are coming into north america, people in north america are leaving.
they're absolutely going to europe. there's a lot of travel within europe, and we're now also seeing europeans come to the united states and go kind of in other locations as well. so, the great thing is the network effect is kind of moving in multiple directions, whereas, say, last year, it was much more domestic and kind of really limited, the corridors are really starting to open. so, dave, i'll let you take the rest of the answer.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. on the ebitda, i'm really pleased and proud of the work that we've done to improve our overall profitability. we made some really difficult choices in the midst of the pandemic to reduce our overall workforce and focus on the core of our business. we think that actually, that focus is enabling us to deliver even more.
like i think we've actually delivered more innovation and productivity as a company by being very deliberate and focused in a more narrow area versus trying to do everything all at once, and that's been really effective with us. we actually have 16% fewer people at the end of q1 '22 than we did at the end of q1 2020 before we had our layoffs. and yet we think we're being more productive than ever before. and then we're getting nice -- so on top of that fixed cost leverage, yes, we're gaining nice improvement in our variable costs and our ops and support, it was 15% of revenue here in the first quarter and seeing nice improvement versus our ops and support in the prior quarters, right? ops and support will include largely our community support operations and our trust and safety activities.
those are the elements that are within ops and support. we're going to continue to invest in those areas because we think those are differentiators for us and then doing those really well. supports our individual host community, but we're making nice strides and improvement in leverage so that we gain continued profitability. and one of the things we noted in the letter is that we're expecting for the full year a modest expansion in our overall ebitda margin rate.
so that's nice to see versus 2021. and i'm really excited that in 2022, we'll have our first full year of net income profitability. so just on a full net income basis, to be profitable this year feels excellent.
ron josey -- citi -- analyst
that's great. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from lee horowitz with deutsche bank. please proceed.
lee horowitz -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. two, if i could. high level, demand across the alternative accommodations industry has proved incredibly sticky through the front half of this recovery and your comments suggest even into the back half.
so what do you kind of owe the stickiness in consumer patterns in terms of the way that they travel even as things open up and hotels perhaps gain a bit of share? and then maybe a bit on cost as well, wage inflation and the inability to kind of find talent has been cropping up across a lot of the names that we cover. you guys haven't necessarily commented too much here, but how is it all are you seeing wage inflation potentially place in the model as we move through 2022. thanks so much.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. dave, do you want to take this? sorry, i'm sorry. i'm sorry, can i -- actually, can i ask a clarifying -- i don't quite understand the first question. can you ask it again?
lee horowitz -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes, in terms of the --
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
can you clarify the first question?
lee horowitz -- deutsche bank -- analyst
my first question is -- the industry -- yes, for alternative combinations has proven incredibly sticky despite reopening more coming online, those sorts of things. i guess, to what do you owe this kind of stickiness in consumer travel patterns?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
why is it sticky? so sorry, i just want to make sure i understand. are you saying why like it was obvious why people were booking homes last year because people weren't traveling for business? they weren't going to urban markets. they weren't crossing borders, they were staying nearby, you're asking why when the markets reopening that --
lee horowitz -- deutsche bank -- analyst
they were traveling --
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
why they're still sticky. ok. got it. yes.
ok. i got it. and then let me do that, and then dave, you can take the second question. so -- and i think it's important to just note lee, that like we were growing really fast before the pandemic.
and the reason we're growing fast is, number one, i think a lot of people want to have a local experience as they travel. number two, they want to save money when they travel. number three, airbnb allows them to travel with groups, and increasingly people are traveling in groups. number four, airbnb allows them to travel and stay nearly every community in the world, hotels, or in limited markets around the world; and number five, the longer you're away from home, the more you want to be in a home and length of stay is going up.
so, i think all those reasons explain the stickiness. maybe said another way, here's another way of saying it. rural demand increased during the pandemic and people are still traveling to rural areas. people are still traveling domestically, which was a very popular demand use case during the pandemic.
people don't have to go back to the office five days a week. so, people are still booking weekly stays and monthly stays. so again, domestic, nonurban, and longer stays were three use cases that weren't really our original bread and butter. our original bread and butter was urban cross-border short term.
but these three trends are sustaining. they're still sustaining. and the reason why is, i think, the genie's out of the bottle, people have permanent flexibility and people now realize there's a lot of great places to go beyond the top 100 tourist destinations. that being said, what we're seeing is a recovery of cross-border in urban.
it's actually both above 2019 levels. so, in short, the old ways of -- the bread and butter of airbnb, cross-border urban are back and the new use cases or the use cases that were accelerated a pandemic are here to stay. and the combination of those two things is why i think this business is so sticky. maybe a more fundamental way of saying it is people love the experience they have.
and so, when people left them, they tend to do more of it. dave, i'll hand over to you.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
you know, in terms of wage inflation, we did $1.5 billion of revenue in q1 with just 6,200 people. and we don't need -- as i said, we actually have 16% fewer people than we did in q1 of 2020. we don't need to add incremental people to have this business grow dramatically. we're significantly larger today as a business with significantly fewer people.
so really, wage inflation is not a major driver of costs. we are investing in our employees in order to enable them to live anywhere, move anywhere within the country. if they move someplace else, we're not going to alter their pay for being in a different part of the country. and we're going to support them to work 90 days in other countries around the world.
so we think that kind of investment will benefit us by having lower attrition and being able to attract the best talent in the world. so we think that's going to be a great investment for the future to have the best talent to unlock all the innovation that brian has talked about on the call today.
lee horowitz -- deutsche bank -- analyst

good afternoon, and thank you for joining airbnb's earnings conference call for the first quarter of 2022. as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the investor relations section of airbnb's website following this call. i will now hand the call over to ellie mertz, vp of finance. please go ahead.
ellie mertz -- vice president of finance
good afternoon, and welcome to airbnb's first quarter of 2022 earnings call. thank you for joining us today. on the call today, we have airbnb's co-founder and ceo, brian chesky; and our chief financial officer, dave stephenson. earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our first quarter of 2022.
these items were also posted on the investor relations section of airbnb's website. during the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on q&a. before i turn it over to brian, i would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.
these factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the securities and exchange commission. we urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. you should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. also, during this call, we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures.
we provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our investor relations website. these non-gaap measures are not intended to be a substitute for our gaap results. and with that, i will pass the call to brian. 
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. thank you very much, ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. thanks for joining. i'm excited to share our q1 results with you.
now despite the pandemic, the war in ukraine, and macroeconomic headwinds, q1 was another incredible quarter. we exceeded 100 million nights and experiences booked for the first time ever. gbv was $17 billion, which was 73% above q1 2019. revenue was $1.5 billion, exceeding q1 2019 by 80%.
net loss was $19 million. now, this is a significant improvement in the same periods in 2018 and 2021. adjusted ebitda was $229 million. now, this is our first positive adjusted ebitda in q1, and this represented adjusted ebitda margin of a positive 15%.
now, this is compared to a negative 7% a year ago and a negative 30% in q1 2019. and finally, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. this was also an all-time high. and what these results show is that two years into the pandemic, airbnb is stronger than ever before.
now, why is this? well, millions of people are now more flexible about where they live and they work. and as a result, they're spreading out to thousands of towns and cities, and they're staying for weeks, months, or even entire seasons at a time. now through our adaptability innovation, we've been able to quickly respond to this changing role to travel, and these incredible results were driven by a number of positive business trends. first, guests are booking more than ever before.
in q1, gross nights booked grew 32% compared to q1 2019. and this is despite the pandemic, the war in ukraine, and macroeconomic headwinds. and people are also more confident booking travel further in advance, and we're seeing strong demand for summer bookings and beyond. second, guests are returning to cities and they're crossing borders.
so our guests continue to travel domestically and continue to go to rural destinations at airbnb, we are also seeing guests return to cities and cross borders at or even above pre-pandemic rates. third, guests are also staying longer, even living on airbnb. now while short-term stays rebounded strongly in q1 2022, stays of a month or longer continue to be our fastest-growing category by tripling compared to 2019. in nearly half of our nights booked in q1 were for stays of a week or longer in 1 in 5 nights booked were for stays of a month or longer.
so the world is clearly becoming more flexible about where people can work. and getting ahead of this trend, last week, we announced that airbnb employees can live and work anywhere, and we've designed a way for them to live and work around the world while collaborating in a highly collaborative way and experiencing the in-person connection that makes airbnb special. now fourth, our innovations are inspiring guests to discover thousands of new places. in 2021, we delivered more than 150 upgrades across every aspect of our service.
and among these upgrades was the innovative i'm flexible feature. now the i'm flexible feature has now been used more than 2 billion times, 2 billion. and guests who use i'm flexible are more likely to book homes in less popular locations. this is really important because this allows us to point demand to where we have supply and it helps distribute guests more widely in communities all around the world.
but we're not stopping there. on may 11, next wednesday, we will be announcing the airbnb 2022 summer release. this is a new airbnb for a new world of travel. with a completely new way to search, guests will be able to discover millions of unique homes in airbnb, they never thought to search for.
and when they book, guests will have the confidence knowing that airbnb has their back each step of the way. and so, you can watch this announcement right on our home page, next wednesday at 9:00 a.m. eastern standard time, 9:00 a.m. eastern standard time, next wednesday, right on our home page.
i hope you can tune in because i'm really excited about what we have to share. and then finally, our community -- our host community continues to expand. we see destinations the strongest demand, showing this most supply growth with nonurban active listings actually growing 15% globally. and we're also showing an increase in total urban supply as demand returns to cities.
and we believe that the upgrades we announced last year, including our new host onboarding flow and aircover, are supporting this growth and enabling success for a new host. so, to recap. we had our best q1 ever. nights and experiences booked and gbv were a highest ever.
revenue and adjusted ebitda were records for q1, and we generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. with these results, airbnb is stronger than ever before. now before i go to questions, i just want to talk for a minute about our efforts in ukraine. because over the past few months, millions of lives have been devastated by the war.
and when the crisis broke out, we knew that our platform can help refugees fleeing the crisis. and within four days of the invasion ukraine, we announced that airbnb.org would provide free housing for up to 100,000 refugees fleeing from ukraine. and over 30,000 hosts have already signed up to open their homes to refugees for free or for a discount. but then something even more remarkable happened, people started booking homes for hosting ukraine.
hosts, they never intend to stay with, just to provide relief aid. and soon, more than 170,000 people joined in, and they booked approximately 600,000 nights booked in ukraine. and because we waived our fees, $20 million were directly to host in ukraine. and i think this speaks to the power of our community.
and they are a reminder that in the world of darkness and in a world of destruction, kindness still exist. and so i'm really proud of our business results this quarter. i'm also proud of how helpful we've been able to be to thousands of people in need. and with all of that, dave and i look forward to answer your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question is from lloyd walmsley with ubs. your line is open.
lloyd walmsley -- ubs -- analyst
thanks a lot. two questions, if i can. first, just it looks like room nights and experiences booked grew a little bit sequentially less in 2q this year than it did in '19. and similarly, the guidance looks like it's calling for a little bit slower sequential growth.
just wondering if there's anything you'd call out that's behind that? and then secondly, can you give us an update on what you're seeing around just how people are using the platform post some of the new search and discovery innovations this summer? are you seeing demand move into a wider dispersion of areas or any changes in conversion rates? what are early learnings from some of those innovations this past summer? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you very much. dave, why don't you take the first question about q2, q3 growth, and i can talk a little bit about how the launch from airbnb categories have affected how people use airbnb.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. so our q2 gross nights before the cancellations, they came in actually above our internal expectations. we did see some elevated cancellations in the back of the quarter relative to our forecast. we believe that some of the elevated cancellations related to flight cancellations around the world, but it was mostly in north america toward the end of q2 '22.
and we're just seeing strong overall nights in growth the 25% year-over-year growth in nights and experiences, we feel very confident in. and the same -- having the same results for q3, we also feel quite good about. we're just seeing strong demand for guest travel all around the world.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and just to answer the second question, just to give a little bit of background, for decades, travel search has worked the same way. there's a box, a search box, and you are asked to enter a location. and the problem with that is that airbnb is in 100,000 locations all over the world. and so people can't think to type in 100,000 destinations into a search box.
and so people miss millions of unique airbnbs they would have never known to search for. and the reason this is important, as you asked is because we think that category categories can allow us to point demand to where we have supply. this, i think, is one of the really big opportunities. so as i said, since release, listings in every categories have been viewed over 180 million times.
we've also seen that guests are now showing more flexibility with their dates and their destination than before. so for example, a typical search properties are 30 miles further apart than they would have been before. so we are seeing search radiuses increase. and additionally, we are seeing more people continue to use the flexible date feature.
so we believe our theory is working. airbnb categories allows us to highlight what makes us unique. it allows us to point the main supply. and i also think it helps us be in the inspiration business where people going to start to travel on airbnb.
lloyd walmsley -- ubs -- analyst
ok. thank you.

our next question is from mario lu with barclays. your line is open.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. so the first one is on new initiatives. so we look at the third quarter guidance, it seems like bookings is expected to contract by more than 10 points in 3q versus 2019 versus the second quarter.
so does that change the timing or focus on these other new initiatives such as experiences? or are more resources now being focused back on the core business?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
no. i mean we have a very consistent strategy. and our strategy is, number one, we want to unlock the next generation of hosts. we have 4 million hosts on airbnb, and i think that millions more can turn to hosting, especially during these economic times.
so that, i think, is really priority no. 1. as we add more hosts, we continue to grow. we want airbnb to be the ultimate host to our guests and host.
that's why we offered aircover continue to provide better service all over the world on continue to up level. and guests aren't just traveling airbnb, they're now living on airbnb. and so we want to continue to offer more opportunities for them to travel and live on airbnb. so we are still focused on our core business.
that is the priority for us. we are also continuing to invest in long-term stays and other initiatives and most importantly, providing an incredible service that people love. and i would also just say, again, we're feeling really, really solid and good about q3. so dave, if you want to add.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. i'll double-check brian's comment. yes, i mean, we do really feel good about stable bookings in q3. i mean, in particular, given we have long lead times that we're seeing, we're seeing some pull forward for summer travel here in q2 and just the broader economic conditions overall.
we are -- if you look at our gross booking value growth versus 2019, q1 was 73%, q2, 73%. we're just seeing strong gross booking value growth relative to 2019. and to see further kind of quarter-over-quarter acceleration, we just need to see continued recovery in europe and apac, which remains significantly depressed.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. and just a follow-up, speaking of apac. you guys mentioned that the domestic business is trending down in china, which i believe you guys said was around 1% of your business. is there any other color you can provide in terms of the p&l impact from shutting that down? and any color on how large the outbound bookings for china is?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean the china business has been a small part of business overall. i mean, it's had less than a 1% impact on our revenue. one of the things that has been important in us getting out of the domestic business in china is maintaining a focus on what we think is the most valuable and important part of china, which is the outbound business.
so really, what we've done is we've shifted all of the resources that we're applying and splitting between both domestic and outbound travel. we focused all that on outbound, which we think is the greater prize and the most important part for the long term. so until china has their covid policy kind of in place in allowing people to kind of travel outbound from china, it will kind of remain to be depressed. but as that evolves and chinese travelers travel again, we think that will be a nice unlock for our asia pacific business.
it's not going to have a material impact on our p&l.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks, dave.

our next question is from bernie mcternan with needham and company. your line is open.
bernie mcternan -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. adrs are hanging in there better than feared, i believe, still expecting them to be up year over year. can you just talk to some of the puts and takes, demand-driven pricing versus mix shift?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. if you kind of rewind to what we've seen with adrs back at the beginning of the pandemic, all of the increase was driven by mix, right? this initial resurgence of the travel for north america, whole home, nonurban. and then over time, we've seen mix become less and less a part of the increase in the adr. here in both q1 and q2, while we've seen is that adrs were up 40% year over -- three years back to 2019.
and about two-thirds of that increase has been price appreciation and about a third due to mix. and so we do anticipate that over time, as more people return to travel to urban more cross border, adrs may moderate. but yes, as you see, two-thirds of that has actually been price appreciation. so it's been stickier than we anticipated maybe six months ago.
bernie mcternan -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. and then the dip in may and june from the earlier booking windows and then reacceleration in july, is that reacceleration for near-term bookings in terms of late summer? or is that kind of early bookings for the fall and winter period?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
well, it's a bit of both. i mean, really, we have on the books for q4 of this year, we have more nights on the books in q4 than relative to the same kind of period a year ago. it's very strong. we're seeing really strong demand in the back half of the year.
so we're seeing a bit of both.
bernie mcternan -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. thank you.

our next question is from justin patterson with keybanc capital markets. your line is open.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you. two, if i can. brian, when you look at host right now and just the friction to onboarding, what are you looking to really solve at this upcoming release? and then secondly, perhaps for both you and dave, you've clearly shown a lot of margin progress, free cash flow progress over the next few years.
how should we think about just the puts and takes between overall growth and showing more margin, more free cash flow generation ahead?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and just to confirm, you're talking about with this upcoming release, right, this winter?
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yes. well, i mean it can be a little broader in there of just where the friction point on onboarding is?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. so that's a great question. let me -- why don't i answer the first question and then, dave, you can talk about margin improvement and then i can potentially elaborate on that answer as well. we have -- as we said, we have 4 million host on airbnb, but we think there are millions more people that could turn to hosting.
i mean, honestly, hosting is one of the easiest ways to be able to make money with an asset that you already have for most people that only have a start-up cost and the majority of people get a booking within the first week. and so -- there are a number of things that we're going to be doing this fall -- this winter and beyond. but one of the most important things we want to do is continue to make it easier to host. and one of the high -- things i want to highlight that we launched last year was ask a super host.
ask a super host pairs our very best super host with prospective host. and this is really cool because basically, what it does is it allows our community to help train new community members, new host to come on the platform. that's made a big difference. and we're going to continue to double down on that product.
we're going to -- but we're looking at some other opportunities to continue to reduce friction. so you're going to see some really cool products to just continue to make it even easier to host. and so that's probably the primary thing that we're going to be focused on this fall. we're also looking at some additional protections for host and just ways to really try to get everyday people with their primary homes that want to host occasionally to host on airbnb.
a lot of people don't realize that the number -- the top professions for a host in the united states, for example, are school teachers, they're healthcare workers, their students, these are the top three kind of professions and locations in airbnb. and so what we really think the big opportunity is to continue to attract regular people to become host. and we think one of the biggest sources of new host are prior guests on airbnb, 36% of new host last quarter were prior guests. so this is where we're going to be focused on.
it's a really big opportunity for us. and i think, again, airbnb was founded during a recession in 2008, financial crisis. people were worried about being able to pay their bills, pay for their homes and their income. and so they turn to hosting.
and we think a lot of people may turn to hosting once again. so this is a big opportunity for us. dave, if you want to talk about the margin improvement?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks. we're really proud of the progress we made to reduce our fixed costs and make improvements in our variable costs. we've really exercised discipline on our spending here in 2022, and we're going to continue to do so.
but while we're thrilled with this margin expansion, we're heavily in growth mode. we are not in profit maximization mode. we really want to balance profitability with growth. we -- one of the things we're very proud in q2 is that we are showing both growth and profitability at scale.
but we'll continue to invest in growth. we're going to prioritize things. we'll grow the business over the long haul.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question is from doug anmuth with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
doug anmuth -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. just hoping you can talk a little bit about just kind of macro environment, just what you're seeing in terms of consumer activity or types of trips being booked? and also just to get your view on long-term stays. i think you talked about 25% growth year over year, but just the trends there going forward. thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. well, if you start the macro environment, again, we are very pleased with our results despite any kind of macroeconomic. we're seeing strong demand here in q3. and as i said, the q2 nights experiences grew 25% year over year, seeing a similar growth for q3 and our demand in q4 reservations is really strong, as i mentioned kind of earlier.
what we've seen so far is north america and europe have been our strengths. we're seeing -- but we are seeing an uptick in more cross-border and more urban. so those are historic strength areas for us, and we're starting to see those parts of the businesses come back. but ultimately, if you just kind of step back, you just see the resilience of our business overall, right, that because we have so much different kinds of supply in so many places around the world, we have any kind of place for anyone that wants to travel.
and there's just so much pent-up demand for travel and just so much demand for travel in general, that people would like to spend money on the experience of travel and getting out of their home more than on things that we're just continuing to see that great strength in our business. and then in terms of long-term stays, it continues to be the fastest-growing business by tripling. so if you look at nights of 28 days or longer, that part of the business is growing faster since 2019 than any other segment stays. and actually, if you kind of subsegment it, nearly 50% of our nights are of seven days or longer.
and which i think, again, you start to stay any place seven days or more in airbnb is the best way to kind of experience that stay. so the long-term state trend continues to be very solid, growing faster than any other part of the business.
doug anmuth -- j.p. morgan -- analyst

the next question is from nick jones with jmp securities. your line is open.
nick jones -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. two -- i guess, first, can you just kind of give us an update on the i'm flexible option and how that's kind of playing out and what kind of experiences you're able to provide in those markets that maybe are less dense? and then a follow-up.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah. so, nick, i'm flexible, essentially with the product that we launched last year it really has two components. there's flexible dates to allow people to say, i'm flex about when to travel, and we can say, i'm really interesting traveling anywhere for a week and a week or a month anytime in the next year.
and we also had i'm flexible destinations. we rebuilt i'm flexible destination from ground up, and that became airbnb categories. so that's the product that has been used or people have seen, listings that have been featured in the airbnb categories over 180 million times since may 11th. this has definitely been like a huge boon for us.
and what we're seeing is that people are, in fact, discovering homes they would have never otherwise seen their books. we're seeing the search radius widen by, i think, it was 30 miles to what i said before. the other thing we're seeing is that people are continuing to be more flexible about their dates. so more and more people are using the i'm flexible dates feature as well.
and so we're really excited about this. i think this is a really big thing that we're going to be focusing on, and we're going to continue to be investing in this product because i think this is a bit of a paradigm shift for how people will travel. not everyone is going to be flexible about how they travel. but for anyone that's not traveling for business or not visiting family, if you were doing leisure travel, almost by definition, you probably have some flexibility.
and as fewer and fewer people are going to be required to go into office five days a week, i think this option is going to be more and more important. and our business model works uniquely for this because we have a lot of unique inventory. so it has been used quite a lot, and hopefully, that answers your question.
nick jones -- jmp securities -- analyst
yeah. and then, i guess a follow-up is in some of the areas that are outside of urban areas, less dense, less i guess, arguably activities. how are you thinking about adding more optionality to make these types of experiences more engaging for the guests?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
sorry. can you elaborate outside of urban areas or so i'm trying --
nick jones -- jmp securities -- analyst
so like if you're in a rural area and there's less activities, arguably because there's less population, how are you adding -- looking to add more experiences for those guests in those regions?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
oh, i see. yeah. well, it's a great question. so number one, airbnb categories and the new products we're doing are great ways to highlight really interesting home and communities who never know existed, right? we have like these incredible barns and farm stays and capsules and treehouses.
and many of these are in towns you've probably never even heard of, most of them. but there's another good question, if you go to paris, you have the eiffel tower. but if you go to a rural area in upstate new york or in california or some other place, what do you do when you're there? and we do think airbnb experiences are great. obviously, for like places that are not iconic tourism destination.
so that's why we're continuing to invest in that product and people really love airbnb experiences. they actually have a higher five-star rating even than home. so i think this is a great opportunity for rural destinations, and we have a lot of really popular experiences. so like if you go on a farm, you can do a farm stay and then you can have interesting experiences on that farm.
so that's just one example. we have really popular experiences, for example, in tuscany. you can make pasta with a nearly nine-year-old grandmother who's been making pasta the same way for more than half a century. so these are experiences you would have never been able to find, and we're really excited about that.
nick jones -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yep.
operator
the next question is from james lee with mizuho. your line is open.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. and maybe as we look into fy '23, obviously, we have a lot of economic uncertainties here. is the economy in the slowdown and consumers start to trade down, how do you think that impacts the airbnb business? and also on the other hand, if you look at expenses, the demand slow down, is there anything in your cost structure you could optimize to offset any potential headwinds? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave, do you want to take that?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. i think we've highlighted this a bit on the call that you don't know what the economy is going to bring, but we do know that airbnb is resilient to almost any kind of economic shock. as brian mentioned, we're founded in recession, and we've obviously thrived in the era of covid to spike covid. and what we're just finding is that people can come to airbnb because we have any kind of property, whether it's a small shared room or a private room to luxury stays, we have something for anyone depending on their travel needs.
and we likely saw on covid, if they can't cross borders, they're going to stay domestically. they get in the car and they go down the road if domestic air travel gets too expensive, they -- again, they can stay domestically, and they can basically within their budget, find the perfect place for them because we have such a diversity of types of offerings for them. so i think that is one of the things that just gives us this great resilience. and then in terms of expenses, if the business slows down, i mean, again, we've already made the hard choices.
in 2020, we substantially reduced our fixed costs. we eliminated a number of positions. we moved from being divisional to functional. so we are a leaner, tighter machine, and we will remain that way.
we're going to continue to grow. we're growing headcount maybe high single-digit percentage rates, but that is going to be able to support us for the very long term, and we're going to remain very focused and disciplined in our investments. so i feel really good about the position that we're in with our investment model.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
operator
the next question is from brian fitzgerald with wells fargo. your line is open.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, guys. we wanted to ask about the recovery of supply that you continue to see, maybe particularly in urban areas. are you seeing hosts who had come off the platform now coming back, wondering how you're making these hosts aware of the increased urban demand and helping to reactivate them? and any color there on that, maybe latent supply capacity, if you could, that would be awesome.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave, do you want to take this?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. a couple of notes on the supply growth. we just continue to see strong supply growth. i think since 2019, our nights and experiences booked, they grew 24% and our active listings have grown 23%.
and we have over 6 million active listings now even taking down the domestic listings in china. so as you mentioned on the urban side, the active listings -- well, i'll start with the nonurban and nonurban increased 7% quarter over quarter and 16% from q2 '21. and then in north america, they've increased 23%. but then to your specific question, yes, as demand returns to cities, we're seeing a return to growth in the total urban supply and exactly right.
the people that have properties, they come back on to airbnb and are ready to host again. i mean if you kind of step back and think about it, because the vast majority of our hosts, our individual host, and then, therefore, the vast majority of their listings are either their primary home or maybe a secondary home, they don't get rid of those in a recessionary environment and other things. i mean it's not like a professional host, which may be looking at the pure return on investment opportunity to the property at a particular point in time. and so with those individual houses, when the demand comes back, they come back on to airbnb and the listings are there.
so it's precisely what we're seeing. when the demand comes back, the supply is right there ready for them to stay.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
awesome. thanks, dave. appreciate it.

the next question is from mark mahaney with evercore isi.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. i think i'll ask two questions. just talk about the china outbound market and how you tap into that, how material that's been for you to date? and then on experiences, i know that's in that list of -- a long list of things that you've been working on in terms of product innovations. it seems like it was less -- it's been less of a priority, but is there anything that suggested it's rising a little bit in your list of priorities and that you want to lean into it more aggressively in '23? thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. dave, why don't you take china, i can expand on the answer and i'll take experiences.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean we're very bullish on china over the longer term. i mean it's obviously been significantly impacted due to covid. people are not traveling out on.
i mean that's actually right how we started the business is seeing great outbound travel from china all around the world. and then -- and that is still the prize for us to kind of continue to focus on. so right now, apac is still significantly depressed. i mean if you look at our overall nights growth, as we said, it's 25% up from q2 of 2019.
but if you exclude apac, it's actually up 35%. so you can see what kind of a drag that has. and i think the acceleration -- further acceleration of the business from where we're at today will be benefited by having trying to outbound come back and resurrecting our apac business.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. i would just add to that, that we have absolutely seen in every other geography in the world that there is pent-up demand. in north america, there was pent-up demand. in europe, there was pent-up demand.
we expect there will probably be a lot of pent-up demand for travel from china outbound and more broadly in apac. and so how we've been preparing? well, number one, a way to prepare for the china outbound business to make sure we have really great supply in the quarters where people in china are traveling to. this includes like japan and korea, southeast asia, and beyond. the next thing is just making sure that once people are ready to travel, our product is continuing to be updated, and we have the marketing campaign ready to go.
so it's a pretty simple strategy. the great thing is we don't have to make a lot of changes. we think our product as it is, is going to be great once the china outbound rebounds, and we think it will. we expect everything to suggest it will just like every other market.
so we're pretty excited about that. and i think that in the coming years, this will actually be a pretty important part of our apac business. now with regards to experiences, yes, i mean, mark, let me just give a little bit of context. 2018, 2019 experiences is going along pretty well, and we expected that 2020 was going to be a breakout year for experiences.
and i was going to -- we were going to focus quite a lot of energy on it. and then, of course, the opposite happened. there was a pandemic. we had to pause the business, people were not comfortable gathering in person level on meeting strangers.
and so during the depths of the pandemic, we got focused back on our core business. we got back to basics. and i think that explains a lot of the business transformation we experienced, especially now we've generated nearly [inaudible] of free cash flow. that being said, we remain incredibly bullish about the long-term potential of experiences.
the average five-star rating for experiences, as i mentioned, is higher than the average five-star even for homes. and we just think people need to know more about this product. it needs to be continually integrated into the search flow, and we need to continue to market it. so the answer to your question, yes, experiences will become once again a rising priority and we are making quite a few investments in the product to continue to highlight experiences.
and i think it's going to be a big part of our story in 2023 and beyond over really the next five years. so i'm really excited about them.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst

our next question is from john colantuoni with jefferies. your line is open.
john colantuoni -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. so last quarter, you mentioned an expectation for marketing as a percentage of revenue to remain relatively flat compared to 2021. and maybe -- is it possible for you to update us on whether or not that's still your expectation following marketing in the first half coming in a few hundred basis points below last year? and i have a follow-up.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. the short answer is we anticipate marketing as a percentage of revenue in 2022 will be consistent with 2021. so a very modest increase in the back half of the year.
john colantuoni -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. and second question on take rate. it looks like outlook for the third quarter implies a take rate that's better than what we were expecting and up a decent chunk versus the same quarter in 2019.
any chance you can give us some detail about the puts and takes driving that take rate? thanks.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. the underlying kind of if you shifted take rate is unchanged. so any of the variation in take rate is just a timing difference between revenue stays versus timing of bookings.
john colantuoni -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question is from stephen ju with credit suisse. your line is open.
stephen ju -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you. so, brian, i think you yourself signed up to be a digital nomad and joined your employees who could not, i guess, work from anywhere. so -- is there anything you can share in terms of what you're seeing from the organization overall regarding pickups or declines in productivity or your ability to innovate? and dave, at the time of the ipo, i think you guys had disclosed that the different cohorts of guests were displaying pretty similar revenue retention as they age. but as we enter the pandemic, you probably had a pretty good influx of new users who signed up to experience airbnb for the first time ever.
so is there anything you can share in terms of the behavior of the 2020 and the '21 cohorts relative to what you have seen for the folks who are arguably the earlier adopters? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. so why don't i take the first question on really remote work. so in april, we announced that airbnb employees can live and work anywhere. and why do we do this? well, there are a couple of reasons.
number one, we have the most productive two years in our company history. and those two years were two years when we rebuilt the company from a ground up, fixed our cost base, accelerated growth. and all of this was done on zoom. and so it's very clear to me that like the most productive we have ever been is on zoom.
and so i thought there was no question that we can maintain that productivity. additionally, i think a really good way to predict the future is to look at what young companies do, right? 20 years ago, young companies had open floor plans and they had a lot of perks on-site, and that became the dominant way that people worked in offices around the world. if you look at a lot of young companies today, they have a lot of flexibility. they're embracing remote work.
and so i think this is a really good leading indicator of what the office space -- office players office environment of the future will look like in the next 10 years. now that being said, we do think in-person interaction is really important. but i don't think that requires you to have to come to an office three days of the week. so the guide that we've given is we like to gather employees at least 1 week quarter.
so rather than kind of coming in every week, we want more meaningful, less frequent interactions and gathering. and otherwise, we think zoom is really, really efficient for productivity. and the other thing i'll just say is i know a lot of ceos are kind of nervous about productivity if their employees aren't in an office. but we have a pretty unique way we run the company.
we view these two releases every year, and it's a really great mechanism for accountability. so you can see the productivity of everyone in the organization because all the work is kind of coming together twice a year to make these really big leads in the organization. so it's actually, in a sense, kind of easier to track productivity when everything is really online. and so that's something that we're really embracing.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
great. and then relative to cohorts, what we're starting to see is we believe, to start with, that we have some of the highest guest retention rates in travel. we still sit at our ipo, and we still believe that to be true and our booking frequency remains quite strong. it's getting closer to 2019 levels.
and as we manage -- look at the cohorts, really what we're seeing in 2020 and 2021, the new guest cohorts, they've been actually very retentive, even maybe more so than kind of historical levels likely due to some self-selection. new guests who joined in the years of pandemic are willing to kind of travel now or probably more inclined to kind of travel than others. and then in terms of rebooking rates of past guests, we've seen nice improving rates in those trends here in 2022, above kind of 2021 levels, but maybe still a bit below 2019, again, just given the nature of self-selection of who's willing to kind of travel at this time.
stephen ju -- credit suisse -- analyst

the next question is from kevin kopelman with cowen. your line is open.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks. can you give us a sense of what listings growth looks like at ex the china shutdown? and then qualitatively, if you could talk about the key drivers and trends you're seeing there and listings.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave, do you want to take that?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah. i mean in terms of the growth, what we've stated is that we're still well above 6 million active listings, even excluding the takedown of the china domestic. so -- and as we kind of mentioned in our results, we're seeing strong listings growth, specifically in the areas where we have the strongest kind of bookings.
so.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
did you give the number of china listings?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
we have not specifically mentioned the china listings now.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. thanks. and then just a quick follow-up on -- so on the q2 guide, you talked about slowing later in the quarter, but you were still pretty much on your -- where you had guided for nights. is it safe to assume for the third quarter, you're also assuming some slowdown in the remainder of the quarter?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
well, if anything, what we're seeing is acceleration in the business here in july and actually kind of a very stable overall nights booked growth for the quarter on nights and experiences booked i mean, obviously, then for our revenue has a modest -- has a decel on a year-over-year basis, but actually will be up from kind of year over three years.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
the next question is from brian nowak with morgan stanley. your line is open.
brian nowak -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i have two. the first one, just any update on the number of i'm flexible queries or sort of how big that's gotten? i know it's a number that you all were disclosing for a couple of quarters. and then secondly, there remains to be an ongoing debate about how much of the shift toward airbnb on term accommodations was sort of covid and now you're going to have a mean reversion back to our hotels. what are two or three of the kpis that you look at that sort of give you confidence that your addressable market of users of the host, everything has really expanded.
like what are you seeing in the internal kpis that you watch now in july and august that give you confidence that store going to have outsized market share growth into '23. dave, do you want take?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean we're continuing to see just really strong growth in our new guests. obviously, looking at kind of new gas or new guest retention, which is one of the questions just had, which remains quite strong with people coming back on. we're continuing to see just overall utilization of airbnb versus hotels.
we didn't ever dip as much as hotels did, and we introduced airbnb to millions of new customers. and we see the new use cases. i mean, we've highlighted things like our long-term stays and the use cases where people aren't going to want to be at a hotel for more than seven days. and so the portion of our business, nearly 50% that are over seven days is really helpful in that regard and over 28 days, it's nearly a fifth of our business.
so we look at just the destinations that people are able to kind of travel. so the robustness of historically have been cross-border in urban. and now what we've seen is great growth in suburban and nonurban and some of the distribution of the nights around the world. i think that is also giving us great confidence in the growth of our business overall because.
we don't just tap out if we were only say, a vacation rental destination-type company, you can tap out in either supply and even demand in those kind of areas. but that's really -- we have such a diversity of supply around the world that we're able to continue to grow quite well.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. maybe i'll just -- brian, maybe i'll add a little bit of context. it's good to remember that before the pandemic, our bread and butter was cross-border and urban. right? that was our bread and butter, it was cross-border travel and urban travel.
and of course, when the pandemic occurred, that got primarily shut off and yet our business recovered because people were using differently. i think that really the key important thing here is that our model is obviously incredibly adaptable. we are in nearly every community in the world. we have nearly every type of space and nearly every type price point.
and i think that's the reason that airbnb people would use airbnb will continue to endure. people are looking for value. they want to feel like they live at the local. as more and more people have flexibility and trick length and continues to increase, nearly half of our business is a week or longer as prohibitive probably to stay in hotels.
so there's a lot of new use cases that we think are here to stay. so the thing i'm pretty excited about is that a lot of the older use cases cross-border and urban are coming back.
brian nowak -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from naved khan with truist securities. your line is open.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks. i'm really surprised by the continued strength in north america and in the u.s. i think you talked about a 37% growth in nights and experiences versus emea, maybe up 25%.
is it just that emea continues to lag? or just from everything that we've been having, it seems like emea saw like a burst of demand in the second quarter. so just trying to reconcile that.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean emea is still lagging behind the acceleration that we've seen in north america. we think that, that is actually one of the opportunities for future acceleration of the business. i mean clearly, things like the impact of the war in ukraine certainly has had an impact.
and there's obviously the economic impact of even just foreign exchange rates, lower euro and british pound relative to the u.s. dollar. so there are some reasons why europe has been lagging. it's still a strong business for us.
it's still doing well, but it could even do better.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
and then maybe just as a follow-up. so if i have to think about the back half and the advertising channels, do you see opportunity to increase the branded ad spend or you think you're pretty much maxed out and might just stay on these levels?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
well, again, i think we have a very -- a modest increase in our overall marketing spend in the back half of the year. we're very happy with the approach to our brand spend. i mean, again, if you step back, one of the big strengths of airbnb is our ability to market to both guests and hosts at the same time to be able to bring guests with 90% of our traffic remaining direct or unpaid. and i think this brand strategy, frankly, it's more of a product marketing strategy that we have to market the features and capabilities that we have in airbnb what makes us different, has been a huge strength for us.
so we're really happy with that investment. we think we're investing fully at the moment there. we will look over time to maybe expand the countries that we're doing more of that investment. so later this year and into early next, you could see us expanding into more countries because we're seeing such good success with our investment right now.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you.

the next question is from jed kelly with oppenheimer. your line is open.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok. great. thanks for taking my question. two, if i may.
just one on the nonurban listings, it continues to grow well, and you're adding a lot of supply. can you sort of touch on where the share gains are coming from like where those listings are coming from? is it coming from people not using their second home as much and going back to more urban destination? or are you taking more share with property managers or are you opening up with new definitions? then my second question just relates to older and all seasonality this year. it seems like the room nights is following a consistent seasonal trend as in 2019. so should we expect a similar 4q seasonality as 2019? thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. so maybe why don't i -- i can at least answer the first not the urban listings, but at a high level. and dave, you can answer maybe more specifically and also talk about seasonality. so jed, at the highest level, i would say that one of the things that we've seen is that we have a global network where the fastest-growing market from a supply basis are typically the fastest-growing markets from a demand basis.
and this is not surprising because the no. 1 source of host are prior guests. so specifically in non-urban listings, it's -- it's not a uniquely different composition. it's not like it's a lot more property managers or anything like that.
it's pretty consistent composition from years prior. so the vast majority of listings are individuals, but there are also property managers that are continuing to come out on the platform. we're also seeing people continue to open up more nights on their calendar. as demand goes up, people are often motivated to add more availability on their calendar.
and also as people get more business, they tend to tell their friends about it. and this is one of the great things about having a business where the vast majority of your supply are individuals. so we continue to see really strong growth in our urban listings. but as urban recovers, we are anticipating that we're going to see some solid supply growth in urban areas as well.
dave, feel free to elaborate on that and take the second question as well.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yes. i think you covered the first really well. i mean, i'll just say on the nights and experiences booked kind of seasonality. now that we kind of enter q3 and q4, it's probably just better to look at the year-over-year growth rates as kind of being more normalized.
and i think that's the better way to kind of look at the overall seasonal growth.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from tom white with d.a. davidson. your line is open.
tom white -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. brian, during the early days of the pandemic, you talked about narrowing your focus on airbnb's most perishable opportunities. you guys have now achieved profitability at scale.
your cash balance has grown significantly. can you update us on maybe your latest thinking about those nonperishable opportunities? are any of them particularly attractive to you? or should we maybe infer from the buyback announcement that maybe you're not super close to really exploring those opportunities again?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
tom, yes. so again, during the 2020 pandemic curve, just to recap, we got really focused. we got back to basic. and over the last 2 years, i think we've really, really benefited by perfecting our core product.
that being said, we are now looking and we are thinking very expansively. so you should look at our stock buyback as our confidence in our long-term growth and profitability. that's all you should be that stock buyback about. that being said, we are going to continue to be investing aggressively over the coming years.
so we are not pulling on the brake. we are now stepping on the gas. remember, like the biggest innovations i had aren't going to be in my 20s and 30s, right? so we have some pretty big opportunities coming up. i'm excited about some of the things we're going to be releasing later this year, but we have another release coming next spring in time for the summer release and the following winter.
and again, we're going to continue to focus on unlocking the next generation of host. so we have some really exciting new products built to attract the next generation of host, especially individuals that want to host occasionally. we are going to continue to think of radical innovations around airbnb becoming the ultimate host to our guests and host. we're going to continue to innovate on our search technology.
and we have a lot of opportunities around helping people travel and live on airbnb. so there's going to be some pretty exciting opportunities coming forward, and i'm pretty bullish about it. i don't know if, dave, if there's anything you want to add to that?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll just reemphasize, our priority is investing in growth. and as $10 billion cash is more than we need, $8 billion is more than sufficient to aggressively invest in growth in the business. and that is our no.
1 priority. at the same time, we're able to both invest and grow just given the profitability profile of our business overall. so i'm proud that we can do both, but the priority for us is investment growth.
tom white -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. maybe just one quick follow-up on fx. over the years, i remember some of the kind of traditional otas talking about how maybe it's less about kind of the absolute level of one currency relative to another, but it's maybe more like the volatility of foreign exchange rates that kind of dictate customer booking behavior. curious whether you'd say that was a similar dynamic in your business? or just generally how to changes in fx rate, what changes impacts are you seeing kind of in terms of customer behavior?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
i think the biggest impact you see with fx is in the cross-border travel, obviously, right? a strengthening dollar gives you the ability for americans to travel abroad, specifically right now, probably europe and to the u.k. and a weakening euro and pound makes it more difficult for them to kind of travel back. but again, if you look at airbnb, the fact is that people adjust their travel to meet their overall kind of budgets. and as we saw in covid, people are more willing to -- maybe they stay domestically if their budget doesn't allow the cross-border traveler.
maybe they stay domestically if they don't feel like they can afford the cost of airline travel. so the fx impact from a consumer standpoint is usually this kind of cross-border impact. and then to our overall business, we're just seeing that as we generate night stayed in euro and pounds and then we bring them back to the u.s. and into the u.s.
dollar, we're just seeing the headwind of foreign exchange, which was -- which is material in q1, it was 600 basis points of revenue growth driven by the fx move. so i'd anticipate q3 probably be something less than that to our overall p&l.
tom white -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thank you.
operator
that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. i'll hand it over to brian chesky for any closing remarks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. so i just want to say i'm incredibly proud of what we delivered this quarter. record nights and experiences booked, we had our most profitable q2 and we generated $795 million of free cash flow, bringing our total free cash flow over the last 12 months to nearly $3 billion.
this transformation of our business was only possible because of our adaptable model and a relentless innovation. and regardless of economic environment, we believe guests will continue to come to airbnb because they can find great value and host can earn extra income. airbnb is ready for whatever lies ahead, and we're so confident in our long-term growth and profitability that today, we're announcing a $2 billion share repurchase program. so thank you all for joining us today, and i'll see you next quarter.

operator
good afternoon, and thank you for joining airbnb's earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2022. as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the investor relations section of airbnb's website following this call. i'll now hand the call over to ellie mertz, vp of finance. please go ahead.
ellie mertz -- vice president of finance and investor relations
good afternoon, and welcome to airbnb's second quarter of 2022 earnings call. thank you for joining us today. on the call today, we have airbnb's co-founder and ceo, brian chesky; and our chief financial officer, dave stephenson. earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of 2022.
these items were posted on the investor relations section of airbnb's website. during the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of the time on q&a. before i turn it over to brian, i would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.
these factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the securities and exchange commission. we urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. you should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. also, during this call, we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures.
we provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our investor relations website. these non-gaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for our gaap results. and with that, i will pass the call to brian. 
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. thank you, ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. thanks for joining. our q2 results demonstrate that airbnb has achieved growth and profitability at scale.
from a growth perspective, we exceeded 103 million nights and experiences booked. now this was our largest quarterly number ever. revenue was $2.1 billion, up 58% from last year or 64%, excluding foreign exchange. gross booking value was $17 billion, up 27% from last year or 34% if you exclude foreign exchange.
now both revenue and gbv were 73% higher than q2 2019, significantly outperforming the travel industry. now from a profitability perspective, we had our most profitable q2 ever. net income of $379 million was a nearly $700 million improvement from q2 2019. adjusted ebitda was $711 million.
now this represents a 34% adjusted ebitda margin, which is significantly up from the 16% margin in q2 2021, a negative 4% in q2 2019. finally, we generated $795 million of free cash flow. now this is a $1.1 billion improvement from the nearly $300 million cash burn two years ago at the depth of the pandemic. over the last 12 months, airbnb generated $3 billion in free cash flow, nearly $3 billion, and ended the quarter with nearly $10 billion in cash.
so what explains this transformation in our business? well, first, our business model is adaptable. we have nearly every type of space in nearly every location so however travel changes, we can adapt. and regardless of the economic environment, our guests come to airbnb because they can find great value and our host can earn extra income. second, we've relentlessly innovated while also staying focused and disciplined.
when the pandemic began in 2020, we made some incredibly difficult decisions. we significantly reduced spending, making us a leaner and more focused company. and we've kept this discipline ever since, allowing us to keep the hiring and investment plans made in the beginning of the year. and airbnb is well-positioned for whatever lies ahead.
in fact, we're so confident in our long-term growth and profitability that today, we're announcing a $2 billion share repurchase program. and this is coming only a year and a half after our ipo. now returning to our q2 results. our strong financial performance was driven by a number of positive business trends.
first, guest demand in airbnb is as high as ever. in q2, we surpassed 103 million nights and experiences booked, marking our highest quarterly number ever. now despite broader macroeconomic concerns, we still saw a 25% increase in nights and experiences booked compared to the quarter of 2021. now early in q2, strong guest demand exceeded our expectations.
this is because guests in europe and north america booked earlier than they have historically. now given this earlier booking, growth rates compared to last year decelerated in may and june. and since the end of q2, what we've seen is growth in nights booked reaccelerate from june to july as we enter peak travel season. second, guests continue to return to cities and cross borders.
in previous quarters, we've talked about how we saw significant growth driven by surges in domestic travel as well as travel to rural destinations. now these trends continue. but we're also seeing guests returning to cities and crossing borders above pre-pandemic levels. third, guests continue to stay longer in airbnb.
they're not just traveling airbnb, they're now living on airbnb. we saw long-term stays of 28 days or more remain our fastest-growing category by trip nights compared to 2019. the long-term stays has increased nearly 25% from a year ago. and actually, long-term stays have increased almost 90% since q2 2019.
fourth, guest demand is driving growth on our host community. we continue to see the strongest supply increases in areas of greatest demand, with nonurban active listings up 50% compared to q2 2019. but as demand is returning to cities, we're also seeing an increase in total urban supply. and we believe the upgrades we introduced last year, including our new host onboarding flow and aircover are supporting this growth, but we're not stopping there.
so you're going to see some exciting new product features to recruit the next generation of host later this year. finally, i'd like to share a few highlights from the 2022 summer release. in may, we introduced airbnb categories. since launch, listings in the airbnb categories have been viewed more than 180 million times.
through categories, we are distributing guest discovery across more destinations and dates. now we also introduced aircover for guests. since launch, the net promoter score for guests that had an issue with their stay has already improved. and the real insulin -- instance where our host cancels, aircover has led to 10% more rebookings.
so to recap. we achieved significant milestones this quarter with our results. nights and experiences booked were our highest ever. revenue and adjusted ebitda were records for q2 and free cash flow was $795 million.
in the last 12 months, we generated nearly $3 billion in free cash flow. now before i go to questions, i want to talk about an update on my co-founder, joe gebbia. last month, joe announced that he'll be stepping back from this full-time operating role. joe will continue to serve on the board of directors of both airbnb and airbnb.org.
airbnb a founder-led company. so he's going to continue to take a role at airbnb, and this will be as an advisor to me on future concepts and creative culture. since the beginning, joe has always been focused on big ideas to help others. these are uncompromising true north.
so it will be fun to be able to spend more time with them on dreaming up new ideas, just like the early days. and as i reflect back on the last 14 years together, i just can't believe how lucky joe, nate, and i have been. if anything, i just gone a few degrees in a different direction, i wouldn't be doing this call with you right now. that's how fragile ideas are.
and it's what gives me gratitude to know joe and nate. and what i'm most thankful for is that we're still together, still meeting every sunday 14 years after we started. we built a dream together. and now, after all these years, we still continue to dream.
so thank you, joe. and with that, dave and i look forward to answer your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] and we'll take our first question from lloyd walmsley at ubs.
lloyd walmsley -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. two, if i can. first, just the classic kind of macro question. anything you guys are seeing globally, any pockets where you're seeing weaker trends in bookings or adrs that would be kind of early warning sign that you'd flag heading into next year? and then second one, you guys have talked a little bit about starting to invest again in experiences.
i guess if we step back, how should we think about the cost growth outlook heading into 2023? and are you -- is there anything you're doing in light of just questions around macro to kind of keep a lid on costs heading into next year? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, lloyd. dave, why don't i answer these and then you can go at a high level and you can go specifically into the booking side of the question. but lloyd, what i'm going to do is i'll answer it at a little more of a high level.
so one of the things that we've seen is despite a lot of consumers pulling back on spending, the one area that i haven't seen them pull back on as much is travel. and in particular, like travel, where you can go and see your friends, see your family, more inspirational type of travel. in other words, meaningful travel, not just mass travel. and i think the reason why is just because many people are now working from home, the mall is now amazon; the movie theater is now netflix, people still want to get out of the house.
they still want to have memories. they still want to have meaningful experiences. and i think that's why they continue to turn to airbnb. and so just like people continue to travel this quarter, we expect really strong demand for airbnb next year.
and again, the new use cases are sticking. in other words, a fifth of our nights booked are for longer than a month and half of our nice booked are longer than a week. and this has basically been a boon because of the flexibility that people have and being able to essentially work from home or have a hybrid work lifestyle. at the same time, our urban and cross-border businesses are incredibly strong because of the value that we provide.
and we think that value and having great deals is going to be a key driver as the economy slows down. on the supply side, i just would remind everyone that we started airbnb in 2008 during the great recession. and at that time, many people were turning to airbnb to earn extra income. and so we think this will be also a great time for millions of people to consider hosting, which is why we're focused on this on november 16.
so we're feeling really positive about the path forward. with regards to experiences, to answer your question very simply, the great thing about experience is we don't have to have very much incremental investments to make this work. it's really just a matter of incorporating experiences more into our existing marketing and incorporating experiences more into our existing products. so i don't think you'll see that in the p&l from a cost perspective next year at all.
dave, feel free to take -- anything else you want to add.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll just double click a few areas. we're just doing incredibly well despite the macroeconomic environment. we saw continued strength in q3.
the q3 nights experiences grew 25% year over year, and our revenue grew 29% year over year. and as we stated, it's actually 36% growth year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. and what we're seeing in q4 is not seeing any overall changes in booking behaviors in our guests. four weeks in this quarter, we're seeing really strong promising trends in cross-border, renewed interest in urban stays, stabilizing cancellations and just strong future bookings.
and that, we included in our guidance here. our guidance for q4, we're anticipating revenue growth between 17% and 23%. and that's 23% to 29%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. and maybe i'll just take a minute to double click here because one of the things we're seeing is the difference in the behavior that we had last year.
if you actually go back to 2019 historic rates, we're actually seeing stable to increasing demand for bookings here from q3 into q4. the decel that we see from q3 into q4 is really a hard comp on q4 last year where we had really strong demand after delta and before omicron. and so this is really kind of a hard year-over-year comp. if you go back and compare back to 2019, we're seeing stable to increasing demand across the globe.
and actually if any areas to highlight, and you see it in our letter, is that apac had some of the stronger growth, 65% growth in apac. and excluding china, apac is now kind of above 2019 level. so that's been kind of the last major region to kind of return to 2019.
lloyd walmsley -- ubs -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
we'll move next to naved khan at truist securities.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks a lot. is there anything worth calling out in terms of incremental demand for european sales from travelers outside of europe, given the decline in the currencies in that area? and then the other question i had is just on advertising. can you share anything in terms of roi on the advertising dollars? and are you seeing more opportunities to deploy these more broadly?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, naved. why don't, dave, you take these? i can round up the answers.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. in terms of european demand, we are seeing strong european demand from places like the u.s., where the dollar is stronger than the euro. it's not a material part of the business, so it's hard to see it impact the overall materiality given just the size of our business being in 220 countries and regions around the world. and conversely, the european travel is going to be maybe less likely to come, say, to the u.s.
where the u.s. dollar is so strong. so there's some offset in there. overall, the impact of foreign exchange isn't as large on the business because of the regional impacts.
more people kind of travel either domestically or within their own regions. and then in terms of advertising roi, we're really pleased with our approach to the marketing strategy that we've had. our brand marketing results are delivering excellent results overall with a strong rate of return. and it's been so successful that we're actually expanding to more countries.
and so that's what still be seeing over the course of the next year, is to expand more countries to support our brand advertising.

we'll go next to nick jones at jmp securities.
nick jones -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. i guess first, i guess when we look at kind of u.s. to international travel, is the strength in u.s.
dollar maybe helping drive more interest in going overseas? and then the second question on durability of kind of adrs. is elevated home prices maybe making hosts less likely to lower the rate at which they're willing to take kind of from here? i mean, are these going to be maybe more durable than we think? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave, why don't you take the first question? i can take the second.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. again, as i just said, on the u.s. international, we clearly do have a strong u.s. dollar, which enables americans to travel abroad quite well, and we're seeing nice strength there.
but again, that part of the business is not so large as to have a material impact on the overall business because you also have some of the offsets of weaker currencies, not necessarily travel in the u.s. again, more of the travel is domestic and intra-regional, that's what's really going to kind of drive things and more of the foreign exchange issues are not as pronounced within the given region.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and i think just regarding elevated home prices and what that does to average daily rate on airbnb, i mean just to zoom out, people come to airbnb because they can find a great value. and you can often get significantly more for your money than a hotel room. you can often get an entire home with a lot of amenities. and continuing to deliver value is going to be really important for the next travel season.
and that means that we need to make sure we have really competitive prices. and that means that we need to give tools for host, more tools for them to be able to better price their listings. so one of the things we're doing is we're going to continue to move toward a more all-in pricing, where when you see pricing, instead of seeing more of a nightly rate, you're going to see a little bit more of a fully loaded rate. and then our search ranking is going to prioritize great value and great deal for the fully loaded price.
i think this will really help hosts understand what they're charging and then we're going to give them more tools so they can see and understand what their all-in pricing is for guests and we're going to provide more discount tools and other features to allow host to remain competitive. and if we do all these things, i believe we'll be even more competitive from a pricing standpoint than we are today.
nick jones -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thanks, brian.

we'll take our next question from brian fitzgerald at wells fargo.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, guys. i think you'll have more to say about supply with the upcoming winter release, but just wondering if you could talk about what you see as continuing pain points for hosts. brian, maybe just talk to that a little bit. and maybe also structural drivers around supply like local regulations and zoning.
thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. yeah, so let me dive into this because this is a pretty important topic. just to zoom out, we have a global network where demand drives supply. and that means that where we see our highest growth of bookings is also typically where we see our highest growth of supply.
and just to give you an example, this past quarter, approximately 35% of our new available hosts had started as guests. so this is a really strong network where guests become host, and hosts, as they get more bookings, they tend to tell their friends about it, and then we get more supply that way. and so this is, i think, one of the things that's really, really important. but beyond that, obviously, we want to be very aggressive about recruiting more host to airbnb because this is a great time.
and because of the softening economy, we think increasingly now more than ever before, people are interested in putting their homes on airbnb to make supplemental income. so to answer your question, what are the pain points? i would highlight too, as we've talked to people that are considering hosting, they've told us two things. the first thing they said is that they want it to be easier to get started. they need help getting started, becoming a host.
the second thing is they're a little nervous about having strangers in their house. and so we have tackled both of these. on november 16, as part of our winter release, number one, we're going to unveil an all new super easy way for millions of people to put their home on airbnb. i'm pretty excited about this.
we've been working on this for quite a while. second, to make people feel comfortable about having other people in their home, which will unlock a lot more everyday people putting their real homes on airbnb, we are going to be providing some huge upgrades and improvements to aircover for hosts. if we do these two things, i think we're going to help unlock significantly greater amounts of supply, which is already on top of the momentum that we have and we've seen in q3. maybe the final thing i'll just say is in addition to adding more supply in airbnb, the holy grail is pointing demand to where we have supply because i know night globally on airbnb, are we ever close to 100% occupied.
it's just a matter of pointing demand to where we have supply. and this is the whole theory around airbnb category, that instead of hoping people type in the place you have available supply in the search box, you can then come and have more of a browse experience where we highlight homes that are available. so this is our holistic strategy. as far as pain points as far as like from a regulatory standpoint, i mean, one of the things we've seen is a redistribution away from very large cities kind of to everywhere.
and a lot of cities and a lot of local communities have been actually reaching out to us because they can see the economic opportunity we provide. so we're working really, really closely with these markets, but we're feeling very optimistic about our supply for 2023.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
just to double click on a couple of brian's points because i think it's really important. because of these partnerships that we've had with local governments, especially on tax collection, we've delivered more than $6 billion in tourism-related taxes to local governments. i mean this is a material amount of money. and collecting -- remitting taxes, we do it in over 30,000 jurisdictions around the globe.
and i think in terms of like zoning regulations, we believe that the reasonable regulation actually normalizes hosting. and when you normalize hosting, it can really be a foundation for future growth. so we actually think that you do this in a reasonable way, and it will actually be a tailwind to growth in the future.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys.

next, we'll move to brian nowak at morgan stanley.
brian nowak -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. i have two. the first one is just to maybe try to cut the business a little bit different way, what can you tell us about sort of your growth in active bookers or active stairs versus spend per booker that's sort of driving the business right now? and how have those cohorts that came in during covid, how have they aged versus covid which is cohorts you had prior to covid. and then the second one, brian, you made so many improvements to the platform over the years from unflexible and trying to load balance supply and demand, etc.
what can you tell us about the conversion of traffic now versus where it was, say, in 2019?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. awesome. yeah, dave, do you want to take the first question?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah, in terms of the active bookers, i think you kind of step back and look at the marketing approach that we've had since pre-covid and that we really has accelerated in covid in a sense has been to continue to focus on the overall brand of airbnb and to be less reliant on search engine marketing. we've been incredibly effective at that 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid which is driving a great return on investment for kind of new active bookers. and so i think the return that we're getting on new has been quite good. and in terms of the cohorts of new, we're actually seeing that the cohorts that are coming in since covid are actually as strong, if not even stronger than they were in prior to covid.
the people that are willing to kind of travel right now and experience airbnb have -- are really sticky, and the cohorts are as strong if not stronger than we saw previously.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
sorry, i just want to answer about conversion of traffic for unflexible. so yes, at a high level, conversion on a year-over-year basis is up. but i would actually generally say, brian, that we actually think about it even more broadly. when we launched airbnb categories, for example, one of the goals was not just increased conversion, but was actually to increase traffic.
and there's a scenario where you can increase traffic, initially conversion can go down because you are a little bit more in the inspiration business. and there were people who are coming and they're dreaming and planning travel. so you really want to look at conversion over a longer period of time. but we have actually seen metronomic improvements in our conversion rate.
but stays -- listings in airbnb categories since we launched on may 11 have been viewed more than 300 million times and with homes they would have never otherwise have known existed. so we're really excited about the progress we're making between airbnb categories, which is really bringing a lot more traffic to airbnb, pointing demand where we have supply, bringing us top of funnel. aircover for guests, which is making people feel more assured about their experience and allowing a more consistent form of reliability. i think that we're going to continue to see a step change in improvement in the product from a guest experience.
and this, of course, will continue to lead to greater conversion.
brian nowak -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you, both.
operator
we'll go next to doug anmuth of j.p. morgan.
doug anmuth -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i have two. first, brian, i know you talked about strong growth in new hosts, and a lot of them seeing new income opportunities. but within that, is the macro environment and interest rates, is that putting any pressure on second homes in your view? and then secondly, if you could talk a little bit about the early returns on the spring update categories.
is there anything you can add just around conversion rates or what you might be seeing in incremental bookings? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, doug, i mean, i'll let dave fill in, in more detail. but at the highest level, i think it's actually pretty simple. in -- as the economy slows down, i think people are looking for more ways to make either supplemental income or like greater yield on the assets they have. and so we generally see a slow in the economy as a moment when more and more people are going to be presumably turning to airbnb for hosting.
and so whether it's second homes or primary homes, i think there's going to be a pretty big opportunity for us. and we just want to make sure that we provide great tools for people so they continue to list on airbnb. as far as some of the metrics we've seen, again, as i said, conversion has steadily picked up. homes and airbnb experiences have been viewed more than 300 million times.
we're seeing us continue to spread out bookings to more and more markets, which is a bit of the holy grail, to point demand where we have supply. with aircover for guests, which is another very important upgrade that we made, because this is -- aircover for guests really addresses a bit of the achilles' heel of airbnb, which is on the one hand, we have this incredible one-of-a-kind home. other hand, one of a kind can be variable in consistency. and so what we've seen with aircover is we provide protection in the unlikely event that a host cancels or you get to a home and it's not as described.
and we've seen, since we've launched aircover for guests, nps is up and probably even more importantly, rebooking rates when a guest is dissatisfied, is also up. and so if we can do these two things: on the front end, continue to be more in the inspiration business, point demand where we have supply. on the back end, make sure that airbnbs are meeting your expectations. and in the rare event that they don't, we make it right, then these are going to continue to unlock significantly greater growth for us in the year ahead.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
just to double quick on the strong -- the second home impact question. if you go back and think about the 4 million hosts that we have, we have a very different business than many others. so 90% of those hosts are individual hosts. they're the people that own a first -- a primary home or maybe a secondary home.
and a big strength of our business, we saw this in covid, is that people, even during an economic kind of shock period, they don't get rid of their primary home. they don't get necessarily rid of their secondary home, which is very different than professional hosts that maybe are doing an arbitrage of exact cost of ownership and return on the investment they can get on that specific property versus other alternatives. and so i think that this helps buffer any of those kind of impacts on our businesses, that individual host community.

justin post -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks. one quick one. when you say adrs could face some pressure.
is that quarter over quarter or year over year in q4? and then much bigger picture, solid bookings for 31% growth. guidance probably implies well over 20 in q4. how do we think about the backlog for '23 on revenues or associate that with potential revenue growth next year? thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right, dave, i think you can take this one.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. on the year over year for q4 -- the q4 pressure adr is year over year. in terms of the backlog for '23, it's a little early to tell, but really, what we're seeing is continued strong demand for travel overall. like i said, when you look back to historic levels of growth back to 2019, we're seeing stable to increasing demand.
we have strong bookings on the books for q4, but then there will be fewer on the books yet for it kind of tails off into 2023. so it's a little early to say. but we're seeing no hints of a decline in people's demand and willingness to travel. it's just a little early to extrapolate much further.
justin post -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

operator
we'll move next to mario lu at barclays.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. first one is for brian. you mentioned earlier this one that redesigning pricing and better transparency is a top priority for you.
how much of an uplift could this be to conversion potentially? and what changes should we expect to see?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, mario. yeah. just to give a little more context to those listening about pricing.
right now, we have pricing that is primarily displayed on a nightly rate. hosts can then choose to add a cleaning fee, and then airbnb adds service fees. and one of the things that we've been hearing from guests, and we heard it loud and clear, is that people would like a little more transparency about what they're actually paying when they first get to airbnb. and so we are working on redesigning how pricing works on airbnb, so people better understand the total price they're going to pay the moment they arrive at airbnb, and it's not a surprise to them.
so i think the north star for us on this matter is transparency. i think the benefit of this is going to be -- we also want to make it easier for a host to understand what they're charging. and sometimes, hosts tell us that they're not aware of what guests are paying because as you know, we add a guest service fee on top of the price that the hosts charge. and occasionally, hosts that they are charging more than they intended to.
and so we are updating some of the tools to make it easier for hosts to understand what they're charging, and this will allow them to be more competitive. in addition to that, we're going to be updating our search ranking algorithm. we've been making some refinements to prioritize home that offer a better value. and of course, when a guest checks out, they leave a five-star rating.
one of the questions we ask is on a scale of one to five, how good of a value was this, and homes that offer a great value are going to be prioritized higher in search results. and in addition to that, we're going to continue to develop new discounting tools, discounting tools like seasonal discounts, weekly discounts, peak season discounts and really tools to make hosts more competitive. if we do all this, i do believe the prices will get even more competitive. and one of the things we know is obviously as the prices get more competitive, conversion rate goes up, and as conversion rate goes up, bookings go up.
and just the final thing to say is we'll have some updates on this soon. i'll be in making some announcements soon.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks, brian. and just one on the operational take rate. i believe it's still above 14% and has not changed much over the past few years.
so firstly, one, is that correct? and if so, what are your thoughts on adjusting up or down in the future to drive demand?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question, mario. i'll start and dave, you can feel free to jump in. we do not have an intention to increase take rate. i mean this is a company that, obviously, in the last quarter, did more than $1 billion in net income, nearly $1 billion of free cash flow.
so i think there's a lot of levers to increase monetization on airbnb, but i don't think we have to increase take rate to do that. in other words, there's opportunities like to allow additional services to host that we could charge for, and we think they pay for that we can do. so there's a lot of ways to increase the take rate on airbnb. there are going to be some areas where we can probably optimize and improve take rates and potentially lower a little bit like on long-term space.
if you're booking a place for two, three, four months, we think conversion rate might go up if we were to lower the take rate a little bit. but i don't think this would cut into our current business. i think that might actually keep more bookings on the platform. so we are going to continue to look at some optimization, but we think that we provide a great value.
and i think if we make some of these pricing and discount changes in the coming future, i think the value on airbnb will get even better. we're going to remain disciplined on our expenses. and there's a lot of monetization opportunities going forward. but our general view is if we're going to charge more, we should provide more.
that's our north star.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll go next to bernie mcternan at needham & company.
bernie mcternan -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thank you for taking the question. i realize that you guys are saying you're not seeing any negative impact yet from the macro on the consumer. but as you think about different scenarios playing out and the potential impact of a recessionary environment, is there any cohort or demographic data that you see from your consumers that makes you think airbnb could be more resilient than broader travel?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
i mean i could answer that high level, and dave, you can go in. i mean it's a very great question. one of the things we noticed during the pandemic -- one of the lessons of the pandemic is i think airbnb is the most adaptable business model in all of travel. and the reason why is we're not just a european business, we're not just a north american business.
we are a truly global business. we're in 100,000 cities all over the world. we're not just a vacation rental business. we're also an urban business, also a cross-border business.
we're not just a family business. we're also popular with millennials, gen z and retirees at nearly every type of price point. so i think that however travel demand changes, we'll be able to adapt. and that's one of the great things about our model.
it's a global network, guests become hosts. most hosts are regular people that tell their friends about airbnb, which is why when a market occupancy increases, it tends in itself create more supply. so these are some of the reasons why we feel very, very excited about our ability to continue to adapt given this challenging macroeconomic environment. dave, i don't know if you want to add anything to it?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll just double click. i mean, it's just a great value that we provide, right, that can people can pick anything from -- from budget to luxe. and if a person has a certain kind of budget constraint, they can choose to maybe get a slightly smaller place or place with fewer amenities, maybe they're go further out, like they can adjust the type of home they want based on their budget. and i think airbnb has such a diversity of offerings that that enables them to do it uniquely with us, which is very different than the flexibility they might have in hotels.
operator
we'll move next to james lee at mizuho.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. and when we spoke with hoteliers in general, i think they're planning to keep the adrs high and with reduced staffing levels. so just curious what you're thinking, does that present an opportunity for you to price your product more dynamically to demand and gain share? and also considering -- are you also considering a price structure change charging guest fees given the tighter consumer budget? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, james. yes, i think that as we give more tools to host to be able to dynamically price, they can be more competitive. and as they are more competitive, then we will continue to gain more share. so anything that allows greater value allows for more share.
we don't -- we're not -- other than changing how pricing will be displayed to make it more transparent, intuitive and to continue to offer better value, we're not actually looking at a fundamental change to our pricing structure.
operator
we'll move next to richard clarke at bernstein.
richard clarke -- bernstein -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. just wondering, based on the commentary you're seeing urban coming back, how normal are we in that mix at the moment? and can you possibly quantify what the adr headwind might be as urban continues to come back? and then maybe just the same question regionally, you're more skewed to the north american market than you were pre covid. is that because those use cases are a bigger factor in north america? or do you expect further changes in the geographical mix over time as well?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, dave. do you want to take this one?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. in terms of like urban coming back, it just continues to be a higher and higher percentage of our overall mix. it's not quite back to where it was in 2019, and it may never quite be because we see such great strength in our nonurban. but urban is strengthening each quarter, and so that's the trend that we're seeing on the urban side.
and i think it's actually similar on the cross-border international side. we're not back to where we were in kind of 2019 level. gross nights were like 48%, were cross-border back in 2019. and what we've just seen is a cross-border continues to be a greater, greater percentage every quarter, but we're not quite back to where we were in 2019.
operator
we'll move next to mark mahaney at evercore isi.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. thanks. let's see. david, could i ask you just the over-earning question.
that the free cash flow margins are truly very impressive. just you really see them, you've been at 40% plus or roughly for the last three quarters on a trailing 12-month basis. what would cause those margins to go materially higher or lower from here? or is there a reason to think that they're roughly sustainable? and then can i just ask about categories? i know somebody asked about this earlier. but brian, these features can sometimes take quite a long time to kind of get broadly used and adopted and they can have a major impact.
and i think this is one of those that could. how long do you think it's going to take for categories to be kind of widely adopted used and really start impacting and helping people better match up that supply -- all the supply you have with the demand that's out there. thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. so we have two questions. i think, dave, you can take the first one, and then i'll take categories.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
excellent. so yeah, the free cash flow, i'm really proud of our delivery of the free cash flow and the free cash flow margin. so thanks for calling it out. i mean we've just made substantial improvement in the overall profitability of our business, right? we've radically adjusted our marketing expenditures to be substantially lower.
we've made metronomic improvement in our variable costs. we're seeing great leverage in our fixed costs. we're being incredibly disciplined in our fixed cost growth, and that will continue going forward. and so all of those will be tailwinds to being able to maintain or even increase our free cash flow margins over time.
as average daily rates could moderate next year, that does put a little bit of a headwind toward our margins. but i think the improvements in our variable costs and the fixed cost leverage should enable us to maintain or even increase free cash flow margins over the longer term. what we'll continue to have is greater expansion in free cash flow margin. some of the things that brian talked about a little bit ago would be kind of incremental services or activities that we add for guests or hosts over time.
and there's no immediate announcements of major changes that you should anticipate in '23, but know that that is a focus for us, and over a more extended period, will drive incremental revenue for us and incremental margin.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. and to answer your other question about the kind of timing for wide adoption of airbnb categories, it's a great question. i think just to kind of zoom out, customers of travel have been, as you know, trained over the last 25 years to search a certain way. and that way is to go to a website, there's a search box, you type in where you want to go and you search.
and then what you get is a list of results. you refine the results, you compare sometimes the different websites, different apps and then you make a booking. and i think this is going to be a multiyear transition to retrain kind of customers about how they can search for travel on airbnb. but i think we're going to start to see some really great momentum next year.
again, we're already seeing people discover homes they never knew existed. we're seeing a lot more people engage with categories. the homes and categories have been viewed more than 300 million times, we're going to continue to be making improvements to this every single year. we have some upgrades coming out in two weeks in november.
and of course, you're going to see some upgrades beyond that as well. so i think this is a really great opportunity for us. and again, because we're a little more concentrated in vacation travel, the business travel, and because people are increasingly more flexible when they travel, we think they're going to be much more open to ideas from airbnb. and part of this is idea of me becoming more at the top of the funnel.
the way the travel funnel used to be, if you go to one website to figure out where to travel, these are typically travel content sites. then you go to the next site, typically to book your flight, and then the third thing you do is get your hotel or get your housing. so airbnb was kind of step three. and we'd like airbnb to go from kind of step three to step one.
this is going to take some retraining for everything to go from step three to step one, but i think there's definitely a line of sight to getting there.
operator
we'll go next to stephen ju at credit suisse.
stephen ju -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you. hi, brian. so you guys took off you -- you guys took out the china supply but maintained your outbound business.
it's probably a little bit too early to tell and there probably isn't a lot of outbound happening as of yet. but is there anything we should worry about from a customer acquisition funnel or retention standpoint because the airbnb use case for, i guess, the chinese traveler is going to get reduced to, i guess, international only versus what was previously domestic plus international? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, stephen. i mean the crown jewel of our china business was always, and we thought always was going to be the china outbound business. and the reason why is the take rate was higher for the outbound business than it was for the domestic business. the inventory is more unique.
there's less competition and the average daily rate is a lot higher. so the outbound business was always the price part of our business, and that's what we're focused on. now as you know, not a lot of people are leaving the country right now, but we want to be prepared for when they do. and they eventually will, of course.
and so the two things we're doing to prepare is, number one, we're going to be continuing to invest in our brand in china. and number two, if people are traveling and they're leaving china, they're going to other countries, and we would call these the corridor countries. and the primary place they're first probably going to go is intra-region. so they're presumably going to be going to southeast asia, korea, japan, eventually, they'll go a little further to europe and then they'll presumably come back to the united states, especially maybe the kind of some of the coastal cities.
and this is kind of how i think travel may recover. and so what we need to do is make sure we have enough supply in these corridors and continue to invest in our brand in china. and i think by only having an outbound business, we can actually focus all of our investments just on that, and it actually makes a lot more cost effective, a lot more efficient. and one thing i've learned is the more focused we are, the more likely we are to achieve our results.
so that's what we're feeling. we're actually feeling really confident about the prospects for china. it's just going to be a longer like payoff than -- because of the fact that not a lot of people are leaving the country and traveling right now.

eric sheridan -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. maybe a two-parter, if i can, on investment strategy. obviously, we have a lot of technology companies that are talking about slowing hiring, possibly pruning talent out of their organizations. how do you think that positions you to possibly upgrade talent within the organization, brian? and how are you thinking about hiring goals over the next sort to 12 to 18 months? and then the second part of the question is, obviously, a slow in the economy would not be like the existential crisis that travel felt in spring of 2020.
but what's your broader philosophy of investing through a soft patch in the economy or more closely aligning revenue growth with expense growth if you did see a soft patch over a couple of quarters? thanks so much.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, eric, good to talk to you. yeah, let me just recap how we think about expense management and investment. before the pandemic, we were essentially a nearly breakeven business doing like a little under $250 million in loss from an ebitda perspective.
and of course, when the pandemic hit, we lost 80% of our business, and we completely changed our cost structure. and out of that crisis, we made a decision. and the decision we made is we weren't going to wait for another crisis, another weakened economy or a recession to change how we invest or run the company. so we were going to be lean regardless of the economy.
in other words, we were going to go from the navy to the navy seal, a small, lean, elite group. and so we're a small team, we're functionally organized. we're only slightly more than 6,000 people in the beginning of this year before, obviously, the economy took a turn for the worst, we still only had a plan to hire 7% to 8% more employees. in other words, we had a plan to be really profitable, and we were planning for a storm.
and so we have not had to change anything about our hiring plans. we don't intend to change anything about our hiring plans in the next 12 to 18 months regardless of the economy because one of the lessons we've learned is the smaller we are, the more nimble we are, the faster we can move. and not only can we be more profitable, we can actually grow faster. and we've been actually more productive than we ever were in our history.
we've made more than 150 upgrades in innovation across the core service. so we are still really aggressive about trying to attract the best of our generation to this company, but that doesn't mean hiring a lot of people. we are really embracing being a lean organization, which is partly our functional structure. we're not a business organization where you'd have four marketing departments.
we have one functional organization, and so that allows us to be quite a bit leaner. and i guess that goes to your other question, which is slowness in the economy. well, regardless of what happens to the economy, our model is highly adaptable. we have a very low expense base.
and we're pretty efficient with marketing. we spent a lot less on marketing than our competitors, and the vast majority of our traffic is direct. so whatever happens to the economy, i think we're in a pretty good position where we won't have to change the way we run the company. but i think we've proven if we ever have to, of course, we will.
but i don't expect for us to have to make a lot of changes because of how much cash we're generating because of how lean we already are.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
and if i double-click on one area is that we announced our live and work anywhere policy this year, and i think that has enabled us to hire the best people in the world regardless of where they live. and so to brian's point about hiring fewer, more senior, more experts in areas, this has clearly been able to make sure that we're getting the best talent in the world.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. and maybe the last thing i'll just say is i think that we learned a lot of lessons probably a year or two earlier than a lot of other tech companies because we were hit so hard so early. but i think the adversity, the challenge we had just made us a much more focused, a much better company. and one of the commitments we made is we're never going to forget the lessons from the pandemic.
we're never going to lose our discipline. because the more disciplined we are, the more focused we are, not only to become more profitable, but we actually innovate faster. and so those principles are here to stay.

we'll move next to ron josey at citi.
ron josey -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. maybe a bigger picture question first, brian, and then dave, one for you on just guidance. just i think, brian, you were talking maybe intra-quarter about aircover being a major franchise going forward.
clearly, we'll hear more about this in the winter release. but just talk to us about how air cover might expand longer term. we clearly see it for guests, for hosts. we know we'll have more updates here in the next week or two.
but just bigger picture, how you see it as a franchise. and then, dave, just on guidance, i think in the letter, we mentioned longer lead time for bookings, stronger backlog for 4q. just trying to understand how that might compare to where we were maybe in prior periods at the same time. thank you.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. i'll take the first one, ron. so yes, questions around kind of the longer-term strategy around aircover. and maybe the way to explain aircover, let's just take -- as an analogy, let's take amazon.
so my recollection of amazon, this will go back maybe 20 years, is 20 years ago, amazon, even back then, their core retail business was an amazing product. they had the most amount of selection on the internet, and they have the lowest prices. but the problem with amazon is they had an achilles' heel. and the achilles' feel was they were competing with walking in a store and taking something out at that moment.
and so one of the things they created was amazon prime, which was obviously addressing the core achilles' heel, which was shipping. i think every business has to understand what its potential weakness is. i think the great thing about airbnb's model is we similarly have probably the widest selection of accommodations, and everything we have is truly one of a kind at a great value. but our challenge is, unlike a hotel, we don't control the inventory, and it cannot structurally always be as consistent.
we can't expect every property. so aircover similar for consistency, addresses something similar to what prime did for amazon with shipping, which is to say, what if we could take this off the table, this question of consistency. and on the host side, the protections have led to a huge increase in nps. our nps for aircover for a host is over 60.
and this is after something happened to your home. so clearly, this was a huge hit. and it was so popular that we decided to bring it to guests. and i think where this can go is over the coming years, we can offer increasingly more protection, more coverage for more different use cases.
and i think the north star for aircover is if a listing was -- most of our inventory is only in airbnb. but let's say a home was on two different websites, airbnb and another website, we want aircover to be so compelling that just by having aircover alone, it'd be reason to go direct and book on airbnb and not book anywhere else. and we're going to continue to make improvements every single year, and i want aircover to be the gold standard for customer service for our category. and that's what we're really focused on.
and then down the road, there may be opportunities to offer like a paid version of this or some other type of membership program, but that would be down the road, but it's a very popular customer request.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
and then in terms of -- to answer the question on guidance, too. on the guidance, articulation of the longer lead times for bookings and just the q4 bookings that we have already on the books for the rest of this quarter is just to indicate that we have stable to accelerating demand for growth and demand from our guests around the world. it's that we are not seeing a softening in that demand, especially when you look back to historic levels of 2019, that any of the deceleration in revenue growth between q3 and q4 is largely due to the uniqueness of the 2021 timing of growth between delta and omicron. so i just think it just shows the stability of people wanting to get out of their homes, wanting to travel, regardless of the macroeconomic uncertainties.
operator
we'll move now to deepak mathivanan at wolfe research.
deepak mathivanan -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. just a couple of quick ones. so first, there's been a lot of press recently about how occupancies on the platform are down for certain house hosts.
is it just anecdotal or seasonal, or were there is anything more to it? i mean your 4q guidance is pretty strong, but just trying to understand how much of this is just kind of noise out there. and then second question, maybe for brian. long-term stays is stabilizing near 20% of the mix on the platform, even as sort of your room nights is growing pretty nicely. you've talked about sort of like the flexibility and lifestyle for many people keeping this -- or helping this growth.
but curious whether there is also like a bigger macro drivers like maybe rental markets being very difficult right now that's helping this trend. just kind of trying to understand how much you're reaching already into the addressable markets beyond travel currently.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, i can -- i'll take both, and then dave can feel free to dive in, especially on the bookings. i mean, i think our -- just to answer your question on whether bookings are down for a hosts, i mean at the macro level, at the high level, they're not down. and i mean, i think the q3 results speak for themselves. there are anecdotal descriptions of some hosts, bookings are down, some hosts, bookings are up.
and this -- there's many possible explanations for this. it's just that travel is continuing to change. one of the other things though is that our search rank algorithm is prioritizing all-in pricing and hosts with the best value. so it's possible -- that might be one possible explanation.
but again, it's primarily what we've seen is anecdotal. and it really depends -- you really have to take it on a case-by-case basis. but overall, obviously, bookings are up. in fact, it's a record quarter.
now with regard to long-term stays beyond travel, i mean, deepak, i would just say that we've only scratched the surface. a fifth of our nights booked are for stays longer than a month, and this is before making some really big fundamental improvement to this product and this category. and i think in the coming years, flexibility is here to stay. i think more people are going to work remotely or in a hybrid way five years from now than they do today.
i think increasingly, fewer people are going to have one-year leases, not to say no one will, but more and more people are going to value the flexibility and want to live in different places. and we think there's a real opportunity. and one of the things we're going to also see over the coming years isn't just that and live in different parts of the united states, but people are going to choose to live for short periods of time abroad in different countries. so we think we're going to start to see more long-term cross-border business, too.
so there's a lot of opportunities here. and we are going to be making some upgrades to our long-term stay business to tap into this large market. i mean the largest expense that most people have in their life is their housing, it's their housing costs. and we've built many of the tools and features that you would need to provide for a longer-term stay offering already.
but we're going to continue to make improvements. and as we do, i think we'll continue to take more and more of that market.
operator
next, we'll move to lee horowitz at deutsche bank.
lee horowitz -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks. so building on the comments earlier about expense growth. given that your advertising strategy has moved away from, say, purely demand linked performance advertising and more toward longer-dated roi investments and brand advertising.
how do you think about actively flexing down your advertising spend in a perhaps a tougher macro environment versus investing into that environment to continue to teach the customers -- retrain the customers about your ever-expanding product set?
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
dave, do you want to start with this?
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
sure. i mean if you look at our actual advertising strategy and the amount of money we're spending on it, it's going to be relatively flat from '22 over '21, and you should anticipate similar marketing as a percentage of revenue in '23. and so we can certainly flex it in line with revenue. we'll be kind of mindful of that.
but we've already kind of hit this new kind of lower overall rate. and what we've actually seen is, to the extent that we're keeping it flat even as we grow, it's because we're actually seeing such success that we're wanting to be able to invest in other countries. certainly, we can moderate that over time, but we're already so low that i wouldn't anticipate us dropping it dramatically in face of substantial headwinds over growth, but we can flex it with the revenue within a reasonably a few hundred basis points here and there.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and i'll just say -- just to jump in. i mean, we don't really think of marketing as a way to buy customers because, obviously, as we've mentioned, more than 90% of our traffic is correct or organic. and so the main thing is we take a full funnel approach to marketing. and actually the top of the funnel is pr in communication.
and we think that's one of the biggest drivers of our traffic is pr. and then brand marketing is actually important. and actually, we think a bit more like product marketing. we want to educate people about our new features.
so right now, we're advertising and educating people about airbnb categories and aircover. and then we think of performance marketing as more of a way the laser in to balance supply and demand rather than a way purchase a large amount of customers. and that's essentially the way we think about marketing. and this allows for a very efficient, very dynamic approach to marketing that should get more efficient every single year.
operator
and we'll take our final question from brad erickson at rbc capital markets.
brad erickson -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks. just had a few follow-ups. first, nights came up just a bit light of where we all had it forecasted. so obviously, that's on us.
but i guess, in cases where you are maybe seeing a little bit of nights booked softness, are you seeing those hosts make any moves on price? or are your pricing tools sending any message to those hosts about making moves? just curious if you look to affect some elasticity in the event of any pockets of softness. and then second, dave, i know you spoke to this just a minute ago on the backlog, but asked in a different way. are you basically saying that you're seeing booking windows expand more than prior years here as we start out q4? thanks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, brad, i'll take the first question. i think dave can take the second. yeah, i mean, what we do see is that many hosts do bring their prices up or down as demand goes up or down. that being said, i think there's opportunities for us to have more dynamic tools and give more visibility that would make prices even more competitive.
to answer your question, they do, many hosts do adjust their prices, but i think host probably adjust their prices less frequently than hotels. and so in periods of time where prices are generally coming down in the industry, we might be a little bit slower. but as we build more tools to provide more dynamic changes, we'll be -- continue to be more competitive. and i'll let dave take the next question.
dave stephenson -- chief financial officer
yeah. well, a couple of things. one thing is we are not focused on optimizing just night side. i think nights is an important measure, and it's an important driver of kind of overall demand.
but we could also drive a lot of nights and looking and try to just drive them toward lower rate nights. like we're trying to drive a balance of making sure that we have nights growth and revenue growth. and revenue growth obviously pays the bills. and so we're seeing strong growth in the business.
i'm very happy with our q3 results. and on forward guide, like you said, i think we're seeing stable to increasing demand, and we're just really impressed with the resiliency of guests and their willingness to travel and interest in traveling airbnb. and i guess it goes back to the backlog, too, is that the reason why we kind of highlight is just that people are having confidence in travel. so what we're seeing is that, yes, the booking windows are up year over year.
there are a little bit -- there's some seasonality in that. so they're actually booking windows a little bit down from q3. and so as -- the lead times are just up from historical levels because the people are confident in being able to travel. i think that's the important thing you should take away.
operator
and that concludes the question-and-answer session. at this time, i'll turn the conference back over to brian for any concluding remarks.
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. well, first of all, thank you all for joining today. i just want to recap and just say we're incredibly proud of our results, and i believe we're incredibly well-positioned for the future ahead. i hope you all join us in two weeks for 2022 winter release, you'll be able to watch it right from our homepage on wednesday, this is november 16, 8 a.m.
eastern. thank you all, and i'll see you then.

operator
good afternoon, and thank you for joining airbnb's earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2022. as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the investor relations section of airbnb's website following this call. i will now hand the call over to ellie mertz, vp of finance. please go ahead.
ellie mertz -- vice president of finance
good afternoon, and welcome to airbnb's third quarter of 2022 earnings call. thank you for joining us today. on the call today, we have airbnb's co-founder and ceo, brian chesky; and our chief financial officer, dave stephenson. earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of 2022.
these items were also posted on the investor relations section of airbnb's website. during the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on q&a. before i turn it over to brian, i would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ materially, expressed or implied, in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.
these factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the securities and exchange commission. we urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. you should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. also during this call, we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures.
we provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our investor relations website. these non-gaap measures are not intended to be a substitute for our gaap results. with that, i will pass the call to brian. 
brian chesky -- co-founder and chief executive officer
all right. well, thank you, ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. thanks for joining. q3 was another record quarter despite macroeconomic headwinds.
we had nearly 100 million nights and experiences booked, which is up 25% year over year; gross booking value was $15.6 billion, this is up 31% year over year; revenue grew 29% year over year to $2.9 billion, our highest ever; and when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased 36% year over year. now we also had our most profitable quarter ever. net income was $1.2 billion. and this is up $400 million from a year ago.
now this represents a 42% net income margin. adjusted ebitda was $1.5 billion, also our highest ever. and we generated $960 million of free cash flow. in fact, over the last 12 months, we generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow.
what our q3 results demonstrate is that airbnb continues to drive growth and profitability at scale. and even with the macroeconomic uncertainties, we believe that we're well-positioned for the road ahead. now why is this? well, new use cases such as long-term stays and nonurban travel are here to stay. and this is because millions of people now have the flexibility that they didn't have before the pandemic.
at the same time, we've seen recovery in urban and cross-border travel, two of our strongest segments before the pandemic. and just like during the great recession in 2008, when airbnb started, people today are especially interested in earning extra income through hosting. now during the quarter, we saw a number of positive business trends. first, guest demand on airbnb remains strong.
globally, we exceeded 90 million guest arrivals during the quarter, and this is another record. now even with macroeconomic headwinds, nights and experiences booked increased 25%. and during the quarter, we also continued to see longer lead times, supporting a stronger backlog for q4. second, guests are increasingly returning to cities and crossing borders.
both segments continue to accelerate. cross-border gross nights booked increased 58% compared to a year ago. high-density urban nights booked grew 27%. and now even as these two segments return, demand for domestic and nonurban travel remains strong.
third, guests continue to stay longer on airbnb. over the last year, we've seen many companies require their employees to return to the office. and at the same time, long-term stay remain 20% of our total gross nights booked on airbnb. and finally, fourth, our host community continues to grow.
we believe there are several factors that are driving this growth. the first reason is demand drives supply. for instance, in q3, as guests were returning to cities, we saw urban supply accelerate. second, since airbnb in 2008, hosts have consistently turned to airbnb to earn extra income.
in fact, since 2008, hosts on airbnb have earned $180 billion in our platform. third, over last year, we made several product improvements to help onboard and support our hosts. but we're not stopping there. on november 16, we're going to introduce an all-new super easy way for millions of people to turn -- to airbnb their homes as part of our winter release.
we're also delivering a major upgrade to aircover that provides even more top to bottom protection for every host. now with these upgrades and more, we aim to unlock the next generation of hosts and improve the experience for more than 4 million people that are already hosting. so just to recap, we had a record q3, nights and experiences booked were our highest q3 ever, revenue and adjusted ebitda were record high, free cash flow was $950 million. and in the last 12 months, we generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow.
so with that, dave and i look forward to answer your questions.
