thank you. (operator instructions) our first question is from sean eastman with keybanc capital markets. please proceed.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, team. thanks for taking my questions. for me, first, it's great to see the strong new sales bookings in the first half. it would be great to get a better idea of the margin profile embedded in those wins, relative to historical norms and whether there is any concentration from an end market perspective, just to get a sense for where you guys are really having some success there?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, for us -- i don't know that there is specific analytics, but i will tell you, we have been so much more discerning on the kinds of business, we're taking on and looking at that margin profile. and i think we said it before, we look at margin in two ways. one, what's the margin expectation going in and what's the trajectory potential. right. so, this difference between taken on a cost plus account versus the account where you have a kind of fixed price then the ability to accelerate through efficiency and some of the deployments that we're making on the technology side.
so, for us, we think that we're starting to see good traction on margin right at the outset with our plans. and for us the focus, if there was one area to highlight from a growth standpoint, the margin standpoint would be our ats (ph) business. everything around energy and sustainability, right now, it's just been particularly half for us. so that's been -- that's been the area of focus that i would point out.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then for ts (ph), clearly very active, but you guys seem to be sort of cautioning that this 2q trajectory is not really kind of a sustainable rate. but -- maybe just to get a better sense -- it would be great to get a bit of a better sense on how you characterize visibility there, maybe just how far the backlog gets you? maybe the visibility on how that backlog is going to be translating to revenues in the next couple of quarters?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
sure, sean. and i think that the comment in context, so we see great -- the pipeline is the strongest it's ever been. our backlog is at a record and our churn, which is the conversion of that backlog into revenue continue to hover around the 20%, which is the historical low lighter than the historical -- right around that historical average. so we see great prospects over the next 6 to 12 months. my comment was really intended to provide some guidance around the longer-term, 18%, a record phenomenal growth. we expected to be in the mid-digit-- high-single-digit, low-double-digit teens range. so, don't take the comment, at a context we see great prospects over the next 6 to 12 months based on the backlog, and our ability to churn that backlog.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and the other comment i would say too is, one of the things we're seeing -- we're seeing larger scale projects too, which is really encouraging. so if you kind of look at -- if you look two years ago at our average project versus today, you're just going to see that we're gravitating to bigger more complex projects which we're really excited about as a firm.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. and then last one from me, clearly b&i and t&m margin performance was well above expectations for the quarter and then also well above the full year segment margin targets. and it seems like that's the case, even if you take out some of the one-time benefits in the quarter, but it seems like you guys are stopping short of raising the annual target for those segments. so i'm just wondering about some of the moving parts in there and why we shouldn't be thinking about that is the new norm for margin profile.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
well we did -- we actually did raise on b&i, our operating margin trajectory for the rest of the year. so we are seeing improvement. and for us, it really comes down to kind of the discipline in these groups about managing labor and just all the things that we've been talking about over the last few years about standard, operating practices and just being taking the best of what we have and applying it across the board. so it's -- it's something that's been really helpful. and don't get me wrong, we are still super cautious about the labor environment right now and you heard in my prepared remarks, we hoped that things will be better by now know.
it's been a year or more since we've seen these labor pressures. and you know you can read it in the papers, right, there's been no real progress on the integration front. supply continues to shrink and it is disappointing, right. we're a labor business and we'd hoped we'd see just a little bit of moderation to the positive now. and there really is no catalyst at this point to see a turn in that. so that's the disappointing thing for us. but the good news, and you're seeing our results is, if you stay disciplined on how you're managing the business and you put a lot of rigor around the day to day, you could mediate it, which is what we've been doing. but make no mistake, we're a labor company and we are cautious about the labor market.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
it's helpful. thanks for the time.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure.

our next question is from andrew wittmann with baird. please proceed with your question.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hey, great. thanks for taking my question. i guess in your commentary you talked about some of the delays and some of the it spend which is kind of helped in this year's guidance. i guess that means there's a little bit more of an impact probably to next year. and i was just wondering if you guys rollout some of the -- particularly that erp later this year, what the incremental cost is going to be, maybe on a growth and maybe also considering there probably will be some netting effects? just any kind of visibility you can help us as we look into 2020 on this -- in fact just some kind of impact.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. and, our it spend was projected to go up and we anticipate it to continue to increase. these are investments that we had planned out as part of transforming both our front end, time and attendance, all the way through our erp. and over time, all of these are going to have an roi associated with it as we get more efficient on the front-end, as well as the back end and some of the front-end, which is scott's earlier point around the labor management is really being enabled by the technology we've put in place and the discipline around that technology.
so from a sequential standpoint, some of this obviously is going to be capex spend that becomes amortization. so from a sequential standpoint, year-over-year, you've seen roughly a $6 million increase in it spend, some of that again is going to be depreciation, the build as well as moving to software as a service license agreement which we outlined late last year, our approach. as it relates to 2020, the incremental, we see a roughly another $6 million or $7 million of incremental it expense, but that's on a gross basis. we have not yet outlined the netting that's going to be part of the efficiencies from the back office. so you have to take into context that's the growth.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then i guess just my last question here is on the new wins that you announced. so it's good see new win being part of the equation here and it sounds like the sales efforts are really working. those have historically been very tilted and i guess you guys kind of alluded to the fact that those are tilted toward technical solutions. but scott, as you look at the annuity-type business, that's in those new wins and compared to the growth rates here in the quarter, i mean, what do you see in terms of like a net new or kind of, i don't know how you want to be -- i guess it implicates on -- implications on organic growth, but what's the view on organic growth seeing that this quarter was a little bit more subdued. and the wins look good, but i don't know how much of the annuity, can you just talk about that dynamic here as the rest of the year, what you're seeing -- for the rest of year playing out?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure. and i'm not sure you're going to see much of a difference than where we are right now, andy. and i do want to go back to the scene, we've been talking about which is organic growth as a metric kind of -- i think will lead to a false kind of evaluation of where we're going. i would just really encourage everyone to look at the two pieces of organic growth, which is new sales and retention and clearly the numbers speak for themselves on new sales like -- i can tell you being very transparent, if you told me three years ago that we were going to sell $590 million in new business in a six month period. that we -- i know how i would answer that, right.
so what we're doing here, and kind of the investments we're making is really paying off and absolutely more tilted to technical solutions, which, by and large is a good thing, right. it's our highest margin business, so we're excited about it. but i think it's really about retention and we're trending a little lower than historical again which, we've talked about in the past as well. and i'm not sure that's going to change over the next 6 or 12 months, because we really want to keep the discipline of not taking and renewing business that's so far from where we are trying to take this firm, right. so i wouldn't suspect there's going to be much of a change, but i'm biased. but i'd like to think that that is healthy versus unhealthy. so we're going to keep to that. we're going to keep to the rigor around our pricing council and how we're going.
i think for us it's that piece of keeping the new sales machine going and getting the bookings going and just continuing to stay disciplined on the retention front. and i will point out, andy and this is an important thing, we aren't looking this as i kind of spreading the concept like peanut butter, right. there are strategic accounts that we have big, large enterprise strategic accounts where we will moderate on margins, if we have to retain that. it's more about the less strategic accounts where we're making those tougher decisions. and it doesn't feel good for anybody, nobody likes losing business. but, we are changing the profile of how we look at things and we want to feel good about what we're doing and it doesn't feel great when you do any work for free.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
and andy, the only thing i would add that is, if you look at b&i, very disciplined around calling the lower margin business and where they're growing in the book margin business that they're bringing on. on average, it's better margin business than what we've historically seen. so to scott's point, it's the discipline and the maturity that we've come along the way over the last couple of years, that's really starting to bear us some fruit.
operator
our next question is from marc riddick with sidoti & company. please proceed.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi, good morning.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
first of all, i appreciate the pricing discipline comments. so thank you for that. one of the things that i did want to touch on switching gears to business to go into the debt reduction, you mentioned coming down to about 3.3 times. i'm wondering if you had a sort of a near-term target there and what -- and what that might do as far as your current acquisition appetite.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
sure. 2019, we laid out a strategy that internal investments and it, m&a, we're going to take at the -- and continue to be focused on our working capital management to drive down our leverage. and our plan is to drive that leverage down to somewhere under three times by 2020 -- early 2020. and that will give us an opportunity to really look at opportunities in the marketplace, either organic opportunities or inorganic opportunities. and we continue to be focused on managing the dsos to get back to the full year targets we have initially.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. and is there sort of a general view or maybe update that you can give as to what the acquisition pipeline might look like or at least the general view as to maybe what you're seeing out there as far as attractiveness and valuation, things like that. thank you.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so we stay pretty active in looking at opportunities and we feel like we're in the narrative of everything that's in the market and the also being more strategic. there are people out there that have fields out for us knowing how we're thinking about it. but going back to anthony's point, right now, this year 2019 is about paying down debt and getting to the point where we will have that proverbial dry powder in 2020. so we think the pipeline is good. we think that there's going to be some terrific opportunities for us in 2020, when we get to the place where we're ready to do acquisitions again. so it is quite encouraging. there are opportunities in the market.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
and the only thing mark i would add to that is, your question on the valuations. valuations i think are still fairly high. and i think that's really a function around the resiliency of our underlying business. when you look at our business and you compare what's the opportunity for us -- for the market that we are in, it's really a resilient business. so as you start to look at the potential for a slowdown in the economy, businesses like ours that generate the free cash flow conversion that remain sticky, that are driving a lot of attention and a lot of interest both on private equity as well as other investors, that has created a little bit of a dynamic around pricing from a valuation standpoint. but we're going to remain disciplined when the time is right for us to look at opportunities.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for taking my question.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
we have time for one more question, and that will be tate sullivan from maxim group. please proceed.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
hey, thanks. couple of quick questions. (technical difficulty) review, is this the first year-over-year comparable metric you've released for new booking since the november '17 (ph) gca acquisition.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
no, we started with our bookings, the last year, q2 of last year and then we are updating it on an annual basis at the end of the year. so you can expect mid year update, both at the q2 and year-end as far as where we stand as well as the outlook for the upcoming year and obviously, we'll continue with that trend.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
okay. but this mid-year update, the year-over-year growth was the highest in your history, is that what you mentioned earlier?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think -- that's right. and last year it was the highest in our history. we -- and i will tell you candidly well like now, this is going to be a tough comp, when we do this again in 2019. so to be $130 million more than our record of last year, it's just astronomical. so really pleased about that.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
thank you. and real quickly on the healthcare comments is, will you -- will all of healthcare go into b&i or did you say earlier, anthony that will be mixed into different segments and how will that work potentially?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
it will be predominantly into b&i. but we're also looking at the portfolio, specifically on the clinical engineering side as well as the hospital systems that are attached to universities and there could be -- split into both ats (ph) and education. we just haven't finalized the numbers. but i anticipate the majority of predominantly will be in b&i, but education and our technical solutions business will also receive a portion.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
okay. and just a follow-up on that, i think you mentioned maybe a $1 million cost associated with that reorganization effort. and was that in your previous guidance captured between the gaap eps and operating eps guidance?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
it was, yes.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
and it was $1 million. okay. and then real quick, just last aviation margins, i think you touched on a little bit earlier, first half of the fiscal year, they're around 2% versus the 3% guidance, what can help that business in the second half? please.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
so from a revenue standpoint, i think for us, we are seeing the biggest pipeline we've had in years in terms of aviation. so that's really encouraging. and what's interesting is, it's not only the us, but it's the uk as well. so we're seeing great growth. we're actually seeing -- been seeing double-digit growth on the aviation side in the uk, which is great. as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, delta made the decision to insource some of our contracts. and this could be a cyclical business and we've talked about this for years now, there are big chunky contracts and we see it moderate.
so i think we're going to have some headwinds on the growth side going into the rest of this year, just as a result of the annualization of the -- some of the delta losses, but the team has been working so hard over the last 12 months about diversifying our portfolio. so it's not just dealing with the big three right united, delta and american, we're doing business now with jetblue, alaska airlines, scandinavian airlines, like -- so we're going across the board and we're also -- we're also differentiating our offerings, getting into catering and fueling. so team is doing a good job about making sure that no one client is overweighted, but historically delta has been one of the larger pieces of our portfolio. and, don't get me wrong, it's still under 10% of what we do, but i think we're going to be very discerning about diversifying.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
okay. and then, thank you for all the detail earlier on technical solutions too, and that's it for me. thank you.
operator
thank you. this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks, everybody. and again, i just want to reiterate how encouraged we are about where we are from an execution standpoint and this really tough labor market. you think about what we're doing here. and again, you think about four years into this and the growth we've had in our margin profile, and the growth that we've had on margin profile in context to the fact that we are in the worst labor market in modern history. i'm just so proud of the team. and it is going to be the big piece for us over the next couple of years, right. we're going to get these systems implemented this year and you're going to see an abm that when you look at a year ago versus what's going to happen in the next year, we're going to have a new hr system, a new time and attendance system, a new erp system, a new purchase order system, a new t&e system, like we are modernizing our it platform, we're making investments and they'll give us some headwinds as anthony talked about.
but we are planning for the long term here and just think about the -- toward the end of 2020, the year 2020 having a new operating model, focused on industry groups, having a back office, that's modernized with shared service center and national procurement and then finishing off the last leg of 2020 vision with a modernized it platform that's going to give us data analytics to have insights into our business and to leverage the standard operating practices we're doing. we just think it's spectacular.
and i didn't want to end this call without saying how encouraged i am about where we are and how excited i am about all the changes that are happening in the future, because they are foundational to our success long term, and as you can tell i am pretty excited. so thanks for spending the time on the call and we look forward to the next quarterly update. have a great summer everybody.

greetings. welcome to abm industries second quarter 2019 earnings call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. a question-and-answers session will follow the formal presentation. (operator instructions) please note this conference is being recorded.
i will now turn the conference over to your host, susie kim, investor relations and treasurer. ms. kim, you may begin.
susie a. kim -- investor relations and treasury
thank you all for joining us this morning. with us today are scott salmirs, our president and chief executive officer; and anthony scaglione, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
we issued our press release yesterday afternoon announcing our second quarter fiscal 2019 financial results. a copy of this release and an accompanying slide presentation can be found on our corporate website. before we begin, i would like to remind you that our call and presentation today contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements.
our use of the words estimate, expect, and similar expressions are intended to identify these statements. these statements represent our current judgement of what the future holds. while we believe them to be reasonable, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. these factors are described in this slide that accompanies our presentation, as well as in our filings with the sec.
during the course of this call, certain non-gaap financial information will be presented. a reconciliation of those numbers to gaap financial measures is available at the end of the presentation and on the company's website under the investor tab.
i would now like to turn the call over to scott.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, susie, and good morning to everyone on today's call. we issued our press release yesterday afternoon, announcing our fiscal second quarter results. i will review a summary of these results and provide an update of our strategic progress as well. our abm team continues to rise to the occasion as we perform quarter after quarter, while simultaneously managing through our new system deployments, as well as the difficult macroeconomic labor environment. i'm pleased with our strong results for the second quarter, which met and in some cases exceeded our expectations.
we grew our business to a second quarter record of $1.6 billion in revenues. this was driven by 1.7% organic growth, which adjusted for the adoption of asc 606 and 853. this is particularly commendable given our exceptional organic performance last year, which set up a tough year-over-year benchmark for the team.
gaap continuing eps was $0.45 a share or $0.47 a share on an adjusted basis and our adjusted ebitda margin was 5.3% for the quarter. these metrics were also positively impacted by asc 606 and 853 modestly. from a segment perspective, underpinning our operational results, with the business & industry and technical solutions segments. b&i, our largest and most scalable segment continues to highlight how we can protect and grow margin when managing our business strategically and discerningly in the current labor environment.
we expanded business with our large national accounts. as our clients grow, we continue to grow with them. we were also more disciplined about pricing, particularly as we saw escalations to account for the labor pressures we have been experiencing. technical solutions, our most profitable segment from a margin perspective, had another home run quarter as they continue to win business at an unprecedented pace in municipalities and the education segment. during the quarter, we announced some great wins, including two energy projects with bryan county, georgia and the el paso independent school district.
we are now focused on churning through the robust pipeline in this segment. given our year-to-date performance, we are raising the low end of our eps guidance outlook to $1.70 to $1.80 per share on a gaap basis and $1.95 to $2.05 per share on an adjusted basis.
now let me provide you with an update on our progress against our key priorities for the year, which include growing our business in new sales while managing retention, continuing to navigate the difficult labor environment, optimizing our business through technology and data and generating consistent free cash flow.
new sales and retention continues to be an important area of focus. we achieved a record $590 million in new sales bookings for the first half of 2019, compared to $460 million at this time last year, which itself was a record. i'm thrilled about this momentum. we are well on our way to replicating the $900 million we achieved in 2018, an amazing accomplishment and validation of the sales investments we made last year particularly in technical solutions. while we are on track to achieve our new sales targets, managing retention is a separate and distinct endeavor that has required a great deal of planned focus. if you recall, we were prepared for a challenging retention here as we've been dedicated to seeking pricing escalations given the labor environment.
it's always been difficult to command price to the services we provide, but we are committed to pursuing the right decisions for our business. we developed an internal pricing council to increase the rigor around our internal processes and tight strategy to not only grow revenues but margin quality as well.
we have seen mixed results so far this year. our overall retention rate is 1% to 2% of points lower than our historical average, which you'll remember we mostly anticipated. many of our clients have been receptive to discussions around market pressures, but in some cases, we've had to be disciplined and more discerning about the contracts we choose to retain based on the labor shortage we began experiencing last year.
our b&i segment provides a good example of how growth could moderate, but you can maintain and even grow margin and operating profits. there are some segments that are more challenging than others such as aviation which we saw the biggest decline in retention. some will also work with due to pricing. we were also impacted by delta's decision to insource some of their contracts. and remember higher wages and shortages of labor affect this group more than others, due to the protracted time applicants have in getting through the tsa background betting (ph). speed to hiring is imperative in this market. that being said, our aviation segment has a more robust pipeline than they've ever had. and as we continue to focus on business development and building a high talent organization, we see a path back to our original growth and margin vision for aviation over the next 12 to 18 months.
now let me spend a few minutes on the current labor environment. it's been a year since we first started seeing and discussing pervasive labor challenges, as a result of the decline in supply of qualified applicants. since then, it has become a widespread and highly publicized topic of discussion, across industries and regions. by this time, we would have hoped for more improvement in labor market conditions, but we are not seeing any meaningful change which is disappointing. and frankly, we don't see any improvements in the near term, which is also disappointing. this is why we are so focused on quality of earnings and choosing our clients wisely.
as we consider a variety of labor and macroeconomic conditions, it's also important for us to ensure our entire portfolio is best positioned to provide superior service. since the beginning of the year, we've been making structural changes to our healthcare division, including the change in senior management.
after careful evaluation with the new leadership team, we've collectively concluded that remapping and realigning the healthcare business within our other segments primarily b&i will provide the infrastructure necessary to support the efficient growth of this business. of the roughly $250 million in business in this segment, two-thirds of the services are core to b&i. of the specific achieved business, we are maintaining a strong network of subject matter experts to provide expertise to support and grow with our clients. we're all excited about this move, and how we will enable us to leverage our scale and strength and capture the long-term potential of this end market.
anthony will discuss the financial and synergistic implications of this realignment later on the call. improving our infrastructure is a theme for 2019, particularly on the it and data front. as you know, we went live with our new hris and time and attendance systems in the last six months. in may, we went live with our erp system in the uk and was slated to go live in the us later this year. as each system gets implemented, we are learning more and more, how we can apply these tools to maximize efficiencies and gain insights into our business. while still early, we are seeing how building the necessary data history over a period of time can provide benefits long- term. i'm reminded of when we first began our transformational journey in late 2015 and what we've accomplished in less than four years.
we have grown annualized revenues to $6.5 billion more than 30%. we've expanded our margins 40% plus from 3.8% to above 5% and we delivered 20% adjusted eps growth. and the work we've embarked on in 2019 is a continuation of this journey as we build an abm that is positioned for an even stronger and more prosperous long term. i want to thank our entire organization for making all this happen and for another quarter of excellent execution.
i'd now like to turn the call over to anthony.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
thanks, scott and good morning, everyone. before i expand on scott's overview of our second quarter performance, i'd like to quickly review the impact of asc 606 and 853 on our reported results.
in summary, the detailed changes that most impacted us in the quarter were lower revenues associated with service concession arrangement of approximately $12 million reflected predominantly in our aviation segment. lower sales commissions, which are now deferred and recognized over the expected customer relationship period primarily impacted technical solutions by approximately $3.5 million and the deferral of profit on uninstalled materials associated with our technical solutions projects was approximately negative $1.4 million.
as you all know, these two accounting adoptions are not the only change we are managing this year. in addition to the launch of our cloud-based human capital management and time and attendance systems in q1, we are now in the deployment phase of our erp implementation. i too am excited that we launched the first phase of our erp rollout in the uk last month.
the podded approach and phasing will benefit us as we continue with our deployment strategy. i know all of our team members are looking forward to having a unified system where we can finally combine our legacy gca and our legacy abm financial environment. with each quarter, these new systems will help us evolve our processes such as our monthly close. changed management is never easy and i commend all of our teams who are working through our complex project plan to implement our new system, while continuing to manage our day-to-day operations.
as we go live, we'll also be masking (ph) the data history necessary to truly impact our decision-making in the future and that is an exciting prospect for all of us, as this has been a challenging component of our legacy systems.
now turning to our results. revenues for the quarter were $1.6 billion, a total increase of approximately 1% and 1.7% organically versus last year, driven by our technical solutions and aviation segment. on a gaap basis, our income from continuing operations was $29.9 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $25.4 million or $0.38 last year. on an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the quarter increased to $31.5 million or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $31.2 million or $0.47 last year. asc 606 positively impacted these results by approximately $0.03 on both the gaap and adjusted basis.
these results were driven by a combination of higher margin revenue contributions from our technical solutions segment, as well as higher margin mix from our business & industry and technology & manufacturing group. during the quarter, we generated adjusted ebitda of approximately $84.7 million at a margin rate of 5.3%.
now turning to our segments. as a reminder, beginning this year, we began breaking out total interest segment revenue which reflects services provided between our industry group. a historical comparison can be found in slide 24 of today's presentation, which we also provided last quarter. our b&i segment delivered $753 million of revenue and operating profit of $48 million for a margin rate of 6.3%. we continue to see success on many fronts, including ongoing expansions at some of our large national account.
b&i has also been a great example of how this discipline we have build over the year, are beginning to yield favorable margin results. adhering to stricter pricing standards, managing labor more accurately, and pursuing escalations aggressively in the base of the current labor market has to do with the better mix of business.
additionally, on a year-over-year basis, this segment also overcame approximately $2 million of beneficial one-time item, that occurred during the second quarter of 2018. fty rate also helped the quarter, but we anticipate the benefits to reduce in the second half as taxable wage limits are reached.
aviation revenues were $250 million. this reflected roughly $12 million year-over-year reduction related to asc 853, as a result of the accounting for public sector parking leases. these amounts were previously reported as rent expenses, but are now classified of contra revenue. as scott also detailed, this segment continues to overcome the loss of certain contracts from last year. operating profit for the quarter was approximately $5 million.
our team continues to leverage our density while pursuing a two-tiered approach of diversifying our service offerings like catering logistics and fueling, and building upon our subject matter expertise in janitorial at additional airports, both with low cost and regional carriers. as we look at the longer term fundamentals of this industry, we believe infrastructure improvements at airports throughout the us as well as strong travel trends will continue to play into our strength and lead to continued demand for our services over the long term.
technology & manufacturing reported revenues of $224 million, with operating profit of $19 million and operating margins of 8.5%. like the b&i segment, t&m been balancing growth this year with a focus on pricing, when considering retention.
we are expanding with more profitable clients in the high tech sector and we have seen some initial interest for higher technical services pull-through which is a good trend.
revenue in education was $206 million with operating profit of $10.4 million. these results continue to reflect last year's buying season as we were optimizing our newly scalable education group, as a result of the acquisition and integration of gca.
looking forward, we are pleased to be in the midst of the new buying season, so we can finally anniversary last year's lingering effect on our 2019 results and position education well for fiscal 2020. education should also be a primary beneficiary of the system convergence as the education portfolio is currently operating on our legacy platform. transacting and processing team members on two separate systems make them more challenging to manage turnover especially in education, given the higher proportion of non-union contracts.
turning to technical solutions. technical solutions reported revenues of $128 million up almost 18% versus last year with operating profit of $9.5 million at a margin rate of 7.5%. the sales pipeline and project backlog in this business only continues to grow and we cannot be more excited by what the team has delivered.
our strategy of pursuing mega project those defined as over $25 million is beginning to bear fruit and we closed two in the first six months of the year. while we are excited about the unprecedented demand we are seeing in the business we want to remind everyone that this is project based growth and does not necessarily signal a new long-term outlook at current levels.
historically, this business has grown in the high single digits to low teens range and we continue to believe that that is a sustainable expectation for the segment. on the operating profit side technical solutions business is the other segment that is most heavily impacted by this year's new accounting rule.
as i stated earlier, the impact of asc 606 on the current quarter was approximately $2.3 million. on a year-over-year basis last year also saw $2 million in 179 (ph) tax credit, which did not repeat this quarter.
finally, moving to healthcare. revenues were $66 million for the quarter with an operating profit of $2.6 million. the longer-term opportunities for this business have been prudent in growing our presence in the non-acute space as well as more hospital systems. as scott introduced earlier to fully leverage all that abm has to offer, and to align a sales strategy that could take advantage of our reach, we have decided to realign our healthcare operations into other segments. this realignment will occur in the third and fourth quarters of this year. we expect to incur approximately $1 million of additional cost and anticipate once fully integrated to generate between $3 million to $4 million in run rate savings by the end of this fiscal year.
turning to cash and liquidity. cash flow from operations is more than $90 million during the quarter. we have recaptured some of the dso slippage we saw in q1 coming out of an exceptional fiscal 2018 year-end collection. we continue to proactively manage our dso, and outside of any one-time events, including timing of working capital needs for large new job start we continue to expect to replicate last year's cash flow performance. we ended the quarter with total debt including standby letters of credit of $1.1 billion and a bank adjusted leverage ratio of approximately 3.3 times.
during the quarter, we paid our 212 consecutive quarterly cash dividend for a total distribution of approximately $12 million. now for a review of our updated guidance outlook, which does not include any impact from the new accounting pronouncement, which could be zero to positive $0.05 for the year.
today, we are narrowing our gaap and non-gaap guidance reflects our year-to-date performance. we now expect gaap income from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.80 and $1.95 to $2.05 on an adjusted basis. this represents a $0.05 increase to the bottom end of each range.
while our first half performance increases our confidence regarding fiscal 2019, we want to remain prudent given the revenue flow through as we continue to manage retention and our labor carefully. we must also overcome the year-to-date underperformance in aviation, as well as the healthcare segment, which is obviously a much smaller business.
additionally, corporate expenses have also come in below our initial expectations for the first half, due to the reversals of stock based compensation, related to our long-term incentive plan as well as the timing related to the deployment of our it projects. we anticipate some of the it benefits to reverse as we continue deployment in the second half of the year.
we are also narrowing our interest expense expectations for the year. during the first half of this year, interest expense was $27 million, a year-over-year improvement of approximately $2 million. this was driven by continued low short-term rates. in addition, we continue to benefit from the strategy we executed during q2 of fiscal 2018, when we terminated our existing swap and relayered the swap. as a result of these benefits and in conjunction with continued working capital management, we are revising our full year interest expense outlook to $51 million to $53 million.
operator, we are now ready for questions.
",2019-Q2,ABM
1.0,1.0,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of andy wittmann with robert w. baird. please proceed with your question.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great, and good morning. i have a few questions here to start out with, but i guess the first one is for scott. i wanted to get a sense from you as to the outlook here. obviously, i think the exits that you've made in parts of your business, including b&i and other segments as well, are clearly contributing to the margin performance that you're seeing in those segments. given that it sounds like the labor market continues to be challenging for you guys, it sounds like basically potential for more exits to continue.
so with that in mind, scott, i wanted to get your sense as to what the revenue trends could look like in your key segments over the next several quarters? obviously, you walked away from some business that's going to weigh on the revenue trends into next year, but how should we be thinking about that in general, given the challenges that you're facing there and the discipline that you've gone to here in the last couple of years?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
we don't give revenue guidance, but i will tell you, well, we think next year will look pretty stimulus to this year. we don't expect any dramatic change. i think the discipline that you pointed out is not going to change, but we will be adding salespeople. we're going to continue to grow the business. we're on record pace this year, and hope to be next -- last year's performance. so, still healthy on the new business front, but i think next year will look a lot like this year.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. i think it's probably a similar question, but in a little bit different vein on the technical solutions portion here. i mean, obviously, this is the segment that carried the quarter. this is probably the area that most people will be surprised with even if you guys aren't internally. but we heard anthony's commentary, i guess, about this is not the way we should be thinking about the long term. but can you just talk about the backlog of work that you have there, if that gives you confidence for at least high single-digit growth here as we move into '20? and then just this is a project business, that means, it could be more economically sensitive. and i wanted to understand, if you guys are seeing any cracks in the foundation given everyone's concern about the economy and how that could be affecting that project-based business?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
andy i'll take the first part of that question. so, our revenue continues to really benefit from a robust backlog, the churn which is the project conversion rate in our pipeline, which is translating into the growth that you're seeing and we continue to see a great amount of growth in that in the short term. as i mentioned previously, when we see backlog and churn of roughly $150 million at 20%, those are healthy indicators of the business and our backlog is well in excess of those amount. so for the short and medium term, we don't see any real change in terms of the trajectory for the business. but as scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, it is a business that is project-based, and therefore, we have to continue to invest into sales people. but it's resonating quite dramatically with our customer base. and we don't see anything that should impact that in the short term.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, look, and for us, andy, this is -- i'll tell you, like, if we talk about potential slowdown, if you think about how we performed in the last recession, which was the great recession, which was pretty dramatic, we did well as a firm. we didn't have technical solutions then, we didn't have that lever. and if you think about it from a firm standpoint, we were organized by service line back then. so when we were helping to solve problems with clients back then, it was kind of a one solution thing, right? if it was a janitorial assignment, we talk about how that helped them through the recession from janitorial. and you know how well we performed relative to others as a firm last time.
well, now we can talk to them because of the way we structure our industry groups, hopefully, we can provide solutions with other service lines, but on top of that, we have the technical solutions lever that, as you know with these project-based capital, they're not operating in terms of an impact to a client in a recession. so it's capital and it reduces operating costs. so we think the technical solutions team should be really well positioned if the economy turns down.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
that's helpful. i have one other question for now, and i might jump in the question queue later, but it has to do with cash flow. and you guys mentioned that dsos were up a little bit. you had a big target for free cash flow this year that you previously articulated. it seems like the fourth quarter would have to be unusually strong to get to that $200 million level of free cash flow. anthony, how should we be thinking about the free cash flow here for the year?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
great. so our free cash flow for the year-to-date, as i mentioned, is somewhat disappointed due to a few reasons, dso slippage, primarily in our aviation, but a little slippage across all of our industry group and nothing systemic, but slippage, and due to a larger project-based work with some working capital tie up. that's the type of tie up that i like. right, at the end of the day, because it's indicative of us growing that pipeline and growing that business.
but given all those factors and given where we stand at the end of q3, and along with our outlook for the remainder of the year, we expect our free cash flow will be closer to the $175 million mark versus the $200 million plus mark that we achieved in 2019. so a little bit down, but we're constantly focusing on it on this. and we are also looking to improve the dso in q4 and beyond.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
cool. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from line of sean eastman with keybanc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, team. thanks for taking my questions. i guess first one from me is just reading between the lines on the prepared remarks. it seems like assuming the status quo in the current operating environment that it's going to be pretty tricky to expand margins in fiscal '20. am i thinking about that correctly?
and secondly, it would be helpful at this point to just round up some of the headwinds and tailwinds as we think about next year just in terms of maybe some non-recurring items, the discrete tax items, where the level of it spend is going, things like that, just so we can think about some of the puts and takes really out here.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
sure. good questions. so i think when we look at margins, we look at it in the operating segments and then you could look at the bottom line ebitda. so, for us, it's so core in this market to protect the operating margins in the segments. and, we've done a really good job of that. i think surprising a lot of folks, to be quite honest, right, on how well we've done and we expect to be as disciplined next year to protect those margins. as it flows through to bottom line margins, yeah, that can be pressured because we are making investments in our it systems and hr.
and lot of this was planned starting back in 2016, when we said, how do we accelerate this company. we said right out of the gate that our systems were not where they need to be, our process wasn't where we need to be. so these were all planned investments that have come into fruition. and it has been a little bit more acute on the hr side, because we had to react to this environment, right. we hire 70,000 people a year, right. so we have to make those investments. so you will see incremental year-over-year in that corporate side related to hr and systems that will pressure the flow through on the bottom line margins, but we would encourage everyone to look to the operating segments.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. so, i mean all in, does that mean margins might actually tick down next year? just trying to get to -- just make sure we're thinking about things correctly.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, look, we're still racking up the budget. we are just entering into the fourth quarter, but there is a chance that it will head down next year, all things being equal.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. got it. that's helpful.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
and again, i would say, look at our operating segments versus bottom line ebitda. the operating segment is the health of what we're doing.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
i get it. and i guess another question is just, this year we put the hr system in place. you've got the card based time and attendance system in place. the erp backup consolidation is under way. i'm wondering, where the incremental it investments are going next year exactly?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yes. sean, it's not incremental. so, some of the systems that we're investing in today go live in the next fiscal year. so, take our us erp that can just become part of the operating environment next year. so, it's all in line with my previous remark in q2 in terms of the year-over-year impact related to it and it's really just a deferral of expense that we expected this year being deferred in to the next fiscal year. so from a cash flow perspective, the investments that we're making should temper off because some of the -- as we get the systems up and running and then, we move to a more operating environment in terms of the expense.
yeah. and the incremental side, if there's going to be incremental side, that will be really around hr, because we think we're going to continue to invest in. it's so critical for us, right, hiring, speed-to-hire in this market, we've said this for a while now, someone comes in and fills out an application, you want to close it in that day or the next day. you wait a week, they're going to have a job somewhere else, right. so we're bringing on recruiters, we're enhancing our systems and we're standardizing practices.
sean, if you were to go back to 2016, everything in this firm was distributed into the field. we have 300 branches. they all have their own hiring practices, their own ways of doing things. we're centralizing now into more of a corporate orientation where hiring practices, onboarding, training, all are going to be standardized with best practices, which was really the theme of 2020 vision. so, there will be some incremental cost, but you'd expect that because we don't believe the labor crisis is going abate in 2020. i don't think anyone does.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. it makes a lot of sense. and last one from me just on free cash flow outlook, revised down a little bit for fiscal '19. but i'm wondering how to think about next year? will some of the aviation receivables unwind, should we see receive decent free cash flow growth next year in your view? [indecipherable] anthony.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
yes, i think it's a little too early. and at year end we will provide the outlook. in terms of the aviation, it's a challenging, consolidated customer base that i don't think is -- i don't think we're any different than any supplier that deals with the aviation, big clients and big customer base in terms of their ability to drag out their table. so we're working actively to ensure that where we work with them and ensure that the dsos are a focus area and they have been a focus area. but we also have some incremental costs, as scott mentioned, but offset by investments that we're making today in our systems, that should abate next year. so overall, we see continued good cash flow generation for the future.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and i will just sneak one more in. apologies to the other people on the call, but maybe you could just update us on the anticipated deleveraging trajectory and whether you guys think you might be back in the market for an acquisition at some point in fy '20?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, that's always been the plan. when we did the gca acquisition in september '17, we said, we're going to take a pause on acquisitions for the next 18 months, 24 months because, first of all, we had to integrate gca. we were over 4 times levered. and we said we want to get under 3 times lever before we go back on the market. so that's where we'll be in 2020. and we expect if there is an opportunity that makes sense for our strategy, that we'll be acquisitive in 2020 for the right opportunity.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much, gentlemen. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from line of tim mulrooney with william blair. please proceed with your question.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
good morning.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. tim.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
can you guys dive a little deeper into the conversation that you're having with clients these days? i mean, it sounds like maybe they're incrementally more cautious than maybe they were six months ago. is that a fair characterization, and is there any more color you can share with investors this morning?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure. that's good. yeah. i think everyone's more cautious, right because, i mean, i don't have to tell you, right. [indecipherable], is there tariffs or there are no tariffs, right, what's going on with trade wars, with the potential recession. so, everyone is in this mode of what's next, but we still have really good traction, good conversations with clients. and i think they appreciate what we're doing and the data that we bring. we are different than many competitors because we do think we have better analytics. so a lot of times they look to us for insight of what we're seeing with other clients, which is where our scale helps because we could rationalize what's going on in the market across different regions. but they are active conversations and everyone's just curious about what everyone else is doing and where the economy is going.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
okay. thanks. kind of along that same line, scott, given all the changes that you've made in the portfolio, you and anthony, and the operational changes you've done over the last couple years, i mean, would you expect the business to perform differently in the next slowdown as compared to the last several recessions?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
i would have to say yes, and it's what i alluded to earlier. now that we're an industry group format and not selling single services, hopefully, we have more solutions to bring to the clients to get better traction. we like to think we have better data now, better analytics to help clients understand what their options are from a cost standpoint, from an efficiency standpoint, if they make specification changes. we have technical solutions now, we have this extra component to say, look, we know you're pressured on cost, here's an opportunity to reduce energy, right, and become more efficient. so we think we are much better positioned in a recession as a firm. and again, i'll read it back, it was a terrible period for our economy in '08 and '09 last time, and we did, relatively speaking, pretty well. so, hopefully, that'll prove out again and with a little plus sign next time.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then, anthony, just one more for you. asc 606 and asc 853, i think, you said that could be a favorable $0.05 impact for the full year. where are we today, what's the impact today so that i can understand the implied impact for the fourth quarter? thank you.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
yes. year-to-date, we're roughly $0.07 of a positive impact. and if you recall, when we initially gave guidance back in december of last year, we had anticipated $0 to $0.05. and now it's primarily related to the uninstalled component, which was the carryover from that fiscal '18. so, at this point, we continue to feel it's going to be closer to that $0.05. it's, obviously, going to be somewhat contingent on operations, but that's what we're going with in terms of our guidance for the full year.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from line of tate sullivan with maxim group. please proceed with your question.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
hi. thank you. thanks. good morning. first on education, i mean, the revenue was up 4% year-over-year, but you mentioned some aggressive bidding, and then, i think you indicated slightly higher margins in education. i mean was it below planning, or did you lose bids you thought you'd win, or can you just give more context to that comment, please, because it seems it certainly performed better than some of your other segments?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks for the question. generally, we were disappointed with the buying season, the execution, and that was really a function of two things. one was the pricing environment, as well as the realization on new sales and retention. that being said, the operating profit came in line. we were able to offset our labor costs by good overhead savings and other savings within the mix, but clearly disappointed by the buying season, which really impacts half the business. it's really the k-12. the other half on the university, or higher res side, that buying season is throughout the year. so, to scott's earlier remarks around our new go to market strategy and leading with solutions, we remain optimistic that the next 12 months will produce a better operating environment and hopefully, a better margin pull through than we've seen this year.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
okay. thank you. and well, switching to aviation real quickly. did i hear you say organic growth rate of 5.7% in one of the segments in aviation, or can you just go back and review that comment, please?
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
we've had organic growth in aviation, but we've also had some contraction in the us business. so when we look forward, while new sales and retention have been somewhat of a challenge, we're seeing good opportunities as it relates to specifically our fueling and catering in our uk operations, and i believe that comment was in relation to our service concessions.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
service. okay. thank you. and then last for me. and then in technical solutions, can you just give some context, what specifically do you do in ev charging?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
so in ev charging we will actually do the installation, we will partner with the actual hardware companies, and then, we'll go to big manufacturers, someone like a bmw or porsche, and we'll say, look for all your dealerships or in all the locations you want in north america, let's plan that out, and then we do kind of a full turnkey installation and then try to lock in the servicing after that. this business has grown for us dramatically. we are the clear number one now in this segment and it's getting more traction and we haven't even scratched the surface yet of cross-selling this to our clients. we're just starting, but this is kind of kudos to our ats team. this is all organic growth that they're finding out there. and it's been spectacular for us. and as we all know, the trends are heading in such a positive direction. so really going to be a good platform for us.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
just quick follow up on that. do you currently do the ev charging service for any of clients and janitorial service, for instance, or does that go to your point about starting that effort?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
we do, but it's more spotty than we like, right. and that's part of really for us getting more mature at cross-selling.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
okay. thank you for those comments.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from line of marc riddick with sidoti & company. please proceed with your question.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi. good morning.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i wanted to touch on -- a lot of my other questions are already answered. i just wanted to touch on maybe some of the progress or some of the areas that you're looking at as far as new service offerings. you touch a little bit on some of those earlier, but i just want to get a sense of where you're seeing opportunities and some of the initial benefits. whether it's the airplane fueling assignments or some of the other things that we might look forward to support for new services? thanks.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i think we've seen what we could do with fueling and catering. and that's really just -- you're talking about something that really over the last 12 months to 18 months has really started taking off, no pun intended, in the aviation sector. so as we look and build on that and let's go back to the ats group and how really ev charging started organically outside of the core projects, we were starting to look at how much work we're doing in data centers and mission critical stuff. i think that's an area that we're going to be exploring over the next 12 months to 24 months, how this could really turn into something, because if i were to give you the list, and i'm not allowed to, but if i were to give you a list of the silicon valley based firms that we do work for their data center and their power testing and have been, think about what's going on with cloud, right, which is essentially data centers. the expansion plans for our clients in terms of opening and lighting up data centers is actually mind blowing. and we're right there with them.
so i think there is opportunities for us. what we do is kind of, we think about leveraging the adjacencies, right. we have our core businesses. what are the adjacencies and how do we leverage them, and that's all wrapped into our strategy for next year and the next down three years to five years.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. thank you very much.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
great. thanks marc.
operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. i'll now turn the floor back to management for any final comments.

yeah. i just want to thank everybody for the call. sadly, summer is over and we are charging into fall here. but we're excited to come back to you in q4. we'll have our budgets all wrapped up. we'll talk about how we finished the year. hopefully, we are going to have some good announcements on our sales trajectory, which we've been spending so much time on and so much focused on. so looking forward to the follow up conversations.
thanks to everyone. and again, i just have to thank my team for everything they've done to get us to this point. it's really proven our team. and thank you.

greetings and welcome to the abm industries third quarter 2019 earnings call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, susie kim, vice president of investor relations and treasurer for abm industries. thank you. you may begin.
susie a. choi -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
thank you all for joining us this morning. with us today are scott salmirs, our president and chief executive officer, and anthony scaglione, executive vice president and chief financial officer. we issued our press release yesterday afternoon announcing our third quarter fiscal 2019 financial results. a copy of this release and an accompanying slide presentation can be found on our corporate website.
before we begin, i would like to remind you that our call and presentation today contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. our use of the words estimate, expect, and similar expressions are intended to identify these statements. these statements represent our current judgement of what the future holds. while we believe them to be reasonable, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. these factors are described in the slide that accompanies our presentation, as well as in our filings with the sec.
during the course of this call, certain non-gaap financial information will be presented. a reconciliation of those numbers to gaap financial measures is available at the end of the presentation and on the company's website under the investor tab.
i would also like to remind everyone that this quarter's results reflect our updated five-segment structure with healthcare remapped and integrated into our business & industry, technical solutions and education segments. for comparative purposes, we have provided historical comparisons in the appendix section of today's presentation.
i would now like to turn the call over to scott.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, susie, and good morning, everyone. as i'm sure you read, we announced another solid quarter of performance in yesterday's earnings release. we expanded our business, both organically and profitably against last year, and our organization is delivering on the commitments we made to manage our business discerningly, as we pursue top-line new sales growth and remain disciplined on margin, themes you've consistently heard.
specifically, we reported a record revenue quarter, reflecting organic growth of 2.3%, with an adjusted ebitda margin at 5.6%. our earnings per share also grew to a gaap eps of $0.55 and $0.60 on an adjusted basis. asc 606 and asc 853 had a minimal impact on these results, which anthony will discuss in greater detail.
we are on pace to end the year in line with our expectations and we're reaffirming our eps guidance outlook of a $1.70 to $1.80 per share on a gaap basis, and a $1.95 to $2.05 per share on an adjusted basis. and as a reminder, last quarter, we narrowed our range by raising the low end by $0.05 per share.
i want to thank our team members for their relentless dedication through another quarter of persistent labor challenges and economic uncertainty. unfortunately, the operating environment continues to be extremely difficult for our industry group as we have not yet reached an inflection point in the current cycle. unemployment remains at historic lows and labor supply remains exceedingly tight. with a more competitive hiring landscape and higher turnover costs pertaining to recruitment, training and onboarding are increasing. the immigration narrative is likely contributing negatively to wage pressure and supply as well, and unfortunately, we are not expecting any near-term changes to ease pressures.
as you know, in our business, wage inflation affects us more dramatically as the majority of our contracts are fixed price. the pricing environment has not yet caught up to the incremental wage pressures that have been occurring since early 2018. in many cases, we are still seeing regional competitors bid on work using estimated wage rates that are not reflective of the current market conditions and future expectations.
while this has caused retention pressures for us as we rebid work, our margins reflect estimates that emanate from our operators' responsible and sustainable pricing. in fact, in some instances, we have seen clients return to abm as they've experienced how non-sustainable low bids can impact service and quality.
we're also beginning to see uncertainty with the economy impact client decision-making. there are instances where award cycles are more prolonged as clients want time to assess the rising wage environment and see clarity on whether there will be a downturn in the us economy. all of these factors have contributed to a difficult retention year for us in 2019, and based on what we're seeing today, and as i discussed last quarter, we do not expect these dynamics to change in the near term.
to mitigate these challenges, we've been managing what is in our control. we have steered our business strategically by reviewing our legacy contracts to seek price escalations where and when appropriate. we adopted a disciplined approach to pricing new business as we balance pursuing profitability and growth with managing risk.
we instituted acute labor management practices to increase productivity and defend against compression and we've invested heavily in our human resources team to improve recruiting and onboarding. across abm's size and scale, these actions can and have served us well. b&i's performance this year is a great example.
our diversified portfolio has also benefited us. technical solutions, continues to capitalize on the demand for energy efficiency and has driven growth across all of their offerings, including bundled energy solutions, easy charging installation and data center power testing. in fact, our entire energy and power services group is experiencing phenomenal growth as demand shifts toward sustainability.
technical solutions has certainly become a critical part of the abm brand offering. it's a foundational component of cross-selling, and we are leveraging our talent and sales expertise to augment other areas of our business. for example, over the past three months, we have appointed key sales leadership from the technical solutions group to senior roles within our education industry group.
during the recent buying season, our education group's bid acceptance was low. the heavily non-union environment and the ability for regional competitors to make wage assumptions that don't forecast what we see as a reality of rising wage rates, impacted our retention and new sales. the new sales leaders of this group are building a go-to-market strategy to differentiate abm from those competitors.
we intend to change the narrative around pricing to demonstrate to clients the value we can create for them by bundling energy programs along with our leading position in custodial, grounds keeping and maintenance. generally speaking, cross-selling will be at the core of our approach. we are actively adding salespeople and account managers through retention and implementing cross-selling training.
we believe in the potential for increased outsourcing in the education sector as schools review their aging operations. and as we've envisioned when first acquiring gca, we are determined to incentivize new and existing clients to outsource by capitalizing on our unique facilities, maintenance and energy bundling capabilities in the way only abm can.
our year-to-date enterprise progress has shown us that focusing on our team members is the key to unlocking greater potential for the firm. we have invested in people to instill a sales culture that is on pace to achieve $1 billion in new sales this year, which would be another record year. we've introduced new tools to help our operators manage the labor more effectively and we continue to invest by adding hr team members to support the growing needs created by the current environment and the need to use speed to hire and best in class onboarding as a competitive weapon.
in addition to adding hr team members, we are making planned corporate investments in an hr structure that centralizes and more importantly, standardizes hiring and training practices. remember, when we started 2020 vision, we inherited our legacy distributed approach across our 300 branches with no leverage from standardization.
we are fostering a dna driven model that measures key metrics such as retention and labor performance to inform decisions and ultimately contain costs. with the investments we've been making in our hr technology platform, this is becoming possible. i just returned from a quarterly business review meetings with our industry group presidents and they were enthusiastic about the expanded engagement and increased productivity from their hr business partners. as we've been rolling out our new hr model, we are starting to see open positions being filled more quickly. this will lead to reductions in overtime, which as you can imagine, is pressured when job sites have team member vacancies.
and investments in hr are not solely about reducing overtime or speed to hire, we believe that supporting the team member experience can drive longer term value through improved retention, higher quality talent acquisition and reduced reliance on temporary workers, which are at higher cost. and don't forget, these are all elements which enhance the client experience. in fact, we recently conducted an enterprisewide client survey and reducing employee turnover was one of the central quest we heard across all of our clients.
a higher cost model has been necessary to grow and offset margin compression. with no near-term change on the labor front, a similar level of attention will be required going forward in order for us to maintain our business with the same core principles. the investments in our hr organizations and systems will prove out to be the game changer for abm over the next two years to three years.
as an organization, we are really proud of where we've been heading over the past four years. it's certainly not easy modernizing ingrained processes and systems of a 110-year old company, and if that weren't enough, throw in the worst labor crisis in modern history. fortunately, we have an amazing team and our confidence has only grown stronger for the long term.
now, before i turn the call over to anthony, i'd be remiss if i didn't congratulate our finance and shared services team for successfully closing our first quarter with a new erp system in the uk. we still have a long road ahead of us, but our uk launch in may and now our first uk close is a milestone that will benefit the entire organization for years to come and help provide a roadmap for our us erp upgrade. i want to thank anthony and his teams for anchoring our business as they close our financials quarter after quarter on multiple systems. anthony?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
thanks, scott. before i recap the quarter's results, i would like to provide my customary synopsis of the impact of asc 606 and asc 853. given we are three quarters into the year, i also want to discuss how the new accounting rule has developed throughout the year.
our quarterly results reflect lower revenues of approximately $12.5 million associated with asc 853 related to service concession arrangements, primarily reflected in our aviation segment. the deferral of profit on unsold materials associated within our technical solutions project was approximately negative $0.7 million. lower sales commissions, which are now deferred and recognized over the expected customer relationship period, was approximately $2.2 million, primarily impacting technical solutions.
our initial guidance range anticipated an impact due to 606, which at the time was primarily related to unsold materials that were a carryover of amounts previously recorded in fiscal '18. moving to q3 and our earnings per share outlook for the full year, the predominance of the 606 impact has stemmed from the sales commissions cost. i want to point this out that as the year has progressed, tremendous growth within our technical solutions segment has enlarged this impact. while for transparency we have delineated these accounting items, i want to note that the sales commission piece is more operational in nature versus the carry-forward of prior years unsold materials.
now onto the quarter. revenues were $1.6 billion, driven by our technical solutions and aviation segments. on a gaap basis, our income from continuing operations was $36.5 million, or $0.55 per diluted share compared to $33.7 million, or $0.51 last year. before moving on, i am pleased to report that these results reflect a $3.7 million favorable impact from insurance, a material improvement since we launched our comprehensive safety and risk program exactly four years ago.
year-after-year, we have seen our prior year adjustments decrease, speaking to the success of the program and its results. it has certainly continued to be a significant challenge due to the unpredictability of complicated societal forces. however, our aggressive procedures to resolve open cases as well as our continued focus and investment in safety personnel and programs has resulted in more stability than we have witnessed over the past few years.
i'm cautiously optimistic that our results are demonstrating a sustainable pattern of decreased volatility. i'd like to thank jessica morgan, who leads our insurance group and the whole risk and safety team for the progress we have made thus far.
moving to adjusted income from continuing operations, for the quarter, it was $40.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to $38 million, or $0.57 last year. on both a gaap and non-gaap basis, our results were driven by a combination of higher margin revenue contribution from our technical solutions business segment, as well as a higher margin mix and continued disciplined labor management within business & industry. during the quarter, we generated adjusted ebitda of approximately $93 million at a margin rate of 5.6% versus $88.4 million and 5.4% last year.
now turning to our segment result, as susie stated earlier, our healthcare segment was seamlessly integrated into our b&i, education and technical solutions segments during the quarter. we are already starting to see some of the benefit from the new structure. for example, we have begun to pursue and have seen initial success with escalations and the optimization of route-based services, leveraging the b&i network and healthcare account.
moving to b&i, b&i reported revenue of $807.9 million versus $822.6 million last year. the year-over-year decline in revenue is attributable to the loss of certain account, mainly lower margin and underperforming contracts that we did not retain given unfavorable pricing dynamics. b&i continued to expand with large national accounts that complement our growth strategy in the current labor market.
operating profit for the quarter was $45.3 million for a margin rate of 5.6%, reflecting an approximately 70 basis point increase versus last year. as scott discussed earlier, our discerning approach to labor management and pricing renewals drove this increase and b&i continued to perform well in this challenging environment.
aviation revenues were $263.3 million, reflecting a $12 million negative impact related to asc 853 as a result of the accounting for public sector parking leases. these amounts were previously reported as rental expenses, but are now classified as contra revenue. organic growth for the quarter was 5.7%, reflecting new business including the continued expansion of our catering logistics services, and a continued growth in our international operations.
operating profit was down approximately $1 million to $8.6 million for margin rate of 3.3%. while we see a strong pipeline in aviation, the business continues to underperform versus expectations as higher levels of overtime and tight labor conditions continue to negatively affect this segment.
technology & manufacturing reported revenues of approximately $227 million versus $231 million last year, with operating profit growing to $17 million for a margin rate of 7.5% versus 7.3% last year. these results reflect a loss of certain account, partially offset by the addition of new business wins within hi-tech and logistics clients. operating margin expansion versus last year was driven by lower reserves established for client receivables and the loss of certain lower margin account. we continue to monitor the pace of expansion, particularly with our manufacturing clients, for any change in decision making or scope.
revenue in education was $215.4 million and operating profit with $12.6 million for a margin rate of 5.8%, which expanded 24 basis points versus last year. as scott noted, we are excited about our new go-to-market strategy given the rationalization of our education portfolio following some softness in the recent buying season.
technical solutions reported revenues of $165.7 million, up 27.6% organically versus last year. this represents an all-time quarterly high since the reorganization of this business in 2017, driven by broad-based demand in the us. energy project continued to expand with municipalities and large school systems. we recently announced contract wins with warren county, pennsylvania, and aiken county public schools in south carolina. the two mega projects that i highlighted in q2 have also contributed to this revenue growth.
also, our ev charging business has also expanded aggressively this year with sales growth outperforming any other year. clearly, we are all thoroughly excited about the growth of our technical solutions business and how well our solutions are resonating in the market. however, i would like to reiterate my sentiments from last quarter. growth in this business is project-based and has historically grown in the high-single digit to low teen range. current performance does not necessarily signal a new long term outlook.
operating profit for segment was $17.9 million at a 10.8% margin compared to $13.1 million and 10% margins last year. this reflects higher project revenue and lower motivation expense following the impairment of our uk business at the end of last year. partially offsetting these results was the blend of our project and related churn rate. and again, these results reflect a $1.3 million impact related to the treatment of commissions under asc 606 given technical solutions exceptional growth.
turning to cash and liquidity, cash flow from operations was $57.6 million during the quarter. we've seen a slight increase in our dsos over the last several months that is attributable to a few items, including working capital needs for our larger technical solutions project and some delays due to unique billing reconciliations in aviation. for the remainder of the year, we remain staunchly focused on reducing our dsos.
we ended the quarter with total debt, including stand by letters of credit, of $1.1 billion and a bank adjusted leverage ratio of approximately 3.2 times. during the quarter, we paid our 213th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for a total distribution of $11.9 million.
now turning to guidance. as stated in our press release, we are reiterating our guidance outlook for the year. we continue to expect gaap income from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.70 to the $1.80, and $1.95 to $2.05 on an adjusted basis. this guide includes the impact from the new accounting pronouncements, asc 606 and asc 853, which we believe could be approximately $0.05 for the year.
looking at fiscal 2020, in line with scott's commentary, we remain cautious regarding retention and continue to monitor labor carefully for the remainder of the year. based on our visibility in the near term, we're expecting to go-forward to have a very similar operating environment to this year and a corresponding level of pressure on retention.
additionally, while helping us navigate the current challenging environment, we continue to make investments in hr and it projects as part of our commitment to elevating our people, processes and systems. on the it and systems front, as scott graciously acknowledged, we just closed our first quarter under our new erp system in the uk. this was the first step to our phased implementation roadmap.
our target dates have shifted slightly. given our year end and to ensure we have accounted for all the testings, training and changed management strategies necessary to launch in north america, we now intend to go live in north america in early 2020 rather than later this calendar year. canada will be the first north american launch and the us will follow shortly thereafter.
with all the changes we have implemented over the past several years and continuing in the foreseeable future, i've seen an admirable level of adaptability from the entire organization, and i thank everyone for enabling us to make the necessary progress to strengthen abm for our future.

operator
thank you. at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] thank you. our first question is from the line of sam kusswurm with william blair. please proceed with your question.
sam kusswurm -- william blair -- analyst
hey guys, how's it going?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
good morning.
sam kusswurm -- william blair -- analyst
now that you're almost two months into fiscal 2020 i was hoping you're able to go into your estimate for new sales growth this year.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
so, first, we don't obviously give revenue guidance, but from a sales perspective, we're really optimistic we crossed over the $1 billion mark this year. and if you would ask me two or three years ago if that was possible, it would have been such a stretched target.
so we've now set that as the benchmark. we continue to add in salespeople and we see our new sales booking in the high single-digit area and really enthusiastic about even what we're seeing at the start of the new year in our pipeline, so you know, thumbs up in that area for us.
sam kusswurm -- william blair -- analyst
awesome. are there any particular end markets or geographies that are having an outsized impact on that new sales?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
look, we always strive for across the board and we allocate resources accordingly. but ats will continue to be strong for us. and if you think about the dynamics in that end market, right, with sustainability and energy, it's where we have our largest proportion of sales people. and you know, look at this year, right, i mean, we're not necessarily expecting to replicate what we did this year, but we were -- as we said in the release, we're over [phonetic] 19% growth for the year. so we're really optimistic about the ats market.
sam kusswurm -- william blair -- analyst
excellent. well, best of luck in the next year here. thanks.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
thank you.

the next question is from the line of david silver with cl king. please proceed with your question.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
yes, hi. i had a couple of -- well i had one question, i guess, on the adjustments and then i had a more of a strategic question. and i -- just to preface, i had to step out for a couple of minutes. i apologize if some of this was covered and i make you repeat yourself. but the last couple of quarters you've had this self-insurance adjustment of several million dollars and it's treated as an adjustment for -- analyzing the quarter's results as it applies to a previous period.
but you know it is money i think that works to your advantage. so i was just wondering if you could maybe talk about that general book of business -- book of insurance business for yourself and whether it's been looked at and whether there is significant further positive adjustments i guess over time. in other words, is that a hidden source of cash or gaap earnings going forward?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
great. and welcome to the team david. this is anthony. so we're very encouraged and proud of the dedicated effort we made in both the pre and post loss management. as you know, the balance sheet amount is a highly subjective, actuarially determined amount and we look at that balance on a quarterly basis and the adjustments that you're seeing are related to the actuarial estimated long-term estimate of where those liabilities land.
so what our goal is to try to reduce the volatility both positively and negatively associated with that balance, and we're starting to see some of that volatility come down. as it relates -- and those are non-cash charges, just to be clear. these are long-term tail type liabilities.
as we look forward, there is opportunities, obviously, with the continued success that we're having on pre-loss, which is the safety side to influence the go-forward, which could result in a lower expenses on a go-forward basis, but at this time, it's too premature.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. and so, just to clarify, the $5.4 million adjustment, that's on a mark-to-market basis, that's not just one quarter analysis of the reserves that you took some time ago versus actual experience. so the $5.4 million is trueing-up your entire portfolio?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
that's true in every loss year from 2018 and prior. so [speech overlap].
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
yes, sorry. thank you for that. one of the -- in issuing your initial 2020 guidance, you know you cited incremental it spending an incremental human resource spending. so on the it side, could you, i was wondering if you could maybe characterize the incremental spending you're seeing in terms of what this spending that was originally considered part of vision 2020 and maybe just wasn't captured through that period or is it incremental spending that may be went a little over budget tied to 2020 or is this spending that may be characterized it as a vision 2025 program.
in other words, you're already moving beyond the targets or the functions that were captured in vision 2020 and you're already moving beyond that you're setting your targets for it capabilities higher. thank you.
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
great. i'll take that question and hand it over to scott. so, our guidance and results fully incorporate both the capex development and ongoing operating expenses associated with the subscription model. so just for context, we're moving from a primarily on-premise model to more of a cloud-based service across all of our major work streams, including hr, finance, and time and attendance.
so one of the pillars of our 2020 vision was the modernization of our it infrastructure. and at the time when we first initially launched 2020, we realized there is a need for that it investment. but while we were a bit higher on the development of the capex, we still remain in line with our previous estimate on savings and on an ongoing operating expense. what we probably haven't yet quantified is the full benefits that will accrue once all the systems are live and we expand that functionality.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and what i would just say more strategically is, for us, you think about the fact that we've been clear over time that we've under invested in this area and to bring us up to speed now and get ready for kind of the digital evolution that's happening in our business. i think it's just -- it's the right time to make the right investment, have best-in-class systems. it's really -- for us, it's going to help us leapfrog into the future.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay, and then just one last question and i know you've touched on this in your prepared remarks, but the -- bringing on a person in a brand new role as the chief strategy and transformation officer. i understand that you have certain targets and he brings something to the table from his previous work with your company.
but if we were to have this conversation may be a year from now, if we're looking out december of 2020, what one or two achievements are accomplishment measurable would you -- scott, would you want to see from that addition to your strategy team? in other words, how should we -- what might we look at maybe an interim milestone or two to see if this strategic addition is having the desired effect on your structure and on your operations?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, a couple of comments. first, you can only imagine how delighted we were to actually bring on more of the top partners of bcg to come and help us with what we're doing and i think the best way to start is like the things that he'll be working on.
one is going to be our business mix and strategy going forward, now that we're kind of coming toward the end of 2020 vision, right. so i think he's going to be looking at the strategic direction for the firm and then managing all of the transformation that's going on at the firm between the it systems being implemented and best practices, that's going to be a core area, but where we'll see the most foundational change quickly, i think, is in implementing best practices.
we brought on what we call the abm way or we call it operational excellence and taken the things that we've seen that we've been rolling out like labor management and building on that and creating form and function across all the other industry groups, hopefully we will see a tightening of some of our labor controls, labor percentages, how we schedule.
labor is a very complicated area. it's what we do, right. and there is so many sub-work streams within labor; again how we schedule people, how you staff their job, how you source labor. so i think across those different work streams, it's going to be -- he is going to have just a foundational impact and is building a team around that. so as we go from 2020 and beyond -- again, we couldn't be more excited.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
our next question is from the line of justin hauke with baird. please proceed with your question.
justin hauke -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
yes. hi, good morning. i guess i wanted to hopefully get a little bit more color around the margin expectations for 2020 and maybe you can help us get some confidence around them. so maybe just starting on the corporate line. i guess, anthony, if you can quantify for us, what's the year-over-year delta on the spending for the it and hr investments that you've highlighted?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
yeah, our corporate line, overall, from an outlook perspective, is going up roughly $25 million. of that half is going to be it and hr related, and then the rest is going to be associated with items associated with corporate -- our stock-based compensations in corporate across the enterprise. so half of that increase is related to our it and hr and then the other is going to be sprinkled around other corporate initiatives and developments.
justin hauke -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
okay, good. that's helpful. and then i guess for the segment guidance, i guess the two areas where maybe we'd appreciate a little bit more color on how you get there, but aviation and education are the two markets where you've had the most labor market pressure, the difficulty in hiring people. and in both of them, you're looking for pretty meaningful margin expansion next year.
so if you could bucket it, i know you've got a little bit less amortization expense in education, that's going to benefit there. and you mentioned anniversarying some of the lost contracts. maybe if you could just quantify the margin impact from those two and then how much is left from kind of the internal initiatives that you guys are launching?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i'll take it in two buckets aviation and education. for aviation, i think it's a -- maybe a different story than education. for aviation 2019, we were really culling the portfolio. we were looking very hard at non-performing contracts and made some tough decisions that i think will end up inuring to a higher margin and we've baked that in.
so that -- aviation, on top of, we expect better and better operating discipline, of course you do that for every area. on top of that i think it's the business mix in terms of clients. so, we'll see a lift there.
and on the education front, the list is really going to be -- come from our go-to-market strategy. we made a change mid-year last year about how we're going to approach the market, how we're going to be more focused on the technical solutions offering and how we could bundle that into our core offering of janitorial and it's early on, right.
but we are seeing some good results. we like the pipeline and we believe -- and again, in addition to the amortization and operational excellence that we're expecting, we believe the go-to-market strategy and the change that we articulated last year is going to have a meaningful impact and we're counting on that.
justin hauke -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
okay, thank you. i guess maybe my last question then here would be just on the free cash flow and the balance sheet. you guys mentioned you're kind of in your target range now. ebitda is going to be kind of flattish next year. so you won't delever from growth and i'm just trying to think how you're thinking about allocating that free cash flow.
is it still the priority to bring the leverage down a little bit more or is the balance sheet open enough where with the new buyback program and you talked about some m&a that that's back on the table in 2020?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
yes, i think, justin, our current leverage and continued strong cash flow provides really the optionality as it relates to our capital allocation strategy, allowing us the ability to look at m&a and share buybacks in in 2020, but a lot of factors are going into that. so i think you'll see a continued focus on deleveraging with the optionality for share buyback. and if our opportunistic m&a presents itself, we have that ability as well.
justin hauke -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
okay, great. thanks. that's all helpful.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.

our next question is from the line of marc riddick with sidoti & company. please proceed with your question.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company. -- analyst
hi, good morning.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, mark.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company. -- analyst
just wanted to sort of follow-up on the back of that and sort of maybe talk about the potential acquisition target areas or whether or not that's something that you've already begun to embark on and how should -- we should be thinking about where those priorities may lie? thanks.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure. it's good question. so we've talked in the past about the fact that we were going to start targeting some of the ats segments like energy and sustainability and power and we're going to continue to look at that.
i think having josh come on now as our head of strategy is going to help us to be more focused and refined in terms of m&a approach. whether it's -- whether it is acquisitive or even organically. so m&a is a lever that we have the ability to pull and just to be clear, aside from the focus on ats and sustainability, we will have the opportunity to do synergistic transactions in our core.
we wouldn't shy away from that as well, if it made financial sense. so i think for us, we just -- for us, it's all about being purposeful and playing into the strategy that we set forward. but definitely something that we can leverage in 2020.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company. -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.

our next question is from the line of tate sullivan with maxim group. please proceed with your question.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
hi, thank you. a couple of follow ups. anthony, first on the interest expense guidance for fiscal '20. i mean, just making sure i have it right $45 million to $50 million, down slightly from fiscal '19 and that's after a meaningful pay down of debt in the last quarter. are there other -- does that imply less of a debt pay down, based on your previous comments on receivables in aviation maybe or can you give more context to that please?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
yes, it's in line with our expectations. if you look at our composition of our debt, the proportion that's fixed at a higher interest rate as well as the proportion that's floating and our expectations of where we see the interest rate curve based on market conditions. that's how we come up with our interest expense. but it's all in line with our deleveraging profile as well as our outlook for cash flow and the timing of cash flow.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
okay, and thank you. next, what has to -- i apologize if i missed this, what changes in fiscal year '20 to get to double-digit eps growth in fiscal '21?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
so, for us, it's about getting back to historical growth rate averages, right. we talked about '20 being kind of more of a muted growth. so once we get back to our historical growth rate, once we get back to historical retention rate, there is absolutely no reason why we won't be double-digit eps going forward.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
great, thank you. in terms of, you mentioned a bit on healthcare and you moved it, i think it was last quarter or the previous quarter. the healthcare and the b&i, was that still somewhat of a drag in the most recent quarter and could that be a drag from lost contracts in fiscal year '20?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
no, no, actually surprisingly, it's performing well. it's -- now that it's in b&i and it's getting some of the operating leverage of our branch network and the proximity of the abm b&i offices to where our healthcare assignments are we're actually seeing that as a nice little surprising uplift. so we're pretty excited about that move, it's worked out.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
okay, thank you. and last from me, and thanks for the detail. i thought i heard that you mentioned a corporate line item increase and i saw the press release comment and for a previous question on it and hr increases, but could you quantify the increase, i missed that. please.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i quantified it earlier. year-over-year, we're expecting overall $25 million increase in corporate line item. half of which is going to be in that it, hr investment.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
$25 million, ok. thank you very much. have a good rest of the day.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer

and hope everyone has a happy and healthy holiday season with family and friends. and look forward to being back in the first quarter to update you on the progress and all the excitement that we have here at abm about the future. we just couldn't be more pumped up. so enjoy and be safe. thank you.

greetings. welcome to abm industries' fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. [operator instructions] please note this conference is being recorded.
at this time, i'll turn the conference over to your host, susie choi. ms. choi, you may now begin.
susie a. choi -- vice president of investor relations & treasurer
thank you all for joining us this morning. with us today are scott salmirs, our president and chief executive officer and anthony scaglione, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
we issued our press release yesterday afternoon announcing our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 financial results. a copy of this release and an accompanying slide presentation can be found on our corporate website.
before we begin, i would like to remind you that our call and presentation today contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. our use of the words estimate, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify these statements. these statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds.
while we believe them to be reasonable, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. these factors are described in the slide that accompanies our presentation as well as in our filings with the sec.
during the course of this call, certain non-gaap financial information will be presented. a reconciliation of those numbers to gaap financial measures is available at the end of the presentation and on the company's website under the investor tab.
i would now like to turn the call over to scott.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, susie, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our outlook for 2020. our performance during the fourth quarter represented another period of progress as we reported $1.6 billion of revenue and higher gaap and adjusted eps of $0.71 a share and $0.66 a share respectively compared to last year.
we also expanded adjusted ebitda margins 10 basis points to 5.6%. this performance enabled us to meet our full year guidance across our key metrics and with and without the impact of the ascs 606 and 853. total full year revenues was $6.5 billion, as we completed a record $1 billion in new sales bookings. this helped to offset our discerning approach to retention and repricing of existing work and allowed us to land at 1.6% organic growth. our gaap continuing eps was $1.91 a share or $2.05 a share on an adjusted basis and our adjusted ebitda margin was 5.2% for the year. we also generated $200 million in free cash flow and ended the year with leverage of 2.8 times, which hit our target range of below 3 times.
operational highlights include the sustained robust pipeline within our technical solutions group as they achieved outstanding growth of 26% for the quarter and 19% for the year. i would urge you all to visit our ir homepage and see firsthand the work they did for the renowned griffith observatory in los angeles, a super-complex project we recently finished.
business & industry also demonstrated continued strength by expanding margins while navigating, and in many instances, absorbing the effects of a still unfavorable wage environment, given where the labor markets remain. in addition to the work our b&i team is adding in their core office market, they are winning work at some exciting sports venues as well.
during the quarter, we started engineering and maintenance work at the chase center in san francisco, the brand new home of the golden state warriors. the venue is expected to host 200 events every year and abm was there to support its first concert ever, as well as the warriors' first home game. i only point that out because opening that arena is such a trusted decision and critical to the impression it will make.
the quarter's results saw our technology and manufacturing segment performing as planned, and keeping with their solid full year performance. our education and aviation segments continues to be pressured from the labor markets more than any of our groups, as they have the highest proportion of both non-union and lower wage team members and the greatest staffing variability due to seasonality with holiday travel and aviation and the cycling of semesters and recesses in education. all the factors we have been discussing with you over the past quarters.
anthony will take you through a deeper discussion of segment performance in financials, but i'd like to put our overall results in perspective for a moment, given we are now through fiscal year 2019. we first announced our 2020 vision strategy in late 2015, which began a multi-year transformational journey for the entire firm.
at that time, our revenues were $4.9 billion; our adjusted ebitda margins were 3.8%; and adjusted eps was a $1.62 per share.
in four years, we've grown revenues by more than 30% organically and acquisitively; expanded margins by roughly 40% and increased earnings by nearly 30%. the structural changes to our business as part of our 2020 vision strategy provided a springboard for these results.
our organizational realignment from a siloed and regionally autonomous structure to a centralized industry-focused operational framework has enabled us to pursue and achieve greater operating leverage. in conjunction with implementing our industry group structure, we created a formal procurement division to further leverage our scale.
to date we've achieved more than $50 million in savings and deferred increasing costs across our direct, indirect and the subcontractor spend. and supporting our 140,000 employees and our literally thousands of clients is our enterprise shared services center.
we centralized the work of 14 nationally distributed accounting centers and today the shared service center handles more than 4,000 journal entries, manages more than 30,000 client invoices and processes 80,000 payments every single month. we are so proud that this group was stood up and is high-functioning in such a short period of time.
another aspect of our 2020 vision was accelerating standard operating practices known as the abm way. over the years, our key areas of focus have included sales, strategic account management and labor management. while we've made progress, these are areas where we are investing to accelerate further, including bringing on a new head of strategy and transformation, which i'll discuss in a minute.
we've made significant progress in some of these areas, as demonstrated by creation of our new sales organization as well as through the institution of weekly operating reviews to manage labor with more agility. this year's performance in both technical solutions and b&i are great examples of how best practices and standardization can yield results.
but in order to truly capture the full potential of our size and scale, we must continue to deepen the reach of the abm way across more areas of the enterprise. it will be critical to our growth and achieving our long-term target of 5.5% to 6% adjusted ebitda margins. this is why we will continue to focus on investing and enable us to win on growth and productivity.
our primary areas of focus will be to optimize revenue management, increase client retention, improve labor management through process and technology and reinforcing team members as our competitive advantage. we will build upon our strong sales momentum by adding salespeople and investing in the continued professionalization of our sales approach.
our plans also include corporate investments in our hr structure to centralized and standardized hiring, on-boarding and training practices. we will also leverage next-gen data platforms to modernize our infrastructure and accelerate our technology and digital capabilities.
during the quarter, we announced some key leadership changes that underscore our commitment to aligning our organizational structure with our strategic priorities. scott giacobbe, previously our chief operating officer, is now our chief revenue officer and is responsible for all revenue generating functions to drive growth, including sales and marketing and continued oversight of our technical solutions group.
rene jacobsen, previously the president of b&i has been named chief facility services officer and will continue to be responsible for b&i but also add aviation, education and technology & manufacturing. in the current operating environment, it's necessary to create a focused effort to drive both organic growth while expanding segment margins through acute operational attention.
but scott and rene have been instrumental in formulating our strategies on these fronts, and i believe their new roles will lead to even greater contributions. we also recently announced the addition of josh feinberg to abm as our chief strategy and transformation officer.
josh joins us from the boston consulting group. he was part of the original consulting team that helped develop our 2020 vision architecture back in 2015. at bcg, he has worked with over 30 different service companies across a variety of businesses and his deep experience will be valuable as we focus on where we compete and how we will continue to win, particularly as we explore both organic and acquisitive investments.
josh, rene and scott will be working closely together to advance the abm way. looking ahead, the midpoint of our guidance does not exhibit our historical year-over-year expansion rate. our guidance incorporates the lower pull-through of revenue into this year as a result of our retention in 2019. this magnifies the impact of a higher cost model due to the continued investments in sales, hr, and it that we believe are essential to achieving greater growth and higher operating leverage in the future. and based on what we've seen all year, we continue to believe the operating environment will remain labor challenged in the foreseeable future.
as a result, we took a responsible approach to setting our guidance. once we make it through this next cycle and we complete our core investments, we expect to return to double-digit eps growth in 2021. so while our balanced results in 2019 serve as a reminder of where we were just a few years ago, our acceleration work continues with vigor [phonetic] and passion. i want to thank our team members for getting abm to this point and helping us fulfill our short and long-term goals.
i would also like to thank our board, including our newest director jill golder as well as our analysts and shareholders for supporting our strategies as we seek to unlock greater value. it's clear that abm has a proven track record of achievement regardless of the macroeconomic environment and i'm confident our diversified business model will thrive even more with our continued evolution, anthony?
anthony scaglione -- chief financial officer
thank you, scott, and good morning everyone. it is indeed hard to believe that 2020 is already upon. we have made such important progress since our journey just a few short years ago. today, we are a stronger company and our position as a leading facility service provider is unparalleled. i'm extremely proud of our team members and i look forward to the next phase of our evolution.
now, onto the results. throughout 2019, we've seen various impacts from the adoption of asc 606 and 853. lower revenues of approximately $12.5 million for the quarter and $48.6 million for the year associated with asc 853 related to service concession arrangement primarily reflected in our aviation segment.
the deferral of profit on uninstalled materials associated with our technical solutions project work was approximately $1.3 million for the quarter and approximately $0.5 million for the year. sales commission costs did not have a material impact during the quarter, but had approximately $6.7 million impact for the year due primarily to the exceptional growth we have seen from our technical solutions segment all year.
for the fourth quarter, total revenues were $1.6 billion, reflecting organic growth of 0.6%, excluding the adoption of asc 853 and 606. organic growth was primarily driven by the technical solutions segment during the quarter. overall revenue also reflects the impact of our decision to exit lower margin contracts and other contract losses.
on a gaap basis, our income from continuing operations was $48.1 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to $8.9 million or $0.13 last year. this quarter's results reflect a $5.4 million benefit from prior year self-insurance adjustments. the second consecutive quarter where we have seen a favorable impact.
safety and risk was among our key areas of focus when we launched our 2020 vision transformation and i'm pleased to see continued progress in this area. and as a reminder, last year's results reflect a $26.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to our technical solutions segment in the uk.
on an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the quarter was $44.7 million or $0.66 per diluted share, an increase of 15.2% compared to last year. on both a gaap and adjusted basis, our results reflect higher revenue contribution from the technical solutions segment and higher overall segment margin mix, including the benefits of improved labor management primarily within the business & industry segment. during the quarter, we generated adjusted ebitda of $93 million at a margin rate of 5.6% compared to approximately $90 million at a rate of 5.5% last year.
i'll now turn to our segment results, which are described on slide 16 of today's presentation. please keep in mind, with the exception of technical solutions topline results across our industry groups reflect the exiting of underperforming contracts and other retention losses from -- throughout this year.
b&i reported revenues of $807 million and operating profit of $51.1 million or a margin of 6.3%. during the quarter, b&i continue to overcome some of their lost business by pursuing expansions of key national accounts, a strategy where we continuing to gain traction.
tag during the quarter also performed well, driven by new and repair construction in the northeast as well as certain project at various sports venues. for the full year, b&i delivered operating margins of 5.6% compared to 4.8% last year.
b&i has been a strong example of how the keen focus on labor management along with optimizing our reporting analytics has had a material impact on our operations and results. standard operating practices, such as weekly labor reviews and strategic account management have driven solid performance improvements this year.
aviation reported revenues of $251 million, which reflect a $12 million negative impact from contra-revenue associated with asc 853. while this segment has performed below our expectations, our two-tiered approach of diversifying service offerings and expanding opportunities with low cost and regional carriers continued during the quarter and is beginning to take hold.
we also recently announced growing fueling partnerships with united airlines and jetblue in the us. internationally, we continue to expand business with carriers such as ryanair. these efforts contributed to aviation's positive organic growth for the full year.
operating profit for the quarter was $3.9 million compared to $2.6 million last year. for the full year, aviation ended with an operating margin of 2.1% as we continue to overcome persistent labor-related challenges.
moving forward, our teams are working toward our goal to expand margins in 2020, as we will anniversary some key losses from 2019, while continuing to target under-performing contracts; monitoring in-sourcing and outsourcing trends across the aviation industry; as well as understanding infrastructure improvements and expansion trends across national airports will be key to our future strategic direction.
moving to the technology & manufacturing; t&m reported revenues of approximately $230 million for the quarter versus $234 million last year. operating profit was $18.1 million versus $17.5 million last year or a margin rate of 7.9% this year compared to 7.5% last year. in addition to expansions with high tech and logistic business expansions, manufacturing client specializing food [phonetic] production and aerospace contributed to revenues during the quarter.
for the year, operating margins were 7.9%. moving forward, we are looking to mimic some of the practices we have instilled into b&i segment to expand with strategic accounts, while also pursuing increasing efficiencies through labor productivity and tags.
revenue in education was $214 million with operating profit of $5.6 million or 2.6% margin. for the year, education's operating margin was 4.6%. education's results reflect the impact of the more rational pricing approach we took during the most recent buying season.
similar to our expectations for aviation, we are planning for margin expansion within education in 2020 as our new go-to-market strategy is bundling technical solutions, driven energy programs with custodial, groundskeeping and maintenance work will go into effect. we are excited about the new sales strategy and the value proposition we can bring to our clients.
lastly, technical solutions reported revenues of $175.5 million a year-over-year increase of 25.5% for the quarter. operating profit was $20.1 million or a margin rate of 11% compared to a loss of $7 million last year. again, last year's results reflect a $26.5 million impairment charge related to our uk business.
growth during the quarter, both from a top line and bottom line perspective, continue to be driven by core projects, building energy solution projects, and ev charging wins. full-year operating margins came in at 9.3%. margins in this segment continue to be the highest across all of our portfolio and we are very excited about our future as we continue to win in both the private and public sector.
our project backlog is down from a historic high at the end of q3, but ended the year up more than 50% on a year-over-year basis. we are committed to continue investing in this business both organically through additional sales people as well as through opportunistic m&a.
turning to cash and liquidity, cash flow from operations was approximately $149 million for q4. as i've discussed throughout 2019, we have been experiencing higher working capital needs for some of our expansion clients and our ar balances in aviation were higher than expected due to billing reconciliations throughout the year.
however, our teams remain committed to our year-end goals and pushed during the fourth quarter to overcome some of these challenges with a focus on collections, which led to a sequential dso improvement of 2 days. we also benefited from timing related to payables. this combination led to annual free cash flow of over $200 million.
we ended the quarter with total debt, including standby letters of credit of approximately $966 million and a bank-adjusted leverage ratio of 2.8 times. i am pleased with how we have achieved our target leverage range of 2.5 times to 3 times in two short years following our gca acquisition and in line with our long-term target we established with our 2020 vision. we consider this an optimal range that allows us to remain flexible in our capital allocation strategy.
during the quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per common share for a total distribution of $12 million to stockholders. and i'm pleased to report that our board has approved our quarterly dividend increase to $0.185. in addition, as part of our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders, our board has authorized a new share repurchase program of $150 million, as stated in our press release.
now, for a quick recap of our annual results. total revenues were approximately $6.5 billion, an increase of $56.4 million versus last year. the increase in revenues was attributable to organic growth of approximately 1.6%, which excludes an unfavorable impact of $47.6 million due to asc 606 and 853. organic growth was driven by our us technical solutions and aviation businesses, offsetting lower retention across all other industry groups.
our gaap income from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 was $127.5 million or $1.91 per diluted share. on an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the year was $137.2 million or $2.05 per diluted share. adjusted ebitda for the year grew to approximately $340 million and we ended the fiscal year with an adjusted ebitda margin of 5.2%.
now turning to our guidance outlook. we are introducing a fiscal 2020 gaap guidance outlook range of $1.65 to $1.85, and on an adjusted basis $1.90 to $2.10 per share. although we previewed many of the dynamic that will contribute to our 2020 expectations during our third quarter call, i like to expand on our assumptions a bit further.
in 2019, we saw roughly $0.09 positive impact as a result from our adoption of the new revenue recognition standards asc 606 and asc 853 primarily related to the deferral of commission that were previously expensed when incurred. we do not expect this to repeat in 2020.
while we do not give specific revenue guidance, our outlook for 2020 contemplates the same operating environment as we experienced in 2019 and the annualized effect of contract losses from this past year. we have remained disciplined in our expansion efforts and i commend the team for taking a longer-term view for a healthier business mix.
as a result, the midpoint of our guidance assumes muted growth for the full year, with the first half of the year exhibiting a higher comparability impact due to a greater degree of contract losses from later in fiscal 2019. as a result, we expect the cadence of earnings will be more back-half weighted than we saw in 2019, given the timing of losses as well as the shift in working days in q2 and q4.
q2 will see an extra working day while q4 will see one less day, each working day has historically represented roughly $7 million of labor expense. additionally, our guidance does not include any potential share repurchase activity, which we will balance against market conditions, liquidity and investments.
adjusted ebitda margins are expected to be in the range of 5% to 5.2%, reflecting the aforementioned pull through impact of revenue and higher corporate expenses related to our hr operating model change in addition to ongoing investments in our it infrastructure. we'll also invest in salespeople and strategic account manager across all of our industry groups.
as it relates to it, let me provide an update on our erp implementation. i'm pleased to share that we went live in canada this month. it is very early as we are still closing the month on our legacy systems, given the timing of the launch. but data is currently being transferred and we'll start operating from the system in canada fully over the next coming weeks.
the uk and canadian implementations mark the decommissioning of our legacy erp. in the us, which is our largest and most complex operating base, we continue with our implementation and like to expand upon that a bit. the complexity in the us conversions includes not only replacing our core financial systems like we did in the uk and canada, but also ensuring all of our boundary applications such as payroll, work orders and time and attendance are configured correctly and set up to drive the productivity and enhancements we are envisioning.
we are also managing our overall cost and expenses prudently and currently continue to be in line with the year-over-year increase i mentioned on previous calls. while we continue to work toward the us implementation in 2020 that will yield enhanced functionality, we will not rush to go live.
moving to taxes, we expect our 2020 tax rate to be approximately 30%. this rate excludes discrete tax items such as the work opportunity tax credits and the tax impact of stock-based compensation awards, which we currently expect will be approximately $7 million for 2020 compared to approximately $8 million in fiscal ' 19. more specifically, we are assuming a roughly $0.10 impact to guidance compared to $0.12 impact in fiscal 2018. we also expect cash taxes to be higher in 2020 compared to 2019, given the full utilization of net operating loss and credit carry overs in 2019.
capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 are anticipated to be between $45 million to $55 million and we expect depreciation of $50 million to $55 million. due to some of the aforementioned factors, we are guiding to free cash flow of approximately $175 million plus or minus any related to working capital needs.
finally, with the investments we have made and our continued disciplined approach, we expect our segment operating margins to hold or even expand in many areas. ultimately, once we navigate the upcoming year, we expect to see a measurable impact to both our operational and corporate results in 2021 and beyond.
operator, we are now ready for questions.

[operator instructions]
our first question is from sean eastman with keybanc capital markets. please proceed.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, team. certainly a strong start to the year. pretty impressive. i guess along those lines. my first question is, if we just look at the annual guidance, you guys are off to a head start here with the first quarter, implying around over 30% of earnings in the first quarter versus kind of a high-teens number on average over the last 10 years in the first quarter. so i'm just curious where you think you might need to have some conservatism in there given this head start, i mean is it really just the labor efficiency dynamic as revenue recovers is it the technology investments ramping up. any color around that cadence would be helpful?
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, i think you hit it right on the head and i think predominantly. we have to remember it's early, right. we just finished q1 and we have some nice line of sight into q2 but it's early in the year and we want to be responsible, right. so i think we always have an opportunity as we go along to update if we need to sean. but for now i think we feel real comfortable where we are.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, got it. and the capital allocation comments are interesting just around the stability and where leverage is. i'm just curious what an acquisition could look like for you guys. maybe it's early there as well, but just a bit of a flavor for what you guys are looking at what kind of supplement to the organic growth recovery you envision, it would be helpful to understand that?
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, i mean, look for us we're looking in two primary areas. first, building into our core, which is janitorial and if anything covid-19 has really elevated that core. so that's something that we're excited to look at, and then also our ats group, we love that division. we love where society is heading toward energy efficiency, sustainability, electric vehicle charging. these are all our major work streams there. so we've talked about in the past that we want to build our geographic footprint across the us. so i could see us doing some fill-in acquisitions there as well. so that's kind of where our focus is at the moment, those two areas, core janitorial and ats.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then one last quick one from me. on ats i mean you guys have exposure to ev charging, you have exposure to energy efficiency and buildings. two clear priority areas from the new administration. i mean, have you seen the ats bid pipeline firm or is that sort of a stay tune too early.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
look, we have a really strong pipeline and a strong backlog. and i think the new administration's attitudes toward the things i just talked about sustainability and energy management are great and it really goes beyond the administration, right. it really goes to society, right. and it's just -- it's playing into all the right trends and if you remember the ats group also there's a fair amount of work in educational facilities and you all know how strained budgets are for schools k through 12 and frankly higher ed and so we come in with really good energy saving solutions and you've heard us talk before about proof points of literally saving teachers jobs, saving after school programs. so we think that there is going to be good momentum toward selling energy projects into schools as well. so everything is pointing up for us in ats. it's just for us right now the impediment has been access to facilities right with covid and we suspect we'll see a lot more traction in the back half of the year as the vaccines rollout and also as schools close, we'll have a chance to get access and start churning that backlog and turning it into real revenue and the number of backlog have signed contracts. so we're super confident. we have a very strong backlog. we just have to turn it into revenue by actually starting the project.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. thanks, scott. i appreciate it. i'll turn it over.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, sean.
operator
our next question is from andy wittmann with robert w. baird. please proceed.
andy wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great, and good morning, everyone. thank you for taking my questions. i was just hoping to just understand a little bit more again this quarter the driver of the year-over-year margin improvement. last quarter i guess you said it was kind of roughly half mixed benefit from teg and enhancedclean and the other half was the benefit of labor management. was there any different in the character of that particularly considering that some of those corporate investments also came in and we're going to offset the other way?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, andy for the question. you're spot on. very similar to what we saw last quarter, this year-over-year uptick that we're seeing in margin is driven by those two components. so firstly the labor efficiencies that we've been receiving as well as the higher margins associated with both work orders and enhancedclean services and that really attributed to 400 basis points of the year-over -year accretion really again split 50-50. in addition to that, we saw the one less working day, which attributed to about 40 basis points, which was offset by incremental investments that you'll see in the corporate expense line.
andy wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
got it. okay. well given that and i appreciate the physical occupancy data that you guys shared the 15 going to 25 by labor day. i guess you said and then by calendar year-end getting a lot more normal than that. i mean that is a recovery in physical occupancy of the space, but i wouldn't say that's any kind of sharp snapback or major change very quickly and in fact that labor day represents most of the rest of your fiscal year. so given that and just doing some math on your guidance here, using your eps guidance and some of the other known quantities here, it looks like the balance of the year, ebitda margins are down pretty significantly not down up year-over-year up to historic levels, down sequentially from a great performance in 1q is what i mean. i'm calculating something in the mid '60s for the balance of the year. so that's a pretty big change. so i was hoping that you could give a little bit more meat on the bone other than kind of what you said or in addition to what you said to get us comfortable with the fact that this is the right margin level to be thinking about for the balance of the year.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
look again, we want to be responsible, andy. we are and we look at the remainder of the year and we do think there is going to be momentum back, which will cause us to lose some of the labor efficiencies we get in the hybrid model predominantly in commercial as this momentum back to the office. so that and that's it and then we are going to be starting the corporate investments. we had a slow start at q1 because we wanted to be super cautious with -- we wanted to be super cautious with the pandemic still remember our quarters like november, december, january right. so we will be starting to build in those investments in our strategy and it area and it's all for long-term growth. this we are going into a growth mode abm and we need to support it with those investments.
andy wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
got it. i have just one last question to follow up on kind of on the fundamentals of the business and demand. last year i think it was defined by very, very low customer loss, very high retention rate, just kind of wanted to hunker down not change anything, make sure that they did this, you guys have talked a lot about how abm has been well positioned with your processes and your leadership in the industry as the ability to take share. i was wondering, scott, if you could talk a little bit about the dynamics now that we're starting to think about reopen, are there more customers looking to switch providers going forward now that the world is a little bit more stable and just given that -- as they look to switch are they also looking to bake into the base contract, some of the work order that becomes so consistent as part of what their processes, you're offering enhancedclean is basically the deeper level of cleaning, but our customers looking to switch and if they switch are they looking to bake in more content and what are the implications of that if they do on margins. thanks. sorry there's a lot of questions, but you can talk about that. thanks.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i got the essence of this. sure, look, q1 was a great retention for us. we were in that 92%, 93% zone. and i think earlier on, we were more cautious about a lot of rebids happening. i think certainly if there is one area probably the education because the one thing we know there is the school budgets still all constrained right and they'll be looking for opportunities. so we will expect to see a higher level of bids and education, but there's a plus side to that too, right, because all this other work is going to get bit out that we don't have, right, and we do love our platform now with our enhancedclean. so where we may get a little pressure on retention. we may pick it up on the sales side and with enhancedclean it's not in the scope of work and we don't as things get rebid for the first couple of years. i'm not so sure how robust the bidding activity is going to be and what makes me think about that andy is not only we talk to clients, but on top of that so many of our clients have this space needs in flux in terms of how they're going to lay out the floors for distancing and the different use cases that are going to have when people come back.
so i don't think there's going to be this rush to go bid right away until they understand the occupancy. but even still when it does get baked in over the next couple of years, i don't think we're going to have too much of the deterioration on margin because if you think about enhancedclean, it is the people are better trained because they're using different types of chemicals, they're using expensive equipment. so we believe between that and all the resources we're putting in with our advisory panel that we're going to be able to maintain a good portion of our margins when eventually does get but again. i just don't think it's going to be immediate because there's too many other drivers that are going to inhibit them from having this all out bidding.
andy wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
all right. thank you for the comments. have a good day.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
you too.

i'll add another one to the margin side. do you think that 2021 adjusted ebitda margin is where profitability kind of peaked out for you guys. i know you mentioned some cost will be coming back throughout the year here. basically, i'm curious if your long-term margin outlook of 5.5%, 6% is kind of irrelevant now because the business is changing. 6% plus the new normal given customers on this high margin virus protection going forward.
susie kim -- treasurer & vice president of investor relations
yeah, i mean, that's a good question. so i think for us, if you remember pre-covid that 5.5% to 6% zone was where we were trying to gravitate to over the next two years or three years. but certainly we believe that covid and kind of the virus awareness in society has squarely put us into that 5.5% to 6% zone and we're going to be thinking about investing into our business over the next five years. we're going to do the things that we need to do to break out of that zone that is our ultimate goal, we always want to overachieve. but i think for now what we're really comfortable saying is we start we've landed into that zone a couple of years ahead of where we want it to be. and the next phase we're finishing up 2020 vision now. i think the next phase of our five year journey is going to outline the path to get out of that zone.
sam kusswurm -- william blair -- analyst
great. that's helpful commentary. maybe switching gears i have a quick one on b&i that i assume there is a lot of disinfection work that must be done preparation for some of these folks going back to work this fall. i'm kind of wondering as far as early to your guidance, are you contemplating a significant step up in b&i related reopening revenue in your fiscal fourth quarter this year?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yes so we do believe there will be increased volume, as there is a return to work and the offsetting factor to that is we're going to have to step up, right. so we look at those two in conjunction with one another, but there will definitely be elevated volumes as people return back. but if you remember like with our fiscal year we end october 31 and we think at that time we're going to be somewhere between that 25% to 50% of occupancy. so it's probably going to be more like '22 when you're going to have a robust return to the office, where those levels will be even elevated past what we'll see in '21.
sam kusswurm -- william blair -- analyst
got you. thanks for the answer guys.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
have a great day.
operator
our next question is from david silver with cl king. please proceed.
david silver -- cl king -- analyst
yeah, hi, good morning. thanks. scott i wanted to follow-up maybe on one of your answers here regarding retention rates. so i mean historically you've been very clear about pursuing high retention rates on your annual contracts. i'm just wondering if you have any early data thus far like on a couple of things. first off, the six month enhancedclean contracts. my sense is, a lot of those are coming up for renewal. and i'm just wondering if you have some early read on retention rates there and then maybe a more qualitative comment regarding the tag work or the work orders that you're seeing. so i mean very hard to generalize, but is there seemingly a customer strategy evolving where maybe they have a work order every couple of weeks or so or once a month to supplement the standard annual contract. so just some idea of the cadence there on enhancedclean and the work orders? thank you.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah sure no problem. so look i think for us again it's been sustained, right and if you look at our work orders and enhancedclean we did $150 million of that in the first quarter as compared to 300 million all of last year. so we're excited about that and then our renewals have been very strong on enhancedclean so far, which is a really good time. but i think what was even more powerful for us is when we surveyed our clients, 90% of our clients said on reopening they're going to do the same, if not more virus-protection, which is pretty incredible and then take that to the next level 85% of our clients said when they look out two years past the pandemic or more, they're going to continue to be doing virus protection. so it kind of proves the thesis that we've been saying all along that on some in some extent pandora's box has been opened around virus protection and awareness and then confirm and not only through the survey results but as you can imagine we're constantly communicating with our clients about reopen plans and it just confirms what we're hearing in the survey. so really optimistic. is that helpful?
david silver -- cl king -- analyst
yeah, that's great. just one quick one and then one strategic question, but the quick one would be on the cares act and i believe last year the cares act will allowed you to differ roughly i think 100 million or so of employment taxes. can you just maybe remind me what, can you update us on how that is going, how that went in the first quarter and then maybe from a fiscal year '21 basis. will any of that accumulated kind of deferral need to be repaid. so maybe the fiscal year '21 cash flow impact puts and takes on the cares act will be great. thank you.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, david, it's earl. let me address that. so if we start, if you look at the cash flow operations this quarter we landed at about $40 million, which if you think about q1, this is probably the first time in recent history that q1 is actually generated positive cash as opposed to actually being a net draw on cash. $31 million of that cash flow came from the cares act so if you look at what we did last year 130 and 131 this year, it's about $161 million that will be repaid in two half -- the first-half being next fiscal, which is really december at the end of december 2021 and then the following fiscal or the following fiscal, the balance of that amount.
david silver -- cl king -- analyst
okay, all right, great. i appreciate that. and then last question would be more i guess just to it's a multi-tasking, question for you, scott. but when i think in your company here. i think you have this big new opportunity or newish opportunity that you're moving aggressively to invest in and to exploit regarding the post-pandemic business environment and then are you also would say that within the last year, you've also initiated another significant kind of longer term strategic effort regarding your transformation programs. and i'm just wondering as you kind of steer the ship here, can those two very significant high priority efforts can they continue on without interruption is there some competition internally for resources, how does human resources view filling senior openings on one project or one effort versus the other? just and of course your time to management attention. so how do you kind of manage i guess those parallel tracks on two high priority and frankly newer efforts relative to how your company has been positioned over the past several years. thank you.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
that's a good question i don't think they're out of line, to be honest, i think they all are online together into kind of one vision going forward. and the way i think about this we're going to have this work stream and investing into the business organically and that's the enhancedclean enhanced facilities and continuing to build excellence around that. so you can have that but at on a parallel path that we're going to be investing in our tech, right, and part of the tech is infrastructure and that's kind of table stakes right getting your data right forming a framework around new technology, but that's really to accelerate and grow the business through client-facing technology, right. so we get stickier with clients and that client-facing technology can intersect with enhancedclean, right in terms of tracking systems and dashboard. so i think that's really important and then also to accelerate the business, the technology is going to work toward workforce management getting our people more efficient, getting our people more data more touch points with our clients because we're informing them and enriching them with the data that we're capturing.
so i think it really aligns well and we will lay out in detail the next five years in the coming months. but we're really excited about our ability to invest in our people and to invest in technology and again it's just going to come together beautifully in online. so we're really excited to talk about it over the next couple of months.
david silver -- cl king -- analyst
all right. just one final comment, but i did want to call out. i thought the slide deck that you put together for this call was exceptionally useful and helpful and the opportunity to go through at last night was an added plus. so thanks for the extra effort. i appreciate it.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
that's great. thanks.
operator
and we do you have time for one more question. our final question will be from marc riddick with sidoti & company. please proceed.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, marc.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
so let me also echo the last comments the slide deck for those who haven't had a chance to see it so far. i thought was exceptional and had a lot of great detail on that. really appreciate that. really appreciate all the commentary that you've already given. but i wanted to touch a little bit on the investment commentary because in addition to the investments that you've talked about. i want to circle back to the idea that you've begun a national commercial campaign and i don't think that's a small thing for a company that's a century old for the first time have a commercial. so i was wondering if you can sort of talk a little bit about that thought process, what the branding opportunity that you see is and what it kind of means for abm as well as what it means for enhancedclean in general?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, look, we were you can imagine the pride we had right to have a national tv commercial for a company like us and it was so well done and we get such great comments on it and i think it's multipurpose, right, marc. part of it is just the commercial side of it meaning the commercial business side of it and we're already seeing web traffic up over 10% just from the commercial, which is so that the payback is incredible. and just from a branding standpoint, it's just repositions our brand and elevates our brand and especially what we're doing with enhancedclean and making sure people understand marc that like we're in essential service with first responders and we even say like with healthcare professionals, they can even -- hospital can open till we've cleaned it right. so i think it's just so much for us on so many different levels, but it doesn't hurt when you get a pure financial payback and you start seeing web traffic up and that turning into actual business.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
and then just to be clear the commercial hasn't been out for very long right, right, i mean when did that hit the air?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
it was just been out for like two weeks, yeah.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i was sort of thinking about on top of the investment commentary that you've made. so as you sort of thinking through the technology investments or what have you. from a timing perspective i would imagine that some of that we'll see later this year and then flowing into next year and obviously you still got some big decisions to make around that, but is that a reasonable way to think about the technology spend that you have in front of you?
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so, marc, just let me address that. so when we look at the technology spend -- part of it is that planning and design that we currently are investing against our future it infrastructure, which again will start with a rollout of the erp system across the enterprise. again the decision right now we're not going to do that in kind of like a big bang approach, but rather will be a series of rollout. so presumably you could see some deployment at the end of this year and then flowing into fy'22.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and so the -- so one of the surprises i guess of the follow-ups the commentary around the acquisitions and looking at acquisitions as a more maybe more near-term potential use of cash and there may be some sort of thinking about and i appreciate you including the commentary on the prioritization of what you might be looking at with from an acquisition pipeline perspective. is it too early to have begun to look at sort of what that pricing for those types of assets might look like or how should we think about that the potential range of opportunities that might be in front of you?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's probably a little early and different assets have different ranges right like the ats stuff is a little bit more prizy than janitorial and it's because it's higher growth, higher margin, right. so i think we have to synthesize all that and there is other things that we take into consideration just besides multiple and pure financials, it's like, is there a strategic component to it like with ats where i talked about expanding our footprint and filling in gaps that we don't have or that we do have rather around the country. so we put all those together and bake it into our analysis, but it's kind of early right now for us. but hopefully, we'll have more to report on soon.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay and then the last thing for me is a year ago enhancedclean didn't exist and we were obviously in a different place, right. so i wanted to sort of get a sense of whether we begin to sort of look at longer term, what enhancedclean to be and it seems as though there is a certain this going to be a certain flow based on the types of customers that you have, but it certainly seems to be encouraging from the survey data that you had in your slides and the like. i wanted to get a sense of that survey work and the feedback that you're getting how recent was that and do you get a sense that maybe some of the bigger picture issues like the stimulus plan like has -- is that beginning to be reflected back in the commentary that you're getting from customers. thanks.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think that one of the biggest knock-on effects to this marc has been the elevation of our brand, right, because you know what our competitors are doing a lot of the same stuff that we're doing, but they're basically coming in and saying we can electrostatic spray, right. well, we could do that too, but when you take on the enhancedclean program, you get a different level of training, you get signage with it, right, you get a different level of the way you communicate to clients, you can even have evidence based testing when we're done to show whether or not we've been successful in eradicating the covid in the space. so and it all ends with kind of the proverbial seal in the window that says this facility has been enhancedclean certified because you remember we talked about the fact that we put together an advisory panel. so it's like i think the biggest push about this marc is that it kind of it separates us from the pack. it really differentiates us as we've talked about before, a lot of our competitors are small and regional companies, they don't have the resources that we have with the scale that we have with the supply chain. all those things are coming to floor now that we're in this pandemic and as really in order to our benefit.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
appreciate all the time. thank you.

greetings. welcome to abm industries first quarter 2021 earnings call.
[operator instructions]
i will now turn the conference over to susie kim, vice president of investor relations and treasurer. thank you. you may begin.
susie kim -- treasurer & vice president of investor relations
thank you all for joining us this morning. with us today are scott salmirs, our president and chief executive officer and earl ellis, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. we issued our press release yesterday afternoon, announcing our first quarter fiscal 2021 financial results. a copy of this release and an accompanying slide presentation can be found on our corporate website.
before we begin, i would like to remind you that our call and presentation today contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. our use of the words estimate, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify these statements. these statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds. while we believe them to be reasonable, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. these factors are described in a slide that accompanies our presentation as well as our filings with the sec. during the course of this call, certain non-gaap financial information will be presented. a reconciliation of those numbers to gaap financial measures is available at the end of the presentation and on the company's website under the investor tab.
i would now like to turn the call over to scott.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, susie. good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. as you read in yesterday's press release, 2021 is off to a tremendous start. total revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, representing a 7.5% decline versus last year, which exceeded our expectation and reflects continued sequential improvement. as anticipated, our aviation segment remains the primary driver behind the revenue decrease. on both the gaap and an adjusted basis, earnings grew by a 160% or more year-over-year. gaap continuing eps grew to a $1.10 per share or $1.01 per share on an adjusted basis.
adjusted ebitda margins expanded more than 400 basis points to 8.3% compared to last year. anchoring these results was elevated demand for higher margin work orders for virus protection as well as our enhancedclean services which are longer term in nature. effective labor management continued to be a lever for profitability. as you may remember, the majority of our contracts are performance based, so any efficiencies we find in staffing as occupancy drops or schools are in a hybrid situation [phonetic] in order to our benefit. this is the advantage of having a flexible labor model. earl, will discuss our segments in more detail, but overall, our industry group drivers are similar to what we saw during the balance of last year.
not surprisingly our aviation and technical solutions segments were challenged by the pandemic due to decreased global travel and limited site access for retrofit projects and educational facilities. education as the segment though grew top and bottom line during the quarter, which shows how well our team has adapted operationally to the hybrid learning system and business & industry and technology & manufacturing are still strong outperformers. we've been able to offset covid related revenue compression with higher margin work orders, enhancedclean contracts and labor management.
we're now almost at the one-year mark since the start of the pandemic and i've just summarized our fourth consecutive quarter of strong results. this sustained performance suggests that we have reached a level of consistency in our results and stabilization across our client portfolio. let me now provide some thoughts on where we believe the operating environment is headed, especially in light of our full year guidance. before i dive into what momentum to normalcy looks like in 2021, i want to underscore that normalcy does not imply less vigilance around virus protection. over the past several months, there have been countless news and scientific journals reminding us that covid-19 and its after effects will continue to linger over the foreseeable future. many believe it will be a permanent fact of life with people getting regularly vaccinated similar to how we handle flu vaccinations. we are so enthusiastic that vaccine rollouts are under way across the country. most importantly, the vaccines will save lives, but the rollouts will also lead to momentum back to work, school, travel and attending entertainment venues. however vaccine rollouts have not been uniformed on a state by state basis nor have stayed policies on masking, public gatherings and other factors that impact infections and new cases.
these factors as well as the ongoing discovery of new variants highlight how societies need to respond to covid-19 on an elevated level, will not end in the near-term. this is why it's so critical for us to partner with our clients and assess their evolving needs and engage our expert advisory panel. in b&i, the vaccines will spur momentum back to work, which for us means a return of more traditional janitorial work as well as the continuation of disinfecting given higher occupancy. currently, average occupancy across the country is approximately 15%. we anticipate this could increase to 25% by labor day and grow to 50% plus through calendar year-end. as clients begin to plan their returns, they are focusing on building trust in their facilities through health and safety protocols, rigor around cleaning, disinfecting and especially physical spacing will be incorporated into their plans. for this reason, we do not anticipate a near-term reduction space utilization across commercial real estate, especially with class a buildings and blue-chip clients.
for a sector like education, we believe the hybrid models will be in effect for at least the rest of the school year. soon, if not already, institutions will start planning for the fall 2021 semester with a push for more in-person learning in the k through 12 segment and higher ed. how this unfolds could vary by region. we should have a better line of sight when we speak to you after q2 earnings. and i'm sure as vaccine adoption continues to expand, there's probably no sector more poised for a robust volume recovery than aviation. we are definitely hearing about pent-up demand for personal travel and minimally a modest return of business travel. for abm, our business portfolio consists of both airlines and airports. as airports were opened during the pandemic, operations in areas like terminal cleaning, transportation and shuttle service enabled us to mitigate reduced volumes on the airline side. and ultimately, this diversification helped us breakeven last year, which was a major achievement.
on the airline side, current travel volumes are approximately 50% of pre-covid levels. assuming vaccine rollouts gain traction, we believe we could see that grow moderately by year-end. as both airlines and airports see increased traffic, the need for disinfection, virus protection and enhancedclean will grow.
on an enterprise level, we conducted a pulse survey of approximately 200 clients last month that largely aligned to our own full year expectations. most respondents are expecting their facilities to more fully reopen and their companies to be endorsing reoccupancy in varying forms by september and they plan to continue taking multiple measures to protect spaces against covid-19 as they reopen primarily in the areas of surface and air disinfection. and even with the increase in flexible work schedules and work from home protocols, the vast majority of our clients say that they expect the total amount of space utilization to remain largely the same. now, the size of our survey, it's just a subset of our client base, but it supports what we are hearing more broadly as we communicate with our customers on their future plans. it also speaks to our confidence in providing full year guidance today. for fiscal 2021, we are introducing full year guidance of earnings per diluted share of $2.85 to $3.10 or $3.00 to $3.25 on an adjusted basis. our outlook for adjusted ebitda margins is 6.6% to 7%, which compares to 6% last year. we also expect to return to growth by the second half of this year and consistent demand for high margin work orders and enhancedclean services through year-end. we also anticipate retaining most of our labor arbitrage through year-end.
our success will not translate to complacency. based on how the pandemic has changed our trajectory, we have been capitalizing on our momentum to elevate our brand and business. at the end of february, we launched abm's first national tv commercial. it was a celebratory moment for the entire firm and we could not be proud of. if you've not seen it on cnbc or bloomberg tv, you can find it on our ir website today.
as we discussed last year, we are going to be investing in our clients, team members, and infrastructure. we're focused on providing technology and data analytics capabilities to enhance client and team member experiences. we are also prioritizing areas like talent development to further empower our people and create even more consequential relationships with our clients. we are committed to building upon our strong culture and fostering a community of belonging where team members feel connected, valued, and inspired. this reinforces our mission and vision as an organization and will have significant long-term commercial outcomes for us. internal initiatives such as our culture and inclusion council are dedicated to driving meaningful social change and cultivating an inclusive environment for everyone at abm and we are taking active steps to turn this vision into reality. i'm excited to share that we have entered into partnerships with organizations that are focused on building a more equitable society. abm has made a commitment to support the naacp legal defense and educational funds, the hispanic scholarship fund, the afterschool alliance, and the thurgood marshall college fund. we are partnering with these organizations in an effort to make a difference in the areas of advocacy and civil rights, basic human needs, education, and workforce development.
before i turn the call over to earl, i wanted to look back at this time last year during our first quarter earnings call of 2020. we were just starting to discuss the coronavirus and its impact on the economy. at that time i reiterated how our diversified portfolio coupled with our nimble operating model or hallmarks of our long-term success over the past 110 years. our results over the past 12 months has proven this beyond a doubt and with our solid liquidity and leverage, we are better positioned than ever to pursue growth and profitability that will unlock even greater shareholder value. i want to thank our employees for another quarter of absolutely incredible execution, particularly those who were impacted by the recent winter storms in the south.
the dedication of the abm team continues to fuel our performance quarter-after-quarter. we have a culture like no other in our industry. in addition to our team members, i'd like to thank our board of directors, including our newest director, quincy allen for their guidance and encouragement. i also thank you, our analysts and shareholders, for your support during a time when the environment was particularly opaque. i'm proud that our results have been the greatest proof point of our resilience, agility and excellence.
i'll now turn the call over to earl.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks scott, and good morning, everyone. let me start by thanking all of my fellow abm team members for the warm welcome i've experienced since joining the organization. today marks my 100th day at abm and my early impressions about the organization's drive to collaborate and execute have only grown. as i continue to evaluate and assess our business needs, my main area of focus will be on helping to determine the appropriate enablers for both strategic growth and continuous improvement. as i will discuss in more detail shortly, our strong results over the past several quarters coupled with our leadership position in the marketplace provides us with great opportunity to invest in our future growth potential. i look forward to finalizing our thoughts on areas such as our internal investment strategy and sharing with all of you over the course of the year.
now onto the results. revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 7.5% compared to last year. the decrease in revenue reflects the continued impact covid-19 has had across our business segments. as a reminder, the pandemic had not yet impacted operations significantly until our second quarter last year and as such this quarter reflects the full year-over-year impact. partially offsetting this revenue decline was the ongoing demand for higher margin disinfection related work orders and enhancedclean services.
work orders were particularly strong within our business & industry and technology & manufacturing industry groups. on a gaap basis, our income from continuing operations was $74.6 million or $1.10 per diluted share compared to $27.9 million or $0.41 last year. in addition to our strong operational performance, the increase versus last year was driven by favorable development in prior year self-insurance adjustments. we saw an $11.4 million benefit this year compared to $6.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. additionally, we saw our second consecutive quarter of current year positive insurance trend recording a benefit of approximately $3 million. on an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the quarter increased to $68.3 million or $1.01 per diluted share compared to $26.2 million or $0.39 last year.
our gaap and adjusted earnings growth versus last year continued to be driven by significant increases in higher margin work orders and enhancedclean services. as our clients have incorporated health and hygiene services such as disinfection into their operation at higher levels, we continue to experience higher margin as a result of direct labor efficiencies, as our operators proactively manage the deployment of labor commensurate with covid-19 related revenue decline. additionally, results also reflect one less working day, which amounted to labor expense savings of approximately $6 million. other items such as corporate discretionary expense, amortization, and interest were also lower compared to last year. these results were partially offset by our planned infrastructure and organizational investment in areas such as it. however, i want to note that our investment spend for the quarter was approximately $4 million, which was lower than originally anticipated. during the quarter, we generated adjusted ebitda of approximately $124 million for a margin rate of 8.3% compared to $68.8 million or 4.3% last year.
i will now discuss our segment results. as i referenced earlier, these results reflect the ongoing impact of covid-19, which has resulted in revenue compression across our services. as scott discussed, our diversified segment structure has been a strength for us during the pandemic and each segment has been impacted by the pandemic in different ways, both positively and negatively.
in most cases though with perhaps the exception of technical solutions, our segment results reflect some combination of a mix shift toward higher work orders and enhancedclean services. labor modulation on lower service demand as well as operational investments in areas such as enhancedclean. b&i revenue was $809.4 million, which was down just $11.5 million or 1.4% versus last year. the parking and sports and entertainment businesses were the predominant drivers of the revenue decline due to the ongoing pandemic. almost entirely offsetting this decline was increased demand for higher margin work orders and enhancedclean services at our national accounts and certain client in corporate sectors such as financial institutions. operating profit for the quarter reflected this more favorable mix of business resulting an $85.7 million or a margin of 10.6% compared to last year's $38.2 million and 4.7% respectively.
technology & manufacturing remains one of our most resilient segments. t&m produced solid results for the quarter as it has since the beginning of the pandemic. the segment reported revenue of $249.2 million, an increase of 6.5% versus last year with an operating profit of $26.9 million or a margin rate of 10.8%. work orders and enhancedclean services drove demand for t&m particularly within the industrial manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and high-tech sectors. we also experienced growth with our logistic clients as we supported them during the peak holiday season. our education segment grew revenues of $209.4 million with operating profit of $21.5 million or 10.2% margin. we believe these results reflect some stabilization as schools have continued the hybrid learning model that has been in effect since the back half of last year. performance was primarily attributable to direct labor management due to modified staffing levels and other expense savings as well as demand for disinfection and covid related work orders. looking ahead, we anticipate some reinstitution of a traditional selling season in 2021, which did not really exist last year due to the pandemic. we continue to monitor how schools are going to evolve their approach to teaching in the current environment particularly as vaccination rollouts progress.
aviation reported revenue of approximately $143 million with operating profit of $3.2 million. as anticipated, this segment remain most impacted by covid-19 and its effect on global travel. the quarter saw a modest sequential increase in travel due to the holiday, but also reverted quickly due to lockdowns in areas such as the uk. we continue to operate according to flight and passenger demand, providing higher tech services such as electrostatic spraying as we managed variable costs and expenses on a real time basis to match demand. finally, technical solutions reported revenue of $113 million versus $142 million last year. this decline was driven by site access issues as clients such as an education continue to limit traffic into their facilities in order to protect administrative staff, teachers and students. however backlog remains healthy above $150 million and we remain focused on churning through these projects as soon as possible. operating profit was $6 million or 5.3% on a margin basis.
turning to cash and liquidity. we reported positive cash flow during the first quarter despite this traditionally being a cash flow negative period. this even includes the deferral of approximately $31 million in payroll taxes from the cares act. we generated more than $45 million in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of approximately $39 million for the quarter.
our strong performance enabled us to end this quarter with total debt including standby letters of credit of $851 million and a bank adjusted leverage ratio of 1.8 times. additionally, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $378 million. given the consistency of our leverage and cash position over the last several quarters, we believe we have reached a point of stability both operationally and financially. as a result, we are evaluating our capital allocation priorities. in addition to organic investments in our business, we are also exploring the m&a market for potential targets to drive growth and build on our current momentum. while remaining cognizant of our reentry into m&a, we will also consider share repurchases opportunistically. we currently have approximately $145 million remaining in our authorized share repurchase program and we'll balance any potential activity with our m&a efforts to ensure maximum flexibility.
during the quarter we paid our 219th consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per common share for a total distribution of $12.7 million to shareholders. and as stated in our earnings release, our board of directors approved our 220th consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
now turning to our guidance outlook. we are introducing a fiscal 2021 gaap guidance outlook range of $2.85 to $3.10 and on an adjusted basis $3.00 to $3.25 per share. scott shared with you some great context from an operating perspective that supports our guidance. so let me now provide some additional assumptions behind our guidance. given our performance during the first quarter, we believe revenue will continue to improve sequentially with a return to growth in the back half of the year. and as growth improves and turn positive we will have to staff back up accordingly. therefore there may be a partial reduction in the level of labor efficiencies we have experienced over the past year, but make no mistake, we do expect to retain a portion of these savings based on new opportunities and labor management practices we have adopted during covid. and as it relates to higher margin work orders and enhancedclean services, we do not anticipate a material slowdown in demand for the balance of the fiscal year. we expect our investments to pick up throughout the remainder of the year as we support the strategic initiatives namely in our it transformation. on a year-over-year basis, we do expect an increase in corporate expenses for the year although timing may vary from quarter-to-quarter as you saw in the first quarter.
additionally, as a reminder, we undertook furlough and expense reduction efforts during the third quarter of last year. and as such, expect to see year-over-year increase in expenses as we have resumed a portion of those expenditures. we are still in the planning and design phase of our technology roadmap and we will update you as we finalize our plans. i'd also like to remind everyone that we will see an extra working day in q2 and one less working day in q3. each working day should represent approximately $6 million of labor expense similar to q1.
moving to taxes. we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for 2021. this tax rate does not include discrete tax items such as the work opportunity tax credit and the tax impact of stock-based compensation awards. at the end of december, wotc was formally extended by congress through 2025 and current estimate suggest a $5 million or $0.07 impact on 2020. and finally, while we are not guiding to free cash flow, until we can finalize the impact of our tech transformation on capital expenditures. i want to express my enthusiasm for the strong start to the year. given our strong cash flow performance to-date, we believe we'll be able to achieve a range above our historical $175 million to $200 million and look forward to updating you as we finalize our longer-term plan.
in closing, we're excited about our performance for the quarter as well as our outlook for the year and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress next quarter. operator, we are now ready for questions.

thank you. at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of tim mulrooney with william blair. please proceed with your question.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
good morning, scott. good morning, earl.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
thank you guys for taking my questions. so, a couple of questions on labor; first labor cost and then labor availability. on the labor cost side, last quarter you said that you anticipated retaining most of your labor arbitrage through year-end. that is a big part of your margin expansion coming from labor savings. but here we are a couple of months later and inflation is on the rise and on the forefront of everyone's mind, do you think the piece of your margin expansion that came from labor savings over the last 12 months, is it your expectation that eventually gets inflated away in the coming periods?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a good question. so, i mean the answer is yes and we've consistently said that. but i think it's important, tim, to level set this. and just as a reminder, you know 50% of our revenues come from unionized labor, which is above market wage and having benefits. so, we never really see pressure there. so it's really on the other 50%. so, we have mitigation right there.
and for us, as we think about labor and what we're doing, we put together a pod for this just like we did during covid when we talked about how we created these task forces. so, we have kind of a multi-discipline task force just focused on recruiting and labor efficiencies right now. and we're hyper targeting certain areas because not every area is built the same, right? there are places like orlando and dallas and houston, which have a little bit more pressure than other areas. and again, we're only really mostly focused on the non-union areas.
so, i think it's something that's top of mind for us, but i always point people back to 2018 and 2019 when there were labor pressures as well and how we navigated there. and it is what we do, right? so eventually, we will see some of the efficiencies trail off, which is what we said because people will return to work and we'll be restaffing the buildings. but we are going to maintain some of those savings because of efficiencies of restaffing. so, we feel good about that.
and then, the last thing i'll say about the labor pressures is, we do ultimately get this back from our customers. it's not exactly elastic, but we pass through and we've shown in '18 and '19 that as labor costs rise, we're really good at recapturing those from customers because they get it, because they're facing the same thing. so it's not anything that's kind of just segmented to our industry. so again, top of mind, but we feel like we got this.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
okay. that's very reassuring. thanks scott. any of the investments that you've made recently, is there anything there that would help you pass on this cost in a different way, new capabilities that you have -- that you hadn't had before? or is that not really related to this piece of the business?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
it's not necessarily related to this piece of business. but i will tell you, the first tranche of our technology path was a couple of years ago when we upgraded our hr system and went to the cloud and got a -- again, much better capability.
so it helps us have insight and information that we never had a couple of years ago. and in this kind of labor game, the key is having information, knowing where the pressure points are, knowing how to articulate and dynamically staff. so, i'd say the newer investments are not necessarily exactly related to labor because, fortunately, we got ahead of that fortuitously.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
understood. if i could just squeeze one more in. i wanted to ask about labor availability. i mean you guys had 114,000 employees toward the year end. and i know this was down from 2019, but still more employees than pretty much every other company on my coverage list. so my question here is not about labor cost, it's about labor availability. most companies i talk to list labor availability as the prevailing issue right now even more so than inflation. so, is labor availability a major issue for you right now? and if so, has this affected service levels in any material way?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so -- funny, i would say, probably for our 112-year history, labor availability is always top of mind, right, because of what we do, alright. but what i would say is this, i'd say it's still little early in the game, right? there was a federal stimulus out there of $300 a week, which we all know about, over and above unemployment.
and you do the math on that, you think about a $15,000 a year bump for people who are on unemployment. so that's something that keeps people at home and we're starting to see some of the states roll it off starting this month. and in september, the federal program rolls off.
so, i think it's a little early to see about what the labor availability will be in the fall when people return to work because that's when we'll really going to need it. but we don't have this massive need right now because, generally speaking, tim, right now it's still very muted occupancy in office buildings, right, and travel, still only about 60% of where it was.
so, i think we'll have more to say on other companies. we're going to have more to say after the federal stimulus wears off and how many people reenter the workforce. so for now, we're navigating it well. but again, we'll acknowledge it's definitely at muted levels right now of lead, right? so, i think september is going to be the time where everybody is going to really understand what the availability pressures are. but i think anything before that is just speculation in our mind.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
okay.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
is that helpful? does that make sense?
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
yeah. that's very helpful. understood. thanks for taking my questions.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
you bet, tim.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of sean eastman with keybanc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my questions and nice job, again, this quarter.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
i guess just going back to the margin discussion, the different moving parts there. i mean, we have an updated second half outlook, but it seems like the dynamic in the business doesn't really change too too much until the fall, september, october. so it's kind of right at the end of the fiscal year. i'm just wondering how much we can extrapolate from the second half about the updated margin guidance as we think about what's sustainable going into next year.
i mean, i could just go round and round in circles around the different moving parts between labor efficiencies and how these it investments trend, ats coming back and being a growth driver again. i mean, is this implied second-half run rate sustainable? what are the big moving parts we really need to consider in our models going into next year relative to that run rate?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so let's -- and obviously, we're not ready to guide yet for '22. so, i mean i have limited to say about that. but i could tell you, look, we feel super confident about the second half of this fiscal year for us. that's why we were able to raise guidance. and a lot of that honestly, sean, has to do with having better line of sight. we've been really consistent about the fact that we want to be responsible and until we have line of sight, we're not going to get over our skis, right?
so, i think we have -- at this point in time, we feel like we have really good line of sight to the rest of this year and the dynamics looked really good. between enhancedclean and our work orders in the second half, they maintained at the levels of the first half. and we feel like it's going to be strong for the rest of this year. we believe there is going to be a return to work. is it going to be a 100% of office occupancy? absolutely not.
but we're probably seeing somewhere around 25% average across the country and probably more in the range of 40% in the southern states and 16% on the coast. so, we think that's going to tick up and return to work is going to be more revenues for us. it's going to be more disinfection services. we'll give a little bit of that back from the labor efficiencies because we'll have to restaff the buildings, but that's really a positive trend for us.
and the last thing and you mentioned is, technical solutions, we have a backlog of over $250 million in business, our strongest ever and more importantly, our churn rate is up. we -- typically, our churn rates for the second quarter was somewhere in the range of 12%. but sequentially, through the quarter got stronger and stronger and so we're excited about that to actually churn to work.
so, i think you're going to see -- you're going to see revenues go up in the second half. you're going to see disinfection strong. you'll see, again, the mitigation on the labor side, but you're also going to see ats churn up as well. so, i think we feel really good about that and we'll see where it goes into '22 as we get closer to that.
and again, november 1st starts our '22, and i think that's still going to be at the time where people are returning to work. and so, i think we'll have a good start to '22 as well, but again, it's early to start guiding. does that makes sense?
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. yeah, it does. okay. and obviously, the balance sheet is primed for some capital deployment here. seems like you kind of stepped up your m&a commentary a little bit and your communications here this quarter. i mean, could you just talk -- speak to the velocity in the acquisition pipeline? i'm hearing from a lot of companies that sort of tell you the decision making is really accelerating here?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so there is definitely more activity. and remember, for us, we were pretty consistent last year that until we get through this pandemic, until we feel like there is stabilized liquidity and what have you, we won't going start thinking about it. so, we've only been in the game for a very short period of time, but we have our teams out there. there is activity.
we'd like to think there is going to be opportunity for us. and the nice thing for us as -- and you -- i'm not going to tell you anything you haven't heard about private equity and having access to capital. but the nice thing for us is that we as a strategic buyer have synergies, both operating and revenue that helps make us competitive if there is an attractive asset out there. so it's definitely a priority for us, m&a, because growth is so important. so, we're excited about what we're starting to see.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. excellent. i'll turn it over there. thanks so much, scott.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, sean.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of andy wittmann with robert w. baird. please proceed with your question.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
great. good morning and thanks for taking my question. scott, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that your b&i customers and some of your manufacturing customers, they're going to keep cleaning. do you think that some of the enhanced cleaning services might become part of the contract? and so i just want to understand that mechanism a little bit more.
do you expect that those will be negotiated contracts? or as they look to increase the size, do you think, generally speaking, that your customers, as they look to increase the amount of cleaning that they do, that they got to rebid with that? and what do you think, as these things become part of the base contract and less tag worker or work order work? what, if any, implications are there to the margins? what are your thoughts on that one?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a great question. and i think -- you know what andy, i think we've been really consistent for the past few quarters saying that the natural gravitation of this work will be to be embedded in scope because i mean, look, i was a former facility manager. that's what i would do, right?
and so, i think as clients start thinking about retendering contracts, which will probably happen over the next year or two, i do see them incorporating in. it's a smart thing to do. and i think we've talked about 30% margins on this work. we'll see that trail down a little bit. i don't know where it will end up landing. will it land at 20%? will it land at 25%?
but the reality is for us, there is -- it's a higher value service and you can build in a higher margin for a higher value service. there is training. there is equipment. there is all these protocols. so, i think we'll be able to retain a good amount of the margin. but absolutely, the expectation is that it will gravitate into the base contracts for the bigger clients. for the smaller tenants, i think it's still going to be kind of on a work order basis, which would make sense for them as well.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
that makes sense. but as we sit here today in june, are you seeing those kinds of discussions happening or this is just still -- i mean, you've been saying this for a while, like you just said there, but are you seeing anything today that -- toward this trend here in june?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
not yet. you know why? because people aren't really focused on rebidding contracts right now, right. i think if you think of the life of a facility manager right now, what's top of mind for them is preparing for return to work for all their workers, right. so they are looking at reoccupancy programs. they are looking at space planning for their offices, all the health and safety stuff.
rebidding a janitorial contract is a pretty big deal and it takes a lot of focus and effort. so, my sense is that kind of thing is going to happen probably '22, '23 versus the back half of this year because we just haven't heard about any plans yet on scale to get in the market and rebid.
and i think the other part of it, the insight i have, andy, and maybe this is helpful is, when you don't know -- when you are a facility manager and you don't know what's your ultimate occupancy is going to be or floor layout, you're getting ahead of yourself by bidding the contract because you can't really drill down on a good scope yet, because you just don't know how it's all going to land.
so kind of -- if i were in their shoes, i would think it's premature right now to start putting together a formal scoping for what the new ways of work look like because people haven't really returned yet. does that make sense?
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
yeah, it makes a lot of sense. and just on technical solutions here, you guys put in electric vehicle charging stations, you retrofit schools with all kinds of different systems. both of these things are talked about as having -- actually, some of these have passed the $1.9 trillion thing had money directly for schools.
i'm wondering, i wouldn't expect that it's in the backlog yet, but are you bidding projects that you can kind of tie to these moneys that have been allocated already? you mentioned the record backlog, i'm just kind of curious as to -- if that's kind of before the stimulus here or after the stimulus and any comments that you have on that in particular?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the good news is we haven't seen yet the direct effect of that because a lot of these programs haven't been formalized. but i can tell you that this kind of bundling of solutions and our energies, we call it bes, which is bundled energy solutions, which is this project retrofit work. we're seeing a lot of activity on that because there are still other government programs out there and any of the school districts can raise capital, where they're getting the pressure is on their operating margin still.
so, we're just seeing an increase on pipeline side of clients, who were talking about ways to lower operating expenses and that plays right into the strength of what we do with our -- again, our bundled energy solution. and then you take on top of that, the administration's new focus with decarbonization and e-mobility.
our easy charging is probably -- it's still a relatively small segment for us, but it's probably our fastest growing. and it's really turning into something that we're putting a lot of focus on. so, we think everything that's going on societally and with the administration is going to be a big tailwind for us in '22 and '23.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then just last question quickly here for earl. i wanted to talk about the unallocated corporate expense segment results. i mean, you guys -- you mentioned in the prepared remarks that your kind of $20 million of investments this year over last year, that's on track. you guys have been saying it's going to be $40 million for the year. seems like that's kind of where you are on those investments.
but earl, just wanted to make sure that for all of our models here that we're getting this right. [indecipherable] last year's corporate and unallocated expense segment is going to be plus $40 million on these investments. but i also think that there is -- because the year is where it is, you mentioned in the press release even that the stock compensation is going to be up in addition to that.
so, i was just wondering if you just could help us a little bit as to how much the stock comp is up year-over-year as well, just so that we can kind of get a sense of what that line is. and then, obviously, the implications -- will it be rolled back into the implications for the operating segment margins as well? just be kind of helpful to understand how you're thinking about that unallocated segment line?
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, andy, would love to do that. so just to start with, as we mentioned last quarter, we're continuing to invest in both our talent to support our future growth opportunities as well as the planning and design phase of our tech solutions rollout -- for the rollout of our tech transformation. and as we mentioned, that investment year-over-year is approximately a $40 million increase.
and when we look at the year-to-date, we've actually spent $20 million of that. although if you recall in q1, it was actually a little bit of a late start and that we actually spent probably about $3 million to $5 million of that, but caught up in the second quarter.
as we look to the back half of the year that $10 million clip we'll continue to spend over q3 and q4. now having said that, however, when you look at it from a year-over-year perspective, it might look a little lumpy, in that if you look at q3, you have to recall last year where we actually had the benefit of the furlough, you'll actually see as a result of that a tick up.
and then, when you look to q4, although we'll still be spending that $10 million, that spending actually started last year in q4. and therefore, q4 year-over-year will look kind of flattish, but we are still on track with the $40 million spend for this year.
in addition to that, we are seeing an increase in our share-based compensation and that's to the tune of approximately $15 million year-over-year. and that's a product of a number of things, including special grants that came up last year, as well as just how we're actually tracking on the grants that will actually come to vesting this year.
again, you're going to see some lumpiness in that that year-over-year increase, you'll see the vast majority of that impacting in this past quarter, q2 year-over-year as last year we took a significant reduction in our reserve, as we were anticipating the impacts of the pandemic. we then started to ramp up that investment last year, that accruals last year. so as you look at the back half of this year, we anticipate more a smoothing year-over-year with regards to share-based compensation.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
all right. that's very helpful. thank you very much. have a great day, guys.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer

operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of david silver with cl king & associates. please proceed with your question.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
yeah. hi, good morning. so, maybe if i could just ask earl to follow up a tiny bit on the stock-based comp discussion that you just finished. always a number of moving parts in these programs, but for our understanding purposes going forward, should we be tracking, let's say, the closing -- the point-to-point change in your share price. in other words, january 31 to april 30 led to the bulk of that expense this quarter or is it more of an accrual with time or an average share price? in other words, might there be a couple of rules of thumb you could share that might give us a little bit of a heads up going forwards to kind of adjust our expectations for that expense item? thank you.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. well, when you look at our share-based compensation, for the most part, there are a number of metrics, but the large percentage is really -- metric is really weighted on our financial performance. and that would be both revenue as well as our ebitda. so one of the things that you can clearly track is how we're actually progressing on those two metrics.
and it's clear to say, especially, this year with regards to our ebitda and our earnings that again, have been driven by the margin expansion; that really is the significant benefactor, if you will, to the increased accrual that we're actually seeing in the stock compensation plan.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay, thank you for that. and then, scott, i had a question about the project reserve that your company took couple of quarters ago. so, i think it was $18 million pre-tax. but my understanding was that was kind of tied to the inability of your customer to kind of open or begin operations.
with the -- i was just wondering if you could give us an update there on whether you think the current pace of, let's say, the reopening of workplaces and social venues and things? i mean, should we be thinking that, that reserve might be reversed in coming quarters? and what's your -- maybe just an update on that issue, please.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, look, i'm an eternal optimist, right. so -- but i will tell you, david, like we're in active discussions and it's something it's really difficult to comment on because we are still -- it's still ongoing. so, just like any other kind of reserve we take, we don't give up and we go after it. and so i think, suffice to say, active conversations and more to come on that.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then, maybe just one more kind of bigger picture question. and this would have to do with branding, i guess, or your marketing strategies and your marketing programs to-date. so, you've mentioned in the past you have ramped up marketing efforts on a number of platforms and i've seen your national commercial on cnbc quite a bit. and two things. i mean, first, i was just wondering if you could point to any tangible results in particular, product lines or sub-sectors that where you think the greater awareness, the greater visibility has made a difference?
and then secondly, maybe just a longer-term perspective. in other words, your company has been in business for over a century. you already have a national footprint and yet you kind of have redoubled your marketing efforts here. maybe if you could just point to, maybe from a one or two-year perspective. i mean, where do you think that that greater awareness, the branding efforts are going to have the biggest effect?
in other words, might it encourage people who had been using maybe a regional player or a mom and a pop to step up to a higher level of service that they associate with your name now or maybe regionally areas where you hadn't been as -- that you're looking to penetrate? maybe that's a necessary pre-condition for success there? so, just overall branding success to-date and then where do you think -- where should we look for the greatest impact over the next year or two? thank you.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. so look, i think, especially with what we're doing with the commercial, brand is so important. and what you're trying to do is create differentiation in the market. and you hit on it, right. there is like kind of abm and then there is regionalized competitors and what we are attempting to do and i think the pandemic has done it is, really, say, like there is kind of us and our resources and our scale and there is everybody else.
and the way that that manifested itself is on our supply chain. we were never the ones that were without disinfectant or ppe for our people, electrostatic sprayers because of, again, our sourcing capability. and not every client that had a regional player can say that they fared as well. and then we had an advisory council that we put together of outside experts to synthesize what the cdc and the world health organization was saying, so our clients could get a better lens on that.
all these things, the small regional players couldn't do. and then you put on top of that commercials on cnbc, it's like -- it's just creating a choice differential that we think is going to be super impactful. hopefully, that's going to have an impact on our retention over the next couple of years. we've been over 90%, a 1 percentage point tick up in retention is dramatic in our business. so, we're hoping that.
we've seen, last time i checked, and my information is a few weeks old, but i think it was something around a 10% increase in hits on our website. and our sales team is seeing tracking coming through digitally. so, i think it's a confluence of things, david, but again, it's elevating the brand between how we performed and the exposure now that we're doing on tv and through all the social channels. it's just -- it's going to -- all we're trying to do at abm is create the separation between our platform and our small regional competitors.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.

thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of marc riddick with sidoti & company. please proceed with your question.
marc riddick -- sidoti & co. -- analyst
good morning.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
marc riddick -- sidoti & co. -- analyst
so, i wanted to just sort of fill in a few of the blanks that we've had from some of the other questions which were already answered. i wanted to start first with going back to the acquisition commentary in the press release and what you've talked about a little bit more recently. just wanted to touch a little bit on whether or not there is any particular areas that you would view as priorities or things that are kind of top of the list that you'd like to see accomplish, whether it'd be a regional selling or a service line area. how should we think about your prioritization of potential acquisitions?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, look, i think for us, we're very intent on sticking to our core, right? and the core of what we do is janitorial stationing, engineering, right? and that with the pandemic and what's happened through all virus protection and our credibility there, we think that's a great accelerator for us. so, we will look for scale there. and you know how much we love the ats work, right? it's our fastest growing and most profitable segment. so, we have a high interest in growing that platform too.
so you know what marc, i think before we start looking for adjacencies outside of the core of what we do, we're really going to stick within the core and scale is always better, right? integrating a small company is as much work as integrating a big company. so, i think we're going to synthesize those. and then there are certain regions even with our -- with our ats work, there are certain regions that we'd like to fill in, where we're maybe not as strong as others.
so, there'll be a little bit of a geographic dent when it comes to ats. so, we have a really good metrics of what we're looking for. and what we said for the past few years is what i'd say now, we are not going to be reactive. we're going to be strategic and planful on how we go after acquisitions.
marc riddick -- sidoti & co. -- analyst
great. and then, i wanted to switch back to talking about some of the segment actively seen during the quarter because one of things that was interesting to me was the strongest segment growth was in education. it seems as though of all the areas of your work, that seem to have been the biggest beneficiary of the strength of the rollout of vaccines and what have you.
i was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about some of the conversations that you're having within the education space and maybe some of the commentary there or maybe what you're seeing from the benefits of funding that kind of gives you -- it seems as though it gives you greater confidence for the upcoming school year.
but certainly, the vaccines seems to have accelerated activity at the very end of this school year. but it also seems to maybe have accelerated the timing of some of those conversations. so, just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about that?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a good question. from the educators, we've been talking to within our client base and stuff we hear in the industry, it seems to be this very binary shift toward in-person learning and the whole remote when it comes to the fall, right? so that's really the next -- really piece of the puzzle right now that school is generally out right now. we're talking about in-person, which is great from a revenue standpoint for us.
again, we'll give some of it back on the labor efficiency. but all the educators we talk to, healthy, clean, safe buildings is top of mind. and it's for them and the parents, right? parents are very vocal about this. so, we're excited about the potential in education because we suspect, if you look at our different segments, right, our technology and manufacturing, which is really focused as much on manufacturing side, they never stop and our revenues always remained strong.
and then you had our b&i, which is office occupancy reduction, right. i think aviation is one that's going to lag probably more than any other segment. but education, i think it's going to have a strong come back in the fall, whereas when you look at b&i, i don't think anyone thinks that offices are going to be a 100% occupied in the fall, whereas it could be close to that for education. so, i think you're going to see a pretty strong rebound.
marc riddick -- sidoti & co. -- analyst
right. right. and then the last thing for me, totally different area, but i was wondering if you can give updated thoughts around -- given the strength of free cash flow generation, debt reduction was substantial than we were expecting. certainly, nice to see there. wanted to talk a little bit about views of future share repurchase and how we should think about, sort of given the strength of the business versus where your stock price is now, kind of how your thoughts are evolving there? thanks.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, it's earl, marc. thanks for the questions. i would say that we're really pleased with the amount of cash that we're currently sitting on as well as our low leverage, which really gives us the opportunity now really to deploy that capital for the purposes of supporting our long-term growth strategy. and as such, we are going to be looking to invest in both organic as well as inorganic growth.
now having said that, we're going to remain our flexibility with regards to capital allocation. as you know, we currently have authorization upwards of about $145 million from the board to actually pursue share buybacks. so, we'll keep that flexibility as time proceeds. but at this point in time, the focus really is around allocating capital for growth purposes for long-term growth, marc.
marc riddick -- sidoti & co. -- analyst
thank you very much.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, marc.
operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. i'll turn the floor back to mr. salmirs for any final comments.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i just want to take a moment to thank everyone for supporting us through this period. so proud of what our team members have done and appreciate the interest from our investor base and analysts based on what we're doing.
and you can tell that there is a strong level of enthusiasm about the future for abm between the brand elevation, between our margin elevation and about societal reflections on virus protection going forward. we think we're just in a super good spot to continue to invest in and accelerate the platform.
and the most important thing is just, we're not out of this yet and i would just urge everybody to not let their guard down and stay safe through this. and we have good things coming. so, thank you all for the time today. really appreciate it.

operator
greetings and welcome to the abm industries' second quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
i'd now like to turn the conference over to your host mr. david gold, investor relations for abm industries. thank you. you may begin.
david gold -- investor relations
thank you for joining us this morning. with us today are scott salmirs, our president and chief executive officer and earl ellis our executive vice president and chief financial officer. we issued our press release yesterday afternoon announcing our second quarter fiscal 2021 financial results. a copy of this release and the accompanying slide presentation can be found on our corporate website.
before we begin, i'd like to remind you that our call and presentation today contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. our use of the words estimate, expect, and similar expressions are intended to identify these statements. statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds.
while we believe them to be reasonable, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. these factors are described in a slide that accompanies our presentation as well as our filings with the sec.
during the course of this call, certain non-gaap financial information will be presented. a reconciliation of those numbers to gaap financial measures is available at the end of the presentation and on the company's website under the investor tab.
i would now like to turn the call over to scott.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, david. good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. as detailed in yesterday's press release, abm reported strong second quarter financial results, building on the progress we achieved in our first quarter.
second quarter adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share increased to $0.82, up nearly 37% from the year ago quarter. we generated significant operating leverage with adjusted ebitda improving 17% year-over-year to $106.6 million and adjusted ebitda margin increasing 100 basis points to 7.1% on slightly higher revenues.
we are pleased to note that for the first time in five quarters, growth in four of our key segments, b&i, t&m, education and technical solutions more than offset the softness in aviation which, while improved on a sequential basis, continue to reflect the impact of the pandemic.
in short, our second quarter performance reflected a consistently high level of operational execution by our team amid gradually improving business conditions, in sync with the reopening of the economy. this strong showing and our current visibility have enabled us to increase our full-year guidance for adjusted earnings per share, while we continue to invest to support future growth.
consistent with what we have discussed over the past several quarters, our customers continue to prioritize protecting their people and spaces, driving strong demand for our higher-margin virus disinfection work orders. enhancedclean, our proprietary and trusted protocols for cleaning and disinfecting spaces was an important contributor to our second quarter results as well.
we also continue to benefit from efficient labor management as our flexible labor model enabled us to identify and capitalize on staffing efficiencies arising from the adoption of remote and hybrid work environments, particularly within our b&i segment where office occupancy in large metropolitan areas remain relatively low. as employees transition back to the office, we anticipate some easing in our labor efficiency, but we expect revenue growth in the second half of the year and increased work orders to mitigate that effect.
with our scale, capabilities, end market diversity and breadth of services, abm remains well positioned for continued revenue and earnings growth as the reopening momentum continues. there are several key trends that support our outlook for continued strong performance in the coming quarters.
first, our clients in both the office and manufacturing markets indicate they plan to continue to incorporate disinfection into their cleaning protocols as they prepare for the return of staff and workers to their offices and industrial facilities.
in fact, given the heightened concerns around pandemic risks and greater awareness of public health issues in general, we expect these specialized services to remain in demand and to become part of our client contracts. abm has been an essential partner in helping our customers navigate through the challenges of the past year and our 90%-plus retention rate, which ticked up in the second quarter speaks to the confidence our customers have in our services and capabilities.
second, we expect continued sequential improvement in our aviation segment, as pent-up demand for travel translates into higher demand for aviation services. as earl will discuss in his comments, we are transitioning our aviation business mix to favor higher-margin contracts with airports and adjacent facilities, with less of a focus on airline services. this strategic shift has created attractive growth opportunities for abm outside of the airport, such as parking services and provides for a more consistent and more profitable business mix in our aviation segment.
additionally, we expect to see increased demand for disinfection and cleaning services in line with the pickup in travel activity. early signs of return to leisure travel have been encouraging and increased business travel is projected to follow later in the year and into next year.
third, school districts have accelerated the return to in-person learning. our conversations with school district professionals and educational institutions indicate that with the full-time return to school expected this fall, cleaning and disinfecting will be a priority throughout the school year. we expect these services to become part of the broader scope of services for new contracts and rebids, providing abm with revenue and growth opportunities.
finally, the energy efficiency and retrofit solutions that we offer in our technical services segment, our highest margin business, provide significant operating cost savings for our customers and enable them to reduce their environmental impact. now that we have greater access to client sites, we expect to increasingly work through our technical services backlog, which was at a record level at the end of the second quarter. additionally, this segment is well positioned to benefit from the new administration's priorities around decarbonization and energy efficiency.
as we look toward the second half of the fiscal year, we are confident that we can leverage our significant competitive advantages to achieve continued progress. you may recall that at the very outset of the pandemic, we established 19 operational task forces or pods as we call them, to marshal our tremendous internal resources on the issues at hand, to focus on our virus disinfection offerings; our field operations; as well as finance, legal, liquidity, cash flow and human resources.
this task force model proved to be a fast and effective way of identifying potential business issues and utilizing cross-functional expertise to develop and implement solutions. given the success of these initiatives, we will continue to use this model to address emerging situations. in fact, our human resources task force is now focused on recruiting and retention and will be instrumental in helping us manage utilization as additional staffing is required to accommodate increased occupancy levels.
additionally, our strong balance sheet and robust cash flow provide us with substantial resources to fund investments to support future growth. we invested in information technology initiatives during the first half of fiscal 2021 and we anticipate investing further during the second half of the year. these investments in technology, data analytics and strategic initiatives are designed to strengthen our client relationships and further empower our employees.
while we will speak about these initiatives later in the year, i can share that we are currently piloting client-facing solutions using sensors to generate real-time occupancy data that inform our janitorial programs and allow us to share service delivery details with our clients via digital displays.
additionally, we are expanding our use of technology to workforce management with a digital test management solution that records work performed and facilitates dynamic route changes to accommodate shifting client demand.
lastly, the abm brand is recognized worldwide, and our recent advertising campaign has served to reinforce the scale, scope and capabilities of our organization. these attributes enabled us to step in immediately to provide our branded services to clients needing a safe environment for their employees and consumers.
the abm brand is synonymous with this tremendous commitment to customer service, which is supported by our ability to deliver. as we enter a post-pandemic environment, we believe the abm brand will provide us with considerable competitive advantages across our business segments.
turning now to the specifics of our outlook. given our strong performance in the first half and our expectations for continued year-over-year growth in the second half, we are maintaining our guidance for full-year fiscal 2021 gaap income from continuing operations of $2.85 to $3.10 per diluted share, inclusive of a second quarter litigation reserve of $0.32.
at the same time, we are increasing our guidance for full-year 2021 adjusted income from continuing operations to $3.30 to $3.50 per diluted share, up from $3.00 to $3.25 previously. this includes additional investments in client-facing technology and workforce management. we're also increasing our outlook for adjusted ebitda margin to a range of 7% to 7.3% from 6.6% to 7% previously.
we also ended the first half with robust new sales of $727 million, including $100 million associated with our enhancedclean offerings, another first half record. this supports our confidence in the company's organic second half performance. additionally, we continue to explore acquisition opportunities where, as a strategic buyer, we would be able to drive meaningful revenue and operating synergies.
before i turn the call over to earl, i'd like to thank all of our abm team members for their continued dedication and hard work. over the past year, we have made tremendous operational progress and have proven our value as an essential partner to our clients during these dynamic and challenging times.
i've never been more inspired by our purpose, our team and our organization. i also want to thank our customers for their confidence in us. as we emerge from this difficult period, i am so pleased with our performance and are more confident than ever in our future potential.
i'll now turn the call over to earl.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, scott, and good morning, everyone. second quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 0.1% from last year. as scott mentioned, revenue in four of our segments grew on a year-over-year basis, offsetting the continued pandemic-related softness we've experienced in the aviation segment. key revenue growth drivers in the quarter included higher disinfection related work orders and continued strong demand for our enhancedclean services.
on a gaap basis, income from continuing operations was $31.1 million or $0.46 per diluted share. by comparison, in last year's second quarter, we reported gaap income from continuing operations of negative $136.8 million or negative $2.05 per diluted share.
as scott mentioned, gaap income from continuing operations in this year's second quarter includes a non-cash $30 million reserve for an ongoing litigation equivalent to $0.32 per diluted share. this non-cash reserve relates to litigation dating back 15 years, primarily relating to a legacy timekeeping system that was phased out in full by 2013. you will find additional information in our form 10-q, which will be filed later today.
the recorded reserve is based on a host of factors, considerations and judgments and the ultimate resolution of this matter could be significantly different. as this litigation remains ongoing, we are unable to disclose further information at this time.
as a reminder, last year's gaap loss included a $2.55 per share impairment charge. excluding these charges, our adjusted income from continuing operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was $55.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted share compared to $40.4 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year.
the increase in adjusted income from continuing operations was attributable to our strong operational performance, including growth in our higher margin services as well as efficient labor management and the recapture of bad debt.
in addition, we benefited from favorable business mix, particularly in our technical solutions segment where we executed on higher-margin projects. excluding items impacting comparability, corporate expense for the second quarter increased by $26.6 million year-over-year. approximately $10 million of the variation was due to increased stock-based compensation, with the remaining $16 million representing investments and other-related expenses. thus, information technology and other strategic investments spend in the first half of fiscal 2021 was $20 million, in line with our expectations.
now, turning to our segment results. business & industry revenue grew 1.4% year-over-year to $796.2 million, driven largely by strength in demand for higher-margin disinfection related work orders and enhancedclean services. as a result, operating profit in this segment increased 44.1% to $85.3 million.
our technology & manufacturing segment continue to see upside from demand for covid-19 related services. revenue here increased 5.4% year-over-year to $246.3 million, and operating profit margin improved to 10.9%, up from 8.4% last year. we benefit from the recapture of roughly $2 million of bad debt in this year's second quarter. but even adjusting for this, our profit margin still showed improvement. the growth in revenue and margin was fueled by a higher level of work orders and new customer contract wins for our services.
education revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $214.2 million, representing the strongest growth rate among our segments in the second quarter. the acceleration in revenue growth primarily reflected the positive impact from the reopening of schools and other educational facilities in the second quarter and the shift toward more in-person learning.
education operating profit totaled $13.6 million, representing a margin of 6.3%, slightly down year-over-year on an operating [phonetic] basis as a result of labor challenges in our southern u.s. operations.
bad debt expense was roughly $1 million lower than last year, and this was a contributing factor to the operating profit improvement we experienced in this segment. although the specific labor costs i mentioned will not recur in the third quarter, we anticipate that the return of students to school on a full-time basis will lead to some reduction in labor efficiency within this segment in the second half.
aviation revenue declined 19.7% in the second quarter to $148.3 million. although reduced global travel continues to weigh on this segment, revenue improved 3.6% on a sequential basis, marking the third consecutive quarter that aviation segment revenue has improved sequentially. with industry data points indicating a progressive recovery in global travel, we are optimistic that revenue in our aviation segment will continue to improve over the second half of fiscal 2021.
aviation operating profit was $5.8 million, representing a margin of 3.9%. while our airline customers continue to request higher margin enhanced cleaning services such as electrostatic spraying, margin remain below normalized levels given reduced volumes.
as scott mentioned, we are focused on securing more profitable overall business with airports and related facilities and have continued to de-emphasize our airline services work. this strategic shift in our aviation segment business mix had a positive revenue and margin impact on our second quarter results and should benefit future periods as well.
technical solutions revenue increased 2.6% year-over-year to $125.5 million. operating margin was 8.2% in the second quarter, up significantly from 5.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to a favorable mix of higher-margin projects. as client site access improves, we remain positive on the growth trajectory of the technical solutions segment.
shifting now to our cash and liquidity. we ended the second quarter with $435.7 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $394.2 million at the end of fiscal 2020. with total debt of $797.9 million as of april 30th, 2021, our total debt to pro forma adjusted ebitda, including standby letters of credit, was 1.7 times for the second quarter of fiscal 2021.
second quarter operating cash flow from continuing operations was $125.9 million, down from $162.3 million in the same period last year. the decline in cash flow from continuing operations during the second quarter was primarily due to the timing of cash taxes.
for the six month period ending april 30th, 2021, operating cash flow from continuing operations totaled $171.2 million. free cash flow from continuing operations was $117 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and $156 million for this year's first half. as a reminder, cash flow is benefiting from payroll tax deferral related to the cares act. beginning next year, the deferral will be paid at $66 million in each of the next two years.
we were pleased to pay our 220th consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.19 per common share during the second quarter, returning an additional $12.7 million to our shareholders. our board also declared our 221st consecutive quarterly dividend, which will be payable in august to shareholders of record on july 1st.
supported by the strength of our balance sheet, we have the financial resources to support our capital allocation priority of adding additional growth by investing organically while pursuing potential acquisitions.
now, i'll provide some additional color on our guidance and outlook. as mentioned, our increased guidance for full year fiscal 2021 adjusted income from continuing operations is now a range of $3.30 to $3.50 per diluted share compared to $3.00 to $3.25 previously.
our upward revised adjusted earnings forecast reflects the strength of our first half as well as our positive view for the second half. as a reminder, our third quarter has one fewer day than last year, equivalent to about $6 million and reduced labor expense.
on a gaap basis, we continue to expect eps from continuing operations of $2.85 to $3.10, inclusive of the $0.32 litigation reserve in the second quarter. we continue to expect a 30% tax rate for fiscal 2021, excluding discrete items such as the work opportunity tax credits and the tax impact of stock-based compensation awards.
as we noted in our first quarter conference call in march, our expectation was to achieve cash flow above our historical range of $175 million to $200 million for fiscal 2021. now having generated $171 million of operating cash flow in the first half alone, we are confident that we will achieve free cash flow for fiscal 2021 of $215 million to $240 million.
we are pleased with our positioning, as business across the country emerge from the pandemic and we look forward to helping our clients provide safe environment for their employees and customers. and i am personally looking forward to meeting with each of you in person, hopefully as soon as later this year and to connecting with you virtually until then.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first questions come from the line of tim mulrooney with william blair. please proceed with your questions.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
good morning, scott. good morning, earl.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
a couple of margin related questions for me. so ebitda margins are still very strong given the strong demand for higher margin work and some labor savings i think. so last year the margin expansion split was about 50:50 between those two factors. i'm curious how that split broke down? how that looked for the third quarter? and because the economy continues to reopen, how you're thinking about those two factors based on the implied guidance that -- which you gave for the fourth quarter?
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, thanks for the question, tim, it's earl. i'll start by saying that this year in q3 we're now lapping a full quarter of the pandemic that started last year, so it's now lapping year-over-year. now having said that, out of the 50 basis points that we actually lost year-over-year, our gross profit margin was actually up about 40 basis points and a lot of that is actually driven by the continued labor efficiencies that we've gained as well as positive business mix, really driven by our aviation business, and then we've actually been able to maintain the level of disinfection margin that we actually had last year. so again, if you think about it lapping year-over-year, we've maintained the margins from disinfection and we're actually still maintaining the labor margin.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
okay, yeah, that's...
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and just -- and your second question, as far as how that translates to the future. again, as we look at the return to office, we've now seen a return to-in-class learning. we anticipate that will actually start to lose some of the labor efficiencies. however, in the long-term we still plan on maintaining a fair portion of that.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
okay, thanks. so i think maybe a good way to continue this discussion would be to actually dig into one of the segments, so you're aviation business not only did it recover in margin, but it actually -- the ebit margin expanded beyond what the business had done historically. how much of that increase do you think is structural due to changes that you you guys have made within the segment, whether it's to focus on different areas of the business or whether it's becoming more efficient in your operation as you move to the pandemic, has the ebit margin structurally improved in aviation or is it just kind of elevated right now from all the higher margin cleaning work and travel increasing, that kind of thing?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, hey tim, this is scott. yeah, i do think there is a structural improvement here. first, i think the good performance is volume related. there is certainly more airline traffic, we're at about 74% of where we were pre-covid and that may ease off a little bit after the summer travel, but certainly much more heightened levels, which we were excited about. but there's also been a shift in us moving from airline to airport, it used to be about 50:50, now we're more like 60:40 airports to airlines, and we kind of like that shift mix. we think there's going to be a lot of investment in airports. we also like the parking segment in that area. so i think there will be a structural change and structural stability more importantly when we gravitate more toward airports. so, but i think when you look at the results today, it's a combination of that shift in mix, but also volume related.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
great, very helpful. thanks for taking my questions.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
you bet, tim.
operator
our next questions come from the line of sean eastman with keybanc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to continue on the margin discussion. i mean, earlier you did walk through the moving parts, that was really helpful. but it's just interesting to see b&i revenue essentially back at fiscal '19 run rates, yet margins holding in the double-digit territory. i mean, i was just wondering where these margins are going to settle out. i mean, just any more color you can provide, maybe within the footprint. clearly some geographies have seen occupancy trends improve, maybe others not so much. but maybe just based on what you're seeing in areas where occupancy has improved, just any kind of thoughts on where this sustainable b&i margin run rate settles out would be really helpful as we think about the go forward?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure, sean. look, i think this is still evolving, right. i would tell you that if you look at geographically speaking, if you look at kind of the two coasts you're talking about 20% office occupancy in b&i, give or take. and then kind of that middle of the country its 40% to 50%, but it hasn't -- it hasn't ramped up as fast as we all thought because of the delta variant. so i think it's still hard for us to pin down a formal long-term margin. we're looking forward to giving you full year guidance in the next three months and then that will give you the insight for the next year. but look, we're going to say what we've continue to say throughout, which is the two for elevated margins are in disinfecting and labor arbitrage, and we believe we will permanently keep portions of that as we restaff these buildings, we believe we're going to be able to do it more efficiently and we'll capture some savings. again, still too early to figure out how much.
and then the disinfecting, we see like -- maybe two quarters ago there was or maybe even a quarter ago there was no delta variant, right. so i think this is going to continue to evolve and we've all just said it even anecdotally, it's just -- i don't think facility managers or landlords or principles of schools, i don't think anyone thinks it's responsible to discontinue disinfection services, especially in high-touch areas. so that's going to continue too. so we believe we will continue to be elevated, but give us till next quarter when we do full year guidance to kind of give you that year outlook.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, fair enough, thanks for that. and maybe shifting over to ats. could you just speak to kind of the velocity in new business wins there? i mean clearly some of this energy efficiency, sort of esg related work is a big play with able. so just some color on client decision making there, new wins, backlog trends as we think about the growth potential in that business line?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so look it's -- it's thumbs up across the board when we look at new sales, we're at record new sales. our backlog, i think the number is 250 million plus in backlog, which is a record for us too. and our churn rate is going up. so not only is our backlog higher but we're churning out the work faster because we have more access to sites. we love -- i made some opening comments about ev charging, it's amazing. we've installed nearly half of the ev charging stations in the country to date. like, i don't think people realize that, right. so kind of the bandwidth we have there as the world moves to e-mobility is going to be fabulous for us. so we continue to be excited about that segment. and then you take -- you take able and you take all the engineering assignments and the ability to cross sell into that, we think there is just going to be phenomenal ability there. we think there's going to be phenomenal ability to create a ifs -- integrated facilities platform.
and as we talked about able with you all, we didn't put any revenue synergies, so, that's all on the upside that's not factored in. so couldn't be more enthusiastic about where ats is going from our core business to our ability to cross-sell to where society is heading. we think it's just again thumps up across the board.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, terrific. thanks, scott. i'll turn it over.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, sean.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of andy wittmann with baird. please proceed with your questions.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
yeah, great. thanks for taking my questions, guys. maybe, scott, i wanted to broaden out that last question that was focused on sales for the technical solutions segment and just talk about base contractual revenue and basically if you could talk a little bit about net new business in the quarter, over the last year or so, certainly early in the pandemic it was just all about kind of hunkering down and your retention was up because nobody wanted to change. time has progressed, things are reopening. i wanted to get a sense from you about the level of customer discussions for changing providers to you or even from you, i suppose, on the contractual side of your business? if you could talk about that, please.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think you said ats, did you mean more b&i?
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
yeah, the prior question was focused on technical solutions. my questions focused on all the other annuity businesses for b&i or t&m, that kind of stuff?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
got you, got you. yeah, so look, there has not been a lot of activity yet. i think my remarks would stay consistent with the last couple of quarters, which is facility managers and landlords are still trying to get level set for what the new reality looks like and now, andy, with -- and you know this policy as well as i do with companies pushing back their opening dates for getting people back, you're still in this mode where you don't want to kind of commit to like bidding out your work and figuring out what the new normal looks like because you just don't know what the occupancy patterns are going to look like. and so we haven't -- we haven't seen a lot of activity on that side and even with schools, right. this is -- this is the first time that -- we would say like probably 95% of the school is k through 12 and higher ed or back in-person. so they're just for us level setting on that right now and hoping to get through the semester with in-person. so i think there hasn't been that activity. so it's still -- it's still a little early for that.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
okay, good. i just wanted to check on that. and then, i guess there is -- fundamentally in your comments there were two things that kind of stuck out is slight changes in terms of the demand for your services. one was that you actually saw occupancy trend down, obviously delta is having an effect, like if we had to point to something that would be, so occupancy kind of trending down in the quarter and then the other thing you kind of mentioned was slightly softer deep cleaning demand, i don't know. but just given that there was a slight change in both of those, so maybe you can elaborate on those.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think -- i think those, that's a good call out, andy. and i think those were all probably temporary. so occupancy trending down was really when delta hit, and it goes to what i said a couple of minutes ago, which is people -- if you remember, right, it was going to be like oh, first that people were talking about july 4th and they were talking about labor day. now there's a lot of people saying november 1st and january. so it's -- the tail is just getting longer and longer on occupancy, which as you know and goes [phonetic] to our benefit, right, because we keep that labor arbitrage, so. but that's a good tailwind for us.
and then the softening on kind of disinfecting. so i would say two things. one, clearly expected. i think we've had that narrative at least a year if not longer that it's never going to stay at these levels, and if you think about it. so if you think about work orders kind of pre-pandemic, we were in that 5% range, right. that was our tag work order revenue, and we got as high as like 10 plus percent. so now we're at like, i think it was 9.3% for the quarter. so you'll see that start kind of tailing down, but we've always projected that. and i think -- also remember this was, we had june and july in this quarter which was summer months, so even less occupancy and probably a more extreme ramping down of the disinfecting work. so i think some of it's temporary. but again, i think the stuff really -- the elongation of occupancy is good for us.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
yeah, that's a very helpful answer. my last question, earl, i guess is for you. and i just wanted to understand and interpret the guidance a little bit. i look at the quarter, you beat by, well i think $0.11 on consensus, that the midpoint goes up by by 10. it feels like the guidance change is mostly due to the third quarter's outperformance rather than some change on your view for the fourth quarter specifically. is that the right way of thinking about the guidance range because its really more about year-to-date performance than a change in your outlook for the fourth quarter?
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think that's correct, in that. when we do the guidance, we look at obviously what's happened year-to-date and how we think that's going to continue to trend into q4. and as such, based on our performance in q3, we felt comfortable raising both the top and as well as the bottom end of the guidance.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
okay, makes sense. thanks, guys. have a great day.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, andy.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of david silver with cl king. please proceed with your questions.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay, thank you very much. i'll just apologize in advance, i've had to step away and a couple of points here. my first question, scott, would be kind of to try to get your perspective on something, a couple of things you talked about maybe a couple of quarters ago and it would be related to the demand for office space as you see it, and then secondarily the appetite for property managers to embed or include elements of your enhanced disinfection routines in the basic service contracts. so i think it was a couple of quarters ago. but you had mentioned that there was an active discussion between yourselves and the property managers and i think you characterized it is ""like too early"" for many of the property managers to really decisively kind of reach conclusions about; a, the demand for office space and b, what -- what types of facility services would be used in the post-pandemic environment.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's right.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
i'm just wondering if you could just update us on your thinking in those two areas? thank you.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure, david. so look, in terms of demand for office space and how that's going to work out, if you remember, it was probably like a year ago everyone was predicting this massive flood of subleasing and people rationalizing their space, and we said we weren't seeing it. we said it was too early. and i think we also said that we believe based on our kind of our knowledge of the space that people are going to wait till tenants got back into the space, so how they were using it before they were going to make these longer-term decisions about the demand for office space. so i think that's still in play. that's still hasn't happened yet because as i said a couple of minutes ago, we haven't seen that return to office yet. so nothing new to report on the demand side. and then in terms of enhancedclean and embedding in the contracts, i think it's the same thing where people haven't gotten back yet, they haven't figured out how to rationalize their cleaning specs, how it's going to work and that's something that we suspect is going to be more of a 2022 event frankly than a '21 event.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay, great. i'd like to follow-up with maybe a question related to able services, and in particular, their technical solutions capabilities. so, and one -- this is a question about how that group will look following the completion of the acquisition. so your existing technical solutions unit certainly has a number of strengths, energy efficiency, and i think a very strong positioning in the education segment. and i'm just wondering if you could maybe compare and contrast what the able services technical solutions unit brings either in terms of spread [phonetic] the capabilities, scale in certain areas? in other words, you've talked about cross selling, but is the cross selling opportunities more of the traditional opportunities that you've been working on with your legacy technical solutions unit? or how will it broaden and extend your ability to cross sell. thank you.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, so able services doesn't have a technical solutions unit the way we have, which is -- remember our technical solutions is mostly project work, right. so we're -- we're retrofitting electrical mechanical systems, their engineering capabilities or on the stationary engineering, which are the engineers that are located on site in the building operating the equipment and we have a segment as large as theirs on that. so if you look at that, the opportunity is for our technical solutions group to cross sell into those engineering assignments and for us to bring a broader set of capabilities because they also have somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 million in janitorial assignments that we'll be able to cross sell as well. so we look as our technical solutions as a catalyst for that. but again, i'll repeat what i said earlier, which is we have not factored that in to any of the economics, that's all upside for us, all those revenue synergies which should be well received by someone like you.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, david.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of marc riddick with sidoti. please proceed with your questions.
marc riddick -- sidoti & co. -- analyst
hey, good morning.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
marc riddick -- sidoti & co. -- analyst
so i was wondering if we could start with the education segment for a moment. i was wondering if you could spend a little time delving into maybe what you've seen so far. and particularly i was somewhat curious as to the ramp-up going into school reopenings. have you seen any meaningful difference in ordering or preparation for the younger grades as opposed to college-age, particularly those that are too young to be vaccinated? i was wondering if there is any difference in what clients were asking you to do or is it somewhat similar across the board?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
generally speaking, it is somewhat across the board. i think for -- if you are a president of a college or if you're principal of the school, you're just trying to protect the kids as best you can, right. and so we don't see a real distinction between maybe doing more disinfection in k through 12 than higher ed, it's similar across the board.
marc riddick -- sidoti & co. -- analyst
okay. and then i was thinking about the sort of -- some of the commentary that you had in the press release around some of the return to normalcy. you've talked about travel. so what we've -- aviation to the side for a moment, that certainly was clear. you did talk a little bit about things like sporting events and the like. and then i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about those kinds of other leisure activities that are not necessarily travel because it does seem as though we're seeing full stadiums again with football and some level of concert activity, though that's been a little bit spotty, so i think you touch a little bit about what you're seeing there?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure, and just as a reminder, sports and entertainment, we love that segment. it's just -- it's great to be in, but it's a very small piece of our revenue, but it's been encouraging, right, because it's been almost like a binary event, whereas last quarter it was like no activity and now we're having activity again where people are getting back to events and stadiums are becoming full or hybrid full, if you will. and so it's a path to normalcy, which we really like and that's been one of our fastest growing segments, albeit it's a smaller one, but it's a fast-growing one. so we're just -- we're just pleased that it's getting back to normal.
marc riddick -- sidoti & co. -- analyst
okay, and then i wanted to also switch gears a bit and go into the sort of where you are on the branding efforts and the exercise there. i mean, it's been a little bit of time now since you started with the commercials, but also sort of just sort of putting the abm brand upfront. i was wondering if you sort of give some thoughts as to maybe what you're seeing there and then what type of commitment we should be thinking about as far as sort of keeping the abm brand in front of people and making that part of the, i guess the structure of your go-to-market strategy?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so look, it's been important to us through 2021 and we renewed our engagements with folks like cnbc, you've probably seeing our ads continue to run and we have those engagements throughout the rest of the fiscal year. it remains to be seen what we're going to do in 2022. but we will certainly address that with you when we do our guidance, but we've enjoyed the up-branding and it's just going to be a cost benefit analysis that we continue to iterate on, but definitely more color on that when we give guidance.
marc riddick -- sidoti & co. -- analyst
okay, great. and then one last thing for me. i was wondering going switching back to the hiring and what you're seeing there. is there any difference as to any regional differences as to labor availability, hiring and the like? and i was sort of thinking about the -- what we've seen in certain areas in certain states that ended the unemployment support earlier in the summer. i wasn't sure if there was much in the way of difference that you were seeing there, but just wondered if you had any commentary there as to how that -- maybe what you're seeing there and what benefits you might be getting? thanks.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think the way we think about it, marc, is really more union territories versus non-union. so in our kind of union markets we see less pressure, right, because wages a higher, there is full benefits and that mitigates a lot of the concern we have around labor. it's more on the non-union markets which tends to be at the bottom half of the country. and we're seeing some pressure there. but that's why we put our task force in place, but it's also been muted because there hasn't been the return to work and we're only beginning with return to school. so we're feeling pretty good about it and we'll see what happens as the benefits roll off now on unemployment and we'll see what happens with the the child care tax credit next year because it was elevated this year. it used to be about $2,000 per child and now it's between $3,600. so we'll see if that gets renewed and that's not taxable. so it's another incentive to not get into the workforce. so i think more to come on that story.
marc riddick -- sidoti & co. -- analyst
great. much appreciated. thank you.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. there are no further questions at this time. i'd like to hand the call back over to management for any closing comments.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, just want to tell everyone to make sure you continue to stay safe and healthy and do all the proper guidelines, that's our moment of safety for this quarter, and we look forward to giving you an update next quarter when we'll have much more to say about the able acquisition and then our full year guidance. so, thanks everyone for your support and look forward to chatting soon. thanks, everyone.

operator
greetings, and welcome to the abm industries incorporated third quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. it is now my pleasure to introduce david gold, investor and media relations. thank you, you may begin.
david gold -- investor relations
thank you for joining us this morning. with us today are scott salmirs, our president and chief executive officer; and earl ellis, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. we issued our press release yesterday afternoon announcing our third quarter fiscal 2021 financial results. a copy of this release and an accompanying slide presentation can be found on our corporate website.
before we begin, i would like to remind you that our call and presentation today contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. our use of the words estimate, expect, and similar expressions are intended to identify these statements. statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds. while we believe them to be reasonable, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. these factors are described in a slide that accompanies our presentation, as well as our filings with the sec. during the course of this call, certain non-gaap financial information will be presented. a reconciliation of historical non-gaap numbers to gaap financial measures is available at the end of the presentation and on the company's website under the investor tab.
i would now like to turn the call over to scott.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, david. good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. as detailed in yesterday's release, abm generated strong third quarter results featuring double-digit growth in revenue, continued solid cash generation, and a 20% gain in adjusted earnings per share. revenue growth was broad-based as each of our five business segments achieved year-over-year gains in revenue, aided by an improving business environment and the gradual reopening of the economy. our team members once again executed well and continue to provide exceptional service to our clients.
overall, demand for abm's higher margin virus protection services remained elevated in the quarter, underscoring ongoing client concerns regarding cleaning and disinfection of their facilities. as anticipated, demand for virus protection eased slightly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021, but remain well above pre-pandemic levels. the emergence of the delta variant and rising covid-19 cases nationally have gains heightened interest in the need for disinfection prevention measures, particularly in high traffic areas. as we look forward to 2022 and beyond, we believe that virus protection services will remain a contributor to our overall revenue as disinfection becomes a standard service protocol and facility maintenance programs.
during the third quarter, we continued to benefit from efficient management of labor as office occupancy levels remain relatively low nationwide and began to trend downward slightly as the third quarter progressed due to the spread of the delta variant. in this evolving environment, our flexible labor model enabled us to capitalize on staffing efficiencies and the associated benefit to our margins. in light of the current pause in the return to the office trend, we anticipate a more gradual ramp in office occupancy levels during 2022, providing an opportunity for a longer tailwind of rising from labor efficiencies. at the same time, we are proactively addressing current dynamics in the labor market, which include heightened competition for available talent.
as i noted in last quarter's conference call, abm has developed a task force model that leverages our substantial internal resources and cross-functional expertise to identify and implement solutions rapidly and effectively. earlier this year, we established a human resources task force with a specific focus on recruiting and retention, and this task force has been instrumental in helping us to manage our staffing needs and ensure our resources are allocated efficiently and cost effectively. as a reminder, roughly half of our revenue is generated from union labor accounts, which mitigates concerns around labor inflation and availability.
revenue growth in the third quarter was led by performance of our aviation segment, where revenues increased 51% compared to the prior year period and the segment operated profitably. our strong performance in aviation reflected a seasonal improvement in air travel as well as our strategic shift toward securing high margin and more stable service contracts with airports and related facilities. while revenue in our aviation segment remains below pre-pandemic levels, we expect to see continued growth, driven in part by new airport transportation and janitorial contracts.
our technical solutions segment continued to perform strongly, generating nearly 23% revenue growth in the third quarter as our broad capabilities address key client needs for energy efficiency, productivity and mechanical performance throughout their facilities. revenue growth benefited from improved access to client sites, enabling us to execute on a large number of projects technical solutions ended the third quarter with a record backlog level and the long-term outlook for this segment is particularly favorable given our position as a leading provider of electrical vehicle charging infrastructure. although ev charging infrastructure services currently represent a limited portion of technical solutions revenue, electrical vehicle adoption continues to rise, aided by the current administration's target to make half of all vehicle sold in 2030 zero emissions vehicles. as a result, we see a long runway of growth for our e-mobility ev charging infrastructure business as we look out over the next several years.
turning to education segment. school districts have accelerated the return to in-person learning, as we estimate that 95% plus of k-12 and higher education institutions will resume in-school classes this fall. with the reopening of schools and educational facilities, education segment revenue grew solidly from the prior year period, driven by increased demand for our services. we believe the heightened concerns amid the prevalence of the delta variant may lead to incremental opportunities for disinfecting services in the fourth quarter and into 2022. but we do expect our labor savings from hybrid environment will wane quickly with a return to full-time in-person learning this fall.
overall, our scale and market diversity and breadth of service keep us well positioned for growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. given the strength of our year-to-date performance and our positive outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our full year adjusted eps guidance to $3.45 to $3.55, up from $3.30 to $3.50 previously.
on the acquisition front, a few weeks ago we announced a definitive agreement to acquire able services in a strategic transaction that we believe will create significant value for all of our stakeholders. we're excited to join with able's talented team and we look forward to working together to better serve our clients with a broader array of services and solutions that address their evolving needs. the combination of abm and able expands our core engineering and janitorial capabilities in attractive geographies. this acquisition is expected to be accretive to adjusted eps from day one, aided by an estimated $30 million to $40 million and cost saving synergies.
as a larger company with enhanced scale, we will be better positioned to provide our clients with service offerings that will not only enhance our growth and margins, but will add significant value for our clients. we also see the potential for revenue synergies over time as we deepen our client relationships and realize cross-selling opportunities. we are progressing on the close of this acquisition, which we expect will occur by the end of september. as a reminder, we have not included any contribution from able in our updated guidance forecast.
in closing, the past nine months have been exciting, productive and successful for abm. we have executed well on our strategic growth objectives, while generating strong financial results, and we are very much looking forward to the addition of able services to abm. in the next few months, we plan to share with you our strategic plan for the next five years, which i am extremely excited about.
i'll now turn the call over to earl for a financial review of the third quarter.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, scott, and good morning, everyone. third quarter revenue was $1.54 billion, an increase of 10.7% from last year. this improvement was driven by revenue growth in each of our five business segments, reflecting an improving business environment and continued demand for our virus protection services.
on a gaap basis, the loss from continuing operations was $13.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to $56 million or $0.83 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. the gaap loss from continuing operations in this year's third quarter is attributable to a reserve of $112.9 million, equivalent to $1.24 per diluted share. the fully resolved previously announced outstanding litigation, you will find additional information related to the legal settlement in our form 10-q, which will be filed later today.
excluding the impact of reserve taken in the third quarter as well as other one-time factors including a favorable prior year self-insurance adjustment of $26.1 million, our adjusted income from continuing operations was $61.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to $50.1 million or $0.75 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year. the increase in adjusted income from continuing operations was primarily the result of strong operational performance, including growth in our higher margin services. additionally, our results benefited from several other factors, including efficient labor management, one less workday compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and lower bad debt expense.
corporate expense for the third quarter increased by $27.5 million year-over-year. the majority of this increase reflects a more normalized expense level in this year's third quarter as furloughs and other cost saving measures taken at the beginning of the pandemic reduced corporate expenses in the same period a year ago. the increase in corporate expense this quarter also reflects planned investments of approximately $9 million, as we continue to execute on our technology transformation initiative. on a year-to-date basis, we have invested $29 million in information technology and other strategic initiatives relative to our previously disclosed target of $40 million for the full fiscal 2021 year.
now turning to our segment results. revenue in our largest segment, business & industry, grew 6.7% year-over-year to $807.7 million, benefiting from increased office occupancy in the quarter as well as continued elevated demand for virus protection services. in addition, we saw improved demand for sports venues, as spectator attendance levels increased significantly from the prior year period. operating profit in this segment grew 18.2% year-over-year to $84.7 million, reflecting efficient labor management, reduced bad debt expense and ongoing client demand for higher margin virus protection services.
our technology & manufacturing segment generated revenue growth of 1.2% year-over-year to $246.1 million, and operating profit margin improved to 10.4%, up from 10.1% last year. since most of our clients in the t&m segment are considered essential service provider, this segment has been least impacted by covid-19 disruption. as a result, segment revenue grew modestly on a year-over-year basis. however, the segment operating profit margin increased 30 basis points from the prior year period, reflecting lower bad debt expense.
education revenue grew 10.5% year-over-year to $208.4 million, driven by the reopening of schools and other educational institution amid a return to in-person learning. education operating profit totaled $17.7 million, down 3.3% from the same period last year. although the return to school trend increased demand for virus protection services, the resumption of more normalized staffing levels reduced overall margins compared to the prior year, which benefited from minimal staffing requirement.
aviation revenue increased 51% in the third quarter to $175.7 million, marking the first period of year-over-year revenue growth in the aviation segment since the third quarter of fiscal 2019. revenue growth was fueled by a rebound in u.s. passenger levels amid significantly busier summer travel season compared to the same period last year, as well as our increased focus on securing more business with airport and related facilities. aviation operating profit improved to $10.3 million compared to an operating loss of $8.2 million last year. aviation segment margins continued to improve on a sequential basis, rising to 5.9% in the third quarter from 3.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. the improvement in operating margin is attributable to a favorable shift in business mix as we emphasize higher margin airport facility contracts and from stronger client demand for virus protection services compared to the prior year period.
technical solutions revenue increased 22.7% year-over-year to $146.1 million, highlighting continued strong market demand for our energy efficiency solutions as well as improved access to client sites. segment operating margin was 9.9% in the third quarter compared to 11.1% in last year's third quarter, reflecting a higher personnel costs compared to last year's third quarter, which benefited from pandemic-related cost saving actions.
i'll now discuss our cash and liquidity. we ended the third quarter with $505.4 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $394.2 million at the end of fiscal 2020, with total debt of $811.6 million as of july 31, 2021. our total debt to pro forma adjusted ebitda, including standby letters of credit was 1.4 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2021. in june, we announced an expansion of our credit agreement to $1.95 billion. the benefits of this revised and expanded credit facility include enhanced financial flexibility as well as increased liquidity to fund strategic growth initiatives. additionally, the revised agreement has more favorable credit term on both the revolving credit facility and the term loan.
as you know, we recently announced the pending acquisition of able services for $830 million, which we plan to pay using a mix of cash on hand and borrowings from our credit facility. following the close, we expect to have very manageable bank leverage ratio of approximately 3 times. supported by strong cash flow of the combined company, we intend to reduce this leverage ratio in a timely manner.
third quarter operating cash flow from continuing operations was $87.6 million compared to $130.9 million in the third quarter of last year. the decrease in cash flow from continuing operations during the third quarter was primarily due to a deferral in payroll taxes last year under the cares act. for the nine-month period ending july 31, 2021, operating cash flow from continuing operations totaled $258.8 million, unchanged from the same period last year. free cash flow from continuing operations was $79.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, down from $121.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. the decrease in free cash flow reflected the cares act payroll tax deferral i mentioned.
during the third quarter, we were pleased to pay our 221st consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.19 per common share, returning an additional $12.8 million to our shareholders. our board also declared our 222nd consecutive quarterly dividend, which will be payable november 1, 2021 to shareholders of record on october 7, 2021.
now, i'll discuss our outlook. as scott mentioned, our increased guidance for full year fiscal 2021 adjusted income from continuing operations is now a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per diluted share, compared to $3.30 to $3.50 per diluted share previously. the increase in our adjusted earnings forecast is due to our strong financial performance over the first nine months of fiscal 2021, as well as our favorable outlook for the fourth quarter of the year. please note that this guidance excludes any impact from our pending acquisition of able services.
at this time, we are not providing guidance for full year 2021 gaap income from continuing operations since we are unable to provide an accurate estimate and timing of the items impacting comparability relating to the able services acquisition, such as acquisition-related contingency advisory fees and integration costs. we continue to expect a 30% tax rate for fiscal 2021 excluding discrete items such as the work opportunity tax credits and the tax impact of stock-based compensation awards.
operator, we are now ready for questions.

paul goldberg -- senior vice president, investor relations
welcome back. we will now begin the q&a portion of our investor day. this is paul goldberg again and i will serve as moderator. [operator instructions]
and with that, our first question of the day comes from tim mulrooney of william blair.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
good morning. can you guys hear me ok.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
perfect, tim.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
all right, thanks. really appreciate all the color that you guys gave today, it was very helpful. i was wondering if you could dive in a little bit more on your enhancedclean services. it wasn't discussed a lot today. but what's built in your guidance basically for 2022 relative to how much revenue that you've made in 2020 and 2021? i know it's coming down, but at the same time more and more contracts i think our integrating this. would love to hear your thoughts on that.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. so look, it's still remains vital for us, tim, and it will be moderating and coming down. we signaled that probably for well over a year as things return to normal, but we have said that we're going to be retaining 50 basis to 70 basis points of covid benefit in our numbers in 2022. so it's still there. it's just not going to be at the crazy record levels that we saw in 2020 and '21, but it's still baked into our numbers.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thanks, scott. and i don't know who this should be directed to. but this is for anyone, but would love to hear a little bit more detail about your plans to improve customer retention over the next several years. i thought it was interesting that you're talking about building back to those rates of 92% to 94%, that really caught my hearing. would love to hear more about that.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'm going to -- i'm going to pass over to rene, but i will tell you it's a major element in our elevate program and i think we're going to. well, i'll let rene handle it, he is best to answer that.
rene jacobsen -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
well, i mean we -- we've certainly been doing well, i would say overall if you look at the industry average. but we definitely want to improve dramatically here and strategic account management is the way to go for us and we've been -- we've been working on this for roughly the last 12 months. very, very detailed, very focused from the standpoint of looking at our clients, not only from the standpoint of individual ig related, but also looking at how we can basically cross sell into these clients in a bigger way than we're doing today and we've really built a great team in the last year that really works together as a tremendous unit and therefore for us it's all about focus, right? it's all about looking at focus as a key word, everybody knows at abm. so that's the key for us. so clearly we're improving the program in a big way.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we, for us it's so important to have a team approach and what we're doing around the strategic account management stand up, its a raise point is going to be game changer for us because it's all going to be about finding solutions and remaining stickier.
rene jacobsen -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
hey, scott, if i could ask -- if i could add one thing.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
josh feinberg -- executive vice president and chief strategy and transformation officer
part of the elevate program is focusing on -- specifically focusing on initiatives that drive client retention, to the question. client facing technology is a great example of that. you saw that in the video and some of the remarks that were made, that is very deliberate, bringing -- some clients have been asking for that as rene will and the operators will share for years and i think now we're finally delivering on it and it's going to be a real game changer, providing a stickier solution that we have as we provide the client with the data that they need.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
that's a great point, josh.
paul goldberg -- senior vice president, investor relations
thank you, tim. our next question today comes from andy wittmann of rw baird.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
yeah. great. can you guys hear me ok.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
go ahead, andy. good morning.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
okay, great. just wanted to make sure, we've had some technical difficulties this morning. i just wanted to take into the margin that you guys are forecasting here. i heard it two different ways on the conference call. i heard that you're targeting a 7% margin in the out-year at the end of the time planning period here. we also heard that you going to plan on picking up, i think you said 50 -- or keeping 50 basis points to 70 basis points of the margin improvement that you saw during covid. so, i guess i just wanted to reconcile what the 50 basis points to 70 basis points is based off of? i think as i think back pre covid, you guys were kind of guiding adjusted ebitda margins in the low 5s, which would get me something in the high 5s or maybe 6% versus the 7%. so maybe earl or scott maybe that one's for you. but could you just clarify kind of the discrepancy there and maybe some of the cadence that you see that on?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure, and i wouldn't say it's really necessarily a discrepancy. what i would say is, i think you outlined it right. pre covid, we were at 5.2%. so you tack on to that 50 basis points to 70 basis points just from covid and then you land somewhere under 6% as kind of the new normal and then you take all the investments in elevate and everything we're doing and you add another 100 plus basis points and that gets you to the 7% over the elevate period. does that makes sense.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
okay, that's, yeah totally makes sense. that's clear. thank you. and then maybe just -- so the revenue cagr here is 10% mid-single digit organic, you get about the same amount from m&a. i guess you've already kind of landed half of that $2 billion with able or a little bit more than half, so you have to find $1 billion of revenue to hit these targets. but i guess with these margin goals that you have outlined and maybe i missed it, but what's the eps cagr attached to that revenue plan?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
earl, you want to try and take that all.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. yeah, so if you look at what we're going to be driving over the next five years and if you look at what elevate is driving for, it's about $110 million to $130 million of ebitda. so really going from eps starting with this year at 355, over the next four years to five years we're looking at probably roughly, i would say approximately a 40% ish increase over that period of time.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
got it, ok. if you will, for me, one more. i'll just cleanup of this final question. scott, over the years we've heard you talk about investments in technology. certainly, i think we've heard about different payroll time keeping systems and all these things. they all seem to have a new iteration with the elevate plan, so i don't know if there's a concrete way to answer this or even to ask it. but can you talk about maybe summarize what you've done so far because some of these initiatives have had investments already, so i'm trying to get a sense of how much different the next wave of investments are? if that makes sense.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, thanks for that, andy. what i'll do is, why don't i let josh kick that off and i'm sure he'll have melanie, have part of that answer as well. but josh, do you want to take that?
josh feinberg -- executive vice president and chief strategy and transformation officer
yeah, i'm happy to, scott. so if you think about some of the investments in the past and that predated us a bit -- a couple of us a bit, that was focused mainly on getting the erp and some of the core financial systems up -- up and running, then covid hit and we really paused a lot of that. so, the investment now is going to expand on that and continue to do some of those fundamentals. and i think the biggest thing is, expanding to all of those order systems and modernizing workforce management, modernizing the client-facing technology, really trying to make sure that we're at the leading edge. and we are really leading the industry in bringing technology to our teams into our clients. so that's the fundamental difference. we kind of stopped after a short start and now we're expanding it.
but i don't know, melanie, if there's anything else that you want to add.
melanie kirkwood ruiz -- chief information officer
sure. i mean, like you said, staying on a leading edge is extremely important. and as you know, technology continues to change. so, we continue to move to more cloud computing platforms that allows us to have the updates and upgrades and stay ahead of technology. and i think that's extremely important to continue.
paul goldberg -- senior vice president, investor relations
thank you, andy. our next question today comes from tate sullivan of maxim.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
hi. thank you, all. hi, thank you for having me then.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
first, on ev charging, if i can start there, you've mentioned some details with your parking customers is what you can bring in terms of electric vehicle charging solutions, starting mostly with parking and then moving to other technical solutions customers or is it broad-based across your customers right now?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean -- i'll let rene give you a little background on that. but i can tell you, we are super excited about ev charging. and it's not just the ev charging stations, it's infrastructure as well. this year, we did somewhere around $50 million in revenue. we can see that doubling next year and then who knows from there. and we've seen some catalysts like rene with the infrastructure bill as well or it started getting our folks excited, right.
rene jacobsen -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah. i mean, in answering your question specifically, i mean, we are seeing really the electrical vehicle service lines really introduced within the ats side primarily. but we're starting to really shift into the aviation space. we mentioned earlier, the project that we have at lava lx [phonetic], and that's a great example of how we're able to cross-sell between several groups, as i alluded to earlier. so we're really seeing great cooperation between ats and aviation specifically. so, we're looking at that as kind of the basis and the foundation to be able to look at how we can broaden that out to the other igs as well. we see great opportunity within b&i specifically relative to ev charging as well. so that's kind of the game plan.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
okay, thank you. and would you -- can you quantify now or willing to? i know it's growing from probably a small base. is it still less than 1% of earnings, 5% or -- i mean, what kind of growth relative to -- are you willing to give any context around the size?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. either way, i would answer that. it's small now, it's emerging, but huge, huge potential. i think, if memory recalls, the infrastructure bill has $7.5 billion targeted to ev charging in many forms. and our pipeline is as big as it's ever been.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
thank you. and a separate question. with where you've come in the last two years and it sounds doing more work with amazon, google, fedex, ups and now following able acquisition, do you have larger customer concentration? do you have less -- is customer concentration a good thing with those types of companies? or how do you look at it strategically, scott?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, look, i think it's important to have customer concentration because it's focus and this is something that rene always talks about, the more we focus the better we do, and we can build teams around those customers. we've had accelerated growth with some of the big names that we've mentioned because we're able to invest in those relationships and build solutions. so we'll continue to do that. but i would also say, we are going to be building business development teams in our new m&d segment to broaden the horizon and grow because there are so many e-commerce and logistic companies that are emerging now and we want to capture them in early stage. so, it's a combination of both.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
thank you. and last from me, a quick [indecipherable]. scott, you've mentioned, with the fiscal year '25, i think it was related to fiscal year '25 cagr. what was that referring to specifically?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think it was up a little bit, but i think you said referring to the cagr of 10% on growth?
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
yes.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, it's a combination of organic, which we said was mid single-digit and also acquisitions. and we're on our way, right, with able, a $1 billion right in our core highly synergistic that's going to open up geographies for us. the ability to cross-sell is going to be phenomenal. and we've been talking about ifs, which is integrated facility solutions. and what really that means is controlling the facility spend for clients, able is going to be a great enabler for that. so, for us, it just shows how important it is to have m&a growth and to build and create scale. so, i think, it's a combination of that mid single-digit organic growth and then acquisitions will get us to that 10% cagr.
tate sullivan -- maxim group -- analyst
thank you, all.
paul goldberg -- senior vice president, investor relations
thanks, tate. your next question today comes from sean eastman of keybanc.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. just going back to andy's question on the margins, i just wanted to make sure i understand the cadence correctly. so, we're coming down 100 basis points in fiscal '22, that's sort of post-covid normalization. and then, we're marching up 20 basis points annually from there. in other words, there is going to be no step down in margins in '23. is that correct?
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that's absolutely correct. so if you think about where we're starting the year, this year fy '21, it's the 7% margins. and then, going into next year, if you look at our range of 6.2% to 6.6%, the midrange being 6.4%, we're down about 90 basis points. the majority of that decline is really driven by the retrenching, if you will, of the covid benefits. so, if you think about it, we now actually have a new ground floor for ebitda margins, which is in the 6%-ish rate, which now allows us to elevate. so, to answer your question directly, we do not see a step down going into fy '23, but yet a 20-basis-point increase year-over-year starting in fy '23.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and you know what i would add to that what i think is so exciting. if you think pre-covid, when we were in that 5% margin range, we set out an aspirational range of 5.5% to 6%, which everyone was pretty excited about. and if i give context back to 3.8% in 2015 was astronomical in and of itself. and now, to say that the floor is above what our aspirational target was back in 2018-2019, it gets this team pretty energized to think that we're on a path toward 7% and with the possibility of going beyond that.
and the other thing i would say, sean, is that if you think back to 2020 vision and we were at 3.8% and we outlined a 100 basis points in growth, i think there were some that were skeptical because we had 15 years of stagnation on margin. we ended up at 140 basis points, not 100. so, we are going into elevate and outlining approximately 100 basis points. i think you're going to have to give us a couple of years. we're going to see how things unfold. but there is no reason to believe at this point that 7% is an ultimate cap for the firm. it's just -- it's what we have really strong line of sight to right now.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's great context. it seems like the market is telling you that maybe the target doesn't look achievable. and it seems like maybe the biggest concern from the investment community is the labor constraints and whether you see some additional margin drag as it becomes difficult to restaff. i think we saw that in the education segment this quarter. so, maybe we can just get a little more color on some of the changes around the flexible labor model, just how confident you are in those targets to the extent the labor market doesn't really loosen up that much over the next year or two?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure. and i'll give you my explanation. i'm going to pass it to raul, who is going to tell you about what we're doing. but i think, let's get some context, right, 50% our labor spend is with unionized labor where they have clear outlined collective bargaining agreements. so we know what those labor rate increases are. and you're starting from a baseline where wages are generally accelerated compared to market and they're getting benefits. so we don't see a lot of turnover. and it's not as hard for us to get unionized labor. so that's half of it, right.
and then the other half is the non-union labor, which is definitely more challenging. but on the other hand, this is something we're really good at, right. and if you think back to 2018 and 2019, i mean i don't think a day went by where the headline wasn't talking about labor challenge, historic labor shortages. so we've been through this before, but we're not resting on our laurels, right. part of elevate and part of the investments we're making is to be able to do rapid recruiting. and raul, why don't you give us some insight on the things that you're working on.
raul valentin -- executive vice president and chief human resources officer
sure. thank you, scott. certainly, it's been a challenging labor market. and as scott said, we've really been leaning into what we call rapid recruiting program, which has a couple of key tenants. so one is kind of an outreach into the local communities, churches, community centers and other direct reaches to get candidates. the other is a very aggressive campaign and approach for driving social media and really reaching to different pockets in our communities and talent pools that we can draw from. then in other situations, we're looking in key markets where we might establish brick and mortar, hiring centers, right, in key urban centers. our distributed workforce means there isn't a silver bullet, but i feel really good about the work the team is doing. we've got a dedicated talent acquisition team that's really driving that forward. and at the same time, we're looking at retention initiatives, making sure our wages are competitive, as scott said, in other things like driving training, development and career pathing for our team members to drive that retention so that both sides of that equation is being addressed.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
and rene, i mean, i think you need to give your take on this right, especially on on the customer side, right.
rene jacobsen -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah, i mean, we've become very, very disciplined and regimented around escalations and as scott mentioned, half the business is, i wouldn't say automatic, but it definitely is on the union side an easier process of passing on escalations for clients. it's on the non-union side, certainly that we -- that we see improvement year-over-year and we're really focused on looking at each client on its own. we obviously have to consider the impact this has relative to retention as well. so there is always these trade-offs that we go about looking at each individual client. but you know, we have been quite good at getting escalations to clients and really for us it's something that we have -- we are very bold about. it's something that we have to be very bold about and we are relative to escalations as such.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, and what i would add is, rene is being very humble about this. he is a task masker with our team, right. it's all again about his level of focus and driving those customer increases and we just have this feeling like we're adding value. and when you are adding value and you're doing a good job, you should not be afraid to ask for an increase, especially in this labor market. and rene has done more than a phenomenal job of capturing those costs. so really enthusiastic about the result we'll get in '22.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. i appreciate the detailed responses, guys. i'm going to turn it over there.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
great.
paul goldberg -- senior vice president, investor relations
thank you. our next call today comes from david silver from cl king.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, david.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
good morning. am i coming through ok.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yes, fine.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
very good. okay, first i'll just make a comment. i really benefited from the contributions made by the other members of the team that we don't normally hear from. so i thought that was an excellent addition to this presentation.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
i'm going to start maybe with scott's comment, right near the end where you said ""covid"" is here to stay in one form or another. and i think in a lot of the assumptions underlying the presentations i heard today, there is the expectation that the quantity of the high margin tag work or outside the core contract services were going to moderate as we enter the post pandemic period. and i'm just wondering, but my assumption is that the standard, let's say cleaning contract is going to have to change as well and i think scott the term you used in the past was embedded, right? so underlying your thinking about how your book of business is going to evolve over the next few years, what are your expectations for that standard cleaning contracts or standard technical services contract? how much of the enhanced sanitation in disinfection work that you're now doing outside the standard contract is going to become embedded in maybe a newer evolving contract?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
that's great. so, i think the way you got to think about this david is like cleaner, safer, healthier buildings are here to stay. we see survey upon survey of employees who were talking about the fact that the only way they're willing to come back to work is to have proof by their companies or their landlords that they're going to be in safe healthy spaces and we've put a stake in the ground and it's what you've always asked for, how much of the covid benefit do you believe you're going to retain and we said 50 basis points to 70 basis points. so we do think a lot of the work orders that we're getting will be embedded into the contracts. but that doesn't mean that there is going to be significant margin deterioration because you have to remember, to do the disinfecting, to do the cleaning that we have to do to combat covid, more expensive equipment, more expensive ppe, more training, higher value, it gets baked in, but it's going to get baked in at a higher margin rate. so we still believe we're going to keep 50 basis to 70 basis points and it will be the new normal. think about with omicron, that's just three or four weeks old in the narrative, how everything is changing already. so there's just no question that safety is going to be paramount.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay, thank you for that. and my next question and i apologize, i'll try to not be so wordy, but i'll probably fail. i mean, it has to do with the it development. so in your 2020 program, scott, there was some spending there. but i would say it was more catch up spending, in other words improving your backlog as to where industry standards were. whereas when i hear a number of the speakers today, the digital transformation is much more moving into the leading edge and becoming a tool to develop revenue streams. so, couple of things. but basically this is a new kind of level of it spend and a new target goal for your it program and i'm painting with an unfair brush. over the last 20 years i've had a number of companies who put in sap [phonetic] type systems and they always tend to take too much time, you miss timelines, cost too much, and it usually causes the ceo and the cfo's hair to fallout [speech overlap] but in all seriousness, how confident or what, as opposed to what you're trying to do were accomplished with the it spend, what are the -- what are the controls, what are the stage gate, the valuations that are going to keep that core strategic it spend and productivity on target?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a good question. so first, i would say it starts with having unbelievable leaders leading that program, ones that have done it already, have the playbook and i'm going to pass it off to josh and melanie. maybe josh you start. but like, i'm going to pass it off to someone who in his career has been involved with many of these and he is going to pass it off to someone who has been involved in many, many of these as well and you may want to talk about the stage gate process a little bit and what that really means because that sounds like maybe jargon [phonetic] so josh, why don't you start off.
josh feinberg -- executive vice president and chief strategy and transformation officer
thanks, scott. yeah, so the governance of our it implementation and the elevate program holistically really has three components to it. the first one is accountability. so every initiative, every piece of the it implementation, every element has a single management team owner who is also responsible for the delivery. so that -- number one, puts accountability in a singular place. two, and what scott was referencing is the stage gate process. no matter what the initiative is, what the it piece is, it has to go through the stage gate process. and i'll quickly talk talk about it a bit and then i'll pass it to melanie.
the first one is a business case. there has to be a clear business case for any element of the it implementation, including in roi, including the metrics that you want to track. that's number one. if you pass that, then you get the design. okay, well, what's the design and what is that -- what does that kind of look like and are we comfortable that that has a potential to create the value that we said in the business case. and then third is, let's test it. let's actually go ahead and test it and see whether not its working, prove some value and only then do we scale it. but at each of those four stages it has to pass a governance process. where if it doesn't pass, it's out, where we stop and pause and fix it and you get funding along the way. so we feel really, really good about that, that we have it under control. and again, it's not like you're writing a blank check from the beginning and handing it off to someone and see them in a year. it's very incremental and it's very controlled in that manner. so i may have stolen out melanie's thunder, but i'll pass it to her.
melanie kirkwood ruiz -- chief information officer
great, thank you, josh. so, think about it. we have a -- we're going with the phased implementation plan. and the point of that is so that we can mitigate the risk that you're alluding to. and with faa's implementation plan comes a very detailed roadmap and what we're doing is we're going to have a robust internal tracking system and program management capability that keeps that accountability. it also tracks our success against those milestones that we have planned. so it keeps us on target.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. thank you very much. appreciate it.
paul goldberg -- senior vice president, investor relations
thank you, david. and next question comes from marc riddick of sidoti.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, marc.
marc riddick -- sidoti -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
marc riddick -- sidoti -- analyst
so, first of all, thank you everybody for the part of the presentation. it's very helpful and it's good to hear from everyone. we don't always hear from. so it's certainly beneficial. i wanted to talk a little bit about maybe continuing on the thread a bit. the digital transformation process, i was wondering if you talk a little bit about sort of how you developed that plan, is that something that you did extensively internally? was that something you've been working with outside partners for? and how should we think about how that plan gets maintained throughout? and then i have a couple of little simpler follow-ups.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so why don't i get started on that. then i'll pass back again to my right. but i would say, a lot of our plan -- and josh alluded to it a little earlier about how covid happened and we paused, what do we all see in covid, right. we saw that we need to figure out how to work in a remote environment, how to communicate in a remote environment. so, so much of what we're doing with the digitization is about communicating with customers digitally, the client-facing technology that we spoke about. how do you get your clients information in a remote format? how do you work -- and josh definitely should touch on workforce management. how do you work with your team members in a remote environment? and so, it started with the societal trends that josh talked about in his prepared remarks.
but with that, let me kick it over to josh.
josh feinberg -- executive vice president and chief strategy and transformation officer
yeah. thanks, scott. and i think it's important just to answer the question very directly, how did it come about? how did digitization come about? the whole elevate program came about with four inputs. and it was really from listening and analyzing the market trends, digitization and mobility is one that was screaming out at us what the client needs are and how we're going to satisfy those -- the team member needs and then the economics across it all. so what that generated then was this focus on client experience, team member experience and then powering both of those with data and analytics. that's where the digitization comes in.
a core tenant of elevate from that third pillar is to make digitization a competitive advantage. that's number one. number two is, it's happening today. you see it today, it's just not happening on scale. we have the opportunity to make it happen on scale because of our footprint. we have the largest footprint in buildings across the us and we have the opportunity to do this at scale. number three is, there is an infinite amount of data that we can collect from buildings. they come in from the equipment. it comes in from the people that are in the buildings, from the team members, from the clients, etc, there is an infinite amount of data that can be done. and then, to scott's point, it's where do you use that data. so how do you use that data for workforce management in particularly to make sure that our people are operating most efficiently and effectively with the information that's being provided to make sure our clients have what they need to manage the building.
so, we're very specifically focused on creating value, whether it be in the p&l or in more leading metrics like client retention that's going to start to generate some more other growth. but if that's where the digitization comes in and we really feel like this is the core tenant to support the team member experience and the client experience and create that competitive advantage.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
one of the things that i really like to talk about that excites me and i think would resonate with you is understanding the fact that our frontline workers won't be mobily enabled. and so, here's here's the picture i want to pay for you. our workers on mobily enabled, we have sensors in a building and a cleaner is walking by a conference from and sees on their mobile device that conference room wasn't used today, you can pass by, right. whereas normally they wouldn't know that and they spend 10 minutes cleaning the conference room.
so what that does is, first, it makes us more efficient and ultimately save on labor costs because they'll be able to do more; and two, this enriches our clients with data because all of a sudden they start learning about their facilities and start asking questions. why is that conference room not being used as much? oh, it's a 10-person conference room. it seems like the four-person conference rooms are being used more. so that's -- this is a simple way for you to understand about how we can provide such value for our clients by putting systems like this in place and think about how sticky we get with our clients if we're providing this rich data. it's going to be brilliant. we're very excited about it.
marc riddick -- sidoti -- analyst
great. and so, there is a bunch of different directions i could go in, but i'll be a little more specific on this part. i think it is part of the prepared remarks, there was a commentary around building development teams -- business development team within the manufacturing and distribution area. and i was wondering if there -- if you could give a little commentary on that as well as if there are other areas that are targeted or prioritized for hiring both maybe above company average? thanks.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
sure. when it comes to manufacturing and distribution, i'll pass it off to rene. but one of the elements of elevate is hyper targeting and how we're going to focus on where to grow and how to grow and adding business development folks. but maybe you want to talk a little about m&d, because i know you're super excited about that industry group.
rene jacobsen -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah. i mean, as i alluded to earlier today, i mean, there is a 1 billion square feet of space coming on to meet the needs of the clients within the retail distribution side. so there is the huge market coming and we wanted to kind of take advantage of refocusing our attention to retail distribution. and that was really the premise for changing from a t&m perspective to m&d with the anchor around retail distribution. and with the high growth clients we already have, amazon, ups, walmart, etc, there is tremendous opportunity still to be had within that space. and really for us, you hear the word all the time, it's about focus. we know focus creates results here. so, it's a key one for us to really tap into. and what we also did was, we just -- we're building the m&d business around the big clients. we're looking at only big clients to be serviced through that and we're using the branch network system within b&i to capture the small to medium size. and there's efficiencies there as well.
so, the m&d story for us as we grow the business through the end of elevate, this will be, apart from ats, we expect this to be a high growth ig, probably the highest aside from ats.
paul goldberg -- senior vice president, investor relations
great. thank you, marc. and today's last question comes via the platform and it was typed in. and the question is, has anything changed with regard to abm's capital allocation strategy and the way you think about dividends and share repurchases?
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'll take that one. and thanks for the question. so, the good news is, our capital allocation strategy remains the same and is really hinged on investing in organic growth. and if you look at elevate, that's a great example of us, being able to allocate capital in a way that drives not only top-line growth, but also bottom line profitability. at the same time, we've talked about elevate also including m&a opportunities. so we will continue to look at opportunities to acquire value assets that will contribute to our long-term growth opportunities and at the same time embellish our profitability.
when we look at the opportunities to allocate capital back to our investors, we just announced a 2.6% increase in our dividend. and so, we will continue to fund our long-standing dividend program. and as you know, we currently have board authorization for about $145 million of share buybacks. share buybacks has been something we've done in the past and will continue to be part of our playbook. so that's a tool that we will continue to look at on a month-to-month basis. so, the good news is that with our strong cash flow and relatively low leverage, it gives us a lot of flexibility

with me today are scott salmirs, our president and chief executive officer; earl ellis, our executive vice president and chief financial officer; as well as other members of our executive leadership team, whom you will meet later during the investor day portion of today's program. we are all very pleased you have joined us this morning.
please note that earlier this morning, we issued our press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2021 financial results as well as details about the elevated initiatives we are undertaking. a copy of this release and an accompanying slide presentation can be found on our website abm.com.
regarding today's program, we will first review our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021 financial and operating results. after that, we will take a short break, we will then begin the investor day portion of the program where we will provide an update on our strategic positioning, discuss our newly announced elevate initiative and provide a multi-year outlook. after that, we will host a q&a session. instructions on how to submit a question will be provided at the end of our prepared remarks.
before we begin, i would like to remind you that our webcast and presentation today contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. our use of the words estimate, expect, and similar expressions are intended to identify these statements. these statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds. while we believe them to be reasonable, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. these factors are described in the slide that accompanies our presentation, as well as our filings with the sec. during the course of this call, certain non-gaap financial information will be presented. a reconciliation of historical non-gaap numbers to gaap financial measures is available at the end of the presentation on the company's website under the investor tab.
and with that, i would like to now turn the webcast over to scott.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, paul. good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results. following our comments, we are hosting a virtual investor day, where we will provide a long-range strategic update and financial outlook, including a comprehensive discussion of our elevate investment initiative. i hope everyone can join us for that part of the webcast and we look forward to speaking with you and answering your questions.
fiscal 2021 was an exceptional year for abm, highlighted by continued strong financial performance and the acquisition of able services, a key transaction that substantially expanded our geographic footprint and broadened our capabilities. throughout the year, our global team continued to execute at the highest level, successfully navigating a dynamic environment with agility, resiliency and dedication to serve our clients. fourth quarter revenue grew over 14% to $1.7 billion and adjusted eps increased 23%, representing a great finish to our fiscal 2021 year, where revenue of $6.2 billion was accompanied by an adjusted earnings per share increase of 47% to $3.58.
our strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by one month of contribution from able, as well as organic growth in our b&i, aviation and technical solutions verticals, which more than offset a modest decline in our education segment. i'm pleased with the progress we've made in enhancing our overall profitability as full year adjusted ebitda margins reached a record 7.3% and fourth quarter adjusted ebitda margins increased 40 basis points from prior year. throughout the year, we continued to experience demand for disinfection and virus protection services as clients prioritized our enhancedclean protocols to maintain hygiene in high traffic spaces. in addition, we continued to manage our labor cost efficiently as office occupancy trends increased gradually through the year.
as anticipated, overall demand for our higher margin work orders and enhancedclean services eased as the year progressed, yet we maintained elevated in the fourth quarter compared to pre-pandemic levels. going forward, we expect that ongoing concerns around covid-19 variance will lead to incremental opportunities for our disinfection services, providing support for our adjusted ebitda margins exceeding 6% in fiscal 2022 per our guidance.
turning to our segment performance. fourth quarter revenue growth was led by a continued rebound in aviation. this industry group, which was most impacted by the pandemic, generated 43% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter as air travel trends improved markedly over the prior year and we capitalized on new business opportunities, including the expansion of our parking operations at airports. our fourth quarter was also benefited from 21% growth in technical solutions revenue, reflecting growth in our emerging e-mobility business and improved access to client-site. technical solutions backlog increased by 20% sequentially compared to the third quarter and reached a record level in the fourth quarter, driven by the transition to electric vehicles and the associated need for charging stations, our e-mobility business has significant long-term growth potential. key growth drivers for this business include federal stimulus funds designated for energy efficient projects as well as the recent passage of the federal infrastructure bill that included $7.5 billion toward deploying ev charging stations nationwide.
our b&i segment continued to perform well as revenue grew at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter, benefiting from the addition of able, new contract wins and continued client demand for work orders. while office occupancy trended higher over the past year, office occupancy levels remained low by historical standards, which should lead to a continued tailwind from labor efficiencies perspective in this segment during the first half of fiscal 2022 and possibly longer.
turning to education. fourth quarter revenue and margins declined compared to the prior year. earlier this year, we communicated that the return of students to school on a full-time basis with diminished education segment labor efficiency, as increased staffing would be required to accommodate educational institutions reopenings in the fall. this [indecipherable] we expected, though the unusual rapid staffing ramp combined with the state of the labor markets resulted in higher labor costs, dampening segment margins in the quarter. with this staffing increase now behind us, we believe education segment profitability will return to more normalized levels starting in the first quarter.
i'd now like to provide some color on elevate, our transformational investment initiatives that we will discuss in detail during our virtual investor day event following this call. five years ago, we announced 2020 vision, a long-range strategic plan to drive profitable growth and shareholder value. today, we are building on the success of that initiative with elevate, a multi-year comprehensive investment initiatives that will enhance our strategic and competitive positioning, leverage the advantages of leading-edge technologies, inclusive of data and analytics and enable us to capture incremental growth and profit opportunities arising from macro shifts in demographics, rapidly changing workplace dynamics and the heightened need for increased corporate sustainability. elevate will include strategic investments in revenue growth initiatives, team member development, workforce management and digital transformation. these investments will accelerate our organic growth, strengthen profitability and create a more rewarding experience for both clients and team members. the total elevate investment is estimated to be $150 million to $175 million and the initiatives is expected to be largely completed by the end of fiscal 2025. in fiscal '22, we expect to invest approximately $80 million in elevate, enabling us to significantly advance the implementation of our digital transformation.
with these foundational elements in place, by the end of fiscal 2022, we anticipate lower levels of elevate investments in subsequent years. we are excited about the opportunities that elevate will provide and we'll share more detail with you on this whole initiatives in a few minutes on the investor day portion of the program.
we are entering fiscal 2022 from a position of strength, supported by a healthy balance sheet, solid cash flow and favorable growth trends across our businesses. we continue to support our clients by providing high value services and solutions that have enabled them to navigate unprecedented challenges over the past couple of years and with the recent acquisition of able, we significantly expanded our capabilities to comprehensively address our clients' evolving needs across the spectrum of facilities management and engineering solutions.
now i'd like to comment briefly on our guidance. for fiscal 2022, we forecast gaap earnings per diluted share of $2.05 to $2.30 and adjusted eps of $3.30 to $3.55. within this guidance, we assume an easing of covid related disinfection services and work orders, leading us to project fiscal '22 adjusted ebitda margins of 6.2% to 6.6%, inclusive of synergies from able services acquisition. while eps and margins are projected to decline from fiscal 2021, they are significantly above pre-pandemic levels and above our targeted long-term metrics we outlined in 2019 when we signaled an aspirational margin range of 5.5% to 6%. we'll provide more detail on our outlook and fiscal 2022 guidance later during our virtual investor day portion of the program.
i'll now turn over the call to earl for a discussion of our financials.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, scott, and good morning, everyone. fourth quarter revenue increased 14.2% to $1.7 billion, primarily driven by one month of contribution from the acquisition able services, continued client demand for disinfection services and a generally improving economic environment. gaap income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $34.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $53.1 million or $0.78 per diluted share in the same period last year. the decrease in gaap income reflects higher operating and corporate expenses, which included acquisition related costs of $19.7 million, initial investments in our elevate initiative and a lower benefit from self-insurance adjustments related to prior years.
on an adjusted basis, fourth quarter income from continuing operations grew 25% to $58.2 million or $0.85 per diluted share compared to $46.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year. the increase in adjusted eps reflects revenue growth and a benefit from the absence of a reserve for notes receivable related to a single project within the company's technical solutions segment recorded last year, partially offset by reduced labor efficiencies and disinfection work.
corporate expenses were $40.9 million higher compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, due to acquisition-related expenses, a lower benefit from prior year self-insurance adjustments and costs related to hiring initiatives. corporate expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were also impacted by $10.3 million of initial investments in the elevate transformation initiative that scott mentioned, and that we will discuss more fully later on.
now turning to our segment results in the fourth quarter. b&i revenue increased 17.5% year-over-year to $933 million, driven primarily by a one-month contribution from able services, increased office occupancy and the expansion of key accounts. excluding the contribution from able, b&i revenue increased 4.7% from the prior period. operating profit in b&i declined 3% to $82.1 million from the same period last year, reflecting an easing in higher margin work orders.
aviation revenue increased 43% to $201.7 million, marking the second consecutive quarter of robust year-over-year revenue growth. this improvement was driven largely by increased airline passenger volume and the expansion of our airport parking operations. aviation operating profit increased to $13.2 million, compared to $3.5 million in last year's fourth quarter, driven by the significant rebound in revenue as well as our efforts to emphasize higher margin airport facility services.
revenue within our technology & manufacturing segment was essentially flat year-over-year at $245.5 million, as new business starts were offset by reduced client demand for covid related work orders and enhancedclean. however, operating margins for t&m improved to 10% in the fourth quarter, up 40 basis points from last year's fourth quarter benefiting from efficient labor management and contract expansions.
education revenue declined 3.7% to $204.4 million, largely reflecting the timing of contract rebids. while client retention rates remain consistent on a year-over-year basis, certain contract rebids were not completed in the fourth quarter, impacting segment revenue. operating profit totaled $7.7 million, down from $15.1 million in last year's fourth quarter. the decline in segment operating profit was in part due to normal seasonality. however, the magnitude of the decline this year was amplified by the widespread reopening of educational institutions that necessitated a near instantaneous ramp-up of staff, as scott has discussed. moving forward, we anticipate education segment profit margins will be approximately 6% in fiscal 2022, representing an increase of more than 100 basis points compared to pre-covid levels, resulting from a sustained uplift in labor efficiency and higher disinfection revenue.
revenue within our technical solutions segment grew 21% to [technical issues] million, aided by continued strong growth in our emerging electric vehicle charging infrastructure business, improved access to client sites and strengthened client demand for energy efficient solutions. segment operating income returned to profitability and generated an operating profit margin of 12.8%.
we ended the fourth quarter with $62.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $394.2 million with total debt of $1.06 billion as of october 31, 2021. our total debt to pro forma adjusted ebitda, including standby letters of credit was 1.9 times at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. as for our dividends, i am pleased to report the board approved a 2.6% increase in our quarterly dividend to $19.5 to be paid out in february.
now, i'll briefly discuss our outlook. as scott mentioned, our guidance for full year fiscal 2022 adjusted income from continuing operations is a range of $3.30 to $3.55 per diluted share. our adjusted earnings forecast reflects a favorable growth outlook across our business segments in fiscal 2022, as well as an expected easing in covid-19 related disinfection work and a reduction in labor efficiencies from anticipated rising office occupancy rates. please note that our adjusted earnings guidance excludes approximately $72 million in elevate related expenses that are planned in fiscal 2022. these are general and administrative expenses for delivering and implementing technology and process solutions related to our digital transformation. we plan to exclude these expenses from adjusted earnings to provide for more accurate comparisons regarding operating performance.
we expect that fiscal 2022 tax rate to be approximately 30% excluding any discrete items. fiscal 2022 will have one additional workday compared to fiscal 2021. as a reminder, each workday represents approximately $7 million of labor expense. in terms of the timing of quarterly workdays throughout the year, we will have one additional work day in both the first and fourth quarters versus the comparable periods in fiscal 2021 and one less workday in the second quarter.
capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to be approximately $54 million, including $8 million related to elevate investments. we forecast depreciation to be approximately $50 million for the year. we hope you will remain with us for our virtual investor day presentation, which will start shortly after a brief break. following the presentation, we will be available to answer your questions. thank you.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
welcome back. what a great representation of who we are and what we do. i'm super excited to kick off the investor day portion of our program, especially in light of the incredible results we shared earlier. joining me are the members of our executive leadership team, who you'll be hearing from later today. this team brings an incredible mix of industry experience and diverse backgrounds. we'll share our strategic plan that will unlock significant long-term value for our shareholders and strengthen our industry-leading position through end market repositioning and building on our core services. our new strategic plan will transform abm from a position of strength, using what we learned from 2020 vision and our covid response to launch our organization into the next phase of our journey.
we're going to leverage the market trends that will impact our business over the next five years. this will not only sharpen our focus, but also inform the investments we'll be making and we're going to optimize our portfolio of services and markets and geographies to better position our businesses to thrive as society evolves and moves forward, and we will innovate in the areas of technology and data to modernize service delivery. this will improve the productivity of our frontline workforce and create digital connections with our clients and our teammates and will drive profitable growth, will accelerate organic revenue growth rates by close to 50% with sustainable adjusted ebitda margins almost double where we started in 2015, while building on our significant cash flow.
over the course of the next hour, we'll dive into each one of these elements. but before we jump into our strategic plan and tell you how we're going to elevate abm, we'll briefly lay the foundation for first. so we're confident that we can implement our strategic plan because we've done it before. in 2015, we launched 2020 vision, a watershed moment for abm, driving long-term profitable growth and enhancing shareholder value. these investments we'll make over the next few years are a direct result of learnings from the success of 2020 vision.
so let's start with a review of what we've accomplished. first, our go-to-market strategy shifted us from a service-centric to a client-centric organization and created industry groups organized by end market. this allowed us to focus on industries where we have a meaningful competitive advantage, like business & industry, with our unmatched commercial real estate portfolio. it also gave us the opportunity to seek out segments where we knew we could build a leadership position, like we did with education. we are now clearly the number one facilities provider in that segment.
this approach was well received by clients and led to improved organic growth. you see, having an established industry group structure makes it easier for us to cross sell multi service solutions to our clients, leading to stickier, higher margin contracts. we were also aggressive in optimizing our portfolio by divesting non-core assets like security and government services and quickly reinvesting those proceeds into an emerging higher growth, higher margin service line, our technical solutions business. through the acquisition of gca, we were able to take to sub-scale vertical markets, education and technology & manufacturing and solidify them as stand-alone industry groups. in a moment, we'll share the ways we'll continue to evolve our industry group mix toward high growth, high-margin sectors.
we also now have mature key corporate functions like centralized shared services for finance and hr. we were able to improve productivity and we're now in a position to take advantage of our scale as we continue our growth trajectory through synergistic m&a. a good example of the benefits of scale is how our procurement team continues to drive efficiencies in large dollar spend categories, as we have more meaningful relationships with our suppliers. the power of this has never been more evident than during the pandemic when we were able to procure ppe and supplies, while others could not. this provide a critical protection for our team members and our clients.
procurement is among many key areas where we can find synergies from m&a, and our sales culture dramatically change through 2020 vision. this resulted in a record five consecutive years of new sales growth and unparalleled achievement for us. and in the field, we established standard operating procedures and a consistent service delivery approach, so our large-scale national clients knew what they can expect from market to market. to fund our acquisition strategy during 2020 vision, we upsized our credit facility from $800 million to $1.6 billion. we also consistently increased our dividend for over 55 years. and this past quarter, we paid our 222nd consecutive dividend.
we'll continue to drive growth and create value by focusing on thoughtful capital allocation to fund organic investments, pursue m&a and distribute cash to shareholders. we learned a lot through 2020 vision and i'm proud of the financial results we delivered. our journey started with a 3.8% adjusted ebitda margin. by 2019, our adjusted ebitda margin expanded by 140 basis points to 5.2%. revenue grew by 23% to $6.5 billion and adjusted eps grew 27%, reaching $2.05 per share. and we delivered these results during one of the worst labor crises in recent memory from 2018 to 2019. and we displayed the resilience that investors have come to expect from abm year-after-year.
we also continue to evolve on the executive leadership front. toward the end of 2019, we made a key hire bringing on josh feinberg, our chief strategy and transformation officer. josh helped guide our 2020 vision as a partner at bcg. and now, he is instrumental in developing our strategic vision and building a digitally enabled operating model.
i'll hand it off to josh now to continue laying the foundation for our strategic plan.
josh feinberg -- executive vice president and chief strategy and transformation officer
thanks, scott. really appreciate the introduction. i feel so fortunate to be here. it's truly a pleasure to chart abm's path forward from a position of strength. and we have a lot to leverage our market leadership position in a large and still very fragmented industry, our unmatched footprint and service portfolio, our blue chip client base in our industry-leading team. but perhaps more than anything else, our business continues to prove time and time again to be incredibly resilient.
we were tested in 2020 and 2021 as the covid-19 pandemic took hold. we acted quickly and decisively, rapidly building and deploying new capabilities and mobilizing our teams to lead our clients through the unpredictable shutdowns and reopenings we've all experienced over the past 20 months. and throughout it all, we perform at record-breaking profitability.
so how did we do it? and how has it further strengthened us for the path ahead? we prioritized the health and safety of our team members and clients, always our top priority, by assembling an advisory council with some of the nation's leading experts in industrial hygiene and infectious disease and establishing the leading pandemic-specific health, safety and operations protocols that we quickly deployed across our client base. we laser-focused on our cash flow and liquidity. when many in our industry struggled, our cash position improved significantly. we developed our own proprietary experts-backed solutions, enhancedclean & enhancedfacility to deliver healthy safe spaces and peace of mind to our clients and their employees, so buildings could reopen and stay open.
we've built and deployed a flexible labor model to accommodate the changing landscape. and we shifted our growth to pandemic appropriate end markets, like manufacturing and distribution, which helped offset the revenue decline in more impacted areas like aviation. these actions led to bottom line profitability beyond expectation, driving our pre-covid adjusted ebitda margin baseline from 5% up to 7.3% in 2021, while generating cumulative covid-related revenues of $600 million over 2020 and 2021.
our ability to perform during the pandemic clearly illustrates our agility and resilience. but the structural enhancements we made during this time, particularly the installation of a flexible labor model and the conversion of higher margin disinfecting into permanent scope additions, will serve us well going forward. our world has fundamentally changed over the past 20 months. society's demand for healthy and safe spaces will continue well into the future, especially as new variants continue to emerge. we are confident that this will translate into long-term margin expansion, whether new variants continue or not. we have moved beyond being a trusted partner. we are now a trusted and differentiated brand.
today, we are well positioned to invest in our future and are fortunate to be launching our strategy from a position of strength. we have unrivaled competitive advantage anchored in our market leadership across all end markets and industries we serve, unparalleled reach with a large distributed network of people and branch offices to serve our clients across the us and uk, a unique portfolio of services spanning janitorial, engineering, parking, technical solutions and aviation services, a trusted reputation that we have earned over the last 110 years of long-lasting client relationship and a strong balance sheet that we will use strategically and opportunistically as expansion possibilities arise.
our performance during the pandemic afforded us the opportunity to look ahead and craft our longer-term strategy, while others struggle day to day. we started by refreshing our deep understanding of the market and trends, impacting our industry now and for years to come. five trends rose to the surface. first, societal shifts are leading to the demand for healthy, safe and efficient spaces as well as a renewed commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. changes in demographics, higher rates of urbanization and consumer preferences have accelerated the need for expanded logistics ecosystem from clients like amazon, walmart, fedex and ups looking to enhance the reach.
second, the future of work is centered on drastically changing employee expectations, which are causing employers to rethink workplace design, assess the appropriate work models for their teams and create efficient collaboration tools to drive sustained improvements in employee productivity and satisfaction. this trend highlights the need to invest in dynamic workforce capabilities and employ flexible operations to accommodate rapidly changing workplace dynamics.
third, sustainability is no longer a consideration for the future. it is required to operate a business responsibly right now. our recently published sustainability report reaffirms our commitment to leaving a healthier planet for the next generation and beyond. more specifically, the demand for renewable energy, clean air, reduction in energy consumption and the elimination of harmful pathogens are just a few sustainability trends that directly align to our janitorial, facilities engineering and technical solutions businesses, all of which our strategic growth priorities.
fourth, mobility is shaping various industries, leading to significant investments in autonomous vehicles and electrification, which is driving new infrastructure builds across the world. this presents a substantial opportunity for our fast-growing ev charging segment in our technical solutions business, in our smart parking solutions, in our b&i and aviation segments.
and finally, digitization. it continues to accelerate with leading-edge technologies and data and analytics, becoming more prevalent in day-to-day use. smart buildings are evolving with artificial intelligence, cloud computing and iot sensor technology. this is leading to our investment in both workforce and client-facing technology at a time when clients are demanding innovation.
our purpose, putting people above all else and amplifying what matters most to them has never meant more. the value and demand for what we do has never been higher. our clients will benefit, our team members will benefit, society will benefit and our investors will benefit. we've anticipated the seismic shifts ahead. we're prepared to embrace these changes and capitalize on the future they've opened up. this is our time.
let me now pass it back to scott to unveil our strategic vision.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, josh. to continue to win in the future, we must build on our positioning to capture the opportunity ahead and sustain the resilience our shareholders depend on. elevate is the next step in our journey. we will elevate the client experience as a trusted advisor and innovate with multi-service solutions and consistent service delivery to drive sustained profitable growth. we'll elevate the team member experience by training and developing the next generation of leaders and building on our inclusive culture and will elevate our use of technology and data to power client and team member experiences with cutting-edge data and analytics, processes and tools that will fundamentally change how we operate our business and result in significant financial returns. this will separate us from our competitors that just don't have the financial resources to make these investments, w will elevate abm.
let's take a look at the elevate launch video that brings our vision to life. we are really inspired by this vision.
now i'd like to introduce rene jacobsen, our chief operating officer. rene is responsible for leading operations for all of our industry groups and has created an environment centered on collaboration, accountability and client focus. he is now going to take you through the market landscape, our service line and industry group portfolio and a view into how we'll elevate the client experience.
rene jacobsen -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thanks, scott. we play in a large and diverse market with many different types of competitors. the total addressable market although very large at $250 billion is highly fragmented. oftentimes our greatest competition comes from small regional players and local companies. while we are well positioned from a competitive standpoint in each market, growth rates for our core services tend to be generally in line with gdp. you'll see that we plan on investing in our platform in ways that our competition cannot. we're also well positioned to ensure business continuity for our clients in response to new variants given our established protocols, expert advisory council and the essential services we provide to meet their needs. elevating the client and team member experiences through the use of technology and data will differentiate abm in the marketplace and help us achieve above market growth.
we operate with a vast number of service lines to well-defined and diversified end markets and geographies. while the diversity of our business is a strategic choice we want to preserve, we continue to evolve our focus. we spent significant time and effort analyzing market trends, competitive intelligence, client needs and economics to assess both our current portfolio and potential adjacencies. let's take a look at how we're structured and provide you with an aerial view of our industry groups and service lines.
let's start with our service lines. janitorial services have always been the core of abm service offering. our position as a market leader in the geographies we operate opens up tremendous possibilities for growing into new whitespace. we will pursue organic initiatives to improve our client retention rates and maintain our market leading position. we will also invest heavily in tools to unlock efficiencies in our frontline workforce. we're excited to share more about these initiatives later on today. we will also seek out m&a opportunities to grow our footprint in geographies with favorable economies of scale. our foothold in key markets provides a firm foundation for synergies.
advances in technology and a focus on sustainability, particularly in energy efficiency and consumption have propelled engineering services to the forefront. preventative maintenance dictated by time based schedule is phasing out as facilities are now being outfitted with edge networks sensors and other smart devices to drive data that allow our engineers to predict failures before they happen. the demand for expert engineering services is high and the ability to lead with advanced processes and technology, one of our key areas of investment over the next few years is quickly becoming a place where we can differentiate.
we'll also continue to seek out opportunities to improve our scale in key markets through m&a like we did with able services. success in parking centers around technology and advanced revenue management capabilities as we seek to optimize our clients parking facilities operations and revenue. we will continue to modernize our parking business and create a consistent operating model around technology and automation to drive value for our clients. we've already begun to deliver first generation smart parking solutions to enhance the parking experience at lax [indecipherable] automation artificial intelligence and machine learning are some of the ways we can provide frictionless entry and exit, smooth way finding and automated payment solutions.
we can also offer a unique bundling opportunity with the installation and modernization of ev charging stations. we are consolidating this data into a single analytics platform to drive revenue and over the next few years, we will invest in scaling these areas to become a unique solution provider for our clients. we are increasingly pursuing client opportunities that include multiple services. our ability to self-perform engineering, janitorial and other maintenance services is a big differentiator with prospective clients. along with a strong strategic partnership network, these contracts require a dedicated technology platform to manage the full suite of services and advance procurement capabilities to negotiate service contracts where we need a subcontract.
there is a continuum between adding an additional service versus a fully integrated ifs contract and there is a lot of white across that spectrum. our goal is to move further along that continuum toward ifs. the able acquisition advanced our position in this area, as you'll see, when we dive deeper into that strategic move a little later. these capabilities provide higher margin and increased retention or stickiness, a key to growing our business and profit profile. our industry group structure was similarly strengthened by this new strategic approach.
let's start with a review of our technical solutions business. technical solutions has been our highest growth and highest margin business for years. historically, we've achieved these results with our hvac, mechanical, electrical and lighting services, which are often bundled together and packaged in a unique offering to our clients to generate cost savings, while yielding healthy margins for abm. we call that bundled energy solutions. we're seeing greater demand for services in higher growth segments of the market related to electrification, sustainable energy savings programs and power and electrical, consistent with the long-term mega trends we discussed earlier.
our team is poised to continue on a growth trajectory powered by the momentum we're seeing in the market for vehicle electrification, where we are one of the largest installers of electrical vehicle charging stations in the country; bundled energy solutions that guarantee energy savings and address critical aging infrastructure; power and electrical services that support the growth of mission-critical facilities like data centers for clients in technology, healthcare and the federal government. the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that just passed will open doors for us. in fact, it allocates $7.5 billion that could be used to construct ev charging stations.
we are planning investments in talent and technology to attract salespeople who can sell these complex solutions, highly skilled engineers and project managers, and hardware and software to build unique solutions and integrate data sources. the revenue and margin potential for ats continues to be very high, relative to other industry groups. investments in public infrastructure, the growth of electrification and the focus on energy and sustainability project significant market growth for years to come.
next, let's turn to b&i, our largest industry group. b&i is anchored by our commercial real estate client portfolio, which consists of both third-party managed and owner managed facilities. janitorial, engineering and parking are the primary service lines in b&i, which have generated solid margins and cash flow for abm. we are planning investments in workforce management that will increase the productivity levels of our onsite operations as well as our use of technology like sensors, autonomous equipment and data platforms. to enhance our value proposition to clients by providing real-time insights to better run their facilities. b&i fared extraordinarily well throughout the pandemic.
while we sustained some top line impact due to facility closures early on and more recently low rates of occupancy, our margins flourished as we were able to drive labor efficiencies and higher margin enhancedclean services to our clients. revenue growth potential for b&i. is that a company average and remains a reliable source of organic growth year in and year out, given its overall size and impact on the organization. the margin potential for b&i continues to be above the industry group average and will be further augmented by elevated investments. the market for commercial office space is projected to grow at modest rates with the types of clients on the upper end of that growth range very much aligned to our operating model, skewing toward large national companies.
next, let's cover our education segment. education is operating a near pre-covid levels as schools have largely returned to in-person learning across the country. we expect both higher education and k-12 schools to continue to invest in disinfection programs, while also focusing on indoor air quality. we are advising clients on different ways to pay for these services, including government funding through the cares act and other programs. our breadth of services in this segment makes us a true industry leader with janitorial, facilities engineering, landscape and ground services in all markets. our education clients have also been a major focus for cross-selling bundled energy solutions from the ats group.
revenue growth and margin potential for education is slightly below company average. however, there is an upside as our team shifts focus to higher margin contracts with private higher-education institutions that have longer buying cycles. the education market is primarily in-sourced, but we are well positioned to generate more first generation outsourcing opportunities with integrated service offering that includes janitorial, engineering and grounds. this solution was bolstered by the acquisition of able services.
now, let's switch gears and turn to aviation. aviation was our most impacted industry group during the covid-19 pandemic. however, our exposure to airports and not just airlines insulated us against the more severe impact as flight volumes dropped almost 90% during the peak. our breadth of service offerings in this space and our commitment to providing healthy and safe spaces for passengers both on-board and in airports helped us sustain a significant portion of our revenue over the last few years.
as flight volumes are returning to normal, we're also continuing to secure higher margin service contracts with airports and related facilities, which tend to be more stable. we're an end-to-end provider of services in the aviation industry as we handle everything from parking and transportation, to wheelchair, to cabin cleaning and many below the wing services like baggage handling.
while revenue in our aviation segment remains below pre-pandemic levels, we expect to see continued growth, driven in part by new airport parking, transportation and janitorial contracts. over the last few years, we've evolved from 45% airport clients and 55% airline clients to 55% airport clients and 45% airline clients as airports are less impacted by fluctuating passenger volume.
revenue growth potential for aviation is projected to be high with the aviation sector recovering after the initial covid shutdown. while margin potentially is structurally lower than company average, we're expecting significant improvement in this area due to volume improvements and customer mix. we believe the market potential is high, given the recently passed infrastructure bill.
finally, let's discuss some key trends in our technology & manufacturing business. over the last few years, our presence in logistics, distribution and manufacturing has grown double-digits. as we covered earlier, several mega trends are accelerating growth in these markets. consumer preferences have changed. they now expect faster fulfillment without an increase in costs, which is leading to a boom in us distribution and warehouse space that is now reaching urban markets. estimates show that 1 billion square feet of net new us distribution warehouse space is needed to support e-commerce growth due to consumer demands. this represents more than 100% growth in these types of facilities.
abm has a strong presence in this high growth market and has client relationships with the likes of amazon, walmart, fedex and ups, who've experienced significant growth over the last few years. add to this robust end markets like food and beverage, auto, aerospace and other large industrial companies, and we are uniquely positioned to compete in this growing market.
today, we're excited to announce the creation of a new industry group, manufacturing and distribution. m&d will replace our t&m industry group and shift our incredible portfolio of technology clients into b&i where they're best served. this will allow us to become even more client-centric in how we deliver our services to manufacturing and distribution clients who have similar business needs and are also essential service providers in our economy. it will also leverage abm's scale to drive service excellence, increasing density and proximity of support to all of our technology, manufacturing and distribution clients as well as position m&d for innovation and growth by putting our best operation around each client and focusing on large specialized client sites to give us a better chance to expand multiple service offerings to these accounts. the accelerated growth of our technology clients with their expanded office footprint is best served by b&i and the branch network with roughly $300 million in annual revenue moving over. this includes clients like facebook, google and adobe. m&d will maintain our large manufacturing clients and add distribution clients with roughly $400 million in annual revenue moving over.
we have already achieved operational savings from this change, which is part of our elevate related run rate adjusted ebitda margin that earl will outline in the fiscal '22 guidance section later on in the presentation. revenue growth potential for m&d is projected to be well above average as we leverage foundational client relationships with large organizations who are realizing exponential growth. margin potential is projected to be high due to the specialization required to perform service in these unique high demand facilities. we believe the market potential is extraordinarily high [technical issues]

that variability makes it difficult to support how each team member can be most productive across the organization.
we will transform how we work together adopting industry leading smart processes and tools by investing in a new workforce platform with modern time keeping, scheduling forecasting modules, providing a simple user interface that our teams can manage and access via desktop, tablet or mobile. ultimately, our goal is to create a digital connection with our workforce to enable just in time and on-demand training and development, providing them with insights to get their jobs done more productively, which will deliver better client satisfaction. we expect these investments to produce significant benefits due to increased labor productivity and will also provide us with better controls to help us comply with the ever-changing regulatory environment in these areas.
we are a people business. our team members will be a driving factor in our long-term success if we empower them to inspire, lead, manage and execute. to accomplish this, we will strengthen our culture and reaffirm our commitment to an inclusive workplace. last year, we launched a culture and inclusion council and now this cross-functional, multi-level council is beginning to help in this area. with the guidance of the council, we selected outside organizations to partner with. as a result, we've entered into multi-year partnerships with respected organizations like the hispanic scholarship fund, the after-school alliance and the thurgood marshall college fund.
all our focus on building a more equitable society for the next generation. this not only resonates with our leaders, but directly to our team members at every level. we will empower and engage workforce through improved talent acquisition capabilities and enhanced coaching and development programs, beginning with the frontline manager. we will evolve our rewards by implementing a totally reward system and recognition program that enhances abms value proposition for team members and drives retention and productivity. we will build stronger hr capabilities by enhancing our hr shared services center that provides team members with support in hr related information 24/7, while we continue to evolve our broader hr capabilities.
while we're excited about our vision to elevate the team member experience, we realize we are in the midst of a global labor shortage. our teams have been keenly focused on mitigating this risk by launching several targeted initiatives to keep our client facility staffed, including strategies to better attract and retain talent. in this spring, we launched a rapid recruiting program that expands the reach of most of our impactful recruiting activities, like deploying local sourcing teams, hosting grassroots hiring events, opening new stand-alone brick and mortar recruiting centers in key markets, driving incentive programs and social media brand promotion across all our major channels. these activities have driven a strong pool of candidates and we will continue to invest in these programs across all of our key markets.
structural realignment of our centralized field recruiting model has significantly improved yield and accepted offers. this is resulting in both improved time to fill and more hires with the same number of recruiters. we expect to continue to realize staffing efficiencies as we scale these initiatives. while we've improved our candidate flow, we've also started to build additional solutions to retain our team members. we developed a predictive retention model to identify areas of the business that may experience higher levels of team member attrition. this data coupled with strong hr and operational partnership has led to site-specific action plans. early results show reduction in turnover in half of all site where this approach has been deployed. with a solid strategy in place to keep our facility staffed and the investments we're making and enhancing our workforce management capabilities, we feel as prepared as we can be considering the current tight labor market.
now to introduce you all to the third pillar in our strategic plan is melanie kirkwood ruiz, our chief information officer. melanie is a visionary technology leader with more than 20 years of experience across diverse industries, including gaming, commercial real estate, manufacturing, healthcare and aviation. melanie will explain how we elevate abm through the use of technology and data.
melanie kirkwood ruiz -- chief information officer
thank you, raul. elevating the client and team member experiences requires us to create a digital connection that links the buildings we service to our teams and our clients. this connection will be enabled with technology and real-time data to promote visibility, it's a facility operations and insights to drive meaningful action. this will result in increased productivity and improvements in client satisfaction and retention.
leading-edge technologies such as ai, machine learning and advanced data analytics are radically changing the way we do business and deliver value to our clients and team members. to effectively capture the opportunities in front of us and stay at the leading edge, we must embrace these trends and develop a digital platform consistent with our market leadership position. we will elevate our use of technology and data by investing in our systems, tools, business processes and operating models to enable the following outcomes.
we will engage our clients and team members in new ways to further differentiate us in the industry. this includes launching a new team member at that will serve as a one-stop shop to manage their schedules and shifts, access new training and development content and communicate with their managers and clients. by developing and deploying client-facing technology and data platforms, we can drive actionable insights that improve service delivery and our ultimate value to the client. a great example being the smart parking solution you heard about earlier in the presentation.
we will expand our use of data by building and advanced data and analytics capability that will develop data products for high value use cases like some of the ones [indecipherable] mentioned already, team member retention, hyper targeting for sales and recruiting among others. this will establish data and analytics as a strategic asset for abm. we will modernize the digital ecosystem to support core activities and enable high value business outcomes. investments in this area will include upgrades to enterprise software like our erp and payroll systems along with infrastructure and cyber security builds to support our new capabilities. technology data, and process will power our ability to provide best-in-class client and team member experiences. we will undergo a fundamental transformation with careful pace and cadence.
and now to talk through our 2022 guidance and forward outlook is earl ellis, abm's chief financial officer.
earl ellis -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, melanie, and good morning, everyone. i am so pleased to have the opportunity to share with you our fiscal 2022 guidance and the details of our strategic investments that will transform abm over the years to come. these investments will accelerate our organic growth, expand our profitability and significantly enhance both our client and team member experiences. over the next four years, we are confident these investments will drive substantial and sustainable improvements to our operational and financial performance, while improving both employee and client retention.
now before i dive into the details of our fiscal '22 guidance and longer-term outlook, i think it's important to first ground us in what's transpired over the past year and a half. since the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we have experienced significant tailwinds from the dramatic impact of covid-19. the substantial increase in demand for disinfecting services combined with our team's continued strong operational execution and drive for labor efficiencies contributed to record adjusted ebitda margins exceeding 7% in fiscal 2021. this represents a more than 200 basis point improvement versus pre-covid adjusted ebitda margins in fiscal 2019. much of this improvement reflects covid related benefits from increased work orders, enhancedclean and labor efficiencies.
while we anticipate an easing of these tailwinds as we emerge from the pandemic, we are confident that we can retain approximately 50 basis points to 70 basis points of uplift over the long-term as we expect to maintain a portion of both the disinfection related revenue and profitability along with a higher baseline level of labor efficiency.
so turning to fiscal 2022 guidance. as we build upon the improved positioning gained over the past 18 months, we are guiding to an adjusted ebitda margin within a range of 6.2% to 6.6%. this represents a meaningful improvement over our baseline pre-pandemic adjusted ebitda margin of 5.2% reported in fiscal 2019, but lower than fiscal 2021 as the pandemic tailwinds ease and our business begins to normalize. in addition, our adjusted ebitda margin guidance includes the initial benefits of elevate, which i will speak to shortly in more detail, as well as contributions from the initial synergies associated with able services acquisition.
as we look to fiscal '22 and beyond, we are excited about the topline and bottom line opportunities from elevate. our elevate strategy includes a series of discrete transformational investments that total between $150 million to $175 million. these investments are wide-ranging, from workforce management, to data analytics, to the digitization of platforms that will support employee recruiting, development and retention. in short, we believe elevate is a game changer. it will allow for the implementation of leading-edge processes, technology and tools that will drive a higher level of substantial financial performance and, at the same time, benefit our team members and clients by providing more digital tools and actionable data to enrich their experiences. ultimately, elevate will enable abm to grow faster and more profitably and provide a higher value proposition for our clients.
by design, the elevate plan is front-end loaded as we plan to spend approximately $80 million in fiscal 2022 or by approximately $45 million in fiscal '23 and approximately $15 million in each of the following two years. of the $80 million planned in fiscal 2022, approximately $72 million will be a discrete expense and will be reported as items impacting comparability and as such will not be included in adjusted eps guidance of $3.30 to $3.55. the balance of approximately $8 million will be included in capital expenditures. the relatively large investment in year one is necessary to meaningfully advance our digital transformation. and with these elements in place by the end of fiscal 2022, we anticipate we can begin to scale the benefits across the organization with lower levels of investments in subsequent years.
now, to help conceptualize the individual components of the elevate program, let me categorize the investments over the next four years in three buckets; digital transformation, workplace and people and our go-to-market initiatives. about half of our investments will be focused on digital transformation initiatives as we invest in client-facing technology, data and analytics and our enterprise it infrastructure. we will make our technology more robust and seamless as we better harness our data to create a competitive advantage while we upgrade and refine our business processes. these enhancements will enable us to engage our clients in new ways, use our data to more effectively drive decision-making and modernize our digital ecosystem.
about 30% of the investments will be allocated toward workforce management and the investment in our people. we will make significant investments in centralized workforce management tools and capabilities, including forecasting and scheduling solutions and standardize task management. these investments will allow us to deploy labor more efficiently and deliver a greater value to our clients. we will invest in on-demand and just-in-time training tools and advanced career development capabilities that will not only improve recruiting and retention, but also position abm as an employer of choice.
the remaining 20% will be used to fuel our organic growth initiatives and our go-to-market strategies, including investments in centralized platforms to support capabilities such as hyper sales targeting, price optimization and strategic account management. elevate will drive revenue growth and increased profitability by supporting favorable business mix, increasing client retention, optimizing price escalations and driving cost efficiencies primarily through labor optimization.
our goal is for elevate to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate to the mid-single digit range, up approximately 50% versus our previous growth rate with potential upside from additional strategic acquisitions. as revenue growth accelerates, we also anticipate a corresponding and gradual improvement to our adjusted ebitda margins of approximately 20 basis points annually starting in fiscal 2023.
in summary, we are confident that elevate will enhance our potential to capture profitable growth. the related investments are expected to generate $110 million to $130 million in incremental adjusted ebitda on a run rate basis by fiscal 2025, driving a projected internal rate of return of 28%. to put this in perspective, at the conclusion of elevate in fiscal 2025, we envision abm will generate annual revenue of approximately $9 billion with a sustainable adjusted ebitda margin of 7%, representing a significant improvement from our baseline level of $7 billion in revenue with a normalized adjusted ebitda margin below 6%. we are also targeting annualized free cash flow at a run rate of approximately $400 million by fiscal 2025.
while these financial metrics are compelling, the benefits and strategic value of elevate go well beyond financial returns. we are confident elevate will be a transformational initiative, strengthening our competitive position in the facility services industry and creating a more rewarding experience for all of our team members.
so with that, let me pass it back over to scott, who will close out our presentation and lead us into our q&a session.
scott salmirs -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, earl. we couldn't be more excited about our future. our industry-leading position will be rooted in innovation and technology and enable us to drive significant long-term value for our shareholders. by implementing our new strategic plan, we can ensure growth based on our commitment to transform from a position of strength, leverage our understanding of market trends, optimize the portfolio of services and end markets, innovate in technology and data to modernize service delivery and drive enhanced profitable growth.
our goal is to be a roughly $9 billion business with [technical issues] sustainable adjusted ebitda margins by the end of 2025. to achieve this and build the capabilities to expand our position in the market, we expect to make investments in areas of the business that earl just spoke about. these investments will drive improvement across several key metrics.
from a growth perspective, our investments will drive organic growth rates, almost 50% higher than -- approaching 4% annually. when factoring in our m&a strategy, we are targeting an overall compounded annual growth rate of over 10%. the focus on the client experience through investments in customer-facing technology and innovation and a new retention strategy aim to improve our client retention rates to between 92% and 94%. we believe these efforts, along with our strategic account management program, could double cross selling performance by the end of 2025.
our people initiatives you just heard about will yield lower cost per hire and reduce team member turnover, which translates to operating margin improvement. our workforce management initiatives has one of the largest paybacks on our elevate program, resulting in labor productivity, which will show up in higher operating profit at the industry group level. and the impact of the digital transformation will be felt across the entire firm. as you saw, technology and data are key components of our growth strategy, people strategy and how we execute on workforce management. all the improvements that we'll experience throughout elevate will be supported in some way by the investments we're making in our digital transformation.
lastly, we'll continue to lean on the protocols that we put in place during the onset of the pandemic. covid is here to stay in one form or another and the emergence of new variant could be the new normal. at abm, we are prepared to support our client's ability to stay open, stay safe and be productive.
before we start our q&a session, we want to share a few housekeeping items. so hang in there and we'll kick things off shortly. thank you.
