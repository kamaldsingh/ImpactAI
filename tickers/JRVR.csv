good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the james river q1 2019 results call. [operator instructions] and as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. i'd now like to turn the conference over to kevin copeland, head of investor relations. please, go ahead.
kevin copeland -- head of investor relations
thank you, candice. good morning, everyone, and welcome to the james river group first-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. these statements are based on current beliefs, intentions, expectations, and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.
for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k, form 10-qs and other reports and filings we make with the securities and exchange commission. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. i will now turn the call over to bob myron, chief executive officer of james river group.
bob myron -- chief executive officer
thank you, kevin, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our investor call. i'm bob myron, ceo, and with me today are sarah doran, our cfo; and kevin copeland, our chief investment officer and head of investor relations. i'll spend some time today talking about our overall results for the quarter and also some specifics on each one of our segments, both results, as well as operations. i'll then turn the call over to sarah, and then we'll get to your questions.
we are off to a great start for the year. the $21.7 million of after-tax operating income and the 16.9% annualized return on tangible equity is one of the best quarters we've had in our 17-year history. our underwriting results were strong with underwriting profits at all three of our segments in a 92.6% combined ratio overall. we had good growth in our two u.s.
primary insurance segments, which is where we are focusing our growth efforts. there are many items of note that bode well for the rest of the year. our expense ratio of 22.6% is market-leading as we continue to carefully manage expenses and get great leverage out of our franchise. i am particularly pleased about growing tangible book value per share from $16.34 to $17.74 in the last three months, while at the same time producing a great return on tangible equity, continuing to pay a nearly 3% dividend.
let me now talk about each of our three segments individually. in our largest segment, e&s submissions were up 17% in the quarter year over year, the highest quarterly percentage increase in submissions we have had in the last 11.5 years. in the quarter, we received over 68,000 new and renewal submissions. this reflects the continued strong and growing u.s.
economy, the excellent relationships we have with our wholesale brokers and meaningful amounts of business flowing from the admitted market into the e&s market. pricing on renewals was up about 3% in the quarter on our core e&s business, but the renewal pricing doesn't tell the whole story. i'll give an example of a couple of habitational risks that we wrote in the quarter, which is a class where we are seeing strong flow in our general casualty division from business being nonrenewed in the admitted market. the first one we wrote in the quarter, we received a 100% increase on the expiring premium, wrote it on a tighter coverage form and for the same $25,000 deductible of the expiring policy.
the second one we wrote with a 68% price increase relative to the expiring premium on a tighter coverage form with a $5,000 deductible, where previously the account had no deductible. in our e&s segment, our underwriting staff are in three offices: richmond, virginia; alpharetta, georgia; and scottsdale, arizona, as well as a few people in remote locations. we have a total of 172 persons currently working in underwriting in this segment. this is the highest underwriting headcount number we have had in our history, and we are continually looking to find additional staff in this area to help us work through the strong and growing submission flow.
under our segment president, richard schmitzer, we have a strong and deep bench of talent with great subject matter expertise at the division manager level, as well as at levels below that. we have had the same group of division managers that we have when i came to the company nine years ago, so the continuity is fantastic. of note, our core e&s segment, which excludes commercial auto, represented $334 million of gross written premiums last year in 2018, which substantially exceeds our previous cyclical high from back in 2006 when we wrote a little less than $250 million. it's the largest book of business that we have at our whole group.
as of last year, our commercial auto division was $322 million of gross written premiums. with this strong submission flow and the strength of our franchise, we are going to continue to see great opportunities for profitable growth going forward in core e&s. with respect to growth in core e&s, gross written premiums were up 5% in the quarter, which was fine, but ex our allied health division, our growth -- our core gross written premium was up 23%. you may recall that we had significant growth in allied health business a year ago in q1 equipment driven by flow from the admitted market and substantial rate increases.
but we got strong growth elsewhere, in particular, in our three largest core e&s divisions, namely: manufacturers and contractors, which was up 34% in the quarter; general casualty, which was up 46%; and excess casualty, which was up 55%. this bodes well for the future. we feel that we are extremely well poised for the ongoing hardening market and small account e&s casualty business that we have been seeing in the last six quarters or so continuing. richard schmitzer has done a great job managing this segment for us over the last 10 years.
now a few comments about our commercial auto division within e&s, the majority of which is with one client. in the quarter, commercial auto grew 19%. this was principally from growth in written premiums in january and february of 2019 over the previous year's contract with our largest client. as we have said before, this contract renews on march 1st of any given year.
from march 1st forward, we will have growth in gross written premiums but not much growth in net written premiums. the approximate written premiums for the 12-month policy term incepting march 1, 2019 is projected to be $400 million gross and $300 million net. the reason for the $100 million difference is that we place the $100 million quota share reinsurance contract behind us on this risk. we are very happy to have received from the client a larger share of the risk in the 20 states and the two territories that we are insuring.
the flexibility of our e&s paper has been very important to our relationship and opportunity with the client. our relationship with this largest client continues to be strong, but that doesn't cause us to rest on our laurels. we work hard to service this account to the best of our ability every day and seek to make constant improvements to service levels and technology. claim servicing is one of the most important parts of the relationship as our ability to service the account is central to the six years of history we have had with this client.
we handle all of the claims for this account using our own staff who are based in three offices: richmond, scottsdale and raleigh. and our claims headcount dedicated to servicing this account is over 300 people. we are making appropriate use of leading-edge claims technology in handling these claims. we also have access to all of the client's telematics when it comes to claims handling.
we don't use third-party administrators to handle claims or tpas. this has been a key tenet of our relationship with the client from the beginning going all the way back to 2013. also as we probably said before, this account is priced on a per mile basis by state. in our specialty admitted segment, we grew 18%.
submissions were up 52% in our individual risk workers' compensation business, which reflects strong agency relationships, continued economic growth and continued modest expansion into a few other states. rates were down about 3% in individual risk workers' comp, but margins were down only about half that and remain strong as we continue to see benign loss activity. you may remember that we buy 50% quota share reinsurance treaty on this business behind us, which has helped to support our modest and calculated expansion and the resulting increase in submission flow and opportunity. in our fronting division, we grew gross written premiums by 15%.
this was because of new fronted deals that were not on the books a year ago. a few comments on our largest fronted transaction, which is produced by atlas, a california-based mga. we reinsure in excess of 90% of this business to quota share and excess reinsurers. the contract continues to perform well from a loss perspective and produces -- and production continues to be in line with expectations.
our group has had a long and successful relationship with atlas. while we take a small slice of risk, we watch this closely like we do with all fronted transactions and mga relationships and work collaboratively with the mga through our own underwriting staff and underwriting guidelines employed, which include oversight and frequent audits of both claims and underwriting operations. this contract renews on june 1st of each year, and at this time, we expect it to renew again. otherwise, we are continuing to grow in both count and premium other fronting transactions.
of note, in april, we wrote two new transactions that we expect to deliver between $40 million and $45 million of gross written premium per annum. we are pleased to report that both of these deals are for property business, which is a first for this division, and will be 100% reinsured without any property tail risk whatsoever. while these transactions will represent a modest amount of premium growth, we are also seeing opportunities which may show up as fee income rather than premium, so the segment growth likely will all register through the top line. otherwise, terry mccafferty, our specialty admitted segment president, has a strong pipeline of new prospective deals that we are optimistic about.
in our casualty re segment, while we did have a modest amount of adverse development in the quarter, sliding scale ceding commissions absorbed much of this so that the net result was still a 99.1% combined ratio and an underwriting profit. we shrunk the top line in this segment in line with our expectations. for the full-year 2019, gross written premiums will be between flat to up 10% as our underlying cedings get rate and positive exposure increases. the book is expected to be over 90% e&s business in 2019.
in terms of pricing for casualty re, the underlying business saw rate increases of about 3%, and we got 1% increase in reinsurance pricing upon renewals. with that, let me turn the call over to sarah doran, our cfo.
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
thanks, bob, and good morning, everyone. for the first-quarter of 2019, we made strong underwriting profits of $7.1 million. we generated an operating profit of $21.7 million, and we're reporting net income of $22.7 million. our expense ratio of 22.6% is an improvement of 2.3 points from the prior-year quarter.
while slightly elevated from the sequential quarter, the improvement is largely due to mix. our e&s segment, which has the lowest expense ratio of the operating segment, now represents about 75% of our earned premium, up from about 65% in the first quarter of last year. we also saw expense ratio improvement in both the specialty admitted and casualty re segments and as always, continue to be focused on managing our expenses throughout the organization. the 22.6% is an extremely meaningful 10-point advantage to our competitors.
we continue to enjoy strong cash flow from our businesses as operating cash flow was $35.4 million this quarter, down slightly due to some timing difference of our casualty re segment. net investment income was the highest in the company's history this quarter. our investment performance this quarter is a credit to our growth over these past few years, as well as thoughtful strategy around the portfolio, and we have the benefit of a market rebound. we are at $19.4 million of nii, an increase of almost 50% from the first quarter of 2018, reversing much of the underperformance we experienced last quarter.
cash and investment assets were up about 15% from the first quarter of 2018, although i believe this growth will likely be slower going forward. this quarter, in particular, our small other private investment portfolio delivered exceptional returns. we construct the entire portfolio to have a few pockets for outperformance that represents a small portion of invested assets, take moderate risk in our well-performing floating bank loan portfolio, and to a lesser degree, in our high-grade portfolio. our balance sheet continues to be a key focus.
in this quarter, our prior-year reserve development was stable with e&s, benefited from continued positive margin in specialty admitted, in our individual workers' compensation book and has a small amount of prior-year development in casualty re. as mentioned in february, our external reserve processes, which include -- which conclude in the fourth quarter, had showed us as having some redundancy across the group. we are focused on making prudent and conservative current accident year loss picks, so our current accident year loss ratio increased from both the prior and sequential quarter. but perhaps our strongest highlight this quarter is that we grew tangible equity per share 10.4% from one quarter ago while also delivering annualized adjusted net operating return on average tangible equity of 16.9%.
we ended the quarter with tangible shareholders' equity of 531 -- $535.1 million, an increase over the $489.9 million at the end of 2018. operating leverage were 12 months, net premiums written to tangible equity was 1.4 times to one. our ability to generate strong tangible book value growth and a high rote is very important to us and shows we have great opportunities to put our capital to work. and finally, on taxes.
our effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.8%. and while there are many points of impact to our tax rate, we continue to believe that going forward, our tax rate will be similar to historical averages, ticking up slightly as more of our assets move over time from a nontaxable jurisdiction. that said, it's worth noting that our bermuda domicile continues to be a strong advantage of ours as the majority of our invested assets remain offshore, and we have an efficient capital management framework in place, which among other things yield strong relationships with our regulators and rating agencies. and with that, i'll turn it back to bob.
bob myron -- chief executive officer
thank you, sarah. operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. would you please open the line for questions?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from mark hughes of suntrust. your line is now open.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much. good morning.
bob myron -- chief executive officer
good morning.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
could you talk about -- on the quota share presumably you'll be getting a ceding commission. any sense of what the impact of that will be? i assume that will be an offset to operating expenses. but could you give us a little insight what that could do to the margin?
bob myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. so we will be getting a ceding commission. there is -- it will be an offset to operating expenses, but we don't want to get into the terms of -- and conditions of it because it's a private transaction principally with one party. and so i think it's best to just make mention of the fact that we have it.
we're happy to have it and how it's going to be accounted for. but don't want to get into the terms and conditions on it, mark.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
ok. the share of the risk you're taking now with your large client, are you taking the majority of the risk? or is it still a less than half?
bob myron -- chief executive officer
well, as i know you know, we haven't gotten into the forever sort of talking about the share of the risk that we actually take. i mean this is obviously increased than it's more than it's been -- more than it's been in the past on a gross basis. but there still is meaningful risk sharing between us and the client.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
understood. the current accident year loss in specialty admitted, i'm not sure if you touched on that in your prepared remarks, but that was up a bit year over year. would you expect that to stay at that level or that kind of return to perhaps where it has been last year or the year before?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
sure. and that -- thanks for the question, mark. that talk is around a fair amount, we don't have count -- premium in that segment. so 74.5% this quarter is improved from the 77.5% in the fourth quarter of last year, but up versus the first quarter.
so i think the point is there's not a great trend there, but i would think about the 74.5% or kind of 74.5% area for this year. that's just the thesis of us taking a conservative look at everything that we're putting on the books right now, in this year, in particular. not seeing any reason to move things up other than just trying to be conservative where we can, as we're doing throughout the group.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thank you.
bob myron -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from matthew carletti of jmp securities. your line is now open.
matthew carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning. sarah, maybe first question for you. just you mentioned some color on the reserves and largely the lack of movement in the quarter.
i was hoping you could maybe tease apart the e&s movement a little bit. i think it was pretty small. let's call it nil overall. were there any notable movements on one side or the other kind of core e&s versus commercial auto.
and likewise within commercial auto by accident year, was there any movement of note? or was it kind of just rounding errors across the board?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
yeah. i appreciate the question. thanks for asking. we know this is going to be a big focus.
so clearly, we're pretty happy to come out the quarter as we were hoping at the end of last quarter with a very stable reserve in that segment in particular. i would say, there's -- they were small movements in a lot of different directions. they were not big movements on one side or the other, in one line, in one year, matt. so really it was kind of -- it netted out to the 10,000, but it was small pieces within that.
both within commercial autos and core over the years, nothing of note to report there.
matthew carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. and then shifting to core e&s pricing. you mentioned how the growth -- because allied health had a really good quarter a year ago, and so you gave kind of the corresponding growth figures.
would the story on kind of top-line pricing be similar, that if you excluded allied health, that i think it was a 3% number, would have been materially higher just because allied health had a head start?
bob myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. a little bit higher, matt, when you exclude it. although it sort of moves from like 3% to 3.5% when you look at the rest of the divisions. i guess a couple of things come to mind here.
first, we've been getting meaningful rate increases now for six quarters, and we are up 13% i think it was q1 a year ago, right? so we're now getting rate increases on top of rate increases. and i think we feel really good about the rate environment overall where the pricing is with the cumulative changes that we've got in the last six quarters. and to be specific around allied healthcare and the like, as you say, we have that difficult compare of the year ago, but in the subsequent quarters, in the rest of this year, for example, in allied healthcare, we don't really have that situation. so i think we're very optimistic about rate.
we're very optimistic about the growth prospects in terms of percentage-wise what that can be. and the submission flow, obviously, gives us tremendous amount of optimism as well.
matthew carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. and then one last question if i can, just around capital. kind of what's your current thinking on capital and operating leverage? i mean we've kind of shifted from what was a capital return story for many years to an environment where you're seeing some nice growth. and so just hoping you could update us on your views.
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks for the question on that, too. i think for right now, we're very happy with having moved away from the special dividend in the third quarter of last year. we're seeing great opportunities to put our capital to work.
so i think we continue with our above-peer 3% dividend yield and look to put as much of that to work as we can. i would expect that operating leverage might tick up a little bit from 1.42. we certainly have room to. but we're able to get to that 16.9% with that leverage, too.
so i think it's taking advantage of all the opportunities we're seeing come over the trends and especially in e&s right now.
matthew carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. great. thanks a lot for the answers.
bob myron -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you.
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from sean reitenbach of kbw. your line is now open.
sean reitenbach -- kbw -- analyst
good morning. going to the allied health division, was -- the drag on the growth, was it completely just a tough comparable? or was there any nonrenewal activity there or anything?
bob myron -- chief executive officer
well, it was a really tough comparable. that was a market that got really hard at the -- in q1 of last year and a substantial amount of flow from business come out of the admitted market. and that has sort of moderated as the year went on, i would guess, i would say, both in terms of flow and pricing, and the like. so that's really the reason and the answer.
sean reitenbach -- kbw -- analyst
ok. thank you. and then overall, on core e&s, do you guys feel comfortable with where rates are versus loss trend? or do you need another point or a couple of points to really feel comfortable or where's that at?
bob myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. so you know, the rates that we've gotten over the last six quarters are definitely outpacing the loss trend. i think that we -- it's a good question. we certainly do think about it that way, but i also think that we have been out seeking rate increases and achieving that for over that six-quarter period of time.
so it's also, you know, just what the market dynamic is and what the market will accept from a rate increase perspective. so i guess we're not specifically thinking about needing to get a certain rate to get over loss trend. we're thinking about optimizing the portfolio between putting nonprofitable business and getting compelling rates. and so we're going to continue to do that.
and i think we are optimistic that there is so much discussion in the marketplace from other carriers that are both in the e&s space and then the commercial line space as well that many lines of business, of course, excluding workers' compensation, there is a -- there's pretty strong momentum for continued price increases.
sean reitenbach -- kbw -- analyst
all right. thank you very much. and for the casualty reinsurance, is there anything that's driving the lower accident year loss pick? it looks like it's been consistently improving over the last five months at least, if not longer.
bob myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. another great question and the biggest thing is really just mix. when we pared the book down, for example, from '17 to '18 and now into '19, we really moved from -- a fair amount of what was not renewed was nonstandard auto business, which had a higher loss pick and a lower expense ratio or ceding commission associated with it. and this book going forward is almost all excess and surplus lines liability type of business, which has a lower loss pick and perhaps a slightly higher ceding commission.
one thing to remember about that loss pick is that the -- a piece of the lae expenses are included in the ceding commissions. so we don't -- we're not necessarily having to book a loss ratio that includes all of the lae. so -- but that's really the reason. it's mix.
it's moving to almost entire e&s -- entirely e&s liability business, and away from some other lines of business that had carried higher loss picks.
sean reitenbach -- kbw -- analyst
ok. thank you. that's helpful. and then finally, on the growing portfolio.
sarah, i know you said that it should slow down. but in terms of the growth of the portfolio, and it has been growing pretty -- at a good pace, and if that were -- happen to persist at all, would that change the trajectory of the tax rate movement as more investments come onshore at a faster pace maybe than what you guys are expecting?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
yeah. i don't know if the growth rate is going to necessarily impact the tax ratio -- tax rate. i think there are lot of things that play in the tax rate. the movement of assets onshore is one, but we still have the majority of our assets offshore.
so i don't think that's going to cause a change to that existing trajectory, if that makes sense. because i just wanted to make the point that our growth in operating cash flow is a down a little bit but will continue to grow clearly, just perhaps not at the prior rates, on that cash invested assets.
sean reitenbach -- kbw -- analyst
ok. thank you very much guys.
bob myron -- chief executive officer
thank you.
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from brian meredith of ubs. your line is now open.
seth rosenberg -- ubs -- analyst
hey, guys. seth here jumping in for brian. really appreciate the color on habitation. i thought the two examples are really interesting.
but it's a line that you certainly heard a lot of other companies talk about as challenging. and one of the large e&s wholesale brokers kind of highlighted it as the most problematic line and particularly with apartments. could you maybe give your perspective on why it's been a difficult line, and why you feel comfortable about writing it?
bob myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i think, we wouldn't put anything on the books without feeling like it's going to be profitable when we do. it's so -- and some of these are larger accounts, and so they're not necessarily decisions that are made based upon the individual underwriter at the desk. when they start to get larger, we start to look at individually pricing them using our actuarial staff and then involving segment leadership as well.
so i think we're looking at those really, really carefully. and i think it's an area that has -- more broadly has been written. i think the best answer i can give you, it's a high-level answer, you know, it's been written pretty broadly by the admitted market for a reasonably significant period of time. there hasn't been a lot of rate change with respect to it.
and i think you've just got meaningful loss creep there without a lot of rate change through the years. and now i think you're in a situation whereby it can't really be profitably written in the admitted market with a filed rate and form. whereas i think we have the ability to exclude certain perils, so to speak, and obviously write it with sort of full open market flexibility on how we price that. so we feel good about those risks when we're putting them on.
and so it's a typical thing that i think -- we're seeing a lot of flow here, and it doesn't seem -- seen any signs of abating. but i would just want to make sure you know that we very carefully underwrite these accounts in particular when they're larger. sarah, is there anything you'd like to add?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
no. i would just emphasize the point that you made before, when you're able to -- you want to take a hard look at something, you've got 100% opportunity for 100% price increase in a tighter form or a 68% price increase with client risk than it was when it was in the admitted market, that degree in a pricing perspective.
bob myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. and i think we saw a similar thing and have seen a similar thing. for example, something we talked about before in the chain restaurant area, so to speak, which is this is business that very typically and for long periods of time had been in the admitted market. but i think the nature of the risk changed somewhat in terms of the types of claims that were occurring when a lot of the restaurants move to more drive-through business and less sort of park and walk-in type of business.
and you had a lot more hot coffee spills on the lap and burns and sort of people getting hit walking through drive-through areas. so accidents in the parking lots so to speak. and that also was an area that admitted market has been challenged to write for certain accounts with filed rate and form. and we were receiving -- have received price increases per location for primary general liability policy that could be to two to three times what the expiring price was in the admitted market.
and now we've got a year's worth of claims activity underneath us, and we've renewed some of those businesses and have a good sense for how that's running and how we feel about the pricing.
seth rosenberg -- ubs -- analyst
got it. ok. that's a really -- that's a great answer. and then maybe this is too simplistic, but is there a way to think about terms and conditions sort of as a renewal pricing benefit? i mean, are tighter terms and conditions sort of like an additional point of value when you think about rate versus loss trend? or is that not a fair way to think about things?
bob myron -- chief executive officer
well, you know, there is -- i'm not going to be able to give an example -- perfect example. but one clear example obviously is a higher deductible or a deductible or a self-insured retention that didn't -- wasn't in place in the expiring policy and our underwriters look at from an increased limit factor perspective. even a small deductible on a primary insurance policy can have up -- if you will translate into that what would that mean from a rate increase perspective, those are substantial, those -- having those deductibles in place have to be able to have the insured in effect have to pay the small nuisance claims, so to speak. and so those are powerful as well.
sub limits on certain things are powerful as well. exclusions on certain types of risks. we're just talking to our claims person the other day, excluding things like high hazard type of activities in bars, restaurants and taverns, like mechanical bull machines and axe throwing areas and things like that. just coverage restrictions that -- we have the ability to basically manuscript that that can be really powerful.
and sometimes it is difficult to translate exactly into a rate change. probably the easiest thing, which is -- which would be done really by our underwriters is when you have a higher deductible and how that -- how you think about that from a rate perspective.
seth rosenberg -- ubs -- analyst
got it. ok. great. and then i think you said, six -- quoting -- or sorry, submissions were up 68,000.
how much of that business do you guys on quoting? is that -- and is that sort of limited by just your underwriting capacity? or is there a lot of business that you just pass on?
bob myron -- chief executive officer
well, so to be clear, we got 68 -- over 68,000 new and renewal submissions in the quarter, and that was up 17% year over year. so that wasn't the growth number. that was the actual number of submissions. and then i think the second part of your question was around, do we have the capacity to handle that? is that what you were getting at?
seth rosenberg -- ubs -- analyst
yeah. i mean, i mean when you think about submissions, how much of that business do you guys actually go after?
bob myron -- chief executive officer
well, yeah. so we go after a lot of it. i mean when you look at our -- generally, when you look at our statistics, these numbers float around a little bit. but you generally end up -- in excess and surplus lines, you generally end up writing plus or minus 60% of your renewal submissions.
and you generally end up quoting 30-some-odd-percent of the new submissions that come in. and then you end up ultimately -- for new business, you end up ultimately writing sort of 3% to 4% of those new submissions, right? so i mean those are kind of the statistics around it. i guess maybe the point that you're getting at is -- or maybe i should make a statement. all other things being equal, if our historical quote and hit rate stay the same, submission growth should turn into premium growth, which is perhaps where you're going with that.
seth rosenberg -- ubs -- analyst
yeah. it was, exactly. ok. great, guys.
thanks. appreciate all the answers.
bob myron -- chief executive officer
ok.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our next question comes from randy binner of b. riley fbr. your line is open.
randy binner -- b. riley fbr, inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning. so i mostly asked and answered. but i guess back to the commercial auto book. understanding kind of the claims discussion you've gone through and reserves more.
but from a -- i guess, from kind of like a real loss perspective and from a loss mitigation perspective, how is claims management going in that over book? there certainly was a concentration in florida in the '16 accident year. and there was issues there. but generally speaking, i know that that organization has called the number of drivers. they've introduced basic safety standards.
i think you all have been kind of investing more in claims. and so can you kind of dimension for us how the real loss activity in those vehicles has changed over the last kind of 12 to 18 months?
bob myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. so good question, randy. i would say that, yes, there's been a significant number of safety initiatives implemented by the insured, and part of that is definitely working to improve the driver pool based upon driver scoring, commentary that they get from riders, accidents and so on and so forth. so they have worked to improve the driver pool and in some instance, has been calling the driver pool in certain states in a number -- in all those ways i mentioned, and more, right? so that has resulted in some decreased level of frequency of claims.
and i think the other big thing really for us is we've talked a lot about florida for the year, that is a tough jurisdiction in particular with certain types of liability claims, um, uim and the like. and there are some other jurisdictions throughout the u.s. that had some tough point bar in the legal environment with respect to that. and we are -- we don't have as many of those states anymore.
and where we do, i think they're a very small percentage of the mileage. so i -- we feel like in terms of the 20 states and two territories that we have, there's a lot more stability in sort of the legal and litigation environment where we have liability claims in those states. so those are a couple of things. and then you made an allusion to something else as well in our claims staffing.
yes, this was a rapid growth -- a rapidly growing account with a rapid growth in mileage. and we still have the largest share of the mileage for uberx in the u.s. but we feel like we've got our feet on the ground in terms of claims headcount and claims resources, in terms of handling these claims well for the mileage that we've been allocated.
randy binner -- b. riley fbr, inc. -- analyst

good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the james river second-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this call is being recorded. i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, mr. kevin copeland, head of investor relations.
you may begin.
kevin copeland -- head of investor relations
thank you, skyler. good morning, everyone, and welcome to the james river group second-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. these statements are based on current beliefs, intentions, expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.
for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k, form 10-qs and other reports and filings we make with the securities and exchange commission. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. i will now turn the call over to bob myron, chief executive officer of james river group.
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
good morning, everyone, and welcome to james river's second-quarter 2019 investor call. i'm bob myron, and with me today are sarah doran, our cfo; kevin copeland, our cio and head of investor relations; and adam abram, who's shortly going to take over the ceo role again as i move back into the coo role. i'll spend some time today talking about our overall results for the quarter and also some specifics on each of our segments. i'll then turn the call over to sarah and adam, and they'll get to your questions.
we had a very good second quarter and first six months of the year. our underwriting results were strong with a 95.2% combined ratio across the group in the quarter. the highlight of the quarter is certainly our growth and pricing in our core e&s business. after a modest start in q1, our growth in q2 in core substantially exceeded our expectations with 81% growth in gross written premiums that we highlighted in our press release.
every division within our core e&s business segment grew, and we had $75 million of new business in core alone, which represented 49% of our core production in the quarter. our groupwide expense ratio of 21.3% continued to decline in this market-leading as we continue to carefully manage expenses and get great leverage out of our franchise. i am particularly pleased about growing tangible book value per share from $17.74 to $18.86 in the last three months, while at the same time, producing a great return on tangible equity and continuing to pay a dividend with a yield of about 2.5%. let me now talk about each of our three segments individually.
in our largest segment, e&s submissions were up 20% in the quarter year over year, up from 17% in q1. so submission flow continues to accelerate. this reflects the continued strong and growing u.s. economy; the excellent relationships we have with our whole brokers -- wholesale brokers; and lastly and most importantly, meaningful amounts of business flowing to us from other carriers in both the admitted market and the e&s market.
we're seeing other carriers do a variety of things, including not renewing accounts that have not performed well and/or have been underpriced -- underpriced, decreased line sizes and discontinue whole classes and lines of business. pricing on renewals was up 5.4% in the quarter on our core e&s business. but like last quarter, the renewal pricing doesn't tell the whole story. on new business, we are binding certain larger accounts with price increases that are three to five times expiring pricing and oftentimes with higher deductibles or self-insured retentions as well.
while the hardening market is broad, we are seeing the most traction in general casualty accounts, such as habitational risks, excess casualty across a number of different classes, manufacturers and contractors and energy. we are incredibly well positioned to capitalize on the current market conditions and we don't see it slowing down right now based upon preliminary indications of july production. as i mentioned the last quarter, we have a large and growing underwriting staff in the segment that is turning through the large and growing submission volume. our underwriting system is scalable and efficient.
also, in the quarter, we saw loss trends in core e&s as being fairly benign as the dollar amount of reported losses are down relative to a year ago at this time, which is notable given that we have -- now have a larger book of business. so we definitely see our rate increases and the rate we're getting outpacing the loss trend. now a few comments about our commercial auto division within e&s. in the quarter, commercial auto grew 33% for gross written premiums, but only 3% for net written premiums due to the quota share reinsurance contract that we placed behind us on the majority of this business.
during the quarter, changes in our reserve estimates resulted in approximately $25 million of loss reserves shifting from the 2018 accident year to the 2016 and '17 accident years. this was to address higher-than-expected loss emergence from the 2016 and 2017 accident years, while the 2018 accident year continues to run well and we feel good about where we're booking the 2019 accident year loss ratio in this line. it's worth reiterating the size of the years in question from the net written premium standpoint. 2018 written premium, commercial auto was nearly as large as 2016 and 2017 were combined, and 2019 will again be as large as 2018 was.
as we've mentioned in the past, we had a substantial rate increase in 2018 on our largest account in this line, and this price carried over to 2019. the change in reserve estimates between accident years caused the tax rate in the quarter to be higher than our run rate. i'll let sarah elaborate in our prepared remarks on this. when we look at the e&s segment, we are comfortable with our loss reserves.
as we've said before, we are making higher accident year loss picks in our core e&s business in 2019 than we did in 2018 and 2017, even though we've had nine consecutive quarters of rate increases, many of which have been above loss trends. in our specialty admitted segment, our top line was down 8%, but i believe that this is temporary and we can and will resume growth in the future. the decline was principally from a 35% decrease in gross written premiums in our largest program, atlas, year over year. this is due to rate declines in california workers' comp, as well as writing a few less classes of business than we did a year ago, where such classes have not met our profitability expectation.
the account continues to run very well, specifically in terms of loss emergence relative to our expectations. in our individual risk workers' comp book, we grew our gross written premium by 25% in the quarter. submissions were up 41% in individual risk workers' compensation business, which reflects strong agency relationships, continued economic growth and continued modest expansion into a few other states. rates were down about 7.8% in individual risk workers' comp, but loss cost continue to be benign and, as a result, we didn't see a decline in margin.
this was because of new front deals that were not on -- i'm sorry, in our fronting division, outside of the atlas relationship, we grew gross written premiums by 37%, this was because of new fronted deals that were not on the books a year ago. we are continuing to grow, in both count and premium, other fronting transactions. as mentioned in our last quarterly call, in q2, we wrote two new property transaction that we expect will deliver more than $2 million in fee income per annum. however, given when they incepted a natural border rollags, we didn't book much of these into fee income in q2.
we also bound a new garage and car dealers program, effective july 1, that is expected to have an annual run rate of more than $50 million of gross written premium. otherwise, the pipeline remains robust, and we have several other meaningful deals that we hope to bind in the coming months. in our casualty re segment, we did have a modest amount of adverse development in the quarter from types and classes of reinsurance that the company no longer writes, which resulted in 100.3% combined ratio in the quarter. the top line continues to be in line with our expectations, with only a modest amount of growth for the year.
the book is expected to be over 90% e&s casualty business in 2019, and we feel great about the business we have put on the books in the last several years. we saw some meaningful price increases in the underlying business this quarter, just like we did in our core e&s segment. in casualty re, the underlying business saw rate increases of about 5.5%, and we got a 1.2% increase in reinsurance pricing. with that, let me turn the call over to sarah.
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
thanks, bob, and good morning, everyone. for the second quarter of 2019, we made strong underwriting profits of $9.6 million, generated an operating profit of $20.2 million, and we're reporting net income of $20.3 million. our expense ratio of 21.3% is an improvement of 1.8 points from the prior-year quarter. the improvement is due to mix and where we have concentrated our growth efforts this year.
net earned premium grew almost 9% in our e&s segment this quarter, and premium in our third-party reinsurance business has continued to shrink. the e&s segment represented over 75% of our group net earned premiums. this proportion increased again from the sequential quarter. this segment has considerable scale and, this quarter, it also benefited from a reduced net commission expense from external reinsurance.
we continue to enjoy strong cash flow from our businesses as operating cash flow was $32.7 million this quarter and $68.1 million year-to-date. this is down year over year due to the shrinkage of our casualty re segment and the time lag as we earn in the most recent growth from our e&s segment in future quarters. the investment portfolio performed as we expected this quarter as we earned $17.5 million in net investment income, an increase of 9% from the prior-year quarter, largely in line with the growth of our portfolio. while this is down from the sequential quarter, the difference is due to the outperformance of our renewable energy and other private investment portfolios during the first quarter of this year.
those two parts of our portfolio are generally more susceptible to greater market volatility. once again, one of our strongest highlights is that we grew tangible equity per share before dividend, 8% from a quarter ago and 19.1% this year, while also delivering an annualized adjusted net operating return on average tangible equity of 15.7% year-to-date. we ended the quarter with tangible shareholders' equity of $572 million. operating leverage, our trailing 12 months net premiums written to tangible equity, was 1.42:1, equal to where it was last quarter and down meaningfully from this time last year.
our ability to generate strong tangible book value growth and a high rote is very important to us and shows we have great opportunities to put our capital to work. and finally, on taxes. our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6%. as a reminder, our internal quota share treaty was not seeded to a u.s.
taxpayer until january of 2018. this quarter, we had $25 million of favorable development from the 2018 accident year, which was largely offset by adverse development in the 2016 and 2017 years. as the internal quota share treaty was not seeded to a u.s. taxpayer in 2016 and '17, but was in 2018, this contributed to the increase in our effective tax rate.
but at this time, we expect the 2019 rate to likely be close to the year-to-date range of 14.7%. lastly, i know i speak for my colleagues when i express my admiration and thanks for bob's strategic insight, leadership and collaboration these last 18 months. he's led us on a path of success, and we look forward to more ahead, and we're very excited to welcome adam back as our ceo. so with that, i'll turn over the call to adam abram for a few comments.
adam?
adam abram -- incoming chief executive officer
thank you, sarah. thank you, bob. james river is a strong company with terrific leaders and people, and it has always been a joy to be a part of it. bob and sarah and the other leaders of our company have us in a great position.
our growth and our strong earnings reflect their scope of leadership. and i'd like to thank bob for the wonderful job he's done as ceo over the last 18 months or so. and bob, sarah and i have worked together before, it's a very comfortable and effective arrangement, and i'm looking forward to being back and more integral member of the team. as always, we're going to be focused on protecting our insured clients, growing the company while maintaining underwriting discipline, innovating to adapt to a changing economy and continuing to deliver strong returns on equity for our shareholders.
and with that, i think we're ready for your questions. thank you, everybody. operator, could you please open the lines for questions? thank you.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from randy binner with b. riley fbr. your line is open.
randy binner -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
good morning. thank you. i wanted to ask a couple about the commercial auto book to start. so with the adverse development in the prior accident years, so '16 and '17, can you characterize kind of what changed from a claims management perspective that caused the revision?
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
yes. i don't think that there was a lot that changed, randy. i think we just had, in the quarter, we had higher-than-expected loss emergence. i think, in 2016, it was from places where we've had it before and with an emphasis on florida.
and i think, 2017, it was just a little bit broader and so it really wasn't -- it really wasn't any more than that. i think that it's important to emphasize, like i did in the prepared remarks, that we do have a substantially increased pricing on the '18 and '19 years, which are combined total about $600 million, and expect to build up the $600 million in net written premium. so when we look at the aggregate performance of the commercial auto book, we feel fine.
randy binner -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
and then on the loss pick for commercial auto, i think if we look at e&s, the core e&s business has kind of seen higher loss picks, in general, to reflect the risk reward around that environment and then i presume that uber pick is lower. can you size -- is that correct and can you size kind of the change in the loss pick around the commercial auto book in 2019?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
no, our -- we still have our original pick up there and it's commensurately higher than certainly where '18 is right now, randy. so we have a fair amount of, we think, conservatism in that loss pick, obviously, adjusting for what bob has said in terms of pricing, the pricing increase that we got beginning in 2018.
randy binner -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
ok. and then i just had one on the investment income, understanding that the -- i guess the alternatives were kind of within their normal band of volatility in the quarter. but on the core fixed income book. where -- i guess where are you seeing new money yields and how are -- we're seeing a lot -- i cover a lot of insurance companies, and we're seeing a lot of yield pressure, obviously, in what can be deployed.
so where is that for you all now and where do you expect to be able to put money to work in 2019?
kevin copeland -- head of investor relations
randy, it's kevin here. so, yes, we've seen an increase in the net investment income from that core portfolio, and that's really due to growth in the size of the portfolio, rather than changing yields. but to answer your question, market yields are about 40 basis points below our average book yield right now. so the duration of the portfolio is about three and a half years, so that will -- if rates stay where they are now, it will kind of slowly work its way into the portfolio as we reinvest maturities.
randy binner -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
and then just from a new money yield perspective, do you have a blended core fixed income new money yield as of today?
kevin copeland -- head of investor relations
just for the core book?
randy binner -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
yes.
kevin copeland -- head of investor relations
i don't have that -- i don't have that number, but i can tell you, it's about 40 to 45 basis points lower than what we have right now. we'll follow that one up -- we'll probably follow that up with you. sure.
randy binner -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from matthew carletti with jmp.
matthew carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
thanks. just a follow-up on randy's commercial auto question. any chance you can give us, after all the moving pieces at june 30, where commercial auto accident year developed loss picks are, '16 through '19, so we can get a feel for the progression?
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
yes, matt, that's not something that we -- that's not something that we've broken out sort of quarter by quarter. just because a lot of it relates to, among other things, a particular client. but, no, we -- it's not something that we've broken out from a this-quarter standpoint.
matthew carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. i'll shift to casualty re. so if i look at that segment, the accident-year results have improved substantially, low-90s combined ratio, since you got out of those new lines of business, kind of risk you aren't writing anymore, a little while back. but we keep taking small level of average development on those risks.
so my question is, can you help us get a feel for where you believe we are in the tail of those older risks that we keep taking development on and when we might be able to expect that they're substantially kind of developed?
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
yes. so it's been several years since we moved -- moved the book substantially to more excess and surplus lines, general liability and proportional, and i think where we've seen some of this adverse development was on when we had a larger proportion of the book in our excess treaties, and where we had a little bit of more traditional commercial auto in there and some nonstandard auto business as well. and at this point in time, that's a few years behind us, and so we're seeing very good trends in our loss of merchants from the more recent years. so it feels like we're pretty far along on that, to be honest with you.
i think that from a practical standpoint, unfortunately, sometimes what you get is the reported loss from 2012 and 2013 on the excess book. and that claim, you sort of had -- didn't have a provisional notice of loss of and it's a material amount. and you don't have much ibnr up on that year or that line of business for that specific treaty, and you have to react to it, right? but i think -- and excess is naturally going to have a longer tail than the proportional stuff does. and so -- but it's been -- where -- this is several years behind us now, and we feel much, much better about the more recent years, in particular, the structure of them being -- the line of business, the fact that they're -- so much of it is proportional and just the stability we're seeing in the underlying loss of merchants.
matthew carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok, great. and then one more, if i can, just on capital. how do you feel about your capital position? and i asked this in light of kind of how you characterize stronger-than-expected growth in core e&s, it seems like it's continuing and kind of the -- as you described, the puzzle pieces in place that i don't think we should expect it to abate in the near term. do you feel that you have kind of the capital to support that growth or is it a little tighter?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
no. it's a -- thank you for asking that question. we feel really good about our capital position. as you know, we had to pause the special dividend a little while ago, and moving our operating leverage to 1.4 times gives us a lot of room to run in terms of supporting the growth in core e&s.
so as we earn that in and as we look ahead and see very strong conditions in that business, at least in the immediacy, we think we're really well positioned to keep doing that. right now, within our e&s segment, it's 60% core and 40% commercial auto. we ended the year of 2018, 50-50, so we're here to take advantage of that market and to ideally just reduce our reliance on commercial auto as well.
matthew carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thank you for the color. bob, best wishes for a speedy recovery, and adam, welcome back.
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from mark hughes with suntrust. your line is now open.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thank you. good morning. on the growth in the core book, i wonder if you could talk about your success. submissions were up 20%.
clearly, your hit rate was a lot better. could you talk about your capacity to effectively underwrite that much more new business and maybe touch on average policy size, were you finding success moving up market a little bit, perhaps?
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
yes, that's a great question. and so, yes, i think the hit ratios are up a little bit. the other thing is that the average premium size is up a little bit as well. i think we're -- when i looked at the report, we're around 23,000, and we've sort of been around '19 or '20 or '21 or so.
and so that's up -- that is up 15 -- 10% to 15% or so mark and that definitely is being driven by the fact that we are seeing some larger accounts and that we are -- are often times, we're doing a lot of individual pricing work on, and i think we're getting very, very good pricing relative to the underlying expected loss cost and then the technical pricing level. what do we work up when we do the actual work up on those individual accounts. so i think it's a -- renewal retentions are holding, hit-rate ratio and new is improving a bit. and the average account size is going up a little bit, but we are perfectly comfortable with it because we're not writing anything that we don't have expertise in to be able to do, and we are still only -- even if it's a larger account, we're still only taking $1 million net, basically, whether that's the policy limited effect or whether we're reinsuring down to that level of the excess treaties that we have in place.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
is there more property in the recent growth?
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
we have seen a little bit of growth in property and we've also seen pricing increases in property as well. i think they've grown a little bit -- book a little bit because as a lot of -- we don't have a big book of that. i mean it's approximately -- the run rate on that is approximately $15 million or $20 million, and it's excess only. i think as we've seen capacity shortages across the competitive landscape, our team has stepped into that a little bit more and written a little bit more of that.
and we've also seen pricing increases there of, sort of, 10-ish, so to speak. so meaningfully higher on renewals, higher than it was -- has been on our casualty business. so they have written a little bit more of that. i think the last thing, though, that i would say is that we heavily reinsured that business, just a reminder to everybody.
we have -- we buy facultative reinsurance, we have a surplus share treaty in place, and then, of course, we have a very -- a catastrophe treaty that reinsures that to a very high-return period. so they're being opportunistic there and -- but i don't think it's adding a tremendous amount of additional volatility to us.
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
no, the only thing i'd add to that is it's growing, and it's growing, but it's in proportion to the rest of the book. so it's not outweighing the mix in the e&s book. so...
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
yes. right, that's right. that's a very good point.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
understood. a final question on the reinsurance segment. just longer term, what should we think about your posture there? if you're seeing very good growth in e&s and maybe you want some more capital? what's your latest thinking about what to do with reinsurance?
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
are you talking about from a production and/or growth perspective? is that what you're getting at?
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
or the opposite, perhaps? yes.
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
yes, i think no real plans for any significant change there, all right? we still only expect to be flat or grow modestly in core -- in our casualty re segment. and we like the underlying terms and conditions, we like the pricing. but as i'm sure you know, this business, on a planned basis, on a budgeted basis, generally has the highest expected combined ratio in the group, right? so we don't -- our team is doing a great job. they're actually being -- they're getting lot of swings and a lot of different opportunities and really carefully picking their spots.
i don't -- but because of the fact that we have an expectation of writing to a lower combined ratio in the two u.s. segments. that's where we're focusing our capital. we don't have an expectation right now of strategically shrinking the casualty re book of business right now.
we're just trying to grow in the u.s. and hold steady, hold firm on casualty re.
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
[inaudible]
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
yes.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
very good. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from meyer shields with kbw. your line is now open.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
great. thanks. i'm going to start by wishing bob the best and saying, adam, glad you're back. sorry, this is why -- thank you.
bob, can you talk a little bit about the claims staffing strategy, given the really strong growth we're seeing in e&s?
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
yes, absolutely. we've significant -- first of all, we've significantly increased underwriting headcount in the last six months in our various offices, i sort of rolled through it in last-quarter's prepared remarks, we have underwriters in richmond, virginia, outside of atlanta and alpharetta, georgia and scottsdale, arizona. we have some people working in, remotely, from home. we may be shortly having a person or two in houston.
and so we are actively looking to -- we've hired a lot, and we're actively looking to hire more underwriting staff to continue to turn through the submission growth. and then, i think, from a claims perspective, we feel like with the -- i'll start with core. someone is asking a good question the other day about this. with a lot of core growth, you don't necessarily see a -- with core e&s growth, given that it's generally higher severity, lower frequency, you don't see a big and immediate need in claims staffing, but we do have about 40 people who handle core claims and then there's about 300 folks that handle the commercial auto claims.
and i think we feel that both of those are well staffed right now. and particularly -- and also because we've had, of course, a mild state decline with our largest client. and so i think we feel very well staffed to handle volume of underwriting submissions, as well as claims. and sarah, is there anything you would add to that?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
no. that's very comprehensive. that's great.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
ok. yes, that's helpful. that's what i was looking for. two quick questions for sarah, if i can.
one, so, in general, i guess, before this quarter, there was the expectation that the tax rate would slowly drift up sort of year after year as less -- premium-less asset flow or small assets flowed to bermuda. should we assume that this -- that the 2019 tax rate is a little above average, so that 2020 should be a little bit lower?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
that would be my assumption there, thank you for the question, being above average because of the reserve move that we mentioned. so i think of a low single-digit -- low double-digit tax rate absent these moves. so if that picks up slightly, that would still be kind of behind a mid-teens tax rate. so we're a little bit ahead of that.
i would expect that to be lower in future years absent these changes.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
ok. fantastic. and then, finally, within casualty reinsurance. so we have the net reserve development, i'm wondering, are there any offsetting leases on more recent accident years or is the net number really all that you're seeing?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
no, we had some offsets on that as well in some of the more seniors in casualty re, but there...
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
all of that was modest.
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
yes. but there was -- i was just going to say, there wasn't much in terms of that, but it wasn't just the adverse number.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
ok. thanks so much.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from brian meredith with ubs. your line is now open.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. good morning. a couple of quick questions here for you. sarah, i'm just curious, could -- going back to the commercial auto adverse reserve development, is it possible to give us what the adverse development was in the '16 and '17 year and then the favorable on the '18 year?
bob myron -- outgoing chief executive officer
well, the favorable in the '18 year was the 25 that i mentioned, and then that got allocated to '16 and '17, and then the majority of it went to '17.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you, majority '17. great. and then my next question, just curious, as the mix of business shifts within your e&s segment to more and more of your core business, is that what we should see kind of driving your, call it, underlying combined ratios down? and i could imagine your core e&s carries a better underwriting margin than the commercial auto business.
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
that's fair. yes, brian.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and then also within that, should we also expect maybe sort of loss ratios trending downwards or expense ratios will probably kind of stabilize a little bit or move up?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
i think that's pretty reasonable. i'm not seeing a reason for them to move up right now, but it is -- there is more expense on the core business and there is in the commercial auto business.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. got you. excellent. thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the james river third-quarter 2019 results conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speakers today, kevin copeland, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
kevin copeland -- head of investor relations
thank you, danielle. good morning, everyone, and welcome to the james river group third-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. these statements are based on current beliefs, intentions, expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.
for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k, form 10-qs and other reports and filings we make with the securities and exchange commission. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. i will now turn the call over to adam abram, chief executive officer of james river group.
adam abram -- chief executive officer
thanks so much, kevin, and good morning, everybody. sarah doran, bob myron and i are all here together. and before i turn the call to sarah, i have a few comments about the loss we reported this quarter and our decision to walk away from our largest account. i think those of you who have followed us for a while know that we pride ourselves in our underwriting standards, and this loss, which is driven by the lack of profitability on the uber account is not acceptable to us.
we decided that it is not in the long-term interest of our company and our stakeholders to continue our contract with uber. in 17 years, since we founded james river, we've made underwriting profits in all but two years, and we've never reported a loss of this magnitude before. we've canceled the account and after taking a reserve charge, we expect to resume producing low double-digit annual returns on tangible equity in 2020. in uber, we wrote a new type of risk that initially seem to be highly profitable based on the data available to us, but uber's business and the underlying risk evolved very quickly.
our underwriting assumptions and the related pricing did not keep pace with changes in uber's business. uber created a new transportation model that altered the american transport and presented new challenges and opportunities for the insurance industries. the risk associated with this model shifted as the company expanded into new regions, added tens of thousands of drivers and evolved beyond just ride hailing. all of these factors created a situation where the risk became too large in absolute terms given the size of our company.
and candidly, in some years, we mispriced the risk. having said that, we're comfortable with our pricing for the 2018 and 2019 years. in response to poor results in 2016 and 2017, we negotiated substantial pricing increase for the contract on the 2018 renewal and renewed at similar rates for the 2019 renewal. we also purchased a quota share reinsurance contract for the third -- for a third of the account for the first time in 2019.
however, profits we anticipate earning in these last two years will not fully offset losses from prior years. we decided to cancel this year, even though we believe the risk is well-priced because of further complications related to the passage of assembly bill 5, or ab 5, as it's known, in the state of california. we believe ab 5 will adversely alter the claims profile for rideshare companies. in 2019, our pricing had not anticipated ab 5, hence our concern.
the legislation becomes effective two months before our policies would have naturally expired. when we canceled the account, we also drew upon the collateral established to pay the portion of claims costs retained by our client. the $1.2 billion in that trust account is now on our balance sheet and may be used to pay our former clients share of any claims as they arise. the funds are invested in short-term treasuries and the interest earned will accrue to our benefit.
while that does not reduce our loss ratio, the investment earnings will somewhat mitigate the effect of the losses we have reported. last night, after we released earnings, uber sent a note asking the collateral be redeposited within the trust. we're confident that we've handled the trust appropriately and do not intend to redeposit the funds. we expect to process approximately 18,500 claims during the runoff of this book of business.
we're well staffed to handle these claims and are committed to handling them expeditiously and properly. in the end, i'd say the uber account was a diversion from the steady engine that is always propelled our company, highly profitable underwriting of small and middle market risk, and that business is performing very, very well, in line with or ahead of our expectations. we decided to reset our focus on the many positives in our core e&s business and attractive growth opportunities we continue to see there and in our specialty admitted segment and to start the new year, focused on those opportunities. during the past quarter, our core e&s, our excess and surplus lines business, meaning our james river e&s business other than commercial auto, grew by 72% compared to the same period a year ago.
rates in this segment have gone up for 10 quarters in a row and increased 3.2% in the third quarter and were up 6.5% if we exclude one large renewal of a profitable account. we wrote $133 million in core e&s this quarter and are on a pace to write approximately $500 million in core e&s this year. the growth in our core e&s business is very, very strong. submissions through the first 3 quarters of this year are up by 22% compared to the first three quarters of last 2018.
the pace is accelerating. submissions in the third quarter were up 29%. we're continuing to book the current year at or above a 70% loss in lae ratio, and long-term observers of our company know, our e&s book has historically developed at significantly lower loss ratios than 70%. pricing is excellent.
a couple of anecdotes will give you a flavor for parts of our market. liability for habitational risks have seen very large rate increases. we recently wrote an e&s liability, excess liability policy, on a california apartment complex, where we reduced the limit by 50% from the expiring limit and increased the rate by over 500%. a similar example from the east coast, where we write the primary layer.
our premium was almost 400% of expiring premium with substantial supplements for assault and battery, water damage and even an absolute dog bite exclusion. this illustrates that, right now, in truing the e&s business, there is an opportunity for improved pricing and more favorable terms and conditions. and because these are new accounts to us and not in the renewal, these increases aren't incorporated in our rate increase information that i was quoting to you before. in our allied health division, we're seeing real strength in the smaller nursing home assisted living area.
larger facilities have not yet seen rate increases, but in september, we wrote multiple smaller accounts and increases exceeding 50%. we have not yet seen significant increases in construction-related accounts. our specialty admitted business, turning to that, also had a very good quarter, growing slightly compared to a year ago and reporting a 94.1% combined ratio. we believe our fronting business in this segment has great potential to deliver high returns on equity, while taking only moderate underwriting risk.
underwriting profits from the specialty admitted unit were $837,000 for the quarter, and we're just starting there. new leadership in our specialty admitted segment has signed four new fronting deals we anticipate will bring in over $50 million in gross premiums annually. so because of the fundamental strengths of our company, i expect going forward that we will deliver a low double-digit return on tangible -- average tangible equity. and before we get into your questions, i know we'd benefit from having additional insight from sarah doran, our chief financial officer.
sarah?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
thanks, adam. let me highlight a few of the financial points from the quarter. net earned premium grew over 16% in our e&s segment this quarter and 30% in our core e&s business alone. year to date, core e&s premium is up 20%.
core e&s earned premium is up 20%. this quarter, the e&s segment represented over 77% of our total group net earned premiums. starting in january of 2020, core e&s will be the majority of our group's earned premium as the large commercial auto account will roll-off by the end of this year. thinking about core e&s on its own, as adam mentioned, we're booking loss ratios at above a 70% loss in lae ratio.
the expense and commission ratio for this business is in the mid- to high 20s. as we've mentioned previously, we are getting strong rate in our core e&s lines. given our strong pricing and our historical results in core e&s, we expect this business will generate very attractive returns. let me take a moment to provide some additional color on the adverse development we experienced this quarter.
we had adverse development of $57 million overall. we had $50 million of adverse development in the uber book, most of which was focused on the 2017 underwriting year, with the balance in the 2016 underwriting year. this recent quarter, we had losses in excess of expected for the 2016 and 2017 years, but we did not see this for the more recent 2018 and 2019 years, so we took no action there. and as adam mentioned earlier, and we've mentioned before, in 2018, we raised rates on this account significantly.
we also had adverse development of about $8 million in our casualty reinsurance book, driven by much higher-than-average claims volumes in the quarter related to several accident years. we had $1 million of favorable development from our individual risk workers' compensation book. turning back to cash flow. we continue to enjoy strong cash flow from our businesses as operating cash flow was $145.7 million in the quarter alone and $213.8 million year to date.
third quarter cash flow is up materially over that of the first two quarters of this year, given the strong growth in core e&s, gross written premium, which is up 51% year to date on its own. the investment portfolio performed as we expected this quarter, as we earned $17.9 million in net investment income, an increase of 9% from the prior year quarter, largely in line with the growth of our portfolio. more notably, as adam mentioned, subsequent to delivering the early cancellation to our clients on october 9, we brought approximately $1.2 billion of assets on to our balance sheet from a collateralized trust, which uber has posted for our benefit. these funds are invested in short-term government securities and now will earn additional net investment income for us.
the collateral secured claims payments for the portion of the risk that we effectively fronted for our now former client, not for our own booked reserves. we are entitled to ask for additional collateral should that prove necessary. so through the first 6 months of the year, we've grown our book value by about $82 million or over 16%. while the loss this quarter is a setback, we still increased tangible equity over 12% year to date despite paying almost $30 million in dividends through the first three quarters of the year, given our healthy 3.6% yield.
our balance sheet and capital position are well able to support the attractive growth that we continue to see in our core e&s business and additional opportunities for growth we are realizing in the specialty admitted segment. we expect that our casualty reinsurance business will largely remain at similar premium volumes to what it has over the last year or so. so while it's too early for us to provide guidance on 2020, i will echo what adam said and that our opportunities to put capital to work at attractive returns for our shareholders are plentiful. while our top line will likely be down modestly from 2020 -- in 2020 from where we end 2019, our core e&s business has typically produced a lower developed combined ratio then as our commercial auto book, building a case for a compelling groupwide combined ratio.
we will actively and carefully manage expenses over the next few quarters as we work to runoff the bulk of the commercial auto book. and with that, i'll turn the call back to adam.
adam abram -- chief executive officer
thank you, sarah. operator, do we have questions?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from matt carletti from jmp securities. your line is now open. please go ahead.
matt carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning. if i could maybe just a couple questions to start on the commercial auto reserve charge. for starters, can you give us a little bit of color behind the scenes in terms of what changed with the reserve charge this quarter? are you at a different point in terms of kind of your confidence level in the reserving numbers? have you gone higher toward the top end of kind of the actuarial range as a percentage of ibnr increased? can you help us understand how the reserve picture sits today versus a quarter or two ago?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
sure, matt. this is sarah. i think i would say, first of all, we have fairly standard practices and procedures around this, and we follow the same that we do every quarter and that we're looking at this book with monthly actuarial data and then we're doing a deep dive every single quarter. and what we reacted to was losses in excess of expected in this quarter.
we put up the number that i think was demanding of that. and we're certainly watching it very carefully and very closely, especially around claims and further development and behavior of that, but we feel that we have put up a number that is in response well and response to the data that we saw that we were presented with, and that's where we got to this quarter. as i mentioned, more of that was concentrated on the '17 year, then on the '16 year. we're clearly closer to the end of the '16 year, just from a timing perspective than we would have been at the beginning of the year.
matt carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. and then maybe can you remind us a little bit of some of the -- either the broad pricing changes or underlying exposure, state footprint changes, how '17 might be different than '16 on a underlying basis?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
sure. i mean, i think -- and that's a great question. a big piece of moving from '16 to '17 was that we took a smaller share. i think we've mentioned this publicly before of florida, and we mentioned florida as being an outsized contributor from an underinsured and uninsured motorist perspective, and that causing some issues with regard to '16.
now clearly, we, in retrospect, have underpriced '17 from the reserve additions that we're making this quarter. but we have less exposure to that state in '17 than we did in '16. we did have a pricing increase from '16 to '17, but as adam mentioned, much more material pricing increase from '17 into '18, and i think that really provides a significant amount of the basis for our comfort in '18 and then '19.
matt carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. and then i'll stop beating the reserve question here, just one more. have you considered, would you consider, are you considering an adc on that book or some other form of reinsurance protection or transaction that would kind of put it out of investors minds for good?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
we certainly realize the value that something like that could provide for exactly as you said it, for putting it to the side from an investor, and certainly from our perspective. and those are options that we look at every day in our business with regard to this business, with regard to other options. soft capital options that could make sense. i think they need to make sense economically for us, and they're not simple transactions, but they're absolutely things that we would and should be considering, for sure.
matt carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. and one last one, if i can, on the reserves. you mentioned -- can you help us understand kind of how that e&s segment maybe will look different in -- and i know 2020 will be bit of a transition year and then longer term in terms of loss ratio expense ratio mix. i heard you mention kind of mid- to high 20s expense ratio, historically, where the core e&s has run.
but i would imagine maybe it runs a little higher initially as you still have the commercial auto tpa business, all the 18,500 claims kind of in runoff. so can you help us at least directionally understand kind of how that split will look as we move forward?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
that's a great question. and we are still working through -- i'll maybe take a stab at it and then let adam come in at the end. we're still working through kind of the fine point on our 2020 plan. but what i would say is that we'll probably carry a little bit of additional expense into the beginning of the year, but we'll have worked our way out of that, certainly, by the end of the year.
so i'm comfortable with that mid- to high 20s expense ratio on the core e&s business for all of 2020. i would say it would be at the low end of that once we work our way out of all of the additional expense related to the business and managing that -- those runoff claims because we -- just to reinforce, we do not expect to have any premiums coming in from that large account in 2020. but i think what's most important there is that we work our way out of the claims, and we come to a good reserve results, then we're ok to carry a little bit of additional expense in the beginning with the big picture to come to a good landing. adam, is there more you'd add to that?
adam abram -- chief executive officer
no. it's just that -- i think you can get a good feel for how this book will look if you go back and look prior to our taking on the uber account at our e&s business. for years, that business has run at a loss in ale ratio hovering around 60. and we've been able to run that business, as sarah said, well below 30 in the mid-25% to 28% expense ratio.
so that's where i would expect this book to settle out once we move through all the other, what i will now call, noise, i mean because it's stuff we're rolling off.
matt carletti -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. well, thank you for the answers, and best of luck going forward.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from mark hughes from suntrust. your line is now open. please go ahead.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much. good morning. adam, the underwriting expenses in e&s kind of the mid- to high 20s, what sort of corporate expense would you have on top of that? i think you break that out in your earnings report.
if i'm looking at it properly, the other operating expenses, corporate and other $7 million last quarter. do we have the kind of mid- to 20 -- mid- to high 20s e&s expense load and then the corporate on top of that?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
yeah. we -- yeah, so excuse me, matt. when i say mid- to high 20s, that's just the e&s -- the core e&s expense ratio. we do have the ongoing corporate expense, which is roughly $7 million and change a quarter, and then we've got the expense ratios in the other segments that we wouldn't expect to change materially.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
very good. and then the -- when you think about the core e&s, and if you point out how you usually book it at 70, and then it develops favorably over time. as we think about 2020, the pace of development, i think it's all been -- you're kind of caught up in the issues with uber this last year or two, and so it's been harder to get a look at what's going on in the core e&s. can you say anything about either the pace of development in the core e&s as it's been recently? or is it likely to be -- at least in the near term, i know that's something that's difficult to predict or provide guidance on, but just sort of -- probably think how the model looks at least in the near term with respect to those moving pieces?
adam abram -- chief executive officer
we were booking. and sarah, you'll correct me, i hope here, but we started booking the e&s business at a 70 in '18. and so we have the benefit of the '18 year, which is already developing some maturity and we get more insight into that as it goes on. but typically, i mean, we don't have a script here about how we bring them reserves.
we look at the actual case reserves and we look at on our ibnr and measure the pace of claims and make a judgment that's historically well informed judgment. and it starts a couple years after we write the business, you'll start to see those reserves rolling to earnings as appropriate.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
very good. and then just two others, if i may. the $1.2 billion, why -- if it was available and you could begin generating investment income. why -- just economically speaking, why wouldn't you have done it sooner than you did here? what was the kind of the dynamic on the -- timing on the decision process?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
it's just -- it's a standard trustmark, and we felt that we were making a change and by canceling the account, we just -- we felt like we wanted to be as secure as we could be in the moment. and we made the decision to draw on the funds commensurate with the early cancellation of the account, just out of an abundance of caution.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
is there -- is that what triggers if this is some sort of -- you have to make a case that there is a reason to take the assets, and then it becomes -- yeah, go ahead.
adam abram -- chief executive officer
mark, no, there is no case that needs to be made. but i don't -- look, this is an account with the client we had for quite some time. and i don't really want to get us into a lot of specifics about the account, but this is a very standard arrangement across the industry, any insurer who enters into one of these standard agreements can at any time typically draw down that trust. our policy was, we have canceled the policy, we're putting this book into runoff.
we thought carefully about our situation and made the choice that we thought was the appropriate choice.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
and then the ab 5, you say that -- you think that may adversely alter the claims profile for ridesharing. could you expand on that a little bit?
adam abram -- chief executive officer
well, look, there's been an awful lot written about that by a lot of experts, but obviously, it's something that we did not price for. nobody -- we didn't price for ab 5, and it was a change, and we think it's a material change. and so having experienced many different changes in the course of this relationship that affected losses, we thought this was the right thing for us to do. this was not incorporated in our pricing.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and your next question comes from meyer shields from kbw. your line is now open. please go ahead.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
great. thanks so much. so just a few, hopefully, quick questions. i'm trying to understand -- or let me ask this as a question.
given the significant rate increases embedded in both new and renewal core e&s, should we assume that 2020 could be booked to something below 70% initially? or is that roughly a good initial guide with favorable experience we reported later?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
we're not far along there, meyer, to have a materially different view on the market. so in the absence of new data in the beginning of november, i do think about that loss ratio, that 70% accident year as being a reasonable assumption.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
ok. that is perfect. is this -- can you give us a sense of the time line for paying down the $1.2 billion of claims related collateral? in other words, how long that will be augmenting investment income?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
yeah. that's very hard to tell because there are a lot of assumptions around claims payments and kind of future, i guess, interaction as well. so i think in the absence of that, i would just assume that it's $1.2 billion over the next year.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
ok. perfect. does the fronting arrangement in casualty reinsurance provide ceding commissions to be earned in coming quarters? was that all booked in the third quarter?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
no. that will come over the next few quarters. good question.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
ok. and then one last question, if i can, on the uber reserves. i guess the one question that i'm hearing is that since you've had sort of late adverse experience on accident year '16 and '17, how do you have comfort that that won't materialize later on in the more recent accident years, even in the context of the current improved underwriting performance?
adam abram -- chief executive officer
i think the biggest buffer against that is a very, very substantial price increase that we got in the '18-'19 year.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
does that preclude later development of claims for later emerging information?
adam abram -- chief executive officer
no. it doesn't preclude later emergence of things, but we are -- we just aren't seeing that right now. look, we're not seeing that kind of emergence right now.
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
where is it? i think we were at earlier points of prior years.
adam abram -- chief executive officer
yes.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
ok. understood. ok. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and your next question comes from brian meredith from ubs. your line is now open. please go ahead.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
yes. thanks. one quick one and one maybe a little bit longer. the first one, sarah, what kind of yield should we assume on those short-term funds?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
it's a money market treasury -- t-bill-type yield there, brian. [inaudible]
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
immaterial. ok. great. and then my second question, adam, i'm just curious, with the substantial growth you're putting on, on your e&s, core e&s business, do you have kind of the platform or infrastructure to absorb that type of growth right now? and then i want to tie that in with what's going on right now with uber, and just how integrated was that in the rest of your platform? and just to avoid disruptions that could potentially cause some cost and issues toward claims management, underwriting all sorts of other things?
adam abram -- chief executive officer
absolutely. we've got the infrastructure to manage the growth in the e&s business and our throughput right now is growing without -- because of good hard work and very capable management and organization by our teams in the e&s unit, our throughput has grown. that is the number of quotes that we've been able to put out. we put some technology behind that that assist us in quoting faster and better.
and so we're not strained at all in terms of our ability to handle this growth. we've added new people in the underwriting division. right now, the uber account is really strictly, obviously, a claims operation, and we have sufficient people to handle those claims easily, efficiently, consistently and within the 4 corners of the contract. and we'll engage in a orderly runoff of that book, and the uber claims segment is separated from our e&s claims segment.
they're under a common management, but the people handling uber claims are different than the people handling the liability claims in our e&s segment. now as uber runs off, by the way, there may be opportunities for us to move people over from -- some people over from uber claims into the liability group as that grows. and in fact, that's kind of an advantage that we have right now in terms of this expanding book. and as you think about the growth in claims -- just in numerical claims that will inevitably come, we've got a lot of talented people handling uber claims who may eventually come over and be part of the e&s claims handling.
so it's actually a fortuitous and good arrangement.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. you have a follow-up question from mark hughes from suntrust. your line is now open. please go ahead.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
yes. on claims development, there's been some commentary, obviously, around the commercial auto that the development pattern has been lengthening and you're seeing -- not you, but others are seeing higher losses in the tail, but then even on noncommercial auto risks or losses there perhaps have been developing less favorably than expected. have you seen that? has the whole point about social inflation, just kind of broadening up the conversation in one of your notable competitors that talked about it? are you seeing anything like that in your core e&s business where some of the development patterns are a little different?
adam abram -- chief executive officer
we're not. we're looking hard at it. we certainly are aware of all the commentary around that. we've not seen what people are referring to is the social inflation in our core e&s book, middle market, basically small and middle market e&s book to date, but we are alert to it.
i will say we've enjoyed 10 quarters in a row of significant rate increases. and then, as i was pointing out before, the renewal book, those rate increases that we report to you, i think, are -- they're part of the story, but there's another part of the story where you can't quite capture the flavor of it, except to explain to you what the expiring premium from another insurer was compared to the premium we've got, and i gave you a couple of examples of several hundred percent here. and i didn't just cherry pick those examples, that's a phenomena that's going on in parts of the e&s market. and at the same time, i'm not seeing yet the social inflation that people are talking about.
but if you look at our long-term history in this business, which is, as i pointed out earlier, 17 years, we've got a long history through many cycles of looking at fully developed loss and lae ratios. and those typically have been hovering right around 60% over time. i think the price increases that we're getting are really good. and i think that this book will perform in line with our long-term history in good years because i think we're really in good position in these years in the current environment.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
understood. then one final quick question. do you even have the written and earned for the commercial auto piece in the third quarter? i think, historically, that maybe gets broken out later. but own review, you have them there in front of you, again, the written and earned in commercial auto within e&s?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
yeah. it was about $80 million there.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
that was the -- those earnings.
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
they're about -- yes. that's the written and the net earned, they're about the same, right? because we basically earn the premium as we write it.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
i guess -- i probably guess, yeah, net written would be the same. do you have gross written by any chance?
sarah doran -- chief financial officer
well, gross would be the additional amount given the large reinsurance contracts that's a little over $100 million.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
yes. ok. very good. thank you.
operator
thank you. i'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. i would like to turn the call back to adam abram for closing remarks.
adam abram -- chief executive officer
well, thank you, everybody, for your interest in our company, and we look forward to reporting to you next quarter and to visiting with you from time to time, and we appreciate -- deeply appreciate your interest and speak to you soon.

thank you, john. good morning, everyone, and welcome to the james river group first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. these statements are based on current beliefs, intentions, expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in the earnings release and risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k, form 10-qs and other reports and filings we made with the securities and exchange commission. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
i will now turn the call over to frank d'orazio, chief executive officer of james river group.
frank d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
welcome to everyone joining us today, and thank you for listening to our pre-recorded earnings call for the first quarter of 2021. i'm joined today by our cfo, sarah doran, who will cover our financial performance for the quarter. but before i hand it over to sarah, i'd like to share some commentary with you regarding significant actions we've taken during the quarter. since joining james river in november of 2020, my primary objectives have been: first, to insure that the company remains fully focused on the market opportunities we have in front of us, as we continue to strengthen our position as a best-in-class e&s carrier with an expanding fronting and fee income business; and secondly, i've made it my personal goal to be able to eliminate the overhang surrounding our commercial auto runoff portfolio. while i intend to share commentary with you in just a few moments about my first objective and significant accomplishments our underwriting segments have been able to achieve in the first quarter, it's more appropriate that i start with a major step that company took in the quarter to put the concerns with our commercial auto runoff portfolio behind us for good. during the first quarter, we strengthened our prior year reserves by $170 million in our commercial auto runoff portfolio. as you might imagine, this decision wasn't taken lightly, but came with the full support of our board of directors, so that james river can focus on our thriving prospective business. admittedly, it is a disappointing outcome after taking a reserve charge for the portfolio in q4 after we saw emergence in that quarter. the reported losses on this terminated commercial auto account meaningfully exceeded our expectations for the three months ending march 31, 2021.
we had expected that reported losses would decline as the account moved further into runoff, but the continued heavy reported loss emergence in q1 2021 indicated more inherent severity in the book than anticipated. in response, we meaningfully adjusted our actuarial methodology resulting in a significant strengthening of reserves for this account at march 31, 2021. in prior quarters, our actuarial work for this terminated commercial auto account have been based on industry data, pricing data, experience data, average claim severity data, and blended methodologies. however, the continuation of highly elevated reported losses in the first quarter of 2021 led us to conclude that using only our own loss experience in our paid and incurred reserve projections rather than the array of inputs that we had used in prior quarters and giving greater weight to incurred methods would give us a better and more conservative estimate of ultimate losses on this account. the result in the changed methodology is significant and also an acknowledgment that our recent loss emergence on the portfolio was likely more than what was originally thought to be a covid-19 impacted catch up. our reserves in the portfolio are now stronger than they've been and a proactive step to close this chapter of the company's history. our total reserves on commercial auto are now more significant than when the account went into runoff at 12/31/2019. our held reserves today consist of 42% ibnr, with 60% of the claims in the runoff portfolio that existed at the end of 2019 now closed. our current net commercial auto reserves per open claim have now increased to 150% since the account went into runoff.
additionally, our current net commercial reserve per open claim is more than 40% greater than our average net paid claim on this portfolio in 2021. as you may recall from our q4 call, i previously voiced an interest in exploring the potential to reduce tail risk and move to a higher end of the range of outcomes in this portfolio. i believe that many of the structures potentially available in the legacy reinsurance marketplace could require a meaningful risk-sharing or co-participation feature, frictional costs and additional premium features as well as a defined limit. i feel very comfortable that our new ultimate reserve levels are likely at similar levels as the legacy market may view. before discussing some highlights and metrics from the quarter, i'd like to remind our listeners on the call today that unlike other carriers, the runoff portfolio of james river does not consist of numerous failed underwriting ventures. it consists of one very large account, which has now been in runoff for over 16 months. several years ago, we were at the vanguard of underwriting a new sector of the commercial auto industry without the benefit of past loss history, promulgated rates or loss triangles, and we got it wrong. my point in all this is that this experience should not define james river, a company with a rich underwriting culture and commitment to excellence. and i look forward to working with the management team to continue to make the company larger, stronger and more profitable in the years to come, my primary objective that i noted at the onset of this call. and so let me now share with you some of the very positive fundamentals that we experienced in q1, underlying our ongoing business that demonstrates the company's ability to maximize the current favorable market conditions.
in e&s, the segment's core gwp grew by 35.6% for the quarter. just as importantly, we also recorded our 17th consecutive quarter of positive rate change at 14.6%, bringing our cumulative compounded rate change to 36.4% since q1 of 2017. rate for the quarter eclipsed both our q4 2020 and full year 2020 figures, a positive sign that the current market conditions have not yet begun to moderate in the markets we serve. our submission activity remains robust, and the quote-to-buying ratio in core e&s improved 20% over q1 2020. the core e&s calendar year reported loss ratio for the quarter remained very attractive at 31.7%, which is very similar to the excellent 30% calendar year reported loss ratio we experienced in all of 2020. we also continue to benefit from a significant decline in the frequency of claims in this segment. for the last 12 months through to the end of q1 2021, we've seen an exposure adjusted decline in claims frequency of between 21% and 33% depending on the exposure metric. remember also that our excess property portfolio is managed very conservatively for both tail risk and attritional losses. and as a result, we've had virtually no impact from winter storm uri. on a combined ratio basis, core e&s produced 83% for the quarter. this is a reminder of what our overall e&s segment is capable of from an earnings perspective now that our runoff portfolio has been addressed with certainty. our core e&s division, which has grown by 86% over the last two years, enjoys an industry leadership position in its space and should be approaching a $1 billion segment by the end of 2022, a major milestone for the company.
our fee-based fronting specialty -- our fee-based fronting business in our specialty admitted segment is also beginning to gain significant traction, with 23.6% gwp growth over prior for the quarter, demonstrating the company's stated commitment to gaining scale in this segment as several of the new programs onboarded in 2020 are beginning to get traction. the segment's pipeline remains active, as we mine relationships and industry contacts throughout the organization and have begun making conscious efforts to better leverage the significant relationships that wholesale distribution partners already have with our e&s segment. the segment's submission activity increased 39% over q1 2020, and we also just signed a very significant new fronting opportunity that's forecast to have meaningful positive impact on the segment's 2021 plan. also notable is the fact that several of our existing programs are starting to show signs of growth as workers' compensation payrolls, revenues and other exposure basis increase as the u.s. economy continues to recover and expand in the wake of covid-19. in addition to growing fee income by 21.8% for the quarter, the segment has done an excellent job of navigating covid dynamics as well as q1 cat activity and is producing a very attractive 92.3% combined ratio for the quarter. and finally, our casualty reinsurance unit will show growth over the quarter over prior. much of this is due to an effective date change and a large renewal that moved out of the fourth quarter.
the segment continues to focus on margin expansion, and its q1 positive rate change of 16%, inclusive of underlying primary pricing, is well ahead of the effective rate assumption embedded in its 2021 plan, a very good sign for the health of the current accident year. collectively, i believe the company is navigating the current market prudently, growing wisely, capturing rate, syndicating risk where appropriate, and servicing our distribution partners and insurers. it is our employee base who capably performs these actions and our 19-year track record as a top quartile performer that define james river, not our runoff portfolio. our plans for 2021 call for us to continue to profitably grow the company, renewing the commitment to our underwriting culture while continuing to invest in our people, our processes and our technology in an effort to create a larger, more profitable specialty carrier consistently producing top-tier returns.
with that, i'll turn the call over to sarah doran.
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
thanks, frank. let me highlight a few of the financial points from the quarter. we reported a net loss of $103.5 million for the quarter, and we had a $108.9 million operating loss for the quarter, given the reserve charges previously mentioned. as we turn the page on our large commercial auto account in runoff, our performance for the quarter on a go-forward basis continues to reflect accelerating renewal rate pricing, attractive growth and prudent reserving for the e&s segment, significant scale and acceleration of fee income growth in the specialty admitted segment, and meaningful expense savings and scale uplift throughout the organization. market conditions remain very attractive for our business. let me highlight a few figures of the profitability and strength of our ongoing franchise. the accident year loss ratio was 64.4% this quarter, slightly down from that of the first quarter of 2020. this is higher than the 63.7% accident year loss ratio we reported for the full year 2020, despite e&s renewal rate increases of 13.7% in 2020 and 14.6% year-to-date. said a different way, we continue to feel that we are building strength in our largest business and largest block of reserves, core e&s. about 69% of the $684 million of net reserves we have in core e&s is in incurred but not reported reserves. the core block also represents about 45% of the $1.5 billion of the company's full net reserve block. moving on to expenses. our group expense ratio decreased to 28.9% this quarter as compared to 34.2% in the first quarter of last year. the absolute dollar amount of operating expenses was down in each of the four segments and decreased about 8% or $4.3 million across the group. we have been working over the last 1.5 years to reduce expenses and gain efficiency.
the expense ratio also benefited from strong growth in lines where we see significant premium for attractive ceding commissions, such as excess casualty in our e&s segment. it also benefited meaningfully from the scale we continue to build in our specialty admitted segment. we expect that our expense ratio for the full year would be close to our first quarter results. bringing the accident year loss and expense ratios together, the accident year combined ratio across the company was 93.3% in the quarter, down from 100% in the first quarter of last year. gross premiums written in excess casualty continued to increase meaningfully and have increased over 100% year-to-date as rate increases in that line have either been the highest or among the highest across our e&s book. as it is our largest line of business in e&s, it has also pushed the net to gross retention ratio in that segment down to about 60% this quarter, which is where it was in the fourth quarter of 2020. that is meaningfully down from the first quarter of last year. we expect the retention ratio in e&s to generally be between 60% to 70%, depending on where throughout the 13 underwriting divisions we experienced growth. and finally on investments, net investment income for the quarter was $15 million, roughly on par with nii in the second and third quarters of last year as compared to the first quarter 2020 result of $22.8 million. the decline is due to the reduction in short-term interest rates and the sale of a meaningful portion of our bank loan portfolio during the second quarter of 2020. this quarter, our gross yield was 3%, on par with last quarter.
and with that, i'll hand it back to frank.
frank d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, sarah. and again, many thanks to everyone listening to our pre-recorded q1 2021 earnings call. we will look forward to reporting to you again next quarter. enjoy the rest of your day.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to james river group 2021 second quarter earnings call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, sarah doran. please go ahead.
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
thank you, henry. good morning, everyone, and welcome to the james river group second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. these statements are based on current beliefs, intentions, expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and the risk factors of our most recent form 10-k, form 10-qs and other reports and filings we have made with the securities and exchange commission. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. i will now turn the call over to frank d'orazio, chief executive officer of james river group.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, sarah. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings call. last night, james river reported very strong results for the quarter, highlighted by continued robust growth and excellent underwriting returns while delivering operating earnings of $0.54 per diluted share, sending a company record for quarterly segment underwriting profit of $25.7 million and recording no adverse development in our commercial auto runoff portfolio. the group experienced 26% growth in the quarter, while recording a combined ratio of 89.7% and a very impressive return on tangible equity of 14.2%. these results demonstrate the resiliency of the organization and the strength and depth of the relationships with our distribution partners, irrespective of the challenges of the previous two quarters.
so our friends in the wholesale program management and reinsurance marketplaces, we appreciate your continued support, value your partnership and look forward to continuing to service the needs of both you and our mutual clients. now let me talk a bit about our business segments as they continue to demonstrate the company's ability to maximize the current favorable industry market conditions. in core e&s, the segment exceeded expectations for the quarter by growing gwp by 15.1% despite the fact that new business production was essentially flat for the month of may, following our q1 earnings announcement, but then rebounded tremendously in june and for that matter, for july as well. the segment recorded its 18th consecutive quarter of positive rate change at 18.1%, bringing our cumulative compounded rate change to 42.5% over that period.
this was the second consecutive quarter where rates surpassed our full year 2020 rate change, building an expectation that these conditions should remain in place into 2022. more importantly, we believe the rate improvements we are achieving significantly exceed our view of loss cost trends, allowing us to increase the future profit margins in our business. our key production metrics remained very strong. our renewal policy retention remained consistent with prior quarters. our new business submission activity and hit ratio increased and policy count was up 27% over q2 2020. for the quarter, we experienced positive rate in 11 out of 12 underwriting divisions and premium growth in 10 out of those departments with particularly strong traction in our underwriting unit that serves a smaller end of the commercial market, our small business division, which includes contract binding.
the division grew 33.1%. this is a sector we expect to scale as the recovery of the domestic economy continues, and our investments in the space take hold. other underwriting units that experienced double-digit rate and growth for the quarter include allied health, excess casualty and excess property. overall, e&s recorded a 77.2% combined ratio for the quarter benefiting from $7.5 million of favorable development from prior years, and again, just as critically, with our commercial auto run-off portfolio performing within our actuarial indications. moving on. our specialty admitted segment continues to expand impressively and profitably. not only have we retained 100% of our programs in the quarter, but our premium growth is up 46.1% versus prior, while producing a a combined ratio of 88.5%.
our pipeline remains robust as we continue to see a healthy flow of program submissions, including a 21% increase in submission activity over q2 2020. growth in fee income within that segment continues at a positive trajectory. excluding a onetime catch-up in fee income realized in the second quarter of 2020, fee income would have increased 33% over the prior year quarter. the segment is currently in various stages, performing diligence on a number of new opportunities while also marketing unbundled services such as claims handling and our forthcoming new policy issuance platform. finally, casualty re showed significant gwp growth of 41% over prior year quarter, based primarily on the growth in existing treaties and underlying rate increases of approximately 15% rather than the onboarding of new placements.
unfortunately, the segment experienced adverse development of $5 million in the quarter, coming substantively from treaties we no longer support. while we continue to remain optimistic about the implied margin embedded in the 2020 and 2021 accident years, the prior year loss emergence drove the segment combined ratio of 109.2% for the quarter. before i hand the call back to sarah, i would be remiss if i didn't mention how extremely proud i am of the management and employees of james river who have continued to remain focused on the opportunities in front of the organization as these results indicate while furthering the group's objectives for the year, remaining committed to our underwriting culture while continuing to make investments in our enterprise risk management framework in an effort to create a larger, more profitable specialty e&s carrier. sarah?
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
thanks, frank. last night, we reported net income of $20.8 million for the quarter and had $18.8 million of operating profit. as frank mentioned, our performance for the quarter in e&s reflects accelerating renewal rate pricing, meaningful current year underwriting profit, augmented by favorable benefit from prior year reserves. in specialty admitted, the story is significant growth and scale in the fronting business. and across the organization, we delivered meaningful expense savings and scale uplift. in sum, we posted record quarterly underwriting profit, an 89.7% combined ratio experienced 26% top line growth and generated a 14.2% average operating return on tangible equity despite holding our highest amount of tangible equity.
the accident year loss ratio was 65.7% for the quarter, on par with that of the second quarter of 2020 and a few points above that of the full year 2020. despite the significant rate increases we've taken over the last 18 quarters, we continue to feel that we are building reserving strength and our growing core e&s business, especially. our current accident year combined ratio continued to improve to 91.7% in the quarter, down from 94.2% in the second quarter of last year. we had overall favorable reserve development of $3.5 million, a two-point benefit. reserve development in e&s was a favorable $7.5 million across multiple accident years. we continue to see a material claims frequency decline in the 2020 year. we did have about $5 million of adverse development in casualty reinsurance and about 60% of the development was on treaties that we no longer write including one that expired this past quarter.
moving on to expenses. our group expense ratio decreased to 26% this quarter as compared to 28.6% in the second quarter of last year and 28.9% last quarter. the absolute dollar amount of operating expenses increased approximately 5% across the group as compared to the same quarter last year while net earned premium increased 16%. this is a testament to solid expense management as well as mix of business. the ratio is sensitive to growth in lines where we see significant premium for attractive ceding commissions, especially excess casualty in our e&s segment. while stronger than we expected this quarter, this growth can be highly variable. the expense ratio also benefited meaningfully from the scale we continue to build in our specialty admitted segment.
in sum, our expense ratio was highly sensitive to growth in rate experienced in any one quarter. but we continue to expect that our expense ratio for the full year will likely be somewhere between our first quarter results of 28.9% and our year-to-date results of 27.4%. on to investments. net investment income for the second quarter was $14.4 million, a decline of 4.9% from the first quarter at about 6.5% from the second quarter of last year. the decline is due to the reduction in short-term interest rates and the sale of a meaningful portion of our bank loan portfolio, which occurred during the second quarter of 2020. we're also carrying a significantly higher cash balance than we were at the end of the first quarter, as we're in the process of putting the proceeds raised from our may 2021 equity offering to work.
i'm going to take a moment on taxes. our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the tax rate where we earn income. in this quarter, we earned more income in the u.s. than we did in bermuda, pushing up the effective tax rate. i expect that our full year 2021 tax rate will approximate the 23.7% that we have now reported for the first six months of the year. we ended the quarter well within our target operating and leverage ratio at 1.12 times and 28%, respectively, having successfully positioned ourselves for further opportunistic growth. and finally, a few points on commercial auto reserves and claims. the rate of claims closure remains strong as we've closed about 1,000 claims since march 31 and remain with roughly 7,100 open claims, about 40% of which relate to the 2019 year and around 50% of relates to the 2017 and 2018 years combined.
we've now closed over 65% of the claims that were open when we put the large account into runoff in january of 2019. we hold about $400 million of commercial auto reserves on our balance sheet, the majority of which relates to the 2016 to 2019 years. as of the end of the second quarter, we had about $55,000 of reserves per open claim on our balance sheet as compared to a current average closing cost per open claim of $43,000. and i'll -- with that, i'll hand the call back to frank to kick off q&a.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
thanks. operator, i think we can open up the line for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from cullen johnson of riley securities.
cullen johnson -- b. riley securities, inc. -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. the first question that i have in the investor presentation in q1, you noted you've been closing about 100 claims a week. in the commercial auto book. has that pace kept more or less constant here? and would you expect it to remain so over time if so?
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
yes. right now, cullen, it's a great question. for the most recent quarter, we closed anywhere between 50 to 100 claims a week. so it's a slightly slower pace than it was in the first quarter. and i would expect that over time, as we move further away from the runoff of the initial data, the runoff of the large account that, that would continue to slow down. i would say that closing about 13% of the open claims during the quarter was slightly above the pace than i think we might have expected. so i think a very strong story as we continue to put the book behind us.
cullen johnson -- b. riley securities, inc. -- analyst
okay. great. that's helpful. and then the 43,000 closing cost per open claim that you noted in the prepared remarks, i think in the prior quarter, was that number closer to 39 if i recall, is that a relatively normal fluctuation you would see or would we maybe expected to kind of sit at that 43 run rate? i'm just curious how you think about that figure?
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
yes, that's exactly right. we were at 39,000 at the end of last quarter. so we would expect that to go up. right now, we've got $55,000 of reserves per open claim. and if we could close every single claim that we have open at the average cost that we've been closing them, i think i mentioned that would cost us roughly $43,000 claims. so we would expect those numbers to narrow over time. and i would say, looking at the claims data on an accident year basis, where we are for some of those early years in terms of trajectory is very similar to where we are for the greener year in terms of 2019. so we're comfortable with that trajectory, and we would expect that dynamic to continue.
cullen johnson -- b. riley securities, inc. -- analyst
okay. great. and then just last question for me. can you just talk a little bit about what your the favorable development in core e&s in the quarter?
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
yes. i think we saw favorable development in multiple accident years in core e&s. i would say, in particular, the 2020 year continues to be a bright spot, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. claims frequency there is down almost 20% at any given point in time. and i think that we feel very, very comfortable with that continuing to be a very effective and profitable year. but we saw a bunch of other years performing well, just over the last, i would say, that $7.5 million kind of tracks a handful of years over the last five, six years, which is pretty typical for us given the tale of our business.
cullen johnson -- b. riley securities, inc. -- analyst
okay. thanks. that's helpful. i'll hand over my question.
operator
your next question comes from matt carletti of jmp.
matthew john carletti -- jmp securities llc -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. frank, i caught your comments on the new business production that may was a bit flat and then rebounded strongly. can you compare kind of how june, july compared to, say, maybe q1 levels? is it kind of back at those levels above those levels? just curious if you could provide some more color on where the market is.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
yes. so well, you just add, let me give you a little bit of color there. so obviously, it's one quarter. it happens to be a larger quarter than q1. and we grew core about 18% in the same quarter last year. so the bar obviously gets higher after 18 quarters of positive rate. but again, we exceeded our own budget expectations for the quarter. and we've seen quarterly growth rates jumping around before. i think it boils down to some of the dynamics that i referenced earlier. so new business production for may was flattish right after we announced the q1 earnings. but then the june rebound was tremendous. i'd say that for us to come in at the growth rate that we did for the quarter despite being flat for may. it gives you some sense that we performed significantly better than what we posted for the quarter in the month of june. and like i said, july was in a similar vein as well.
matthew john carletti -- jmp securities llc -- analyst
okay. great. that's really helpful. thank you. and then just one other kind of just pricing question. i mean you guys have had strong pricing for a while, definitely kind of held serve there. are you seeing any kind of running a pricing elasticity kind of your point of 18 quarters in a row. is it becoming harder to achieve those sorts of price increases? are you seeing any sort of quote-to-bind ratios or some of the things inflation and otherwise going on in the market, continuing to kind of support those rate increase levels more broadly?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
it's a great question. we've been pleasantly surprised that rate has exceeded our full year 2020 rate change for two consecutive quarters now. and obviously, you can never predict when rates will change or begin to moderate and eventually begin to reverse course. but i don't expect to see that this year. to your question, we have not seen it beginning that much more difficult in that regard. we're not seeing that in any of our ratios, submission activity was up. our hit ratio was up. so no signs of any moderation just relative to our ability to produce the type of rates that we're seeing right now. i think there's some outside forces that could potentially even impact the next couple of quarters.
obviously, hurricane season is active. that may have some impact in certain product lines. but right now, it certainly feels to me like we've got several quarters of favorable conditions ahead of us, particularly as casualty loss and sale for the soft market years, and carriers continue to remain disciplined relative to limit deployment. and right now, the interest rate outlook certainly remains pretty much unchanged.
matthew john carletti -- jmp securities llc -- analyst
great. thanks for the color. appreciate it.
operator
next question comes from casey alexander of compass point.
casey jay alexander -- compass point research & trading, llc -- analyst
yes. good morning. just one of the things that you had mentioned previously was if there was an opportunity to do a loss transfer of capital markets transaction related to the commercial auto book that you would explore that. has the company made any moves down that path, looked at any pricing in order to pull off that kind of transaction might that require some addition to the reserves that exist on the commercial auto book. just some color on where the company stands on that could be helpful.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
sure. thanks for the question, casey. we put so much analysis into the q1 reserve action that we took basically starting over, taking a different approach, changing our methodology and then, of course, taking the charge that we did. so i'm comfortable with the steps that we've taken since i've been at james river certainly. that said, if we're presented with a legacy structure that mechanically and economically makes sense, we're going to give it serious consideration. if it significantly increases certainty and is not overly cost prohibitive, that's still key. so remember, even if there's an agreement on the ultimate a third party still needs to be paid to assume the liabilities. so i guess, to summarize my comments here, it's still a possibility if we find a structure that we feel makes sense on the conditions that i've just outlined, but i don't feel it's a necessity.
casey jay alexander -- compass point research & trading, llc -- analyst
great. thank you. that's my only question. i appreciate it.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
sure. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from mark hughes of truist. [technical issues] all right. we'll just get back to mark. your next question comes from meyer shields of kbw.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
thanks. i guess first question, can you talk about the loss trends that you're assuming in excess and surplus? and i'm curious particularly whether those have changed overall? and as the contribution from excess casualty becomes bigger?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
yes. so good question, meyer. so our actuarial team performs a formal trend study annually that analyzes frequency and severity trends across lines, as you might imagine. we also look at exposure trends. to the extent that business we're writing is inflation insensitive, we're picking up that impact on exposure as well. our actuaries look at the duration of lots associated with those products and have to take that into consideration relative to the impact on future claims payments, but we're constantly seeking to identify trends in various segments of the business that we write. so whether that's northeast habitational or california nursing homes or new york contractors just i guess, decide a couple of examples.
and so we adjust our pricing trends and rates accordingly when we deem it necessary, whether that's a price index related form of inflation or social inflation. and we get fairly granular by line of business. but at a very high level, we currently think about loss cost trends on the overall portfolio in the mid-single-digit range. and clearly, the rate increases we're producing are a multiple of that range. we're actually in the process right now of doing that formal review and kind of setting our expectations going forward. so we'll be refreshing that you shortly.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
okay. thanks. second question, just a numbers one. was there any expense ratio impact associated with the reserve charge in casualty re?
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
no. that's a great question, meyer. often, there's a sliding scale impact that would move the expense ratio down the treaties that had adverse development in this quarter, either didn't have a sliding scale impact or didn't have a sliding scale in particular. so thank you for asking a question. there was no expense ratio impact from the adverse development in casualty re this quarter.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
okay. perfect. thank you very much.
operator
next question comes from brian meredith of ubs.
brian robert meredith -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
yes, thank you. a couple of ones for you. just, i guess, mathematically trying to figure out the e&s growth versus rate. is it that you're kind of declining exposures or exposures are going down on your e&s given that growth was only, call it, 14%, 15%, but your rate was up 18% and change?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
no. listen, first of all, i think it really boils down to just a few items. so our retention rate in line with past quarters, submission and hit ratios are up. we believe we saw very little impact in terms of cancellations or nonrenewals that were tied to the events of the first quarter. to date, we're aware of only one in-force policy in the e&s segment that totaled $29,000 that was either non-renewed or canceled due to a rating impact. i talked about new business being flattish for the month of may, but then rebounding in the following months. the other dynamic, i think, is probably worth mentioning, and maybe this gets more to your point, is the size of our average new business policy premiums came down roughly $23,500 in q2 2020 to $17,400 per new policy this past quarter. and that's really driven by the traction we've been gaining over time in our binding facility and small business units that, again, experienced significant growth in the quarter that i referenced in my prepared comments.
so that's been an area that we've been investing in and bringing along since 2017. our contract binding portal is now getting up to 900 to 1,000 visits per week, again, been growing steadily as we continue to roll out access to that portal with our distribution partners. so we're certainly happy to have the growth in those units that cater to smaller insurers because the margins are attractive. it's low touch. we keep on earning box fairly tight. and we have the ability to continue to expand the network. so we like where that's going. but some of the impact there is just bringing down some of the new business kind of average premium.
brian robert meredith -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
got you. makes sense. second question, just curious, in your specialty admitted segment, funding growth, obviously terrific. what's happening with your more traditional workers' comp business right now? and kind of what's your view on that business?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
yes. workers' comp is -- the outlook is still mixed, right? npci continues to reduce their loss costs, and we still see pricing declines in most of the markets. but we do see competition slowing. we believe that rate indications from the rain bureaus will turn positive soon and their prices will go up in the near term. so we're in the camp that believes an inflection point is coming, and we're making rate filings for increases in several states. but right now, we were off our individual risk workers' comp business, i want to say it was down. so keep me honest here by to say about 12% on the quarter.
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
yes. but i think an important point there, which i know you know too, brian, is as we've had success in growing the rest of the program business within that segment. workers' comp between a large program that we have and the individual risk workers' comp book is about 1/3 of the total gpw in that segment. and as recently as two years ago, that was the overwhelming majority of it. so we have looked through the growth, really diversify against that concentration.
brian robert meredith -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
got you. and then i guess last question here. frank, as i look at the casualty re business, it seems like every quarter, we've got adverse reserve development on that book. is there anything that you're doing with respect to systems or data or i don't know, to basically try to get that under control?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
yes. well, it's an issue that i guess we've talked about in the past, right, there's a $5 million adverse charge for the quarter coming primarily from old accident years. so in this quarter was primarily from the 14 to 17 years. and well, let's say that the $5 million in the adverse charge, 60% of it came from treaties that we no longer write. so four treaties that are no longer underwritten by the book. it was some gl and some hospitality and contracting classes and nonstandard auto accounting exposure. so i continue to be very, very optimistic about the 2020 and 2021 accident years. but admittedly, the prior year emergence is a disappointment. again, this is a different part of our business in which we're not handling the claims. we're not necessarily reporting the claims, right? they're coming to us from a third party, but we're going to continue to evaluate our positioning in bermuda.
brian robert meredith -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from mr. mark hughes of truist.
mark douglas hughes -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
can you hear me?
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
we can hear you, mark.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
we can hear you.
mark douglas hughes -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
excellent. my audio cut out when there's a question about the -- if you took out may where your activity is more flat kind of june and july, what the growth profile might have been in those months more recently? i'd be curious to hear what your answer was on that point.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
sure. well, let me see if i can replay the tape for you. so yes, i think what i pointed to, mark, was the fact that we produced a 15.1% growth rate for the quarter despite the fact that we were flat in may. so june was significantly better than that. and then we saw the same type of trajectory in july. so much more in line with our expectations.
mark douglas hughes -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
okay. good. thank you. and then from a more global perspective, your risk management, as you've seen these events here lately, and this may even tie in to the last question about loss emergence in the casualty re. what changes perhaps have you made from a broader perspective around risk and the underwriting that you might point to the last few months?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
sure. good question, mark. so listen, let me say this, we have strong processes in place at james river, particularly relative to rate and performance monitoring. we have monthly segment checking calls, quarterly segment reviews. we do regular deep dives on the business, discussions and studies and loss trends. and just we tie those processes into how we underwrite and price and reserve the business. what i would say though is we've been broadly looking across the organization at how we take very good and improve upon it. so make it better, make it great.
the actuarial practice plays a large role in overall enterprise risk management. we've been reviewing all of our controls in the risk register individually. we're finding where necessary, adding where necessary. and we're going through similar processes with our framework and governance controls and our risk policies and our cybersecurity and how we use our economic capital model, it's pretty much an iterative process, and we expect to continue to refine our governance framework. i just think that's a healthy process to continue to go through just relative to erm.
mark douglas hughes -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
and then you've got a new group chief actuary, i think. any changes you might anticipate?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer and director
well, it's day four for our new chief actuary, so you probably just ordered business cards. but listen, i expect him to focus on the same thing that all newly hired executives focus on when they joined a new organization. and remember, i was in a similar position just a few months ago. so you meet your team and the leadership of the business segments you support, you listen, you observe, you take a lot of notes and of course, you immerse yourself in your new responsibilities. and we're very fortunate. our current chief actuary isn't retiring until the end of the quarter. so we expect to have a very orderly knowledge and process transfer. but listen, the day doing a grizzled veteran with extensive expertise in lines that we write casualty, workers' compensation, professional lines, property reinsurance and he's seen it all. nothing is going to surprise them. but he's coming in with no preconceived notions certainly.
mark douglas hughes -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
and then one final question on the specialty admitted. what kind of combined grade should that be operating at? what would you be targeting for that combined?
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
yes. so the business obviously had a very good quarter at the 88.5% combined ratio. i think you've seen it move around a lot, mark, and this is a tough one just with any line where you're getting 50-ish percent growth in any given quarter-over-quarter. that's coming through new programs, mix of business, different retentions. we're still in the kind of sub-20% retention, but it moves around on any given program. so i'm definitely not trying to avoid the question, but just paint the picture that i think that with all these moving pieces, it's tough to probably have an exact trend line there.
but conceptually, i think about that business running in a combined that's probably somewhere between a 90% or 92% on a run rate basis and that probably improves over time. but the delta there is just going to be a little bit on the expense ratio. we had some expense benefits throughout the business this quarter because i was kind of covering in my prepared remarks. and then i would say some fluctuation in the loss ratio, just as those more recent programs continue to come on.
mark douglas hughes -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
thank you very much.

operator
thank you for standing by, and welcome to the james river group holdings third quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions]
and now i'd like to introduce your host for today's program, brett sheriffs, head of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
brett shirreffs -- senior vice president, finance, investments and investor relations
thank you, jonathan. good morning, everyone, and welcome to the james river group third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. these statements are based on current beliefs, intentions, expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.
for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and the risk factors of most -- of our most recent form 10-k, form 10-qs and other reports and filings we have made with the securities and exchange commission. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
i'll now turn the call over to frank d'orazio, chief executive officer of james river group.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
thank you for that introduction, brett. good morning, and welcome to everyone on the call. it's a pleasure to join you again having just yesterday completed my first year at james river as ceo. i certainly plan to cover the results of the quarter in a moment. but given the timing of this call, if i'd first reflect on some of the goals i originally set for the organization and review the progress we've achieved in my first 12 months.
as i said on my first call with you last february, my primary objectives were to ensure that the company remain laser-focused on the market opportunity that we have in front of us to strengthen our position as a best-in-class e&s carrier with an expanded fronting and fee income business and to eliminate the overhang surrounding our commercial auto runoff portfolio. i believe we've been very successful in executing on these two priorities. having put a loss portfolio transfer agreement in place in late september, with coverage provided highlighted without an aggregate limit and fully collateralized, priced very close to our held reserves.
and secondly, by driving strong growth and attractive rate increases throughout our two very strong insurance franchises. our e&s unit, which has long been an industry leader and our specialty admitted unit, which we emphasize our fronting capabilities and fee income generation. at the same time, i've also significantly added to my senior management team with the addition of highly experienced leadership in our new chief actuary and new chief claims officer, who each joined us this past quarter and are playing pivotal roles in the risk framework of the organization as we invest in and bolster our enterprise risk program.
james river has also added to its board of directors, adding two very strong independent directors with deep industry experience who will undoubtedly provide valuable guidance to the management team. when i took the reign here as ceo, i told the board i would emphasize growing our highly profitable core businesses. the core e&s business was approximately $615 million in gross written premiums on a trailing 12-month basis by the time i joined the organization. over the subsequent four quarters, we've taken advantage of dislocation in the market as well as rate increases to grow the core e&s book by 25%. with the opportunities available to us today, the core e&s business should soon be exceeding $800 million in gwp. rates in this segment have increased by more than 13% over the last four quarters, meaningfully in excess of loss trend.
accounts continue to stay in the e&s marketplace for longer as we've been able to provide renewal quotes on nearly our entire in force portfolio, each of the last few quarters. while our policy count has grown over 24% during the last year. our e&s segment grew 21.3% in this most recent quarter, which is a significant acceleration from q2 and a validation that we remain a preferred destination for our valued wholesale market partners. i mentioned on our last earnings call that we saw a brief slowdown in new business volume during the month of may, around the time of our equity offering. new business volume returned to normal during june and july, and that momentum has continued during q3.
just as importantly, the macroeconomic conditions that have created this market hardening still exist today. concerns of social inflation, the impact of climate change, a continued low-interest rate environment and the hangover effect associated with soft market era underwriting, lead me to believe that the market's current pricing and underwriting discipline should continue well into 2022. given our capabilities as an expert in the e&s casualty arena, the relationships of our experience and dynamic underwriting team and what we see in terms of market opportunities in front of us, i have no doubt that our franchise will continue to be a leader and will continue to benefit from the robust market opportunities in the sector.
in the specialty admitted segment, our fronting business has grown by almost $100 million of gross written premium on a trailing 12-month basis or approximately 27% since i joined james river. and in the most recent quarter, fee income was up more than 20% relative to the third quarter of 2020. we have another very experienced and capable team running this business that has deep relationships with both our underwriting partners and the strong panel of reinsurers that support the programs. growth in our fronting and program business slowed a bit during the third quarter as new programs added in 2020 have begun to complete 12-month renewal cycles, but our growth was still up double digits from the prior-year quarter, which was largely due to newer fronting relationships.
i would note that the deal-driven nature of the fronting and program business can produce large swings and premium results from quarter to quarter. it can take months, if not more, to bind a program. and so top-line results for this segment can be lumpy. i would expect our long-term growth over the next few years is not likely to be in an absolute straight-line for this segment. i would also dismiss any suggestion that our prospects for this segment are hampered by our recent ratings change. most of our competitors in this space carry the same a stable rating as we do, but i believe our team and level of experience set us apart as we've been in this business now for nearly a decade.
we've renewed all of our programs that have been up for renewal since our downgrade and submission activity for new program opportunities was up more than 30% during the third quarter. we continue to have a healthy pipeline of new deals, and my optimism and outlook for this business remain intact. although i'm pleased with the growth in our proven key segments, i want to make it clear that we remain a bottom-line focused company. our e&s business continues to report very attractive margins with underlying combined ratios in the low 80s, while our specialty admitted segment is growing fee income at double-digit rates and driving underwriting income in that segment.
now, turning to my second priority that i referenced earlier. as you know, finding a legacy solution for our runoff commercial auto portfolio that provided economic finality was a key priority for james river. after a month-long process to evaluate options related to our legacy reserves, we were able to execute a transaction to bring economic finality to substantially all of our run-off portfolio. this exposure has been transferred on a fully collateralized basis to a counterparty that is well-known to us.
and i believe the ultimate cost of the transaction further supports the change in actuarial methodology that was introduced in q1. the entire leadership team worked very hard to make this happen, and we're very pleased with the outcome. the transaction removed a significant distraction and helped to strengthen our balance sheet meaningfully. we have benefited from a return to a stable ratings outlook as a result of the executed transaction. moving forward, in addition to focusing on the fabulous market opportunity that remains in front of our insurance businesses, my priority now is to stabilize our casualty re segment. this is a business that we've been in for over a decade.
and quite frankly, the results have not met our standards. before i joined the organization, the decision was made to shrink the business substantially, and it's down more than 35% from its recent peak a few years ago. while we do feel much better about the prospects for performance of the recent accident years, the persistence of our emergence from older underwriting years is not acceptable, and the scale of the segment does not warrant increased investment in the coming year.
the most immediate action that we can take is to continue to meaningfully reduce our exposure by exiting treaties that have proven to be unprofitable and reacting quickly to reserve indications while we continue to analyze our options for the segment. the focus of the organization is on our insurance and fronting businesses. that is our future. we'll begin to significantly shrink top-line writings of our casualty re segment over the course of the next year as we focus the growth of our organization on our higher returning u.s. insurance businesses.
casualty re's q4 activity is largely already underwritten and bound at this point in the calendar, but i'm committed to putting a significantly greater focus on our u.s. businesses going forward, and that will become more obvious in q1 2022. the $15.1 million of reserve strengthening in the quarter was extremely disappointing and largely reflects the increased loss emergence we saw during q3. nearly 3/4 of the development was related to general liability treaties and primarily came from the 2014 to 2017 accident years. more than half of the reserve development came from treaties that we no longer write.
since i arrived at james river, we've consistently booked to the actuarial indication or higher when booking our reserves for this segment. our reserves for casualty re are reviewed by third-party actuaries on an annual basis, and our held reserves at the beginning of 2021 were consistent with the external estimate we received. i'll close now with just a few comments on market conditions and the quarter itself. our headline e&s rate increase was 8.7% in the third quarter and stands at 14.5% on a year-to-date basis. the rate moderation relative to the second quarter reflected a slowdown in some of our larger units.
for example, rates in excess casualty were up 12% in the third quarter, a very attractive level, particularly given the amount of rate already achieved in that line of business and ahead of our view of loss trend, but this is down from nearly 30% in the second quarter. excluding the excess casualty line, rate increases were stable compared to the second quarter. i would also point out that we saw similar overall rate moderation in q3 and q4 of 2020 before experiencing significant rate acceleration in the first half of 2021.
in total, the third quarter represented the 19th consecutive quarter of renewal rate increases in the e&s segment, compounding to 46% over that period. this jump in rate, combined with significant improvements in terms and additions over this period, has given us confidence to pursue our growth objectives. as i mentioned earlier, absent what would be nonrecurring events for the quarter, the underlying e&s business is producing combined ratios in the low 80s, and we continue to see margin expansion across the company.
going forward, the strength of our core e&s business should no longer be burdened by our commercial auto runoff results. after completing the lpt transaction, our ibnr as a percentage of our reserves has increased meaningfully to 65.7% in e&s and 62.9% across the company, increases of eight and five points, respectively, from june 30. overall, we feel very good about the current market in which we're operating and our ability to take advantage of these very favorable conditions. there is ample opportunity for us to continue to grow profitably in both e&s and specialty admitted. our ratings are strong and stable. our underwriting teams remain embraced by our distribution partners, and we remain focused on effectively deploying our capital and generating attractive returns on equity.
and with that, let me turn the call over to sarah.
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
thanks, frank. good morning, everyone. given frank's extensive comments on the current quarter as well as the past 12 months, i'm going to focus my comments on a few discrete parts of the quarter as well as some other key financial items. last night, we reported a net loss of $23.9 million for the quarter and had a $26.8 million operating loss. this loss was impacted by the aforementioned commercial auto lpt that we executed at the end of september, bringing economic finality to substantially all of our commercial auto runoff portfolio.
we also had two other unique impacts on the quarter, which i will further explain in a moment. frank has already commented on the adverse development in the casualty reinsurance segment. so, to sum the unique impact of the quarter in e&s. first, as we mentioned in conjunction with our 8-k filing and the signing of the commercial auto lpt, there is the impact of the transaction, of which the majority is related to claims expense. second, there is the $5 million net impact of the ida cat losses.
we have a small, geographically diversified excess property portfolio that the company has written for many years, which is heavily reinsured. our reinsurance incepts at $5 million of losses and provides for $40 million of limit. we also benefit from a substantial surplus share treaty. for that reason, the $5 million of net losses should not grow. last, this quarter was unique in that we had $8.1 million of reinstatement premiums for casualty treaties in different years, caused by losses we experienced in those accident years.
reinstatement premiums are a function of excess of loss reinsurance, which is what these treaties are. generally, our casualty treaties works such that the first reinstatement premium is due on first loss of the treaty. but thereafter, we have a few free reinstatement premiums to provide coverage should further losses arise. as these treaties protect losses in prior accident years, the $8.1 million is a straight reduction to net written and net earned premium in the current quarter.
absent these three impacts, as frank mentioned, the combined ratio for the e&s segment would have been 83.4%, which has improved by about two points as compared to the 85.2% in the comparable quarter last year. the e&s ex-cat accident year loss ratio, adjusted for the casualty related reinstatement premiums and the commercial auto lpt would have been 64.6%, consistent with our performance year-to-date and in excess of our historical fully developed loss ratios for prior years in core e&s.
absent the casualty related reinstatement premiums, which again, served to reduce net written and net earned premium and e&f by $8.1 million, net written and net earned premium and e&s would have grown 25% and 22%, respectively, over the prior year quarter, a meaningful acceleration from the growth rate of last quarter. moving on to our groupwide expenses. our group expense ratio was 24.8% this quarter as compared to 24.8% in the third quarter of last year and 26% last quarter.
we had favorable adjustments to bad debt expense and certain accruals for taxes, licenses and fees within the specialty admitted segment this quarter, which served to lower the segment expense ratio by about five points. this was partially offset by a higher expense ratio in casualty re due to lower sliding scale commission reductions and less premium earned. it also benefited meaningfully from the scale we continue to build in our e&s and specialty admitted segments. finally, on to investments.
net investment income for the third quarter was $15.3 million, an increase of 2% from the third quarter of last year and about 7% from the prior quarter. the increase is due to increased returns from both our renewable energy portfolio and some other private investments. we ended the quarter well within our target operating and leverage ratios of 1.2 times and 29% respectively.
so with that, i will hand it back to frank.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
thank you, sarah. operator, please open the lines for questions from our listeners.
",":
operator
certainly. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of mark hughes from truist. your question, please.
mark hughes -- truist -- analyst
yes, thank you. good morning. is there any impact? you mentioned the new chief actuary and chief claims officer, did that influence in any way, the approach to the casualty re reserve development?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
no, not necessarily. dave joined the organization just this quarter, as you know, joined in august, and our prior -- our chief actuary retired at the end of september. so while he was a key part of the q3 review, he's not been with us for a full quarter, not completely finished his initial review. in essence, what you saw relative to the quarter and casualty re was no change relative to methodology.
mark hughes -- truist -- analyst
okay. and then the reinstatement premium, could you talk a little bit more about that in particular circumstances that drove that, that, at least in my experience, seems unusual that you would have that magnitude of a loss that would trigger the reinstatement premium. just a little more detail on that would be helpful.okay. and then the reinstatement premium, could you talk a little bit more about that in particular circumstances that drove that, that, at least in my experience, seems unusual that you would have that magnitude of a loss that would trigger the reinstatement premium. just a little more detail on that would be helpful.
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
sure, mark. it's sarah. i can help to conceptualize that a bit more. as i mentioned, they're both casualty, xol treaties that we have in e&s that we've had in e&s for many, many years, the same structure etc. and if i think about those, the -- for lack of a better term, the ran of them this year is that we had losses from two different years on the treaties. so we triggered two different reinstatement premiums. as i mentioned, typically, you pay for the first reinstatement premium, and then you get a number of free reinstatements. so to the extent, we had further losses on those particular accident years. there would likely be a 0% financial impact from any future reinstatement premium. but what that does is conceptually net down our losses to, call it, a $1 million to $2 million range on anything we're writing, which obviously protects our balance sheet, kind of plays through the low volatility focus of our e&s business. this cover largely helps with, i would say, four or five divisions within e&s. and one of the things to consider here with regard to xol treaties and the way these are priced is there is going to be a factor for our growth but a different way. we have grown a fair amount, which point effect, makes the restatement premiums relatively large compared to where the -- they have been a few years ago when we weren't growing as much. but i think the import here is there is some randomness in that they both came through in the same quarter. and i would not expect to see those triggered for the foreseeable future.
mark hughes -- truist -- analyst
anything on the nature of the loss, what sort of end market, what industry perhaps? is this social inflation? just a little more characterization of the underlying issue?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
yes, sure. so the two reinstatement losses that you're referencing came out of the energy segment. i'm not sure how familiar you are with our energy underwriting unit there, but it's not a large unit. i think we did roughly about $15 million in premium last year, primarily focused on oilfield services. we are not a big e&p or coal underground mining type of underwriting shop. certainly, there has been a push within that underwriting department to cut our limits to take some of the volatility out of the underwriting segment. it has historically been very profitable line of business for us. but we have pushed policy limits down. so now i would say roughly a little more than half of the policies that we write out of that unit have limits under $5 million, $5 million or less, i should say.
mark hughes -- truist -- analyst
okay. and then any commentary in terms of business flow activity early in the fourth quarter?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
so, sure. i mean i would say that -- and we referenced this, i guess, in q2, right? so we saw some slowdown in terms of growth in ends in may. but it picked right back up in june and july, and that really continued through the rest of the quarter and into the fourth quarter as well. so policies in force, that count is up about 24%. numbers of binders on our small business initiative is up 11%. we continue to see the benefit of strong support from our wholesalers with a negative outlook removed. so it's all been quite positive, particularly since the outlook will stabilize.
mark hughes -- truist -- analyst
thank you very much.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
thanks, mark.
operator
our next question comes from the line of matt carletti from jmp. your question, please.
matt carletti -- jmp -- analyst
hi. thanks, good morning. frank, i was hoping to circle back to your commentary on casualty re. i caught what you said about you expect the top line to significantly shrink, particularly starting in q1. what i was hoping you could give us some more color on is what you plan to do to address the back book because shrinking it forward isn't going to take care of prior reserve issues. i know it's reinsurance. is it adc or an lpt a possibility or something that's being considered? is there -- you commented that you've always kept it at or above actuarial indications. but i mean, if we look back over many quarters and years like those actuarial indications have consistently been short. is there a deeper reserve study? or are you considering kind of changing the actuarial approach? i'm just trying to get out, are you willing to make a commitment to kind of as you brought economic finality to the uber issue, is there a commitment to bring economic finality to the back book here in casualty re?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
no, matt, it's a good question. so you're right. it's a two step process relative to the strategic action, relative to underwriting operations, but then also to use your terminology to back book. so we're going to finish our actuarial review for the segment. so again, this is dave's first full quarter working with the casualty re portfolio. but to your point, i'm going to be open to exploring our options fairly thoughtfully. some more complex than others, but i'm going to be open options, particularly if we can improve the certainty associated with that portfolio, especially after what we were able to accomplish on the commercial auto runoff block and the value that it added to our organization. and we're doing that now.
matt carletti -- jmp -- analyst
okay. great. and on the -- sounds like the deeper dive that's taking place. any sense on timing? is that something we could expect alongside or with q4 reporting? or do you suspect it would take longer than that to get through the numbers?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
we're expecting to complete our review of the reserves in the fourth quarter.
matt carletti -- jmp -- analyst
yes, great. thank you.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
this is underway.
matt carletti -- jmp -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of brian meredith from ubs.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
yes, thanks. a couple of ones here. just quickly, sara, the wind-down of the reinsurance sort of taking it down, any tax implications that you need to be aware of will have any effect on tax rate going forward? is that at all limiting factor to doing some type of a transaction?
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
no. we want to do what's right for the business, brian. and i wouldn't think that we're not going to drive the business based on tax implications. i think there's many different things we can think about here, and that's what the team is committed to doing. i wouldn't hold tax out as a reason not to be a full force on kind of looking at the segment going forward.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great. understood. but will it have an implication for your tax rate here going forward?
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
yes. again, i don't see it, brian. we're early days in this, but i'm not seeing a meaningful implication, right?
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
okay. great. and then second question, i'm just curious, the cat loss you had in the quarter on, i guess, what you said in excess property, maybe you can kind of -- it's something that obviously unfamiliar with cat losses with james river. and i understand you've got a lot of great reinsurance protection. can you maybe describe kind of what it was, what happened, why it was so unusual?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
sure, brian. so as you know, our excess property book, it's always been fairly small, less than $50 million in gwp, about 5% to 7% of our core e&s business. it's a pretty well-diversified book geographically, heavily reinsured, as you mentioned, to the one on 1,000 level on no ep basis. it's engineered to perform very well. and our loss here was really driven by the fact that this was a $30 billion event. i think that's how we think about this underwriting unit is it's -- it performs very well. when you have a very noteworthy or large event, we're going to have some loss. and i think that we were fairly conservative in terms of how we evaluated our potential loss from this event. we are into -- based on where our protections attached from a property standpoint, this event can't get worse for us.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
thanks, brian.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of cullen johnson from b. riley. your question, please.
cullen johnson -- b. riley -- analyst
hey. good morning and thanks for taking my questions. sticking at the higher retention ratio in the fronting book. was that just a pretty standard fluctuation quarter-to-quarter, do you think? or was that more of an intentional move there?
sarah casey doran -- chief financial officer
yes. that's a great question, cullen. there was not an intentional move. as frank said, as we've characterized, that book is just lumpy depending on when certain deals come on and when they don't. and i think, on average, as we've said, our retention there is probably going to be 10% to 20% over the whole book. but you're going to feel that at different points in time. obviously, there'd be some that might go up to 30, but that should be our average overall, as i've stated.
cullen johnson -- b. riley -- analyst
okay. great. thank you. and then i think last quarter, we kind of talked about loss cost trends at roughly mid-single digits broadly across the entire portfolio. is that still a reasonable way to think about that figure here?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
yes. no, i think so. i don't think anything's changed. when we think about the portfolio at a high level, mid-single digits is a good way to think about it, maybe slightly above that on excess casualty and kind of right there for the primary million dollar limits. again, if you take a look at the rate that we've experienced over the last '19 quarters, 46% over that period of time, we feel very good about where we are versus our view of trend.
cullen johnson -- b. riley -- analyst
okay. great thank you. that's all of my questions.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
thanks, cullen.
operator
our next question comes from the line of derek han from kbw. your question, please.
derek han -- kbw -- analyst
good morning, thanks. i know you talked a lot about the consistent adverse development in casualty re in detail. but i was hoping that you could provide some color on what that implies for social inflation within the e&s lines? and how do your accident year loss picks kind of reflect that? i know you're still kind of doing the reserve study, but i was hoping if there are some details on that.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
yes. sure. so listen, i think all insurance companies have some exposure to social inflation. we've certainly seen some aspects of it. i think overall if you're talking about the e&s book, based on our focus on sme business, i think we're probably a little bit more insulated than most. i also think that the industry talks about social inflation, like i said, 2020, 2021 phenomenon. i think something that has been kind of ticking up over the last five to seven years. and so to some extent, you've got a little bit of this exposure baked into your loss history. but i think we're fine. we obviously take a look at it on a pretty close basis, and that's factored into our overall views relative to the loss picks.
derek han -- kbw -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then my second question is on the fronting business. i know you've had pretty good growth there in the past year or so. but are you seeing any increased competition from peers? i know there were some recent launches of start-ups and other carriers kind of getting to the space?
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
yes. no, i think you're right. there have been some new entrants in the space, particularly over the last 18 months. i would say falls lake is considered a leader in the space. i would suggest our fronting pipeline is very strong. commission growth has been strong and is up 30% for the quarter. at any given point in time, we've got as many as three to six programs in various stages of diligence. and like i said during my prepared comments, it oftentimes takes several months to actually onboard a program. but right now, we're very bullish about the prospects for the segment. q4 activity is good. we've actually bound a new program. we expect to onboard two more over the quarter, and we're just giving another notice on a fourth that i think has got a little bit more of a lead time because it's a book role and there's a notice of cancellation provision to the incumbent. so again, i'm very excited about the prospects for growth in the segment.
derek han -- kbw -- analyst
got it. thanks for all the color.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
sure. thank you for the question.
operator
thank you. this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. i'd like to hand the program back to frank for any further remarks.
frank n. d'orazio -- chief executive officer
okay. thank you, operator. i want to thank everyone listening on the call for their time today and for the questions we received this morning. i'll wrap up the call by reiterating my appreciation for the staff of james river and our ability to continue to grow our u.s. insurance segments profitably while continuing to deliver on our corporate objectives to make this a stronger and more profitable company. i look forward to speaking with you again early next year to discuss our q4 results. thank you, and enjoy your day.

"
2018-Q4,JRVR,,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the q4 2018 james river group holdings limited earnings conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (operator instructions) as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, mr. kevin copeland, head of investor relations. sir, you may begin.
kevin b. copeland -- senior vice president, finance and chief investment officer
thank you, joel. good morning, everyone, and welcome to the james river group fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. these statements are based on current beliefs, intentions, expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.
for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k, form 10-qs and other reports and filings we make with the securities and exchange commission. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
i'll now turn the call over to bob myron, president and chief executive officer of james river group.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our conference call today. this is bob myron, and with me are sarah doran, our cfo; and kevin copeland, our cio and head of investor relations. sarah and i will make a few comments to give you some additional color on the quarter and the year, and then we look forward to getting your questions.
the earnings power of our franchise is already strong and i see it improving in the future. for the full year 2018, we have an outstanding 14.8% operating return on tangible equity, which is the highest our franchise has achieved in the last 12 years. and we achieved this with fourth quarter results that were marginally below our expectations, both with respect to underwriting profits as well as investment income from our private investments. we achieved these results for the year through strong growth and good underwriting by our segment teams, booking conservative accident year loss picks, continued expense management across our group, and great capital management.
the last part is something that we haven't commented on a lot in the past, so let me do so now. we have a compelling net written premium to equity ratio, along with prudent and efficient capitalization. we managed the company this way on purpose in order to deliver the highest rote we can to shareholders, while at the same time, meeting the expectations of our rating agency, regulators and policy holders. we also have a compelling dividend yield, which approximates 3%, which outpaces many of our specialty peers and the p&c marketplace as a whole.
while our rote is high, it has also been consistent. we've averaged a 13% rote over the four years which we have been public, and the standard deviation around this result has been low. this is a testament to our high-return but low-volatility model, where we retain low net limits and have limited property exposure. so this is probably a good place to highlight that we again outperformed the specialty p&c marketplace with respect to catastrophe losses. in 2018, our industry had more than $90 billion of insured property losses, and our property losses for the 2018 year are de minimis. it's also worth noting that on a fully developed basis, our catastrophe losses from the 2017 calendar year have turned out to only be about $3 million.
we had another quarter of strong growth. in core e&s, which excludes commercial auto, we grew 18%. submission growth continues to be strong and is increasing, growing 12% relative to the same quarter last year. in commercial auto, we grew 16%, which was due to the growth in our largest account.
in our specialty admitted segment, we grew 11% on the top line from 34% growth in individual risk workers' compensation and 7% growth in fronting premium. our fee income in the quarter in the specialty admitted segment grew to $3.9 million, or 13% from the same quarter a year ago. lastly, we have a robust pipeline of potential fronting deals, probably the most we have had in the six years that we've been pursuing the strategy as part of the specialty admitted segment. while we need to work toward binding many of these deals, i am very encouraged that we can continue to profitably growing in this area of strategic focus.
in casualty reinsurance, we grew by $24.7 million in the quarter due to the shift in the renewal date of one large contract from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. for the full year, this segment shrunk by 42%. but as many of you know, this has been planned as we have carefully refined the book of business over the last 12 months.
from a combined ratio perspective and underwriting profit perspective, i'll cite a few highlights. in e&s, our combined ratio in the quarter was 93% as we continue our strong underwriting results in calendar 2018. in specialty admitted, we had an outstanding quarter with a combined ratio of 81%, and for the full year, we had a combined ratio of 87.4%, the first time we have been in the 80s for many years. in casualty re, while we did have a 99.9% combined ratio in the quarter, for the year, we had a 97.5% combined ratio, which is the best in this segment's history going all the way back to 2008.
let me talk a bit about reserve adequacy. we are through our year-end reserve studies done by our internal actuaries and our external consulting actuaries, and these studies show that our booked reserves are in excess of the actuarial point estimates. we are comfortable that our reserves are in good shape by division, including commercial auto, by segment, and for the group as a whole. so we entered 2019 with a strong balance sheet. we did have some adverse loss reserve development in the quarter from our largest account, which was again from the same place that has been in the past, the 2016 accident year. we are confident, that development from this year is now behind us and that our overall reserves in commercial auto are in very good shape as we head into next year.
for commercial auto, we renewed our largest account with an effective date of march 1st, 2019, and we are appreciative of the continuing -- of continuing the long and collaborative relationship we have had with this insured. we are pleased with the pricing of the renewal, and we continue to work diligently to service this account well across our organization. from an exposure perspective, the renewal consists of about 82% of the mileage that we received in the prior year's contract. however, we expect to have about the same amount of net written premiums from this account in 2019 as we did in 2018, due to changes in geographic mix and coverage in the business that we are writing.
now to pricing outside of commercial auto. in core e&s, renewal rates were up 9.7% in the quarter and 6.5% for the year, which is the highest result we have had in the last 10 years. so the trend on pricing is up, and we are extremely pleased with this, given that core e&s is the largest business in our group. and renewal rate increases don't always capture the pricing power of our business. in the quarter, several new larger accounts were written where our pricing was three to four times what the expiring pricing had been in the admitted market; for example, habitational risks and other commercial auto business such as food delivery.
in our specialty admitted segment, workers' compensation pricing continued to be down, but we continued to see very benign loss activity, so margins remained strong. in casualty re, underlying primary pricing was up 3.2% and pricing on treaties was up 1.5%. so overall, we feel great about pricing across the group and our insurance margins remain healthy.
with that, let me turn it over to sarah.
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
thanks, bob, and good morning, everyone. for the fourth quarter of 2018, we made underwriting profits of $7.1 million, generated an operating profit of $17.1 million and are reporting net income of $11.6 million. for the full year, our operating profit of $70.6 million was 49% higher than it was for 2017 and the second highest that it's been in our company's history.
our expense ratio of 21.3% is an improvement of 1.2 points from the third quarter and came in at 23% for the year, the best annual result in our company's history and a 10 point advantage to our peers' mean results. we believe our annual expense ratio of 23% positions us well for attractive returns. we continue to enjoy strong cash flow from our businesses as operating cash flow for the full year was $290 million, as compared to $208 million last year and $154 million in 2016.
our investment performance has been a key bottom line contributor, as we have grown cash flow and generated above average returns, in particular from a small subset of assets outside of the core fixed income strategy. this subset consists largely of our renewable energy assets, as well as select limited partnerships we've invested in, which have credit and equity attributes. it represents about $72 million of value, or less than 5% of our total investment portfolio.
unfortunately, december's market volatility impacted the portfolio this quarter, and to note, we did book the portfolio through the full end of the year. we've had a loss in two discrete investments, which puts us off pace from where we've been tracking on net investment income for the year.
this year, we grew tangible equity per share almost 10%, including our common dividend, which currently has it above sector yield of approximately 3%, as bob noted. over the course of the quarter, our tangible book value per share grew from $15.95 to $16.34. complementary to our 12% or better rote target, we're focused on growing tangible book value per share. we ended the quarter with tangible shareholders' equity, including our common dividend, of $526.1 million, an increase over the $474.5 million at the end of 2017.
operating leverage for trailing 12-month net premiums written to tangible equity was approximately 1.5:1. we continue to see attractive opportunities for organic growth and reinvestment in our business and look forward to continuing to put our capital to work at very attractive returns for our shareholders.
and finally on taxes, our effective tax rate for the year was 9.9%. while there are many points of impact to our tax rate, we continue to believe that going forward, our tax rate will be similar to historical averages, varying a few points in excess of where it came in on this year.
so with that, let me turn it back to bob.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
thank you, sarah. lastly, i would like to thank all of our 750 employees for their hard work in 2018 in producing these strong results, and we look forward to continued strength in 2019.
operator, that concludes our prepared remarks, would you please open the line for questions?
",":
operator
thank you. (operator instructions)
our first question comes from randy binner with b. riley fbr. your line is now open.
randy binner -- fbr capital markets & co. -- analyst
hey, good morning. thank you. i have a question on reserves, and it has to do with the '17 accident year where there was still a good amount of growth. can you outline why there is the level of confidence there versus the 2016 accident year that's had considerable amount of reserve development?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeah, randy, this is bob. i think it's the same things that we've talked to -- talked about in the past. a lot of the development in 2016 came from um and uim related exposures and a lot of it came from a particular state. and in terms of the '17 renewal, we took rate and underwriting actions both -- and underwriting actions in particular with respect to share that significantly mitigated those -- the causes of the development from 2016. so it's really the same thing that we've communicated in the past, and those underwriting actions have borne out well for us.
randy binner -- fbr capital markets & co. -- analyst
all right. and then just one related question to the commercial auto account. in your opening remarks, you said, you -- post the renewal of the contract going forward, you expect a similar amount of premium. but did you say specifically that they bill like less miles driven, and did you quantify that?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeah, i said that the milage driven will be approximately -- the number of miles will be approximately 82% of what we had in the -- have in the expiring contract, which is ending this month.
randy binner -- fbr capital markets & co. -- analyst
but that's offset by expanded coverage of the liability limit higher? what would offset that? or just price increase?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
well, i'll just go back to it's -- what i said in the prepared remarks. it's really geographic mix as well as the amount of net line, i guess you would say, that we take, and that's bounced around through the years in terms of the share of the risk that we have. and so, it's really from those two things.
randy binner -- fbr capital markets & co. -- analyst
all right. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from mark hughes with suntrust. your line is now open.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much. good morning. when we think about the accident year loss pick for 2019, presumably you've seen good growth in your core business. you're getting better pricing. it seems like your mix is going to shift more in favor of that core e&s in 2019. when we put all that together, should we think current accident year may improve a little bit?
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
i think the way that i think about that, mark, is, we've said consistently through 2018 that we are trying to put a pretty conservative accident year picks, and that's the way that we'll continue to go into 2019 in core. i think we've got a great growth opportunity and strong pricing there, but we want to book high very conservative accident year picks out of the box. so i wouldn't expect to see a big improvement over that versus 2018 right away.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey capital markets -- analyst
at least the logic of those moving parts that sounds reasonable?
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
the other pieces of what you are saying is reasonable based on mix, et cetera, but i'm just kind of addressing the accident year loss pick in particular.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey capital markets -- analyst
understood. for reinsurance, your -- i think your outlook perhaps from here for written premium is steady. when we think about profitability within that line, have you called that to retain the more profitable business, and so you may see some improvement? or should we sort of stick with the kind of high 90s combined ratio?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yes. so, mark, this is bob. the team here -- i'll leave it with this, the team here has done a really good job of calling the book and reducing it pretty significantly. and one of the focuses there, of course, was to focus on the most profitable accounts since we've been doing this business since 2008. and so, i think we are focused on the more profitable business and we are able to retain that obviously with a lower written premium number. there's a little bit of an offset from a scale perspective, right. but i don't -- so we're not really focused on growing that business tremendously.
and as you know, we don't really give specific top line guidance but -- so we're basically -- would expect that to be plus or minus flat in terms of 2019. and where that business ultimately gets priced in terms of the loss ratio and then the sliding scale commission and then when you layer on brokerage and then the overhead expenses and the like, it basically does come up to that high 90s number.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then one final question. the -- in the specialty admitted, your current accident year number popped up into the high 70s, had been running kind of mid-upper 60s. it's a pretty good loss environment, i think, as you describe it. any comment there on why you saw that move up? does it mean anything for 2019?
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
i would say, it really doesn't, mark. it's a bit of an artificial impact of how we book loss and loss adjustment expenses, in the comp business in particular, and that's something we're working on addressing through our somewhat formulaic approach there. but we expect to see continued good experience out of that book as we have through 2018.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much.
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
thank you for the question.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from bijan moazami with compass point research. your line is now open.
bijan moazami -- compass point research & trading -- analyst
good morning, everyone. just want to understand that uber (ph) account a little bit better in terms of the kind of coverages that you guys are providing starting march 1st as compared to last year. in particular, is -- your miles driven is down by 18%. does it mean that you're getting 18% rate increase in order to have a flat premium volume growth for that account? and if you're getting 18% rate increase from that account to remain flat, are you providing something that you didn't provide last year?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
no, just to be clear, i don't make the assumption that's because of rate changes, bijan. again, i would go back to what i said in the prepared remarks, it's really driven by geographic mix changes as well as the coverage that we're providing, right? so whether that's different limits or the share of the limits that we're taking is really the thing that's driving that, right? it's not a rate-driven change. but i would reiterate that we're very happy with the pricing that we're receiving on this renewal.
bijan moazami -- compass point research & trading -- analyst
just to understand better, does that mean that you're getting less miles in a low-rate state and more miles in a higher-rate state?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
well it could be as a result of that, as well as what -- we haven't disclosed it before in terms of the share of the risks that we actually take. but through the years, there have been changes in that share of the risks that we actually assume from a liability perspective. and so -- but let me get back to, i think, a highest level part of your questions in terms of the coverages that we provide. in terms of the coverage we are providing, physical damage coverage for the drivers as well as liability coverage for the drivers, and the physical damage piece of it is something that we've never taken risk on, and we've talked about that before. so we're basically just handling the claims for -- we're there for a fee for that component of the coverage. and then on the liability side, we've -- through the years, we've taken various shares of the liability risk in this contract, and that sort of moved up and down through the years.
bijan moazami -- compass point research & trading -- analyst
great. also on the specialty admitted business, how big the fronting business can become? and also how is the kind of fees that you can charge this year as compared to last year? and finally, how much capital the fronting takes?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeah, that's a great question. so the first thing that i would say, which is similar to what we've said in the past, is, we've gone from zero to about $350 million plus or minus of fronted premium here in the last six years. however, as sarah likes to point out, this is lumpy. the deals can -- you can get no new deals signed in a quarter, you could get a couple or three new deals signed in a quarter, and a year could be some material number above that as well. and so, we have a robust pipeline. i expect that we will continue to grow this fronted business.
we would like it to get meaningfully larger than it is. i think we've made good progress, but we do want to continue to grow it because we do see it, as you pointed out, as pretty capital-light. it's a -- it's really a credit business where you have to manage your credit risk carefully because of the heavy amount of reinsurance that you're buying, and we generally are reinsuring 90% or more of any one of these deals. so that's important. the capital charges for the business really come through reinsurance recoverables, whether you look at that from a regulatory or rating agency perspective, whereas if you have a lot of retained risk, 90% of your capital charges are going to come from net written premiums or reserves. so it is meaningfully lighter from a capital perspective.
and i would say, to your last question around pricing, we are endeavoring to get four to six points of gross front fee on any one of these deals. and that -- those are compelling numbers, and it's generally where the market is. and i would say that we're not really looking -- we're not really looking at stuff that has a gross fee income number that's lower than that unless it's a deal that has really large scale or it's a really large transaction. and as we model it, we feel like something less than that could still give us a very compelling return on a risk on allocated -- or return on allocated capital basis and how much it impacts our infrastructure.
obviously, you can spread a larger deal over the organization and just -- for example, the number of people needed to administer a large deal might be the same number of people that would be needed to administer a smaller deal, right? but we're generally targeting fees in that level, and they are achievable in the marketplace.
bijan moazami -- compass point research & trading -- analyst
one last item. are you guys expanding your admitted licenses to be able to do more fee business or fronting business?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeah, i would say that we are always looking to expand licensure and filings and having perhaps multiple filings on multiple companies and also are continuing to work on e&s licensure as well in this respect. but we do have 50 states. we have broad licensure across the united states. it's more of a by exception situation where we don't have it than where we do.
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
we have licensure in almost every state, both on an e&s and admitted perspective right now for that business, bijan. so we've got full capabilities and looking to take advantage on that.
bijan moazami -- compass point research & trading -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from meyer shields with kbw. your line is now open.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning all. bob, i'm just -- i apologize for pounding on the same issue, but should we expect fees within the excess and surplus lines segment to come down if you are going to retaining some of the physical damage exposure?
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
i don't think we said that we were necessarily there, meyer, on that point, but i would not -- i would expect the fees to continue to decrease, just given the same dynamic that we talked about at the beginning of last year that we are not accounting for the business from a fee perspective as we were in, say, 2016 and even 2017, and it's really a change in accounting. and that impact goes through premium now and not through fees, and there's a bit of a lag in the way that's decreased, but you would continue to expect the fee income in e&s to come down materially over the course of this year, and that to be missed -- that to be represented within the premium income instead.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
okay. no, that's helpful. that's surprising. i hope you could comment a little bit on -- i think there's some seasonality in the core e&s rate increases. they were really strong last fourth quarter. this fourth quarter, a little lagger in between. were this quarter's rate increases a function of the lines of business that are renewing now?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. so it definitely can be, meyer. and i think that -- let me leave it with this. we continue to actively seek rate increases on the book of business overall on renewals, and obviously, we feel very good about pricing of new as well. i would say that in terms of where we did get rate increases, it was pretty broad, it was across, i think, 8 of 12 or -- the divisions within excess and surplus lines. it can be lumpy because of certain renewals at certain date, so to speak. excess casualty, for example, had substantial rate increases in the fourth quarter because some of the business that renewed there, but we also got meaningful rate increases in general casualty and environmental and several of the other divisions as well.
so yeah, i think -- but you're hitting on the point, which is why it did bounce around during the course of the year. sometimes, if you don't have as many renewals in a division that where the market is harder, you won't see as much in the way of rate increases on a blended overall basis. now, i think a perfect example of that is allied healthcare. we had some quite a bit of new and renewal business. and that has a tendency to be q1 dominated. it's sort of january because these have a tendency to be larger accounts and they are more calendar year oriented in terms of when they renew. and so, if you remember, we had a large renewal rate increase there in that division, but throughout the course of the year, there's just been smaller renewal premiums, right? so that sort of weights in less. so i guess that's a long way of saying yes to your question.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. i guess, it all (inaudible) anyhow. and then final question, again, within excess and surplus, outside of the commercial auto, was there any favorable or unfavorable reserves element within core?
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
no, there was not. we just have the $5.8 million of adverse development from the 2016 accident year in commercial auto.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
okay. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from brian meredith with ubs. your line is now open.
seth rosenberg -- ubs equities -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. this is that seth rosenberg stepping in for brian. so back to randy's question on the '16 versus '17 commercial auto, bob, i think you said certainly pricing went up in the state as the year renewed, but you also mentioned underwriting. i'm just trying to understand behaviorally why these two years might act different. were there changes maybe in the terms or policy language? or are you starting to see a benefit from, you see (ph), more cameras in vehicles these days?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
well, i think what we -- just to repeat what we've said in the past, there was an overall rate increase for that entire renewal, and then there was -- we started to do state-specific pricing and then some of the shares were varied by state as well in terms of that year. and florida being the state that has been the most difficult, so we -- that was priced separately and there was a separate share that we took there, but then, we no longer had florida for the 2018 renewal, that's an important thing to mention as well.
seth rosenberg -- ubs equities -- analyst
okay, understood. but in terms of the terms and how the policies structure, the limits, that didn't change between the two years?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
well, it does because of the share that we take, i guess, in terms of our net limit that we're retaining.
seth rosenberg -- ubs equities -- analyst
okay, understood. that's helpful. thank you. and then maybe broader picture on commercial auto, a number of companies that had adverse development this quarter, you hear some talk in the marketplace that maybe it's impacting more the trucking and heavy equipment-type vehicle because there's more attorney involvement, attorneys going after where they see higher limits. are you guys seeing any of that in your book?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. i wouldn't say that we really are. it's -- i think that this is -- this account in this business is (technical difficulty).
operator
pardon me, ladies and gentlemen, please stand by.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
hello?
seth rosenberg -- ubs equities -- analyst
hello?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeah, hi. it's bob myron. i'm sorry, we lost phone connectivity there, but we're dialed back in.
seth rosenberg -- ubs equities -- analyst
sure. so, i think you were, i think you were saying you haven't seen a real impact from attorney involvement?
(technical difficulty)
operator
and pardon me, speakers, you may begin. (technical difficulty)
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
hello, this is bob myron.
seth rosenberg -- ubs equities -- analyst
hey, bob, still here.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
okay. i'm sorry about that. we're sitting in bermuda and we're having some technical difficulties here. so we've dialed back in on a cellphone. so would you mind repeating the question?
seth rosenberg -- ubs equities -- analyst
sure. so just kind of broad picture, you heard a number of companies this quarter talking, well, seeing some reserve charges and higher loss picks on commercial auto. some companies have spoken about more attorney involvement, particularly focused on more the trucking space where lawyers can target higher limits. so i'm just curious, in your book and the dynamics you have, do you see any of that?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeeah. i wouldn't say that we necessarily do. i think this book is reasonably different than more traditional taxi cab or trucking-related commercial auto accounts. i don't really think that it's necessarily being driven by the same things that you're hearing from other people. i think it's really just where the contract at the time was priced and losses and exposure coming out of uninsured and -- uninsured motorists. and so, we took some meaningful corrective actions on that in 2017 and then again in 2018. and so, i think, that's really the story here.
seth rosenberg -- ubs equities -- analyst
okay, great. thanks. and one last one shifting gears, so no special dividend. i know you guys have previously spoken about sort of the deploy versus return strategy. am i thinking about it the right way that sort of the 12% rote that you're targeting this year, that's sort of the right threshold to think about in terms of how you're thinking about deploying capital versus returning it?
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
i think -- sorry, this is sarah doran. i think what we're -- our guidance is 12% or better return on tangible equity, just to highlight that for a second. and we pay an above-average, as we've kind of commented on in the call, ordinary common dividend at that 3% level. we feel like that is a very effective capital management strategy for us. and i think what we said consistently through 2018 is, we had great opportunity to put our capital to work, given this rate environment and what we're seeing, especially in core e&s and in other places. we'd like to continue to do that, rather than focus on the special dividend, especially if we're already -- we feel like we're effectively and efficiently managing capital through the ordinary.
seth rosenberg -- ubs equities -- analyst
sure.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
and i just want to make one other point clear too is that we are -- when we had normally declared a dividend was -- a special dividend would have been in -- when we released our third quarter results.
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
yeah, that's a good point, just a quarter ago, yeah.
seth rosenberg -- ubs equities -- analyst
got it.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
that wasn't done...
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
we don't do that in the fourth quarter, yeah.
seth rosenberg -- ubs equities -- analyst
got it. okay. thank you, guys, very much.

2018-Q3,JRVR,,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to third quarter 2018 james river group ltd. earnings conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. instructions will follow at that time. (operator instructions) as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, kevin copeland, head of investor relations. you may begin, sir.
kevin b. copeland -- senior vice president, finance, & chief investment officer
thank you, nicole. good morning everyone and welcome to the james river group third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. these statements are based on current beliefs, intentions, expectations, and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k, form 10-qs, and other reports and filings we make with the securities and exchange commission. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
i will now turn the call over to bob myron, president and chief executive officer of james river group.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
thank you, kevin, and good morning, everyone. this is bob myron, president and ceo, and with me today are sarah doran, our cfo, and kevin copeland, our chief investment officer, who you just heard from us and who also leads investor relations. we have a few prepared remarks and then we look forward to taking your questions.
we have posted another solid quarter and we've generated an annualized return on tangible equity of 15.1% for the year-to-date, well above our guidance of 12% or greater. we had good top and bottom line performance in each of our three segments with underwriting results showing an overall improvement from a year ago, as highlighted in our press release.
our combined ratio for the group came in at 96% and we had good combined ratios at all three segments. we didn't have any material property losses in the quarter from any of the noteworthy catastrophic events or otherwise, nor do we currently anticipate any material losses from events in the fourth quarter to-date. we had net adverse loss reserve development in two of our segments, but it didn't have a significant impact on our underwriting results. pricing continues to be attractive in our e&s book and i expect market conditions will continue to be positive going forward.
our specialty admitted segment continued to see favorable loss emergence (inaudible) year-to-date, and this quarter generated a combined ratio of 87.3%, its lowest in recent memory, as our fronting business is now a meaningful contributor to the segment. our investment performance was again very strong.
let me talk about a few of these things in some more detail, and then i'll hand it over to sarah. regarding growth, in our e&s segment, we had strong growth overall, growing in eight of our 13 underlying divisions. the commercial auto division grew 17%, substantially assisted by the significant rate increases we previously obtained on our largest account back in march. in our core e&s book, we grew 7.4%.
this was substantially driven by strong growth in excess casualty, which was up 28%, in general casualty, which was up 16%, and in environmental, which was up 126%, but on a small premium base. growth across all three was characterized by both the addition of new accounts and meaningful rate increases on renewals.
submissions for the e&s segment overall were up 7% in the quarter over a year ago, which is right in line with where we've been in the last two years, 7% to 10% per quarter. our average premium per account in the quarter was about $17,800, which is the lowest it's been in a few years. that's fine with us. it just means that the larger accounts are becoming more competitive, and we're happy to walk away from them if we don't think we can get good pricing.
in the specialty admitted segment, we grew gross written premiums by 31% in individual risk workers' comp and 14% in the fronting division. this growth is due to increased submission flow, the continued strong economy, and the inception of the new fronted deals we also discussed last quarter. submissions for our individual risk workers' comp segment were up 60% in the quarter. this was due to the addition of several new underwriters and marketing staff over the last year or so.
in the casualty reinsurance segment, while we did shrink the book in line with expectations, the renewal date of above $50 million of premium was pushed out from the third quarter of this year to the fourth, creating new lumpy comparison.
now with respect to pricing. in core e&s, which is all business in the segment excluding commercial auto, renewal pricing was up 2% in the quarter. when looking only at accounts under $100,000 in premium, renewal pricing was up 3% in the quarter. in our specialty admitted segment, rates were down for workers' compensation 1.2%, but net of underlying index lost cost changes, we believe margins held steady. in the casualty reinsurance segment, there was an approximate 3.3% rate increase on the underlying primary contracts and an approximate 1.4% increase in the reinsurance treaty pricing this quarter.
let me now speak a bit about loss reserves and our accident year loss picks. in our e&s segment, we had adverse loss reserve development of approximately $10.4 million, which was basically all from the 2016 accident year on our commercial auto division, and principally from one large account and one state. in 2017, we separately priced the state and also had a lower share of the risks that we did in 2016. in 2018, we no longer write this state.
now, overall, the 2018 accident year on our commercial auto division is developing well, which is a result of very significant increases in pricing as well as other underwriting actions we have taken in this account in the last two years. the 2018 contract is approximately three times the size of the 2016 contract. a reduction in the current accident year loss pick of a few loss ratio points resulted in an ibnr take-down in the quarter that substantially offset the adverse loss reserve development from the 2016 year.
we are comfortable the current year accident year loss pick is still conservative and prudent and are very comfortable with our overall level of reserves in the division and the segment. on a groupwide basis, our case reserves are strong and our ibnr as a percentage of total reserves is at 63%, which is notable given that we have been waiting and had shorter tail casualty business in the last few years. on a groupwide basis, our accident year loss ratio was 67.5%, down from 78.2% a year ago, principally from this reduction in the commercial auto current year loss pick.
with that, let me turn the call over to our cfo, sarah doran.
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
thanks, bob. good morning, everyone. for the fourth quarter of 2018, we made strong underwriting profit of $8.1 million, generated operating profit of $19.4 million, and are reporting net income of $19.6 million. our combined ratio has improved as compared to the prior quarter as both the loss and expense ratios have declined. and while our expense ratio improved as compared to both the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year, we continue to believe that a mid-20s expense ratio is very attractive for our franchise and our mix of business. this quarter, the ratio has benefited from the continued growth of our specialty admitted business as well as certain lines within core e&s that entail attractive ceding commissions.
complementing our underwriting performance, investment income grew about 10% as compared to the prior quarter and even about 3% as compared to the sequential quarter. this was principally due to our larger investment portfolio and rising rates on our floating rate loan portfolio, which more than offset a decline in our renewable energy portfolio.
we continue to enjoy strong cash flow from our businesses as operating cash flow this quarter was $87.8 million as compared to $55.7 million in the third quarter of last year. in line with this, cash and investments have continued to grow and up for about 10% year-to-date -- 12% year-to-date, excuse me. while we would not expect this growth to continue at current levels, given we have actively reduced our third-party reinsurance business, our portfolio has been the beneficiary of the strong growth in our business these last few quarters.
and finally, on taxes. our effective tax rate this quarter was 11.5%. while there are many points of impact on our tax rate, we continue to believe that the full year rate will be similar to historical averages.
we ended the quarter with tangible shareholders' equity of $477.7 million, an increase over the $469.4 million at the end of the second quarter of this year. operating leverage, or trailing 12 months net premiums written to tangible equity, was 1.5 to 1 times. as we mentioned in prior quarters, we have elected not to pay a special dividend this year, given the attractive opportunities we continue to see in putting our capital to work in our growing insurance businesses.
and with that, i'll turn it back to bob. bob?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
thank you, sarah. in closing, i feel great about our performance year-to-date and for our guidance for the year. so there is no change to that. pricing continues to be up, submissions continue to be up. we are getting strong growth where we are targeting at, and we feel great about the performance of the most recent years in our commercial auto book.
this concludes our prepared remarks. operator, we are now ready to open up the call for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. (operator instructions) and our first question comes from mark hughes from suntrust. your line is now open.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
yeah. thanks very much. good morning.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
good morning.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
i wonder if you could talk about the adverse development in the quarter. you've given some very good detail. i'm sort of curious maybe at a little more practical level, what you're seeing on severity of these cases just lingering on and the, whatever, settlements or payouts higher than expected, how many claims are still going through some sort of adjudication process where they still continue to develop, just a little more detail would be helpful.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
sure. and mark, you're talking about the 2016 year specifically.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
yes, exactly.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
and the underlying cause of that. yeah, i would say that it's -- obviously as mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's concentrated in florida and it's really a severity issue there and it's really around um, uim, and that's underinsured or uninsured motorist related claims. and it's not really necessarily related to litigation. it's really more of just settlements on what the absolute value of those claims are. so it's really a severity thing based upon the regulatory environment in florida and not really frequency driven.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
anything you can say about how many open claims are there or at least just some sense of the magnitude of the risk that you could have potentially more adverse?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. sure. so i don't have the statistics specifically for florida, but i can tell you for the accident year on aggregate, 98% of the claims for the accident year have been closed. so it's a pretty substantial number. i think we've said a number of times that this book of business, given what it is and also given our proactive claims handling here, it's meaningfully shorter tail and shorter duration than the rest of our casualty business.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
and then a final question, your underwriting leverage, is that influencing your growth outlook at all? are you being a little more selective in the business you'll take in light of your capital situation?
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
no, i wouldn't say that we are. only that we're focused on the insurance businesses rather than the reinsurance business. so that's where the growth has shown up year-to-date and we would continue for it to be so, mark. and that's in line with some of the tax changes that came down at the end of last year and the structural changes that we made that we've been discussing throughout the year, but i wouldn't say that -- at all that the capital is influencing the growth in our insurance businesses.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from brian meredith from ubs. your line is now open.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
yeah, thanks. a couple of questions here for you. just curious, bob and sarah, 2016 year developed adversely. why aren't the loss trends that you're seeing in '16 also impacting your '17 year picks? i understand it's a different rate on that business, it's much higher, but wouldn't the loss trends have an impact on the '17 year also if that kind of would be getting elevated?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i mean, a couple of things. first of all, we took significant underwriting and pricing action in '17 and then of course '18 as well, and so that was -- we've had pricing increases, on top of pricing increases and the reunderwriting actions that were principally around the shares of the risks we might take by state, for example, and some other smaller things. but given that, the thing that has made 2017 so -- 2016 so problematic has really been florida, whereby we had a materially reduced share of that risk in '17 along with a separate pricing for that state. that is the reason why we haven't seen it leak into 2017 and 2017 has held. and i think that another important thing that -- in this regard is for the group as a whole, we -- in the past, we've generally had third-party actuarial work done in the latter half of the year, in the fourth quarter, but in this year, some of the third-party actuarial work that's done by outsiders that was done in the fourth quarter of last year was done in the third quarter of this year, specifically around commercial auto and workers' comp and some other lines of business. so the result of that work is reflected in this quarter's results.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great. and then a second question on workers' compensation insurance. one very, very large workers' compensation insurance writer out there noted rising frequency as a result of this very low employment environment . just curious what your thoughts are on that. it doesn't sound like you're seeing it in your book, but is it something that you're keeping a watchful eye on?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
this is in workers' compensation?
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
correct. workers' compensation, the individual comp in your specialty admitted business.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. i don't think we have seen a real increase in frequency. there is actually a -- there is a -- maybe i'll weave this into the change in the accident year loss pick. we saw some elevated reported loss ratios in the first nine months of last year, and it started to appear as though -- it started to appear as though we were, in particular, getting some severity increases and then just with a number of policies in force and/or number of people in the workforce, some frequency activity as well. and that's the reason why, on the year-to-date through last september 30th, 2017 we ended up having a materially higher current accident year loss pick. we put in place the 50% quota share effective october 1st last year, and since that point in time, we've seen nothing, but low reported loss ratios again. and they've been meaningfully low, right back to the level that they were at in the several prior years prior to 2017. so we are not really seeing frequency and severity issues in the workers' compensation book in the last four quarters.
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
yeah. but we're absolutely keeping an eye on it, as you'd expect us to, and the increased submission count that -- of 60% that bob mentioned is his prepared remarks is nice and powerful, but our growth has been pretty moderate certainly as compared to that as we want to keep a close eye and be selective around that. comp is cyclical.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
comp is cyclical. we obviously are off a peak from a pricing perspective, and so i think it's -- we got to watch it really carefully, as sarah says, just that (inaudible). what -- we will start to see loss cost inflation at some point, but we've not seen it yet. and i think to the extent we do, we're well protected with a 50% quota share, and then a meaningful excess of loss tower as well that sits on top of that workers' comp book. we're buying $29.4 million excess of $600,000, i think. so that should take any severity issues out of the equation as well, and we like the ceding commission that we're getting on the quota share treaty there. so i think we're in good shape to weather what might be coming. we just haven't seen it yet.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from meyer shields from kbw. your line is now open.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
great. thanks. i was wondering whether it's possible to quantify, i guess, by accident year, if we look outside of florida in commercial auto at the average incurred loss per, i don't know, 1,000 miles, how accident year '18 compares to accident year '16 and '17.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
the average incurred loss, i guess, you're talking about that from a perspective excluding rates, right? you're just talking about absolute dollars.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
exactly.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think in terms -- given our mix and the fact that with the 40 states that we have and there is some less volatile states in there and some less higher, but it's down a little bit, meyer. and then of course, on top of that, we've gotten very significant price increases. and then i would also say that there has been some modest frequency declines, and that's been because of the driver actions that our client has taken in terms of improving the driver pool. the folks that we deal with there, they're not only the heads of insurance, but also what they call safety division as well, and they've done a lot of good work on better screening for drivers, in terms of calling drivers who have had negative reviews and/or accidents and/or complaints and things like that. and so that has manifested itself in the frequency numbers that we've seen as well.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
okay. no, that's very helpful. second question, as -- casualty reinsurance, i guess, setting aside $50 million timing shift, should the shrinkage in casualty reinsurance premiums translate to -- or have any impact on the investment portfolio duration?
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
no, i don't think so, meyer. i mean, it's -- the duration of our e&s business and even of the little that we retain in the specialty admitted business is not dissimilar to what we write in the casualty re business. so i wouldn't think that the investment duration will be that different either, if i think about the dynamics of answering your question, that's the way i think about it at least.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
yeah. no, that (inaudible). that's perfect. thank you so much.
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
and obviously we're not absolutely asset-liability matching just given it's a p&c business, but yeah.
operator
thank you. (operator instructions) and our next question comes from randy binner from b. riley. your line is now open.
randy binner -- fbr capital markets -- analyst
good morning. thanks. i came in late. so i apologize if this has been asked, but can you share what the statutory or schedule p developed loss ratio is for your commercial auto line in 2016 and 2017 with -- including this quarter?
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
well, i want to be careful about providing information that's too specific to an individual client, but i think it's -- the 2016 year obviously is a significant loss position from a ratio perspective. and then i think that the '17 year is not materially different than where it would have been at the end of last year, and then we feel very good about a conservative accident year pick that we are still booking on the '18 year, given all the magnitude of the pricing and underwriting changes. and so '17 and '18 are still booked at levels that are resulting in underwriting profits, and we feel good about those years.
randy binner -- fbr capital markets -- analyst
and then on operating leverage, the -- i guess, the -- i think this may have been covered before, but i -- it seems like it's around 0.8 times. so the way we measure it is last 12 months net written premiums over total gaap capital. i understand that there is different ways to measure it, but because it's an offshore company, that's what we use, so -- and just in general, that would be pretty conservative from an operating leverage perspective. i think it would be closer to 1. what -- without the special here, what kind of a good operating outlook for the business, what's the right operating leverage? is this the right operating leverage we should expect in 2019, 2020 and beyond?
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
i think that there is room. we measure it a little bit differently. we get to 1.5 times to 1 times and that's down a little bit from last quarter's 1.7 times to 1 times. i think that we have room likely above the 1.7 times to 1 times. so we have room from an operating leverage, we have a safe room from a financial leverage perspective as well. so there is a fair amount of room to run as we look at the growth opportunities in our insurance businesses over the next year or so.
we just felt like that was a better use of capital and we've been saying that this whole year rather than paying the special that we don't feel like we get quite candidly a lot of credit for given that we've only been paying it for a couple of years. so we wanted to get the 15% operating return on capital that we've gotten on our business kind of year-to-date and kind of blow that out over the next couple of quarters with that capital as well rather than paying a special this year.
randy binner -- fbr capital markets -- analyst
how does your calculation work?
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
yeah. we get to 1.5 times to 1 times, randy, which is what i said in my prepared remarks, which is just 12 months net written to gaap capital, tangible capital.
randy binner -- fbr capital markets -- analyst
tangible capital. got it. okay. thank you.
sarah c. doran -- chief financial officer
i might be at a delta.
operator
thank you. and i am showing no further questions at this time. i would now like to turn the call back to bob myron, president and ceo, for any further remarks.
robert p. myron -- chief executive officer
thank you everyone for your time this quarter, and we look forward to talking to you again in three months.
operator
