greetings, and welcome to rackspace technology fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, joe crivelli, vice president of investor relations.
joe crivelli -- vice president of investor relations
good afternoon, everyone. welcome to rackspace technology's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. with me today are kevin jones, our chief executive officer; and amar maletira, our president and chief financial officer. the slide deck we will refer to today can be found on our investor relations website.
on slide 2, you'll see that certain comments we make on this call will be forward-looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which would cause actual results to differ. a discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. rackspace technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call except as required by law.
our presentation includes certain non-gaap financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures which we believe provide useful information to our investors. in accordance with sec rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable gaap measures. reconciliations are found in the tables included in today's earnings release and our slide presentation, both of which are available on our website. after our prepared remarks, we will take your questions.
i'll now turn the call over to kevin. 
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, and thanks for joining us to discuss the fourth-quarter financial results. it was another excellent quarter for rackspace technology and we are excited to share the results with you. i'll start by giving an overview of the quarter, as well as, additional perspective on the massive multicloud market opportunity that we are addressing and the competitive advantages that are enabling our success. then, amar maletira, our president and chief financial officer, will walk through the financial results in more detail.
on that topic, please join me in welcoming amar to his first official earnings call. he has made a huge impact on how we operate and view the company, and he will share his perspective with you. and i will make some concluding remarks before we open the call for questions. as you can see on slide 5, it was another strong quarter for rackspace technology.
the sales bookings success we've discussed in recent quarters is positively impacting the top line. and in addition, we are seeing very strong earnings leverage and resulting growth in profitability. revenue was $716 million in the quarter. this was up 14% compared to last year's fourth quarter and 5%, compared to the third quarter of 2020.
excluding our legacy openstack business, core revenue growth was even stronger at 18% year over year and 6%, compared to the third quarter. revenue growth was driven by the strong bookings growth we've delivered over the past year, as well as, continued improvement in net revenue retention. as noted on the slide, our land-and-expand strategy is working. bookings were $293 million in the quarter and core net revenue retention increased to 101% from 100% in the third quarter.
the rackspace technology sales engine is firing on all cylinders. and i continue to be pleased with our sales execution, as well as, our customer success organization which is finding new ways to increase business with our installed base. adjusted ebitda was $199 million, up 6% year over year and 4%, sequentially. amar will talk more about the puts and takes there in a moment.
but the key takeaway for investors is that earnings growth is materially outpacing revenue growth. non-gaap operating profit was up 23% year over year and 12%, sequentially. and non-gaap earnings per share was $0.26, up 24% year over year and 37%, compared to the third quarter. this earnings leverage was driven by our scalable business model, best-in-class automation, as well as, the transformation programs we've executed to date.
i'm also pleased that we refinanced our senior notes in the fourth quarter and reduced the rate on this debt by nearly 40% which will deliver significant cash interest savings for the company and our investors. and we followed this up by refinancing our term loan b earlier this month, extending the maturity of this debt for an additional seven years. we now have no significant debt maturities until 2028. amar will provide more details about this in a moment.
turning to slide 6. i want to spend a few moments discussing why we believe that rackspace technology is a compelling investment for shareholders with a long runway for continued growth. multicloud has exploded in the past two years because it helps customers save money, quickly scale up, scale down, and change their business model. the customers no longer pick just one cloud platform and build their whole business on it.
customers want to diversify, taking some of their compute resources on one platform while operating on other platforms for competitive reasons. some applications may run better on one platform versus another, so other data may belong only on private cloud for privacy or security reasons while legacy applications may be too cumbersome or expensive to move to the cloud. validating this, on the left side of the slide, 81% of cloud users are working with two or more cloud providers, according to gartner, but multicloud is complex. the landscape is constantly changing with new rules, new pricing, and new service offerings.
as a result, even the most sophisticated it organizations at the world's largest companies need help managing their multicloud environment. so in the middle of the slide, you see that 75% of customers are using multicloud managed services. gartner is forecasting that multicloud will continue to grow into a $520 billion market opportunity by 2023. the great news for our investors is that this is almost an entirely white space for rackspace technology and gives years of runway for continued growth.
as shown on slide 7, rackspace technology has painstakingly built a product portfolio that helps companies from small business to mid-market to enterprise navigate the entire life cycle of their multicloud journey, including the infrastructure, applications, data and security. we provide an end-to-end stack of services across all these lines of business, including advisory services, design and implementation services, as well as, managed services where we operate and continually optimize these environments. we have these capabilities at scale across private cloud and all the major public cloud hyperscale. we believe there is no other services provider in the industry that can deliver the breadth or depth of capabilities in multicloud.
turning to slide 8. it's worth noting that one of the biggest challenges that customers face in their digital transformation is staffing. it professionals with cloud expertise and certifications are some of the most sought-after talent in the world today. and by and large, they prefer to work at a technology company.
at rackspace technology, we are able to attract and train the best it talent across the globe. so as shown on this slide, a key rackspace technology asset is the collective value that is represented by our 7,200 rackers and depth of talent and expertise in multicloud that they bring to the table for our customers. on the right side of the slide, you'll note that we have certifications and recognitions from all of the public cloud hyperscalers and many leading cloud software companies. on slide 9, rackspace fabric is the proprietary software that underpins our industry-leading automation.
it includes over 200 unique tools and components to deliver our services. rackspace fabric represents an investment of more than $1 billion and 12 million hours of highly skilled professional time. we believe it gives us a sustainable competitive advantage that would be difficult, if not impossible, for a competitor to replicate. here's why.
over the course of over two decades in the cloud business, we've seen a lot of workflows and any time a racker sees the same task multiple times with different customers, they write code to automate the task. we also use advanced machine learning tools to identify work that can be automated. so we have a critical mass of automation based upon institutional knowledge and know-how that we continue to increment every year. approximately 75% of our workloads are automated today, an industry-leading figure that increased dramatically in 2020, and we continue to optimize our automation to drive further efficiency gains in our business.
on slide 10, one of rackspace technology's significant accomplishments in 2020 was being recognized as a leader in the forrester wave for hosted private cloud services in north america and the forrester wave for multicloud managed services provider. you can see that rackspace technology was the only company identified as a leader in both forrester studies. in addition, the horizontal axis identified rackspace technology as having the strongest strategy of any of the companies mentioned. we were also named a leader in the gartner 2020 magic quadrant for public cloud infrastructure, professional, and managed services worldwide.
i want to share some examples of how we are helping customers to navigate their journey to the cloud. on slide 11, let's talk about mrs. t's, the leading manufacturer of frozen pierogies in the united states. to give you a sense of scale, mrs.
t's makes over 600 million pierogies a year. mrs. t's needed help moving to google cloud as part of an erp system migration. with rackspace technology's help, they completed the very complex process in just seven months which is shorter than all-time lines and estimates.
in addition, the migration helped them modernize their sales forecasting capabilities and accelerate transaction processing by up to 60% with minimal downtime and no disruption. this is a great case study of a complex cross-functional solution from rackspace technology, including business and it transformation, managed public cloud, migration services, application services, and managed storage. the customer's it director in commenting on migration said, rackspace technology was a one-stop shop, a single pane of glass, one partner that can do everything. finally, last week, we were awarded sap on google cloud expertise certification for our work with mrs.
t's. this is a major step in our differentiation with google and potential joint clients. on slide 12, the autopets litter robot is an internet of things solution enabled by rackspace technology. in autopets' case, the company needed to modernize its infrastructure, enhance the customer onboarding experience, and improve application speed and reliability.
one of the reasons multicloud is growing today is because it helps companies quickly scale up. with help from our onica team within rackspace technology, autopets migrated to the cloud and was able to quickly scale its business from just 500 users at the onset of the relationship to over 100,000 users today. as you can imagine, their revenue during this period grew exponentially. i'm proud of the work we did for autopets because it utilized a wide cross-section of aws solutions, as well as, cloud-native application development, our own internet of things solutions, and ultimately, increased product reliability while lowering costs.
now amar will take you through our financial results in more detail, and i'll make some concluding remarks before we open for q&a. amar?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, kevin, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. before getting into the financials, let me share some initial observation as the incoming cfo. i've been in the technology industry for more than 25 years and i've seen multiple technology and business cycles. however, what we are experiencing today in the it marketplace with digital transformation and shift of workloads to multicloud is truly unprecedented, and i believe we are just at the beginning of a massive multiyear cycle.
rackspace technology is well-positioned to benefit from this secular trend. we are addressing an attractive and growing market. we have the right strategy, a good execution machine, and an overall momentum in the business. the results we announced today are evidence of that fact.
with that said, let me get into the details of our financial results. slide 14 shows key financial metrics for the three months ended december 31st, 2020. bookings were up 27% to $293 million from $231 million last year. this is the second-best quarter in the company's history and was driven by continued strong execution by our sales and customer success organization.
total revenue in the fourth quarter at $716 million increased 14%, compared to last year's fourth quarter, and core revenue increased 18%, while pro forma core revenue grew 14%. this was driven by the success we have had over the past year as new bookings have converted into revenue. multicloud revenue grew 19%, and apps and cross platform grew 13% year over year. fourth-quarter earnings growth outpaced revenue growth.
non-gaap operating profit was up 23%, compared to last year and non-gaap eps was up 24%. this was driven by our top-line growth, cost transformation, and ongoing efficiency programs. non-gaap eps also benefited from lower interest expense due to repayment and refinancing of our debt. we continue to actively manage both the operating and financial levers in the company to optimize profitability and cash.
on slide 15, for the full year, bookings at $1.126 billion were up 61% driven by broad-based growth in multicloud, as well as, apps and cross platform. this was largely due to sales execution and overall growth in the multicloud market. this led to 11% growth in total revenue at $2.7 billion. our core revenue grew 15% year over year and pro forma core revenue grew 9%.
non-gaap operating profit for the full year at $473 million was up 14%, and non-gaap eps at $0.83 was up 118%. these were driven by revenue growth, cost transformation programs, and reduced interest expense. slide 16 provides the breakdown of revenue by business segment and by geography for fiscal year 2020. the multicloud segment represented 79% of revenue in 2020 and grew 17% year over year.
apps and cross platform was 13% of revenue and grew 5% year over year. we have multiple opportunities in this business segment as the market continues to evolve. we will selectively and strategically invest in new offerings and expect this segment to accelerate in the next few years. our openstack public cloud business which we are not actively marketing was 8% of total revenue for the full year and declined by 20%.
geographically, the americas at $2 billion in revenue represented 75% of 2020 revenue and grew 13% year over year. emea represented 22% of revenue and grew 4% while apj at 3% of revenue grew 9% year over year. we believe we are underpenetrated in emea and apj and have a solid runway for growth in these two regions. over the past year, in these two regions, we have enhanced our leadership, refined our go-to-market strategy, and broadened our sales coverage and we expect these efforts to drive results in the coming years.
we expanded our global presence in 2020. we entered additional countries such as new zealand, japan, the u.a.e., egypt, ireland, south africa, malaysia, bahrain, and other places in southeast asia. slide 17 is a snapshot of our cash flow metrics for the fourth quarter and full year. for the fourth quarter, adjusted ebitda was $199 million, up 6% year over year and 4%, sequentially.
capital expenditures were $51 million. if you do the math, adjusted free cash flow which we define as adjusted ebitda less capex was $148 million. for the full year, adjusted ebitda was $763 million, up 3% compared to 2019, and capital expenditures were $225 million. adjusted free cash flow was $538 million.
capital intensity was 7% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. we expect capital intensity to be slightly higher in the first half of 2021 due to investments we are making in the business and should be in the range of 7% to 9% for the full year. we ended the year with cash and equivalents at $105 million and we have $375 million of undrawn revolving credit facility. turning to slide 18.
over the past two years, non-gaap operating margins have trended up over 4 times and consistently been in the mid- to high-teens. this was a result of our ongoing opex efficiency programs to drive higher productivity across sg&a functions while making targeted investments in our go-to-market to increase market coverage. at the same time frame, we delivered higher net income margin which further reflects lower interest expense as we optimize our capital structure. while we are on this topic, i would like to address the adjusted ebitda and gross margin trends.
adjusted ebitda margins reflect a shift to a capital-light model, as depreciation and amortization expense continue to decline with lower capital intensity, and gross margins reflect where we are in a growth phase. first, we are a solution provider, and as most of our new customers are in the initial phase of their cloud journey, their spend is more weighted to infrastructure compared to services. second, we are making the investments to build our installed base as part of our land-and-expand strategy. while public cloud infrastructure carries gross margins below our corporate average, it is gross profit dollar accretive and delivers a consistently high return on investment.
third, during this growth phase of land and expand, we expect gross margins to be approximately mid-30%, plus or minus a couple of points, and operating margins in the mid- to high-teens which is in line with or better than, most u.s.-based best-in-class solutions providers. and fourth, as we sell higher-margin services over the life of our installed base, we should see both our gross margin and operating margin profile improve over time from favorable revenue mix and operating leverage. we believe that non-gaap operating margin is the best metric to gauge our performance as we make this business model shift to capture the secular growth trend in multicloud. now turning to slide 19 and our capital structure.
since the last earnings call, we have completely refinanced all outstanding debt. this generated significant interest savings and we now have no meaningful debt maturities for the next seven years. in total, our debt repayments and refinancing after ipo will reduce our total interest expense by $75 million to $80 million annually. now before i talk about our expectations for fiscal year 2021, on slide 20, i want to recap how we performed against the guidance provided immediately after our ipo.
we guided to four primary metrics for 2020: total revenue growth, core revenue growth, adjusted ebitda, and non-gaap eps. as you can see here, we exceeded the forecast for the year for each of these metrics. our outperformance was driven by the continued significant growth of the multicloud market, the sales transformation programs that we implemented to capitalize on this growth, cost transformation programs which are ongoing, and optimize earnings leverage for the company, and lower interest expense from our debt repayment and refinancing. so with that as a backdrop, let me share our outlook for 2021.
on slide 21, you will see our outlook for the coming year. for the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. this is an implied growth of 11% year over year at the midpoint which is an acceleration from 6% pro forma revenue growth in fiscal 2020. also, investors can assume 48% of the guided revenue in the first half and 52% in the second half of fiscal 2021.
core revenue in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, this is an implied growth of 13% year over year at the midpoint which is also an acceleration from 9% pro forma revenue growth in fiscal 2020. non-gaap operating profit in the range of $500 million to $530 million which represents 9% growth at the midpoint. we expect about 46% of our operating profit in the first half and 54% in the second half of fiscal 2021 which is roughly in line with our historical seasonality. non-gaap earnings per share in the range of $0.95 to $1.05 per share or 20% growth at the midpoint.
non-gaap other income or expenses of $226 million to $233 million of expense. non-gaap tax expense rate is expected to be at 26%, and we expect non-gaap weighted average shares of 210 million to 214 million. with that, i will turn the call back to kevin for closing remarks. kevin?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
thanks, amar. before we open for questions, let me reiterate why we believe rackspace technology is extremely well-positioned to capitalize on what is estimated to be a $520 billion multicloud market opportunity by 2023. turning to slide 23. multicloud is arguably the hottest sector in technology today.
every company on the planet from small business to mid-market to enterprise is evaluating how they can best apply multicloud to improve their business and drive efficiency and agility. secondly, multicloud is incredibly complex. it is not simply moving data to a new provider then calling it good. there are a myriad of factors that it departments need to consider: deciding which app works best on which platform, effectively migrating data, ensuring bulletproof security, managing legacy storage infrastructure in a multicloud environment, and staying on top of a landscape that is literally changing daily.
it departments need help with all of them, so we believe rackspace technology is extremely well-positioned to be the partner of choice. we have the automation, the expertise, and the partners to help customers of all sizes to optimize their multicloud journey, all wrapped in the fanatical customer experience we are known for, and we are the leading pure-play multicloud services and solutions company. 2020 was an important proof point of our value proposition. we grew core revenue of 15%, bookings 61%, non-gaap operating profit 14%, and non-gaap earnings per share by 118%.
we restructured our balance sheet to ensure years of financial flexibility and we set the stage for years of incremental revenue growth, earnings growth, and enhancement of shareholder value. so i am very pleased with where rackspace technology stands at the beginning of 2021. we expect to deliver great results for our shareholders in the years to come. with that, we will take your questions.
operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from dan perlin with rbc.
dan perlin -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, guys. good evening. i hope things are well. i just wanted to circle back to the non-gaap operating profit guidance of $500 million to $530 million.
it was a little bit light of what we were expecting. it has kind of implicit margins that are actually declining a little bit year on year. and amar, i know you kind of talked about it a little bit in your prepared remarks in terms of the shift, but maybe you could walk us through like what's explicitly embedded in those assumptions, both from a gross margin perspective but also just as we think about the cadence of this shift, as well as, the investments that are going to take place throughout the year.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so thanks, dan, and absolutely. let me just start with saying that when you look at our guidance, we are way ahead of our plan on the revenue side. we are guiding to a very healthy 11% growth which is an acceleration from the 6% pro forma growth that we saw in fiscal 2020. and on the profit side, we are growing operating profits at 9% and eps at 20%, and within that guide, we are making investments for growth.
so just to be clear here, we have a huge opportunity in front of us. there's a tectonic shift happening in multicloud and we are running this business for the long haul. so we are making certain growth investments and i will give you some of the compositions here, dan, shortly. but let me just touch on this topic of growth investments because this is an important point that we are trying to make here.
so when you think about our growth investments in the business, it's quite broad-based, including our go-to-market team, operations, professional services which is the tip of the spear. we are also launching new service offerings and i will touch on that shortly, and we expect some of these investments to be more weighted toward the first half of 2021. now let me give you some additional color on two areas of investments which will touch on your topic about the gross margins and gross profit, as well as, the operating profit. so the two areas are in -- one is in our new services-and-solutions offering and second is in our land-and-expand strategy.
so dan, at the core, we are a technology company. so we are making investments in innovative services that will clearly redefine the way these services are offered, consumed, as well as, delivered in a multicloud environment. so it's all about addressing this huge multicloud opportunity that we have in front of us. so we will be launching new -- these new market-leading products and services starting in the first half of 2021.
it will be our most exciting year in the history of the company with new services offering on tap in managed public cloud with service blocks 2.0 where we are redefining managed services in the public cloud using elastic engineering. by the way, we have tested this with the customers. they love it. we are totally reimagining the way private cloud gets delivered with our next-generation offering which is more capital-light.
again, in line with our strategy to moving toward more capital-light offerings. this will immensely benefit the customers as we offer a hybrid of multi-tenancy and single tenancy. we are also moving up the stack in the offerings with cloud-native applications, for example, to help our customers develop serverless applications, refactor their applications to work effectively on cloud. additionally, we'll also have new offerings in iot security data services.
so very excited about the services and solution road map in fiscal 2021. i've been here only for three months, but when i look at what the team has accomplished and the investments we are making, we'll be, in fact, skating to where the puck is going not only in terms of changing the revenue growth, but also the profit growth, ok? so that is one part of the investment and that is broad-based. i will not get into the nitty-gritty of it, but that's what's baked into our plan. the second investment is -- we are making is in our land-and-expand strategy.
now these investments are in go-to-market, but also it is in the form of lower start-up gross margins that we land -- when we land a new customer, and i explained this in my prepared remarks. as most of our new customers are in the initial phase of the cloud journey, the spend is more weighted to infrastructure compared to services. so we are also making investments in landing new accounts so we can expand these relationships over multiple years by upselling and cross-selling higher margin services. so this should give both gross margins and operating margins and should drive it upwards due to favorable revenue mix, as well as, operating leverage in the model.
so let me give you three data points which are very important for you guys to understand how we will be expanding margins in the longer-term. most of the industry analysts we have been talking to estimate that cloud customers will spend nearly $10 of services for every $1 of infrastructure spend over the life of the engagement and our recent new customers exhibit this dynamic. when you look at our new customers that we signed in 2020, within the very first year in the follow-on sale, customers bought, an average, $2 of additional higher-margin offerings for every incremental dollar of public cloud infrastructure. and also when you look at the data for the cohorts of customers from 2016 to 2019 that we shared with you guys last quarter, you will see there was a healthy double-digit growth on a cagr basis in each of these cohorts.
so we have all these data points that suggest that we cannot only expand after landing these new customers, and we are clearly seeing it in the growth trajectory in our bookings, but also expand with higher-margin mix of our business in the installed base. so when you take a look at the guidance, we always plan conservatively and go and execute aggressively and that's why you see the gross margins. we are assuming the gross margins to be in the mid-30s, plus or minus a couple of points. we're expecting the operating margins to be in, say, mid- to high-teens.
this is in line with best-in-class service providers in the u.s., and we feel very good about our position here. so these are the choice points we had, dan, and the choice we are making is to make the investments to capture the secular wave.
dan perlin -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
no, that's fantastic color. i really appreciate that. if i could just ask one other quick follow-up around bookings in the quarter, another really successful quarter for you guys. i'm wondering, can you talk a little bit about the mix that's kind of inside the bookings number and then also as it pertains to kind of legacy client churn, how that's progressing and then maybe what the pipeline looks like as you sit here today? thank you.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
very good. amar, how about i kick off on bookings and churn and revenue retention, and then you jump in as well. dan, thanks very much for your questions. so, yeah, look, we're very pleased with our sales bookings once again.
fourth-quarter bookings of $293 million, second-best quarter in the company's history, and 27% year-over-year growth. so we're pleased with that. just to give you a little bit of color, we had over 7,000 deals closed in the quarter. so once again, lots of diversity in our bookings and bookings were broad-based across all regions.
for example, in the americas, our sales bookings were up 21% year over year. in emea, we were actually up 35% year over year in sales bookings, and in asia pacific and japan, we're actually up 101% year over year. so terrific acceleration of growth all over the world as multicloud continues to accelerate at different rates in different countries. so pleased with the regional kind of performance.
if we look across customer segments, again, very broad-based. good growth in small business customer segment, mid-market customer segment and the enterprise segment where we continue to make a lot of traction penetrating the enterprise market. the other thing, dan, we saw a substantial year-over-year increase in larger deals, right? so we're excited about that. in terms of our sales pipeline, you had asked about that.
sales pipeline continues to increase. so despite continuing to put up great sales numbers, the sales pipeline is also going up. as amar indicated, this is really our time to invest and take -- capitalize on this great opportunity. so sales pipeline for the fourth quarter was up 150% year over year, that's 1-5-0 and 20%, sequentially.
so really good growth in the pipeline. one last thing i'll mention and then, amar, you might want to touch on your view on sales bookings, maybe one point there, but you had mentioned churn and net revenue retention. so churn is a component of our net revenue retention figure that we report and very pleased here as well. our net revenue retention, as you probably remember, really stepped up each quarter in 2020.
we started out 2020 at 98% net revenue retention. that was in the first quarter and we exited the year at 101% core net revenue retention. so delighted with that and we expect continued momentum there. amar, any other color you want to provide?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think just one quick comment here, kevin, if i may. so on the bookings growth for q4, we had a 27% bookings growth, both on a pro forma basis, as well as, on a reported basis, i just want to make sure i clear that. i know somewhere in the press release, it says 15%, but it's 27%, both on a pro forma basis, as well as, on a reported basis.
one more quick point i'd like to make and probably kevin alluded to is we -- in the total for the year, we signed approximately 400 new logos. so we continue to feel good about our new logo sales motion, and as i just mentioned, i gave you some color on our land-and-expand strategy. and if you don't land, you don't expand, and we are at the very beginning of a multiyear cycle and in the very early innings and this is our opportunity to capture the wave. and i think we have so many data points that suggest that this opportunity is just ahead of us, so a lot of excitement there from not only bookings perspective but the investments that we are going to make in launching new offerings to skate to where the puck is going, as i mentioned earlier.
dan perlin -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you both.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
thanks, dan.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, dan.
operator
and our next question is from amit daryanani with evercore.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. i have two as well. i guess, first one, maybe just to follow up on what dan was talking about on bookings. kevin, i'd love to maybe just understand when do you see this bookings momentum eventually helping drive or accelerating the sales growth run rate that you've had so far? and is there anything you'd call out on the duration of bookings in '21 versus '20, let's say?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
hey, amit, yeah, look, great question. you know, we -- we continue to be pleased with the booking success that we've had and also, as you've seen, that booking success is translating into revenue growth. so we're pleased with that, pleased with the diversity of bookings. to kind of your point, in terms of duration, we continue to see really good success in lengthening the duration of our relationship with customers.
the other really exciting thing is our increase in large deals. i alluded to that a little bit earlier. just to give you, amit, a little bit more specifics. we actually had a 40% year-on-year increase in signings of large deals and we define large deals as having more than $1 million of annual recurring revenue.
so it's just proof that the penetration of this enterprise market continues to accelerate. so duration is strong. size of deal is strong, really in our sweet spot and the 400 new logos that amar mentioned, by far, a company record, right? we're really excited about the new logos of that size that we've been able to book. so feeling very optimistic.
and the other thing, amit, is we can be very selective, right, about the deals that we're doing. so we want to make sure we're doing deals that line up with our strategy and the customer segmentation as we define it. so terrific market, just continues to gain momentum.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so let me just uh, amit, if i may add and amit, by the way, great to hear your voice. if i may add, just to connect bookings to revenue growth and i think that was also part of your question. first of all, our bookings is a leading indicator and captures only the new business generated in a period and through new customer acquisition and also new services that we sell to existing customers. so additionally, the bookings are annualized numbers and it takes generally three quarters for a project to ramp and for bookings to fully materialize in the revenue run rate.
so if you look at our revenue guidance, you will see our bookings growth in fiscal 2020 is driving revenue growth in fiscal 2021. as i mentioned, our core revenue growth is accelerating from a pro forma growth of 9% in fiscal 2020 to 13% at the midpoint of our guidance for fiscal 2021. so let me summarize by saying we are seeing the revenue growth as a result of our sales bookings success that we've seen in the last couple of quarters.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
fair enough. and amar, nice hearing your voice again as well. so if i could maybe follow up with you and you touched a fair bit on the operating leverage of the business. i was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about how do you think about the current free cash flow generation for rackspace and really the levers that you have at your disposal to improve this as you go forward.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think that's a great question and thanks for asking the question, amit. now we have -- we look at our cash flow metrics, our two cash flow metrics, right, we have two cash flow metrics. one is the adjusted one that i talked about during my prepared remarks and the other one is as reported in a cash flow statement.
and just to be clear, i'm focused on both. the adjusted cash flow is a good number to look at from a pro forma and operations perspective. but end of the day, what i'm also very focused on is what lands in my bank which is cash flow from operations and free cash flow that we report. now our reported cash flow from operations was down in fiscal q4 and let me give you some color there.
there were three things that were happening. one is there was a large one-time software license prepayment in the fourth quarter related to a major customer account that we onboarded. two, as we integrated onica's billing system and went live in q4, we did additional quality control checks on all the invoices for onica customers. keep in mind, our differentiator with the customers is a fanatical customer experience and we are very, very careful in making sure that we don't lose that.
so we delayed these invoices. the collection was pushed up to january and we have collected all those receivables as cash in january. the third one is, in addition, you can notice from our balance sheet, our accounts receivable is growing, and the account receivable is growing because our revenues have been sequentially growing. now this is a good problem to have, amit, but we have good opportunities and plan in place to improve our working capital metrics.
we have a seven-point program that have launched already, this is month three, but that's something that i always watch out for, optimizing profitability and cash by growing revenue, and we continuously look at that. with that said, if we control for all these three one-time items, our cash flow from operations would have been solid. so i'm not really worried about cash generation by this company. now we do have a lot of opportunities to improve our cash flow, so you have -- you can be assured that as the cfo, i'll be very focused on improving our cash flow in 2021 and we have several levers in fiscal 2021.
one, we are forecasting at the midpoint for a 40% net income growth on a non-gaap basis which will help cash flow improvement in 2021. second, we will tightly manage our working capital. as i mentioned, we have a seven-point plan to do that and it's implemented across the company. third, our debt refinancing and repayment has reduced our cash interest expense.
so that will also be a tailwind for fiscal 2021. and finally, we had some one-time cash expenses related to our ipo that won't repeat. so i expect our reported cash from operations would grow in 2021 and it will be a good indicator of a superior earnings quality. and that's what i'll be focused on, our revenue growth, profit maximization and optimization, cash flow optimization, and quality of earnings.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much for all the details.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thanks. take care.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
thanks, amit.
operator
and our next question is from ramsey el-assal with barclays.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. i wanted to ask about the apps and cross platform revenues and specifically about amar's comment about acceleration over the next few years. it exited the year quite strong, accelerating quarter over quarter, that's presumably largely due to the state of texas contract. i'm just trying to get a better sense of what is the underlying kind of normalized organic growth rate in that segment maybe once you anniversary that contract? and maybe comment on the sort of the levers and sort of timing of that acceleration.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so i will take that question, kevin, if you like to jump in later. so let me just -- that's a good question, too. when you look at our apps and cross platform, i think it's a very critical part of our portfolio because we are trying to move up the stack in our business with multicloud environment and our customers are asking us to also move up the stack. so what you should expect, at least in fiscal 2021, based on what we are guiding, we should be in high single-digit to low double-digit kind of growth in fiscal 2021, right, and some of it accelerating in the first half.
now your question is an important one. at the end of the day, this particular market is at very early innings. it is greenfield. you don't find a lot of companies out there who have cloud-native app development at scale.
and customers, as i mentioned in my previous remarks, customers want us to do refactoring of their applications as we move their applications from, say, on-prem or from a private cloud environment into a more multicloud environment. they want us to write those serverless applications and that's where we will be focusing our investments on, and we believe that this has a long tail. we're just getting started. customers are just moving their workloads to multicloud and i think they will also start looking at how do they refactor that application so they can improve the performance of the application on a multicloud environment.
so a lot of work here, a lot of opportunities. i don't think -- if you look at the universe of service providers, no one can claim that they have it at scale, and i think this is an opportunity for us, and this is where we'll be focused on. so stay tuned, we should expect that in the next couple of years to start growing double digits. this is a very exciting opportunity for us.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
i think that's well said. i mean, ramsey, i would just say, this is really where we see the next generation of economic value being created for customers and i think we're innovating fast here. we've got a great product team. we'll be talking more about some of our internet of things solutions, cloud-native application development, moving up the stack where we've got lots more visibility and input into customer strategic it initiatives, and spending, all the work around big data that we're doing and security.
so very focused here, huge area of opportunity, early days, and really greenfield for us.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and i also wanted to ask you about just balance sheet capital allocation and, specifically, the m&a pipeline. now that you guys have got your balance sheet in order in terms of your debt maturities, you're paying down debt at a nice clip, how should we think about m&a going forward, strategic m&a?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll take that one. i'll start out with m&a.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah, you take that one and i'll go with the -- i'll come back with the capital allocation.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
capital allocation? yeah, so look, great question. m&a has been a very important part of our strategy. since the lbo in 2016, we've done five acquisitions that have really revolutionized our service offerings. so m&a strategy, very focused on enhancing growth, reach, our product capabilities, and the two acquisitions we've done since i've been here at rackspace is onica which has been spectacular, right? it's been a terrific acquisition, enhanced our aws advisory and consulting capabilities, moved us up the stack, we've got just some amazing engineers, architects and go-to-market teams from onica.
and then the latest one that we did at the end of last year was bright skies which gave us expanded microsoft azure capabilities in europe, so really good. now what we've got, we've got this integration center of excellence and integration playbook which is a great platform. so as we do more acquisitions, we've got a really good management system, a really good playbook to make sure that we realize the synergies, and the value, right, that we pay for these companies. so look, m&a, an important part of our transformation.
going forward, we'll be very thoughtful about the size of deals that we do, particularly, over the last couple of years as we deleverage which amar will talk about in a minute, our capital allocation structure, but we will do deals. and we'll do them to enhance our multicloud capabilities, our growth prospects, our geographic presence, and continue to develop the service offerings as we mentioned.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
let me just touch on the capital allocation priorities. so first and foremost, we will make organic investments in the areas of secular growth and i did explain to that in my previous comments. the second investment we are also making is making sure that we continuously drive cost efficiency programs in the company and that's across automation, best shoring, making sure that we have the right mix of resources in the right location. and that's not just in operations but across our g&a function, as an example, and i've done this before in my previous company, it has a huge operating leverage.
the third is we'll continue to consolidate data centers as we move to a more capital-light model. and all those savings that we we'll -- that we'll deliver, we'll flow it to the bottom line, and a lot of it, we'll reinvest back into the business. the third is debt repayment and deleveraging the balance sheet. that's why my earlier comment on amit's question is focused on cash.
we will generate cash so that we can start paying down the debt very opportunistically. the fourth is targeted inorganic investments that kevin just alluded to. and then, finally, we will also try and opportunistically buy back shares to offset dilution from stock-based compensation as and when we feel that it is attractive to do buybacks. so that's our capital allocation priorities for the company.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
that makes perfect sense. i appreciate your answers today. thank you.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question is from matt cabral with credit suisse.
matt cabral -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah. thank you and thanks, amar, for all the detail on gross margins. i guess, i wanted to follow up on some of the earlier commentary around investment. you talked about two different vectors, so new services and solutions and more of that land-and-expand model.
just wondering, how we should think about the payback period across those two initiatives? and then more broadly, you talked about mid-30s gross margin, just wondering of duration we should think about being in that range. i guess, is it quarters, is it years? and how do we think about sort of the path back to a longer-term outlook for the company?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. so great question, matt. so let me first start with the long-term outlook. i'm not in a position to provide a long-term outlook today.
again, i'm in month three on the job. i'm just looking at the exciting opportunity ahead of us and we will basically talk to you guys sometime in september. and joe and i are finalizing that where we will launch and we'll have an analyst day and i can give you some long-term outlook at that point in time. now in terms of how the gross margin, i think at the end of the day, we want to make sure that the gross margins, you make the right kind of investment.
so as kevin mentioned, we will not go and sign up for any deal that comes our way. the demand is strong, and as the demand is strong, we have an option to be selective and we will be selective from that perspective. we want to land accounts where we have an opportunity to expand. so the investments that we are making in gross margins, making sure that we get these deals ahead of time and in the early stages, and we'll be very mindful on the investments we make.
so i do believe the mid-30%, plus or minus, will be for the next maybe one year or two or maybe better. i don't know at this point in time, matt, i can't say this, but definitely, for this particular year in fiscal '21, that's what we are planning for. and again, as i said, we will always plan conservatively and go and execute aggressively, but at the same time, we do not want to lose the opportunity to invest. i think that's the point we continue to make here because we are at the beginning of the cycle.
if we missed this cycle, after four or five years, it's hard for us to get back into this wave, and i've seen companies miss the cycle and then wait for five or six years to get back into the next cycle. i think we are very well-positioned right now. so what you should be focused on, as investors and as analysts, is how do we do from an operating margin perspective? and that's where i'm saying we will be in the mid- to high-teens in operating margins and where we will continue to drive an sg&a efficiency, productivity, while making investments in sales and go-to-market, etc. does that help, matt?
matt cabral -- credit suisse -- analyst
it does, and actually, it leads pretty well into the follow-up that i was going to ask you anyways. i want to talk a little bit more about opex for the company. i guess it looks like a lot of the margin expansion you guys have seen is driven by the transformation of the cost takeout efforts you put in so far. just wondering if you can expand a little bit more about sort of the biggest efforts you've made and where you are in the program? and just how we should think about the opex of or the trajectory of opex going forward from here?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so listen, i think the way to think about opex, and i encourage everybody to do it, is don't think about opex as what's the dollar reduction. you should think about opex as a percentage of revenue. when you are a growing organization, you want to grow opex slower than the growth in the top line, ok? so if you think about our opex, we -- in fiscal '20, we landed at roughly about 20% or 21% as a percentage of revenue which we -- in q4, it was roughly about 18%, and i expect that to continue in fiscal 2021. now where are we seeing the growth? we are driving efficiencies across g&a.
as i said, in g&a, we have just touched the surface, so to speak, in terms of best shoring. we have touched the surface in terms of automation. i've led programs in my previous company where we used bots to automate some of the processes so that you can take labor out of the process. but more importantly, when you scale revenue, you don't have to scale opex at the same rate.
so from that perspective, we are a company that does automation to help customers. now we can help ourselves to do automation internally, whether we can drive higher efficiency in sg&a, so you should expect us to be focused on that. there's a lot of runway here, and i think, as i said, i'm in month three. i see a huge opportunity in terms of not only driving efficiency but in terms of reinvesting it back into the business so that we can grow profitably.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yeah. i would just add, i think that's really well said, matt. i would add huge opportunities on the cost side. we mentioned best shoring, really early days there; automation, more opportunities, supply chain management, and then as these new logos that we've signed, you know, we signed so many new logos.
usually, the margins are lower as soon as we sign them, they're still very good and positive. but as we add on additional workloads and additional services, that will drive profitability as well. so it's where we kind of are in the life cycle with all these new customers that we are. so we believe we've got really good margin expansion opportunity.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. so matt, if i can just add, you know, we are driving higher sales productivity because we made investments in go-to-market last year, so most of the sales is becoming more productive. number two is we have consolidated some of the office space and we'll continue to do that. we are also consolidating legal entities.
we are shutting down bank accounts and this company has done a very good job from that perspective. so there are a lot of opportunities that we can go after from a g&a perspective. so i have a funnel, let me put it this way, matt, just as a closing. like our sales leader, i have a funnel of opportunities on the cost side and i look at how to fill that funnel, how to convert that funnel, and then how to reinvest some of it back into the business.
matt cabral -- credit suisse -- analyst
very helpful. thanks for all the color, guys.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
thanks, matt.

operator
good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the rackspace technology's first-quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please also note, today's event is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference call over to joe crivelli, vice president of investor relations. sir, you may begin.
joe crivelli -- vice president of investor relations
good afternoon and welcome to rackspace technology's first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. kevin jones, our chief executive officer, and amar maletira, our president and chief financial officer, join us today. the slide deck we will refer to today can be found on our investor relations website. on slide 2, certain comments we make on this call will be forward-looking.
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which would cause actual results to differ. a discussion of these risks and certainties is included in our sec filings. rackspace technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call except as required by law. our presentation includes certain non-gaap financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors.
in accordance with sec rules, we've provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable gaap measures. these reconciliations are in the tables included in our earnings release and slide presentation, both of which are available on our website. after our prepared remarks, we will take your questions. i'll now turn the call over to kevin. 
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
good afternoon and thanks for joining us to discuss our first-quarter financial results. 2021 is off to a great start, and we are excited to share the results with you. today, i'll discuss quarterly highlights and provide additional perspective on some recent product launches that we believe position rackspace technology exactly where the market is moving. as i've done in past quarters, i'll also touch on some case studies of customers who are doing truly innovative things with cloud technology, and our president and chief financial officer, amar maletira, will go into detail on the financial results before i make some concluding remarks.
slide 5 shows the main messages we would like to deliver today. first quarter was very strong for rackspace technology, and we exceeded the guidance targets we set in late february, with record revenue and very strong earnings growth. the tectonic shift to multi-cloud, as well as the success we had onboarding new logos in 2019 and 2020 are expected to fuel double-digit revenue growth throughout 2021 and beyond. you've heard me say that 2021 is going to be the most exciting year for new product launches in the history of the company.
and in the first quarter, we launched rackspace elastic engineering and rackspace services for vmware cloud, which have been extremely well received by industry analysts and customers. i'll talk more about these in a moment. the work that our finance team has done to improve cash flow drove a significant turnaround in the first quarter, with strong growth in operating cash flow. amar will discuss this in his section.
it also bears repeating that our first-quarter debt refinancing put us in a position of strength from a balance sheet perspective for years to come. as we've noted previously, we now have no significant debt maturities for the next seven years. and in addition, our debt was booked at historically low interest rates. in fact, the $550 million financing that we completed in february was the best pricing ever for a non-investment grade senior secured notes offering.
turning to slide 6. we posted another record quarter with revenue up 11% compared to the first quarter of 2020 to $726 million. core revenue growth was even stronger, up 15% year over year to $677 million. this strong growth was driven by continued momentum in our multi-cloud business.
we are winning new customer engagements and expanding share of wallet with the customers we onboarded in late 2019 and throughout 2020. as a result, we believe we are expanding market share in cloud it services. earnings leverage continues to be excellent. non-gaap operating profit was $119 million and non-gaap earnings per share was $0.23, up 10% and 44%, respectively, compared to last year's first quarter, and we see opportunity for additional earnings leverage.
amar, now in his sixth month, is taking a fresh look at everything we do. as a result, we've driven a number of changes in our decision-making process and management system. to give you a few examples, we revamped the way we analyze deal profitability and decide which deals to pursue. this, in turn, has informed how we structure our sales force and which product lines we lean into for growth.
we have reexamined our expense structure and uncovered additional efficiencies that we can drive in 2021 and beyond and identified areas where we can invest these savings to accelerate the trajectory of our top line. additional discipline in working capital management has led to a significant turnaround in cash flow. amar will provide more details in a moment. and we continue to improve our investor reporting and give the investment community more insight into our growth drivers and value creation strategies.
new sales bookings in the first quarter were $244 million, up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2020. this was a solid bookings quarter. the year-over-year bookings growth was lower than in past quarters for a number of reasons. firstly, we are lapping our own efforts and are up against tough compares from a bookings growth standpoint.
this will continue throughout the year as we landed a number of marquee multicloud deals, including the state of texas deal in the second quarter of last year. so while we expect continued strong bookings in 2021, the year-over-year compares will be more modest. we remain confident in our revenue guidance for fiscal 2021 and expect double-digit revenue growth for the year. secondly, we are focused on driving the right mix of business and increasing the initial margin we are willing to accept on new deals.
this is a benefit of the bookings success we've had, as we now have a significant installed base of enterprise accounts that will serve as a foundation for our growth. thirdly, we adjusted sales incentives and realigned our sales force to prioritize high-value deals, in line with our land-and-expand strategy. as these changes have taken root, we are encouraged that bookings accelerated and grew sequentially each successive month of the year. slide 7 shows how we're evolving the strategy of the company.
we have gotten encouraging signals from customers that they see us as the opposite of the global systems integrators, or gsis. this is because we bring the benefits of a gsi, including size and scale. but unlike the gsis, we're also cloud focused, disruptive, flexible, fast, agile, and we have our fanatical customer experience. so we are staking our claim as the un-gsi.
we believe this makes a clear statement with customers and prospects about who we are and the competitive advantages we bring to the table. on slide 8, our positioning as the un-gsi, as well as market trends have influenced our product development efforts. as a result, we recently introduced two new offerings that we believe hit the sweet spot in the market. many of you participated in our webinar on rackspace elastic engineering in april, and that service offering has garnered significant early interest from customers around the world.
last week, we introduced rackspace services for vmware cloud as vmware is, in many cases, the platform of choice for private cloud workloads. looking forward, we believe vmware is an important fourth cloud platform alongside aws, azure and google cloud. on slide 9, rackspace elastic engineering is the next iteration of our service blocks. we are very excited about this new offering and believe it is exactly what the market needs to move cloud adoption to the next level.
rackspace elastic engineering is on-demand access to a pod of multidisciplinary cloud specialists who will know the customers' application, team and desired business objectives and will be laser-focused on driving their cloud outcomes. the pod will work seamlessly with the customers' internal dev ops teams, essentially becoming a trusted part of their permanent cloud team. the pod is capable of delivering a broad spectrum of outcomes without the constraints of a fixed scope of management. this is a complete opposite of how a gsi structures and prices their services.
rackspace elastic engineering is already available and fully supported across aws, azure, google cloud and vmware. this really cracks the code for customers who are trapped between running their traditional operations and evolving to be more cloud-native and modern. after just a few weeks, elastic engineering has been one of the most successful new product launches in rackspace history. we've already closed significant deals in all three regions of the world, and the pipeline for this offering is growing very fast.
on slide 10, last week, we announced our rebranded private cloud offering, rackspace services for vmware cloud. in conversations with customers, it became clear that they needed a solution that provided a public cloud experience with private cloud security, data sovereignty, low latency and pricing flexibility. we are excited about this offering and view it as a way to significantly increase growth in private cloud and further extend our lead in multicloud. in addition, this offering aligns to our capex light business model.
in the early going, it is clear that customers were hungry for this kind of architecture, as we are off to a great early start with this offering as well. as i've done in past quarters, i'd like to highlight some customers who are doing truly innovative things in the cloud. on slide 11, let's talk about porsche, which is a signature enterprise cloud customer for rackspace technology. as you can imagine, automobile manufacturing is a complex undertaking in a complex industry, and it requires best-of-breed systems and tools across a variety of it environments to execute at the very highest level like porsche does.
so porsche is, in many ways, a textbook case study for multicloud as the company leverages all three hyperscalers, aws, microsoft azure and google cloud for its cloud environment. accordingly, we are very proud to have been selected as porsche's cloud partner of choice to help this world-renowned automaker harmonize and govern its multi-cloud platform. on slide 12, autodesk's subsidiary, innovyze, is one of the preeminent software companies for the water industry. the company knew that it needed to be on the technological forefront to continue to lead its industry.
they had to modernize their solution, which was a desktop app with on-premise client servers. while the company had highly skilled saas engineers and machine learning and devops teams, they did not have the resources to meet an aggressive timeline. pivoting from a desktop-centric product suite to a saas solution would require all hands on deck. they needed to bolster their teams with equally skilled engineers.
with rackspace technology's help, they built and introduced info360, a saas offering based on aws, which also included advanced iot analytics using real-time data. the new platform was built with serverless technology, and micro services enabled their customers to transfer their asset network information to the cloud. it also leveraged geospatial mapping functionalities, which were previously available only with additional third-party software. i'm so proud of the rackers who helped innovyze meet its aggressive timeline so that it could maintain its lead in the industry.
now, amar will take you through our financial results in more detail. then i'll make some concluding remarks before we open for q&a. amar?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, kevin. and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. slide 14 recaps our financial results for the quarter. demand trends across our customer segments and geographical markets continue to remain robust which, coupled with strong execution, drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth.
in our first quarter of fiscal 2021, we posted revenue of $726 million, an increase of 11% year over year. this was ahead of our expectation, driven by strong performance in our core business. our core business revenue at $677 million grew 15% year over year. non-gaap gross margin at 34.4% in the first quarter came in within our expected range and was down compared to prior year, reflecting the mix shift from strong growth in our multi-cloud business, decline in our legacy openstack and ongoing investments.
while the mix primarily impacted our gross margins, our operating margin at 16.4% was relatively unchanged year over year. compared to prior year, non-gaap gross profit at $250 million was down 2% due to a decline in our legacy openstack revenue, partially offset by growth in gross profits in our core business. our non-gaap operating profit was above our expectations at $119 million, up 10% year over year. this was a result of operating leverage from strong revenue growth in our multi-cloud business and opex efficiencies, primarily in g&a.
non-gaap earnings per share at $0.23 likewise beat our expectations and was up 44% from last year. this reflected strong growth in operating profit and also lower interest expense from debt repayment and our recent debt refinancing. slide 15 shows the company's revenue mix in the first quarter by segment and by geography. multicloud continues to represent the vast majority of revenue at 80% of the mix, and it grew 14% year over year.
apps and cross platform at 13% of total revenue grew 19% year over year, driven by strong performance in application services coupled with strength in our data and security services businesses. openstack, which is a legacy business, declined 23%, in line with our expectations. this segment now represents only 7% of total revenue. from a regional perspective, americas continues to represent 75% of our revenue and had a solid 11% year-over-year growth.
apj grew at 28%, while emea grew 8% year over year. now, moving to slide 16. let me give you more color on our multicloud segment, which represents 80% of our total revenue. the trending bar chart on this slide shows our successful strategy of driving the significant mix shift to the higher-growth markets within this segment.
the purple bar represents estimated revenue from our solutions in high-growth markets, which include all four cloud platforms -- aws, azure, google and vmware. the gray bar represents revenue from our solutions in low-growth and mature markets, primarily non-vmware private cloud and managed hosting. this chart really shows the business transformation that's taken place since mid-2019. we leaned into high-growth areas of the market, such as managed public cloud by winning new logos while also proactively transitioning some of our existing customers to newer cloud platforms.
this was a purposeful strategy to extend our customer relationship and position us well in an attractive and growing cloud services market. on a trailing 12-month basis, in our fiscal first-quarter 2021, our revenue in high-growth markets made up approximately 65% to 70% of our multi-cloud segment revenue and grew roughly between 30% and 40% year over year. within this segment, our managed public cloud revenue grew even faster, outpacing the overall public cloud market growth. we are targeting the high-growth revenue mix within this segment to exceed 80% of total multi-cloud revenue in the next 12 to 18 months.
we believe our gross margins will stabilize within 12 to 18 months period for two reasons. first, this mix shift within the multi-cloud segment will be largely complete, and the majority of our revenue in multi-cloud will come from high-growth areas. second, we are confident that our land-and-expand strategy with the new customers we have onboarded since early 2020 will work and drive higher margins in the installed base. i'll explain why we have this confidence in the next slide.
all this bodes well for rackspace to deliver long-term growth in profit through both revenue growth and operating margin expansion. on slide 17, you see some proof points of our land-and-expand strategy with two very different real customer examples. delivering a solution, which includes cloud services and infrastructure, is a key value proposition to help customers optimize their costs, it creates stickiness in the relationship, and provides an opportunity for rackspace to upsell and cross-sell more higher-value solutions. in the first case on the left, we show a long-term customer in the financial services industry.
in this case, we led with services. and as infrastructure mix grew, you can see a modest decrease in sold gross margin. but as we have cross-sold additional services to this customer, you can see that the margin rebounds and exceeds the starting point. on the right is a relatively new customer in the manufacturing industry.
this was one of the new logos we onboarded in the first quarter of 2020. again, you can see that the initial services-led margin is high. and as the customer deploys a multi-cloud solution, which includes cloud infrastructure, the margin dips. but then as we expand our relationship with higher-value services, the margin recovers.
these are the types of customer use cases that we are focused on replicating across our entire customer base. and we are having some good success in this regard. on slide 18, we analyze the managed public cloud customer cohort from the first quarter of 2020. and as you can see, our cumulative bookings have increased 21% in the first year and sold gross margins have expanded over 200 basis points.
this is an area that has intense focus in our weekly management system meetings, ensuring that we continue to execute our expand strategy. it is also one of the areas for which we elevated the focus of our sales force and account teams and aligned our incentive plans. slide 19 provides a snapshot of our cash flow and balance sheet. cash flow was strong in the first quarter due to improved working capital management.
we had operating cash flow at $103 million, and free cash flow was $66 million. total capital expenditures in the first quarter was $59 million and total capex intensity was 8%, in line with our expectations. please note that in the second quarter, we are renewing several large multiyear enterprise license agreements or elas. the accounting treatment for these renewals requires us to recognize the full amount of these elas as capex in the period the deal is signed, even though the cash payments are spread out over time.
accordingly, we expect second-quarter capex intensity in the low teens, which is in line with our plans. but for the full fiscal year of 2021, we expect capex intensity to be in the range of 7% to 9%. our cash capex was $37 million, and cash capex intensity was 5% in the first quarter. for fiscal year 2021, we expect cash capex intensity in the 4% to 6% range.
total cash at quarter-end was $198 million, and we had $375 million of unused revolving credit facility. on slide 20, we have our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2021. for the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of 735 to 745 million, which at the midpoint is 13% year-over-year growth, core revenue of 690 to 698 million, which at the midpoint is 16% year-over-year growth, and non-gaap operating profit in the range of 113 to 117 million. this guidance reflects continued investments and mix shift to high-growth areas in multi-cloud.
we also expect non-gaap earnings per share in the second quarter in the range of $0.21 to $0.23, non-gaap other expenses of 52 to 53 million, non-gaap tax expense rate of 26%, and we expect non-gaap weighted average shares of 214 to 215 million. we have made no changes to our guidance for the full year, except for a minor change to the full-year non-gaap other expenses and 2021 weighted average share count. after six months at rackspace, i'm more convinced than ever that we have a lot of opportunity and runway for continued growth and shareholder value creation. i will now turn the call back to kevin for closing comments.
kevin?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
thanks, amar. before we open the call for your questions, let me say that i'm proud of the first-quarter results, which we believe were a strong validation of the rackspace technology investment thesis. we continue to grow both total and core revenue by double digits. the earnings leverage inherent in our business model and cost transformation programs are driving significant improvements in year-over-year profitability.
finally, in the first quarter, our discipline with working capital assets resulted in a dramatic increase in both operating and free cash flow. most importantly, we are continuing to position the company for consistent ongoing growth and earnings leverage. the new customers we landed in 2019 and 2020 provide a strong growth foundation, and the continued tectonic shift of workloads to the cloud will provide secular tailwinds for years to come. our new market positioning as the un-gsi, as well as the new service offerings we've introduced in 2021 position rackspace technology as the clear partner of choice for companies that want to migrate their business to the cloud.
we are already seeing significant traction in the market for these initiatives. also, we are committed to driving cost efficiencies and making ongoing growth investments to continue our financial momentum. so i remain excited about our opportunities in 2021 as we continue to see double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings per share for the full year. and with that, we will take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from ramsey el-assal from barclays. please go ahead with your question.
unknown speaker -- barclays -- analyst
hey, guys. this is ben on for ramsey. i wanted to ask about the -- first, the pace of bookings growth. i know like some time ago, we had talked about kind of like a low double digit, low teens kind of growth rate over like the next several years.
and i understand that you lapped tough comps. is that sort of what we should expect as we kind of lap those comps and get into 2022? is that sort of a reasonable expectation?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
ramsey, it's kevin here. thanks for the question. so i'll kick off here on bookings, and i'm sure amar will have a few things to add. so as a reminder, ramsey, the figure for bookings that we report is only new business bookings, and the 244 million of bookings in the first quarter is very healthy.
new business bookings is just one of the factors in our revenue growth alongside recurring revenue, there's renewals, contract extensions, churn, implementation and revenue realization. that one component of revenue, new business bookings, grew a healthy 6% year on year. we were also more selective in the first quarter about the deals we pursued as we onboarded a significant installed base of new customers in 2020 and now can increase our initial margin on new deals. this, in addition to our land-and-expand strategy, drove a significant increase in sold gross margins in the first quarter.
so overall, new bookings were solid. we're committed to our revenue guidance for the year and double-digit revenue growth in 2021 and beyond. amar, do you want to add something?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes, let me add here, ben. so just stepping back, when you take a look at bookings and the revenue growth correlation here, we've been executing very well on the sales front. we have had strong year-on-year bookings growth for the past seven quarters. and what this has done is this has significantly increased the baseline of our bookings, which captures incremental new business, as kevin mentioned earlier.
so at an annualized bookings baseline of roughly 1 billion-plus, we will be able to deliver double-digit revenue growth in 2021 and beyond. and having said that, we are focused on continuing to drive bookings performance going forward. hopefully, that answers the question.
unknown speaker -- barclays -- analyst
yes, very helpful. if i could ask one more, just in the quarter, apps and cross platform, the revenues came in a bit higher than we were expecting, which is great to see. is that related to maybe like the timing of the state of texas deal? or is that just kind of a broader outperformance? and is that level of revenue growth kind of indicative of what we should see in that line for the rest of the year? or should it perhaps moderate a little bit?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so that's a great question. so it was very broad-based. it was not just application services. so within the applications and cross platform, we have three services offerings at a high level.
there's an application services offering, there's data services, and security services. and we saw broad-based growth across all those three service offerings. and of course, application services also benefited from the texas dir deal, so you should expect that kind of level going forward. now, it will moderate here and there because some of it is transactional business, but we are confident on this particular portfolio.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. i would also say, ben, we're pretty excited about this area. we've got lots of investment that we're making in cloud-native application development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, a lot of our iot and edge computing services here. so yes, broad base.
and when you kind of look at the short and medium-term future, we're pretty excited.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so just to add there, we'll be -- we were at about $97 million in q1. we should be slightly in that particular range between, say, 93 to 97 going forward. there will be some quarters that are up, some quarters will be down based on the seasonality of the business.
unknown speaker -- barclays -- analyst
ok. that's super helpful. thank you, guys, so much.

our next question comes from amit daryanani from evercore. please go ahead with your question.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you very much for taking my questions. i have two as well. i guess, first, maybe if i can just go back to the free cash flow discussion, amar, a little bit, really good quarter performance for sure. maybe just walk me through, given some of the comments you had around q2, how should we think about free cash flow conversion as we go forward? and do we think q2 is a bit negative, and then you ramp up in the back half?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so overall i think as you know, amit, there's an intense focus in the entire company around free cash flow. and i often repeat my cfo mantra in the company. as i say, revenue is vanity, property is sanity, and cash is reality. the entire company has heard this hundreds of times since i joined the company in november.
and i think we have made tremendous -- we have tremendous opportunity to continue to drive improved cash flow. and we are executing against the transformation program that we talked about, amit, in the last quarter that addresses the entire life cycle of cash flow, including forecasting the cash flow, the collections aspect of it, credit terms, the payables, and so on, and so forth. so i would say we will deliver a significant increase in cash flow from operations, as well as free cash flow compared to fiscal 2020. so fiscal 2021 should be much higher than fiscal 2020.
and there will be some quarters will be lower, some quarters will be higher; but i do believe what we are focused on is to driving higher and healthy quality of earnings. and i believe our cash flow from operations should be roughly about 80% to 85% of our operating income in the longer term, so that's what we are focused on.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and then, if i just kind of go back or kind of have you guys talk a little bit on the gross margin line for the march quarter, year over year, i think the performance is sort of notable in terms of the drop. i know you guys have talked about this in the past. so i'd love to understand, when you look at the gross margin contraction on a year-over-year basis, how much of that do you think was investments rackspace is making in their business versus mix implications? i would love to understand those two buckets.
and then, should we feel comfortable that gross margins have troughed for calendar '21 at this point?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so let me start here by saying our gross margins, amit, are not declining due to any competitive pricing or market pressures. and the decline in gross margin is mainly a result of mix shift in our business, driven by three factors very clearly. first is, as you know, our openstack business, which is our legacy business, is declining as expected.
and this is a higher-margin business, so there's an unfavorable mix impact. second, we are onboarding new business with initial low margins due to the higher mix of cloud infrastructure in the solutions, as i discussed earlier, and also the start-up costs associated with it. and third is customer migration from older-generation private cloud offerings and managed hosting to newer cloud platforms. and in many cases, we are proactively managing this for our customers.
so all this has a near-term dilutive impact on the gross margins because the older-generation offerings were capex-intensive. and now as we drive -- and it also had higher gross margins. while the newer offerings that we are selling are capex-light, it has initially low gross margins. but as we upsell higher-value services, the gross margins improve, as i've shown in the earnings presentation with the q1 2020 cohort of customers.
so amit, we believe our gross margins will stabilize within the next 12 to 18 months for two reasons, as i mentioned during my prepared remarks. first is this mix shift to high-growth areas within the multi-cloud segment will be largely complete. and second, as we discussed, we are confident that our land-and-expand strategy with the new customers that we onboarded will drive higher margins in the installed base. with that said, i do expect even during this period, our operating margins to remain in the mid to high teens, in line with other best-in-class u.s.-based it service providers.
does it help, amit?
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
no. that's really helpful. thanks, amar.

our next question comes from ashwin shirvaikar from citi. please go ahead with your question.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
hey, guys. sorry. hello? can you hear me?
joe crivelli -- vice president of investor relations
yes. hey, ashwin. we can hear you.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
great. i guess, i wanted to ask about the pipeline that you're seeing in terms of the split between multi-cloud and apps -- versus apps and platform. are you just seeing -- are you beginning to see maybe a shift toward more apps and cross platform? and then, sort of a related question as you introduce elastic engineering, does that, down the road, have an impact on bookings [inaudible].
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
right. thanks, ashwin. yes, i'll start with that, and then amar can jump in as well. so let me give you just a little bit color on the pipeline, as you had asked.
and i'll talk about apps and cross platform as it relates to the pipeline; and then elastic engineering, and kind of what i see there for the future. so ashwin, pipeline is strong, healthy, continues to build. as i did mention on the earnings call, we are being more selective on the deals we pursue. so i'd also say it's a very high-quality pipeline of higher-margin deals.
so excited about the pipeline, it's growing. and i would say it's broad-based. there's still a massive opportunity in multi-cloud, but we are seeing a lot of opportunity in apps and cross platform as well. so i would say really high in both areas.
i'm really excited about the early signs of rackspace elastic engineering, right? we've really, we believe, reinvented managed services for the cloud with rackspace elastic engineering. and what's happened here, ashwin, is this really shortened our sales cycles on these deals, which is great for future conversion of revenue. rackspace elastic engineering, one of the most successful new product launches in the history of the company, closed many deals. already closed another one in europe over the weekend.
so in three weeks of this offering being released, signed deals in every region, new and existing customers. we've got nearly 100 new business opportunities identified for rackspace elastic engineering. so excited about that one. excited about rackspace services for vmware cloud.
that was just released on thursday of last week. that's going to be tremendous as well. pipeline for professional migration services is growing very strong also.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
got it. and then, a question, i guess, for amar. after 4q, you've provided a very detailed split across quarters in terms of the cadence that we should expect. would you say that anything has changed relative to what you've indicated back then in terms of revenues and profits?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
i think -- so thanks, ashwin, for the question. so our guidance for -- i've not changed the guidance for the full year. and let me give you -- let me start with the big picture here and answer your question on the seasonality and authorization of the guidance. so if you look at the big picture and if you look at the first half profit in total, i'm just talking on the operating profit side and then i'll come to the revenue side, too.
if you look at the first half operating profit in total, we are on pace with our original guidance even with the lower expected q2 operating profit. and then, going forward, let me walk you through the four key drivers of improved second half profitability. first, as i've indicated earlier, the seasonal expense headwinds, such as the u.s. payroll taxes that impacts our first half -- are weighted more toward the first half and will subside in the second half of the year.
secondly, we are also making investments, as i mentioned earlier, in the business that are going to be sort of moderate in the second half. third is we have opex efficiency programs that will kick in and generate additional savings in the second half compared to the first half. and finally, the second half revenue growth will be higher than the first half and will also drive incremental profit. now, this is all baked into our full-year guidance.
so in summary, feel good about the full-year guidance, and we expect to be within the guided range for revenue, for operating profit, as well as eps. and as you can see in the first half, we are exceeding -- certainly on the revenue side, we are exceeding the midpoint of the guidance. and so, i think there's a little bit of an upward bias to the revenue compared to the midpoint of the revenue guidance for the full year.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from frank louthan from raymond james. please go ahead with your question.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. walk us through some of the cost savings initiatives that you're putting into place, and where should we see those show up? and then talk to us a little bit about churn. what has that been running? and do you expect anything different in churn for the remainder of the year?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
sure. so let me start with your question on the cost savings. one of the things that i keep reminding people is first of all, the cost takeouts and opex efficiencies are all embedded within our guidance. so we would encourage you to follow the guidance from that perspective.
but we approach cost initiatives overall the same way we approach sales. we build a funnel of efficiency programs, which we regularly fill and convert, and that's how we look at it. and so, just specifically on, say, opex side because i do believe there is immense opportunity on opex to continue to drive efficiency. there are four areas that we are focused on.
first is more automation and streamlining processes. now, this is i would say, frank, this is technology-driven efficiency programs and productivity improvements that will come through automation. that is the first one. second is leveraging the g&a as revenue grows and also increasing the leverage of partner r&d, the product development costs that they put in, as well as the market development.
so we can leverage that given the relationship we have with our partners. third is driving higher offshore mix across the company. i do believe that there is a huge opportunity there. we need to continue driving that as we grow.
and the fourth is on the nonlabor expense side. there are various ways to optimize our nonlabor expenses through supply chain management. we can optimize our real estate footprint. there are legal entities that we are looking around the world to see how we optimize those legal entity, do better management on the vendor side.
so these are all the cost savings initiatives that we have in the funnel that we'll continue driving as the business model continues to transform. and we will reinvest some of it back into the business, as we have done, to continue driving the top line growth and also investing in continuous automation and productivity improvements.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
amar, do you want me to start on --
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes, please. please, kevin.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
frank, it's kevin. yes, it's a great question on churn. i'll just give you a little color here. i would say churn, particularly for the newer offerings, is coming up.
now, it's a very favorably, certainly compared to my expectations and compared to some of our older offerings. so that's really, really encouraging that the new product offerings that were coming out are not just growing fast, but customers are keeping them and keeping them longer. and certainly, this area of the business has performed better than i had expected. so that's really, i think very, very positive.
this is obviously a revenue lever for us that we continue to spend a lot of time with our management system, with our leaders, with our customer success representatives in the field. we've got a close feedback mechanism into our new product development. so i feel like we've got a really good kind of system here to drive further benefits for the company.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
thanks, frank.
operator
our next question comes from james breen from william blair. please go ahead with your question.
james breen -- william blair -- analyst
thanks. you talked about bookings early on in the q&a. i was wondering just, can you just give some color around how the bookings growth sort of translates to revenue growth, given some of the land and expand as you think about the 6% year over year, and then sort of the double-digit growth on the revenue side?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, jim. how about i start on that one, amar? and then --
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes, absolutely. go ahead, please.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. so a little bit more color, james, on the bookings. first of all, 6,300 deals in the quarter, very diversified bookings, broad-based strengths across geographies, customer segments and industry. we're pleased with the additional rigor sort of resulting in expansion in sold margins for deals during the quarter.
so that's good. we see momentum in large deals with more than $1 million of recurring revenue. those were up double digits in the year. the other thing, james, we signed 25% more new logos than we did in last year's first quarter.
excited to see continued momentum in mid-market and enterprise as well, those two customer segments. just to name a few wins, we talked about porsche in my prepared remarks. apria healthcare was a great win, tsb bank in the u.k., aramex in the middle east. so again, broad-based in mid-market and enterprise as well.
so pleased with the momentum. yes. amar, do you want to cover kind of the translation question?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
sure. i think -- listen, i think the way i would like to answer this question is why are we confident about the double-digit core revenue growth, whether it's sustainable or not? and the way i think about this is as i mentioned earlier that we had a strong year-on-year bookings growth for the past seven quarters. that has really elevated the baseline of our bookings, which captures incremental business, as i mentioned earlier. and when we take a look at our baseline, if you're on the baseline, annual baseline of roughly about $1 billion, i think you should be able to -- because this is all incremental business that comes from new logos, as well as new business from the existing customers, it should be able to drive double-digit growth in revenue.
that's how the model works. and second also, we are a high mix of recurring type revenue, which drives good visibility into the future. so we really feel good about the revenue growth sustainability in 2021 and beyond. and for example, the midpoint of our 2021 revenue guidance indicates that 14% core revenue growth, up from a pro forma growth of about 9% last year.
so that shows you that the baseline has gone up and elevated, and we can continuously drive double-digit growth into 2021 and beyond.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. i would add, amar, would you agree our confidence in the sustainability of our revenue growth has increased since the last time we reported?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
absolutely.
james breen -- william blair -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from matt cabral from credit suisse. please go ahead with your question.
matt cabral -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes. thank you. kevin, you called out some revamped deal profitability metrics in your prepared remarks. you kind of alluded to them a couple of times during the answers as well.
just wondering if you could expand a little bit more on what the changes are that you've made? and just if that's had any impact on how you think about forming sales quotas and the different metrics that you comp the sales force on?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
matt, great question. so yes, absolutely, always looking to continue to raise the bar on sales performance and continue just to capitalize on this, i think, once in a generation opportunity here in multi-cloud. so matt, what we did in the first quarter, particularly in the americas region, we sort of realigned the team to kind of ensure our sales professionals, our solution architects, all of our customer success team members were aligned, particularly on this land-and-expand strategy that we've been talking about a lot. we kind of enhanced our regional structure to increase accountability.
we did -- and also improved our customer sales coverage. we did a lot of work on that. we also adjusted our compensation plans to support all the goals that we had for this year, including selling higher-margin deals. so we're very pleased with kind of the early signs of how those changes have materialized here in the results and in the pipeline.
and we expect these changes to help us continue both winning new logos and accelerate the success of this land-and-expand strategy.
matt cabral -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and then, thanks for all the additional detail you guys gave on the multi-cloud business. i guess so it's pretty clear from the chart that the margin on services is higher than infrastructure. but i'm curious if you can comment on just the magnitude of the spread between the two.
i guess what i'm really trying to get at is if i take a step back, this segment used to do profitability in the low 40s from a gross margin standpoint. and i'm just wondering as the services mix on public cloud matures, do you think you'll be able to get back to those levels? or should we start thinking about maybe rebasing to a different margin structure as the mix shifts more toward cloud going forward?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so well, listen, i think i'm not going to give specific guidance here on the margin, on the gross margins. but as i mentioned earlier that if you think about our gross margin profile, today we are in a transient stage as we are having a major mix shift going on in the business to high-growth areas, as we are onboarding new customers and also migrating existing customers. so you have all those headwinds from a margin perspective initially. we do believe that the gross margins will expand as we upsell and cross-sell more services.
and you saw, matt, in one of the charts that i provided, which was taking q1 cohort of customers where we were able to expand the gross margins by about 200 basis points-plus while growing the bookings about 20%-plus, right? now, i would want you guys to focus on operating margins, which we will continue to operate between the mid to high teens because of the all the operating leverage we have in the model, as well as the ongoing opex efficiency programs. so just to give you an example why we should be focused on that, and we do believe that the gross margins will stabilize. if you think about gross margins, let's say, our corporate average is, say, mid-30s today. when we sell incremental business, even if the gross margins in those incremental business in our current installed base, say, comes in below the corporate average, let's say, i'll just make up a number here, say, 30% or so.
we would spend about maybe 5 to 7 percentage points of that in incremental sg&a. and you will see at least 20 to 25 points actually drop to the operating profit line. so which means that there is such a high operating leverage in the model, it creates an upward bias to your operating margin rate. that's how we should be seeing this business.
so currently, matt, the way i think about it is, for the next 12 to 18 months, we'll be in the transient phase. it will stabilize. but ultimately, we want to drive operating margins into mid to high teens. and as we start selling, upselling and cross selling more services, you should see upward bias on those operating margins and operating margins have a tendency to start expanding.
so our long-term goal is to grow revenue, grow profit faster than revenue. the only way you do that is by expanding your margins.
operator
our next question comes from dan perlin from rbc capital markets. please go ahead with your question.
unknown speaker -- barclays -- analyst
it's actually matt on for dan. following up on the bookings question. is there any way to kind of frame the sort of amount of deals that you walked away from because of the new focus on corporate profitability? and then, i have a follow-up.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes, i'll start there. in terms of the more selective kind of approach that we took, dan, in q1, it was really as a result of the success that we had onboarding all the new logos in 2019 and 2020. and so, as a result of all that success that we had, we really have a strong foundation for growth for the next decade. so we spent quite a bit of time in that land-and-expand strategy as we kind of talked about.
and now really, our focus is on up leveling the initial margin of the new deals that we run after to drive profitability. so i don't have a specific figure other than to say we booked good growth in bookings. we did it at higher margins. our margins grew.
so we're actually very pleased with that result. and as amar kind of mentioned, our propensity for confidence in revenue growth just continues to increase. i think we did a really nice job balancing here. and it was because of the success that we've had with all the new logos and the onboarding last year and the year before.
so we're in a really good spot here.
unknown speaker -- barclays -- analyst
ok. and then, as a follow-up, what are you seeing in terms of like employee costs, availability, etc.?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. so it's an interesting question here, dan, employee cost, as amar mentioned, we've got payroll taxes and things like that that make that cost heavier in the first half of the year compared to the second half of the year. one thing to keep in mind about our business is we're really more of a technology- and software-driven business than a heavy labor business. so in terms of the availability of resources and people, we're in a great -- a really great situation there.
you may remember, dan, we talked about we select fewer than 2% of our job applicants to the company, so very well positioned in terms of labor force availability. we continue to expand our labor force globally. we've got a great workforce management system, all aided by the fact that the core of this business is very strong because rackspace fabric, the software and the ip that automates 75% of our multi-cloud workloads, still we believe the highest automation in the industry. so well positioned here as well.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
if i can just add a quick -- i'm sorry. so i just wanted to add to kevin's remarks there. at the end of the day, we have a good management system, dan, internally to tightly manage our labor costs and nonlabor costs. and we do that on a very regular basis, and also a very good hiring engine as we ramp up, for example, professional services because we are seeing a lot of opportunity for growth in the migration services and cloud services in general.
so feeling good about how we manage our labor and non-labor costs in this company.
unknown speaker -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.

and our next question comes from tien-tsin huang from jpmorgan. please go ahead with your question.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan chase & co -- analyst
thanks. yeah. i just had a follow-up on the being more selective comment you just made there. just is it more of your -- maybe i may ask it differently.
initial pricing, are you just being a little bit more careful with some of the deals, or are you just taking a view on finding clients that meet a certain land-and-expand threshold? just trying to make sure i understand that as best as possible.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
tien-tsin, yes, i'll start. and amar, if you want to, you can jump in. it's a little bit of both, really. we do have a land-and-expand strategy.
and as you know, we've got a very rigorous management system. when we set off on a program, we want to execute on it, right? at rackspace, we get work done and we focus. so that certainly is a big part. we landed all of these new logos.
amar mentioned the strategy, if you can't land, then you can't expand. so we landed, and it's time to expand. so what that does is that is really quite beneficial for us because as you add new business to existing customers, you don't have to repeat the cost for new account managers and some of the infrastructure that we put in place and some of that more kind of recurring costs. a lot of that fixed cost is already there.
so the beauty of expanding is that you can expand the higher margins. so -- and that was certainly part of it. part of it as well, and i'll let amar talk to it, is kind of the rigor that he's brought in and really looking at the margins that we're willing to accept on new deals and really kind of raising -- we have talked about up-leveling that margin for initial deals. so really, a combination of both of them is where we saw the lift in the sold margins in the first quarter, and we're pretty proud of that.
having said that, as we mentioned, i think we're doing a nice job of balancing that against just a tremendous opportunity in the market and our confidence in double-digit revenue growth. amar?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
i think you covered it very well, kevin. i think i would just summarize by saying, at the end of the day, we are focused on return on investments we are making. there's a huge demand out there, and we can afford to be selective. and as you mentioned earlier that if there is no expansion opportunity, i think there is no point of making an initial investment in those accounts.
and so, we take a look at where there are expansion opportunities and where we can make investments so that we can generate that return on those investments by selling higher-value services in the future. and some of this relationship can extend for a decade, and we want to make sure that we are focused on selecting those accounts where we have an opportunity for expansion for -- in the longer term.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan chase & co -- analyst
i'm confident you're being thoughtful about it. just my quick follow-up, staying on bookings, and in the last quarter -- or last year second quarter, you had the texas contract. i think that was a mid-30, near-40 million number. so should we, at least for the second quarter, should we think about growth more sequentially from the first quarter base? i think i heard, kevin, you say that bookings were improving month to month to month in the quarter.
so this is why i'm thinking maybe we should look at it sequentially, you're going to the second quarter given the difficult comp.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. great question, tien-tsin. i'll start. and amar, feel free to jump in.
so i'll give you some color here. we do not guide on bookings, but we're very confident in our pipeline. i believe we've got a lot of runway to continue to grow revenue. yes, more difficult compares given some of the state of texas deal, like you said, last quarter.
well remembered. i'll just say we continue to see momentum. we did see sequential momentum monthly so far this year, and we're working hard in may as well. what i'll kind of just kind of point you back to is our bookings.
our bookings kind of projections internally are incorporated in the guidance for revenue and committed to revenue guidance for the year. feeling strong about that, committed to double-digit revenue growth in 2021 and beyond.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
i would just add very quickly. again, as kevin said, we're not guiding on bookings. but we're also looking at the quality of the pipeline, as well as quality of the bookings. it's not just the bookings dollar numbers, but how the revenue will get realized, what's the margin profile on those bookings, the length of the contracts.
so there are multiple metrics that we use to make sure that we have the right mix of bookings and the quality of bookings that we deliver, and we feel good about it. and i think as i mentioned, if you're operating at a very high baseline of $1 billion of bookings on an annualized basis, since this is all net incremental bookings, it's not -- we're not putting renewals in it or any of those things, contract extensions in it. so since it's all incremental bookings, it really helps to drive a double-digit revenue growth if you are maintaining at the billion-dollar mark or so. so i feel really confident.
i've been here now for six months. i'm still a student of the business, but have done a lot of analysis on how bookings should translate to revenue, what kind of bookings mix do we need to make sure that we deliver -- continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth at the right margin profile, and how we will be able to go expand our margins in the future, and more importantly, continue to generate increasing free cash flow for the company.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan chase & co -- analyst
yes. i appreciate it's one metric of many that's important and that's new sales. but just figured i'd ask, understanding that the texas deal was quite special last year.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
true. very true.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes, very true.

joe crivelli
good afternoon, and welcome to rackspace technology's second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. kevin jones, our chief executive officer; and amar maletira, our president and chief financial officer, join us today. the slide deck we will refer to today can be found on our investor relations website.
on slide 2, certain comments we make on this call will be forward-looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ. a discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. rackspace technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call except as required by law.
our presentation includes certain non-gaap financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. in accordance with sec rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable gaap measures. these reconciliations are in the tables included in our earnings release and slide presentation, both of which are available on our website. after our prepared remarks, we will take your questions.
[operator instructions] i'll now turn the call over to kevin. 
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. i'll discuss quarterly highlights and touch on some customer case studies, then amar will go into detail on the financial results. as shown on slide 5, we delivered a solid second quarter. revenue and non-gaap earnings per share were at the high end of our prior guidance, and non-gaap operating profit exceeded the top end of our guidance.
our new product launches from earlier this year, rackspace elastic engineering and rackspace services for vmware cloud, are off to a good start with some early wins already on the board. the turnaround in cash flow resulting from our working capital and cash management transformation programs has been remarkable. in this quarter, we began paying down debt with the repayment and retirement of our accounts receivable financing facility. the strong cash flow we are now generating will enable us to continue to make progress on reducing our leverage ratio toward our stated targets.
turning to slide 6. total revenue was up 13% and core revenue was up 17% compared to last year's second quarter. non-gaap operating profit was up 4% and non-gaap eps was up mid-teens at 14%, in line with revenue growth. new sales bookings in the second quarter were $258 million, up 6% compared to the first quarter.
this year, we are calibrating new sales bookings to drive both revenue growth and initial sold margin. we believe approximately $1 billion of new sales bookings in 2021 will enable us to drive double-digit revenue growth while optimizing profitability, and we are on track to meet that goal with just over $500 million of bookings in the first half of the year. on slide 7, i want to touch on the transformation initiatives that we announced in late july. over the past six months, we've taken a hard look at every aspect of our business in light of the acceleration of digital transformations and continued migration of our business from mature products to growth products.
through this process, a few things became very clear. we had to free up resources and continue to invest in new solutions. we had to expand our delivery capabilities to meet demand for those new solutions. and we had an opportunity to help employees in our mature businesses develop high-demand skills to meet needs in growing areas.
the actions we announced in july accomplished all of these goals. as part of this initiative, we are providing our rackers, including those impacted by the restructuring with the ability to reskill and retrain for hot new areas in cloud, including elastic engineering and cloud professional services. net-net, we believe the transformation and restructuring initiatives announced in july position rackspace technology extremely well to compete and win in the growing cloud technology solutions industry. as i've done in past quarters, let me share some case studies of how rackspace technology is helping customers do innovative things in the cloud.
on slide 8, let's talk about pure storage, a $6 billion market cap tech company. pure storage serves over 8,000 customers with its storage as a service offering, helping them run their operations seamlessly across multiple clouds. as containers became more practical and a proven technology, pure took notice and looked for a world-class partner who can move fast to build reference architectures on google anthos and kubernetes. the partnership with rackspace technology enabled pure to hit an aggressive 90-day time frame for initial product launch.
pure storage now has reference architectures that can confidently take prospective customers that deliver the benefits of leveraging pure storage on google anthos. slide 9 is a case study from bright skies, the company we acquired in germany in the fourth quarter of 2020. bright skies recently helped dole. the international produce company transitioned its european operations from company-owned data centers to the cloud.
our solution included an entire service package starting with a cloud-readiness assessment, a feasibility study and budget plan and technical workshops to define the target architecture. on an accelerated three-month time line, 100% of dole's virtual machines moved to microsoft azure. today, dole benefits from having its data in the cloud with less complexity, increased productivity and most importantly, reduced costs. now amar will take you through the financials.
amar?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, kevin, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. slide 11 recaps our financial results for the quarter. revenue was $744 million, an increase of 13% year over year. our core business grew 17% year-over-year to $698 million.
non-gaap operating profit was $119 million, up 4% year-over-year. non-gaap operating margin was 16.1%, down 1.5 percentage points year-over-year but within our mid- to high-teens expected range. and non-gaap earnings per share was $0.24, up 14% from last year. slide 12 shows the company's revenue mix in the first quarter by segment and by geography.
multicloud continues to represent the vast majority of our revenue at 82% of the mix, and it grew 17% year over year. apps & cross platform, at 12% of total revenue, grew 16% year over year, driven by growth in application services coupled with strength in our data and security services businesses. openstack, which is our legacy business, declined 20%, in line with our expectations. this segment now represents only 6% of total revenue.
from a regional perspective, americas continues to represent 75% of revenue and grew 12% year over year. apj grew at 39%, while emea grew 13% year over year. as shown on slide 13, q2 was another good quarter of cash flow. gaap cash from operations was $106 million, bringing first half cash from operations to $209 million.
free cash flow, defined as gaap cash from operations minus cash capex, was $77 million, up from $66 million in q1. this brings the total free cash flow for the first half to $143 million. as expected, total capex in q2 was $82 million and total capex intensity was 11%. this was due to the renewal of large enterprise license agreements.
as a reminder, the accounting treatment for these renewals requires us to recognize elas as capex in the period the deal is signed. cash capex was $29 million, and cash capex intensity was 4% in the first quarter. for fiscal year 2021, we expect cash capex intensity in the 4% to 6% range. total cash at the quarter end was $215 million, and we had $375 million of unused revolving credit facility.
we paid down $56 million of debt, including $50 million repayment and termination of the accounts receivable financing facility. on slide 14, we have our guidance for the third quarter. for the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $750 million to $760 million, core revenue of $705 million to $715 million, non-gaap operating profit of $118 million to $122 million, non-gaap earnings per share in the range of $0.23 to $0.25, non-gaap other expenses of $50 million to $52 million, non-gaap tax expense rate of 26%. and we expect non-gaap weighted average shares of 213 million to 215 million.
for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to grow approximately 2% sequentially and operating profit and eps to be flat sequentially. with that, we'll take your questions. joe, please go ahead and queue up the audience for q&a.
joe crivelli
thanks, amar. [operator instructions] our first question comes from dan perlin at rbc.
dan perlin -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
guys, can you hear me? sorry. i just want to make sure it's unmuted.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. we can hear you, dan.
dan perlin -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. so i had a question. you're targeting $1 billion of bookings for the full year. that kind of suggests kind of absolute dollar flattish for the second half or the next two quarters.
so two questions. i think, one, can you just remind us how that is going to translate into double-digit revenue growth for the second half of the year? because the midpoint guidance looks like it decelerates a little bit third quarter to fourth quarter. and then secondly, you clearly have refined the strategy of what you're letting into that funnel. so maybe you can remind us of some of those changes and why that's beneficial to you guys longer term?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
sure. let me get started here, and kevin can add additional color here. so dan, when you take a look at our revenue growth, revenue growth is driven by multiple factors. first, we have a high base of recurring-type revenue, which drives good visibility into the future, and that's what we have factored into our guidance.
second, we are also executing revenue-related initiatives that are less visible to the street, which are mainly focused on things like acceleration of revenue realization, churn reduction and contract renewals. and third, of course, is the bookings that we will get to. so we need to roughly deliver $1 billion of bookings to continue driving double-digit revenue growth in '21 and '22. and if you look at our fiscal '21 guidance, we call for a double-digit growth in revenue.
now in q3, based on our guidance, our core revenue will grow roughly about 13%. and in q4, it will grow about 10-plus percent, depending on what you model for your openstack business. so i think when you take a look at $1 billion, you will see that the revenue growth continues. i think we are looking at the old revenue growth for the full year.
and for the full year, you should expect us to continue delivering about 13%, 14% growth, which is much higher than what we delivered last year.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. and i would just add to that, dan, when you kind of look at the second half for bookings, i would expect third quarter bookings to be lighter than the $250 million run rate to get to that $1 billion total number. that's because of seasonality and summer holidays in certain parts of the world, but then go up again in q4 to kind of balance out at that sort of $1 billion number that, as amar mentioned, we need to sustain double-digit revenue growth. and that's what's built into our guidance as well.
and the second part of the question about, ok, what kind of business we're calibrating, we basically have been calibrating new business bookings along with initial sold margin. and that's been really, i think, a positive development in the company. and what that really is doing is it's allowing us to be more selective. there's a big market out there, and we can be more selective in the actual deals that we take and as we continue to grow our professional services business, our cloud-native application development business, multicloud managed services such as elastic engineering that we recently released and those types of offerings.
so that's kind of where the focus is. amar, anything else to add on that?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
well, i think you said it well. dan, the focus is there's a lot of demand out there. as we have said previously, we want to focus on good quality bookings, bookings that will continue driving not just double-digit revenue growth, but also more importantly, driving the right margin profile for the business and expansion opportunities within those accounts.
joe crivelli
tien-tsin huang, you're up next. and then jim breen, you are on deck.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
i'm hopefully unmuted now. can you guys hear me?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes, we can.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes, we can, tien-tsin.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
terrific. appreciate the question here. i like the format. just on the margin side, i figured i'd ask, we've been focusing on the supply side of the equation.
i think a lot of the industry is talking about war for talent and wage inflation. i'm curious if you're seeing that and how much of that is a factor in some of your margin outlook. i know you're in some hot areas around cloud and whatnot. so i just want to check if that is a focus area that is influencing some of your thinking on the margin versus some of the other things we've talked about in the past.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
do you want to start with that, amar, on the margin? and then i'll pick up a little bit on the comment on the war on talent.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes. absolutely. so tien-tsin, i think what we are seeing is when you look at our margin, gross margins have been declining and continues to do so purely because of the result of mix shift in our business. and it has two components we talked about.
one is the ongoing decline in our legacy openstack business, which we are no longer actively marketing. and second is the mix shift within our multicloud segment where we're seeing from mature to growth products. so growth products have a lower initial gross margins but also have, as you know, lower capex and opex intensity. now i know your question was about how are the gross margins getting impacted because of the war on talent.
i think for us, that is already baked into our guidance. we have made room in our model to continue to make investment in the business. but what we are seeing right now from a gross margin perspective and i want to give you guys more color and broader color on gross margins, we are in a transient phase right now. and we believe it will continue for another four to five quarters.
and during that time, we do expect our gross margins will bottom out in the low 30% range. and once the gross margins bottom out at the end of this transient phase, we expect to inflect with a favorable mix shift to our higher-value cloud services. and we are already seeing some very good traction in our land-and-expand motion, and that gives us a lot of confidence that the margins can start expanding with high-margin products. in fact, if you look at our first half 2021 part of customers, where we sold managed public cloud engagements, we are seeing our cumulative bookings are growing double digits.
the sold gross margins have been expanding significantly. and that gives us the confidence that this higher value expansion with higher value services will play out in the next four to five quarters. now just to give you more color because this also leads you to my guidance question and i'll give you more color on guidance later. but in q3, we do expect gross margins in the 32.5% to 33% range.
and we basically modeled it prudently for the reasons that i just mentioned. we are looking at the mix shift that is going on in the business. we are onboarding more managed public cloud customers. in fact, our new logos continue to grow.
we actually grew 31% in the first half of 2021 compared to first half of 2020, which sees that there's a massive acceleration in the public cloud onboarding of customers. and that's also resulting in some gross margin decline. so we have factored that all into our model as we provided the guidance for the second half. specifically with regard to the gross margins because of talent, i think that is already factored into our guidance.
and we plan to continue investing in the business into the high-growth areas of the market. one more thing i will add, and i'll then cede the floor to kevin, is we are managing this mix shift and expect to deliver operating margins in the mid-teens during this transition phase because as you can see, we announced a restructuring on july 21. we have made sure that the opex structure now aligns to the new gross margin profile of the business. and that should continue to help us deliver these mid-teens operating margins in the next four to five quarters.
kevin, war for talent?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. in terms of the war for talent, yes, we're definitely, tien-tsin, seeing an increase in activity kind of across our industry and customers mention the same thing that they're seeing lots of activity from their competitors in terms of the war for talent. i think we continue to be really well positioned to be able to manage through that. if you kind of look at our business, it's really a technology and automation-driven business with fewer employees than the big systems integration companies and global managed services providers.
we still accept less than 2% of the applicants to the company. having said all that, like amar said, we've baked in investments here, and we were monitoring this kind of industrywide trend closely and being very proactive here.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thanks for that. and amar, you answered my operating margin and gross margin question as well. so i'll cede the floor.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thanks, tien-tsin.
joe crivelli
thanks, tien-tsin. jim breen from william blair, you're up next. and then ramsey el-assal from barclays is on deck.
jim breen -- william blair & company-- analyst
great. can you hear me?
joe crivelli
yes. we can hear you, jim.
jim breen -- william blair & company-- analyst
so can you just give us a little bit more color on the guidance for profitability. if you look at your -- the full year guidance you gave last quarter is over $500 million in the non-gaap operating profit. it seems like you're going to be a little bit below that. so just wondering sort of what's changed over the course of the last quarter or so.
and then just any thoughts on the apps & cross platform. revenue was down sequentially this quarter. just can you just talk about the lumpiness there? thanks.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes, sure, jim. so let me start with the guidance question first, and i did answer some of it in my previous response. but let me start with the revenue guidance first. what you see in our revenue guidance is we expect continued sequential growth in our revenue in both q3 as well as q4 and a double-digit core and overall revenue growth for fiscal 2021.
that's what we have basically baked into our revenue guidance. so revenue guidance for the full year is roughly at the midpoint of the overall guidance for fiscal 2021. now what do you see on our profit guidance? so profit guidance reflects lower gross margins in the second half '21 and i may be repeating this, but i want to make sure that we give you more transparency into this. so we are seeing a mix shift happening in the business that's impacting our gross margins.
i talked about the ongoing decline in the legacy openstack business, which we are no longer actively marketing. the second is the mix shift within our multicloud segment, from mature business to high-growth business that we talked about and mainly managed public cloud. as i mentioned, we are onboarding a large number of public cloud customers. and this transition is happening very rapidly with accelerated growth in public cloud, and you could see that from the growth announcement by hyper-cloud providers.
so what we have done is we have prudently modeled gross margins in the second half in the 32% to 33% range. also, with the restructuring that we announced on july 21, we have aligned our opex to this new gross margin profile to continue delivering operating margins in the mid-teens in the second half of '21 while we continue to make investments in growth offerings and go-to-market that we mentioned earlier. so all this is baked into our guidance. now if i just have to extend it a little bit and go forward and give you more color for the next four to five quarters, we believe that we are in this transient phase with this mix shift that is happening in the business.
and our projections indicate that this will continue for the next four to five quarters. and during this transition phase, we do expect our gross margins to bottom out in the low 30%. and by the end of fiscal '22, we do expect it to start inflecting with a favorable mix shift to higher cloud -- higher-value cloud services for three reasons. one, our legacy openstack product is becoming a smaller and smaller part of our revenue mix.
it's already down to 6% of our revenue. second is we expect the mix shift in multicloud to be largely complete, and it's expected to be more than 80% of the mix. and third is more meaningful expansion in our newer accounts with higher-margin services. and these expansions typically take some time, but this is a long-term play for us.
so those are a few reasons why we believe that it will stabilize and then we have an inflection point starting the end of fiscal 2022. did that help, jim?
jim breen -- william blair & company-- analyst
yes. that's great. and then just on the apps & cross platform side, we saw the revenue down a little bit this quarter.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
sure.
jim breen -- william blair & company-- analyst
just what your thoughts are there.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
right. so in q2, when you look at our apps & cross platform, it did grow about 16% year-on-year. so it was a healthy growth but it was down about 5% sequentially. and also as a part of our restructuring, we did exit a small line of business in application services that we figured that it's non-strategic for us.
so we continuously evaluate the portfolio and there was a non-strategic part of the business that we exited. and this explains most of the sequential decrease in apps & cross platform going from, say, q1 to q2. now we think that this segment will continue to deliver revenue in the $90 million to $93 million range in q3 and q4 and continue to grow at a healthy clip.
joe crivelli
our next question comes from ramsey el-assal with barclays. ramsey, are you there? i think we've lost ramsey. so there are no further questions in the queue. so with that, we'll call it a wrap.
again, if you have follow-up questions, you can reach out to me after the fact at ir@rackspace.com, and have a good evening.

good afternoon, and welcome to rackspace technologies' third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. kevin jones, our ceo; and amar maletira, our president and cfo are joining us today. the slide deck we will refer to today can be found on our ir website.
on slide 2, certain comments we make on this call will be forward-looking. those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ. the discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. rackspace technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call except as required by law.

[operator instructions] i'll now turn the call over to kevin. 
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. i'll discuss quarterly highlights and touch on some customer case studies then amar will go into detail on the financial results. turning to slide 5. as a best-in-class pure-play cloud solutions company, rackspace technology is well-positioned in a market that is booming.
over the past five years, our cloud partners, aws, google cloud, and microsoft azure have grown their revenues tenfold. in the third quarter alone, aws grew 39 percent, azure grew 48 percent, and google cloud grew 45 percent. to put things in context, in 2020, incremental new cloud spending with our hyperscaler partners was $22 billion. that total is expected to grow to $34 billion in 2021.
and next year, analysts estimate that new cloud spending will grow again to approximately $44 billion. as they move their business to the cloud, customers are grappling with the pace of change, especially mid-sized and commercial businesses and state and local governments. they need help and rackspace technology is poised to be their partner of choice wherever they are in their cloud journey. in the third quarter, we took several steps to solidify our market-leading position.
the financial results reflect this. revenue, core revenue, non-gaap operating profit, and non-gaap eps all grew at a healthy year-over-year clip. we delivered strong operating cash flow of over $100 million for the third quarter in a row. for the first three quarters of 2021, operating cash flow is now in excess of $300 million.
we continue to introduce timely new product and service offerings that help our customers get the most out of their cloud investment. our new elastic engineering model is seeing fast adoption, and we have expanded it to several new areas. and we are very excited about the launch of rackspace data freedom, a new storage solution based on robust rackspace-developed technology that gives customers a cloud-adjacent storage option to manage cost and increase data fluidity across multiple cloud platforms. our broad customer base puts our finger on the pulse of the cloud market.
our service development strategy is driven by those insights. because of this, rackspace data freedom is targeted at a massive white space in the cloud market and addresses a pain point we see and hear about every day from our customers. having our ears so close to such a diverse customer base, especially mid-sized and smaller businesses is a key rackspace advantage. on the esg front, earlier this month, we launched our first comprehensive esg report since returning to the public markets.
i'll talk more about this later in the presentation. we are investing in our employees and culture to differentiate rackspace technology as an employer of choice in the current war for talent. this helps us attract prospective employees and retain our most valuable assets, our dedicated rackers. these investments are delivering results.
in the third quarter alone, we are recognized as one of the 50 most engaged workplaces by achievers, a top 50 workplace in the country for latinos by latina style, and a top place to work for mothers, fathers, and parents working remotely by parents at work. turning to slide 6, we continue to deliver revenue growth well into the double digits. total revenue was up 12 percent and core revenue was up 15 percent compared to last year's third quarter. non-gaap operating profit was up six percent and non-gaap eps was up 32 percent.
we expect a strong fourth quarter for bookings and believe we will hit our full-year new business bookings target of $1 billion. in the third quarter, new sales bookings were $200 million. on slide 7, a key growth strategy for rackspace technology is to forge partnerships that bring best-in-class cloud solutions to our customers. accordingly, in the third quarter, we strengthened our relationships with leading cloud solutions companies such as snowflake, datadog, cloudflare, and platform9 [audio gap] partner in q3.
we are investing and staffing up our team of snowflake-certified engineers over the next few quarters. with data-dog, we were recently named a gold-tier partner, and we're working closely with them to develop mutual go-to-market sales motions. we are developing a tailored elastic engineering service for cloudflare to help our customers customize, optimize, and manage their security platforms. as we noted on our most recent earnings call, channel partner development is a priority for cloudflare in 2022.
as you may remember, earlier this year, we invested in platform9, a saas-managed kubernetes platform that builds and operates clusters across edge, private, and public clouds. with platform9, we are bringing these solutions to market to help make kubernetes simple to own, operate, and scale. strong partnerships like these in creative joint go-to-market solutions are exciting growth opportunities for rackspace technology, alongside managed public cloud and our private cloud offerings. now, i'd like to share some case studies demonstrating the value that rackspace technology delivers for its customers.
first, one from the middle east. on slide 8, bfc group is a major fintech company based in bahrain, providing global money transfers, foreign exchange, and currency and payment solutions. bfc needed to modernize its core applications to better support a physical business model while accelerating a digital transformation and preparing for international expansion. at recommendation of aws, bfc group selected rackspace technology as a support partner for migrating its core application to the cloud and providing ongoing management and consultancy services.
using a comprehensive solution, including aws and a long-term contract for rackspace security essentials, we help the company create a flexible and stable platform, allowing it to focus on what it does best: helping customers move their money around the world. bfc group saw an immediate uplift in critical measures of performance such as transactions processed per second and improved customer experience. on slide 9, arthrex is a privately held medical device company based in florida. arthrex is a pioneer in the field of arthroscopic surgery and has developed over 13,000 innovative products addressing a range of orthopedic procedures.
arthrex wanted to reimagine and modernize the postsurgery experience by creating a digital communications portal that would give surgeons customizable templates that could quickly populate and make available for patients to access on-demand. in just 12 months, rackspace technology built this communications portal on, alongside a mobile app to download media and metadata from arthrex's medical imaging technology. this solution both increased patient satisfaction and reduced the administrative burden on surgeons. turning to slide 10.
last week, rackspace technology published its first comprehensive esg report since going public in 2020. suffice it to say, invest in esg has always been part of the company's dna, and it's an extremely high priority for me, our executive leadership team, and our board of directors. esg is not something we do because it's fashionable, it is part and parcel of our existence as a company and is rooted in how we work every day. the esg report demonstrates that rackspace technology is 100 percent committed to being a thoughtful steward of our planet's natural resources and an employer of choice for the most talented professionals in the technology industry.
additionally, it highlights our focus on being a force for good in the communities we serve and a transparent shareholder and customer-focused publicly traded company. this report is simply the first step in providing our constituents with improved transparency into our esg initiatives. we are devoted to continuous improvement in this area, and those efforts will be fully visible to shareholders as we move forward. i encourage you to download and read the esg report, which can be found on our website.
now, amar will take you through the financials. amar?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, kevin, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. slide 12 recaps our financial results for the quarter. revenue was $763 million, a 12 percent year-over-year increase. core revenue grew 15 percent year over year to $718 million.
non-gaap operating profit was $124 million, up six percent year over year. non-gaap operating margin was 16.2 percent, within our mid- to high-teens expected range. and non-gaap earnings per share was $0.25, up 32 percent from last year. let me now touch on the third quarter bookings.
as kevin noted, bookings in the third quarter were $200 million, and we still expect to hit our $1 billion bookings target for fiscal 2021. we've won a large competitive deal, which we had been working for sometime early in the fourth quarter, and we expect to have it signed before year-end. throughout 2021, bookings have run lower than 2020. this is because we changed our go-to-market strategy at the start of this year.
since pivoting to the fast-growing cloud market two years ago, we have followed a land-and-expand strategy. in 2020, we focused on the land part of this equation as we had a massive opportunity to establish beachheads with new customers. the deals with onboarded in 2020 were heavily weighted toward infrastructure in the early stages of this customer relationships, which drives higher-dollar bookings. at the start of 2021, we aligned our sales and incentive plans more toward the expense side of the equation to deepen and grow revenue and profitability with our new customers while also selectively adding new logos.
this has tilted the sales equation toward contracts but relatively with smaller-gross bookings but higher profitability. to put a finer point on this, slide 13 provides additional details on how we are growing our business with the new managed public cloud customers that we onboarded in 2020. as this slide demonstrates, our land-and-expand strategy is working. customers for all pre-2020 cohorts have grown their business with rackspace technology well into the double digits for the past four quarters and the increase in sold gross margins on these bookings ranges from 200 to 400 basis points.
in addition, we have seen cumulative bookings and saw gross margin increase in every quarter since these customers were onboarded. this validates our go-to-market strategy. last year, we pressed the accelerator on growth to onboard new logos. now, we are benefiting from the installed base, and each quarter, our customers buy additional high-value services from us.
looking ahead, we will be investing to broaden and deepen our portfolio of service offerings as the cloud market evolves at a rapid pace. this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in a wide, open market space. we plan to take maximum advantage now while it's still early. slide 14 shows the components of our revenue, as well as the transition of our multicloud revenue to growth businesses.
multicloud continues to represent the vast majority of our revenue at 82 percent of the mix, and it grew 15 percent year over year. apps and cross platform at 12 percent of total revenue grew 11 percent year over year, driven by growth in applications services, coupled with strength in our data and security services business. openstack, which is our legacy business, declined 20 percent, and this segment represents only six percent of total revenue. growth market offerings are now in the mid-70 percent range of the multicloud segment and continue to grow between 30 percent and 40 percent year over year.
as shown on slide 15, we had another strong order for cash flow. gaap cash from operations was $102 million, which is the third quarter in a row in which operating cash flow exceeded $100 million. year to date, cash flow from operations was $311 million. free cash flow, defined as gaap cash from operations minus cash capex was $81 million, up from $77 million in the second quarter.
this take for the year-to-date total free cash flow to $224 million. total capex was $35 million and total capex intensity was five percent. cash capex was $21 million and cash capex intensity was three percent in the third quarter. for fiscal year 2021, we expect cash capex intensity in the four percent to six percent range.
total cash increased to $260 million at the quarter-end. we had $375 million of unused revolving credit facility, bringing total liquidity toward $600 million. on slide 16, we have our guidance for the fourth quarter. we expect revenue in the range of $766 million to $776 million, core revenue of $724 million to $732 million, non-gaap operating profit of $118 million to $122 million, and non-gaap earnings per share in the range of $0.23 to $0.25.
we also expect non-gaap other expenses of $51 million to $52 million, and non-gaap tax expense rate of 26 percent, and non-gaap weighted average shares of 212 million to 214 million shares. on the right side of the slide, you'll see what this computes to for the full year. with that, we'll take your questions. joe, please go ahead and queue up the audience for q and a.
joe crivelli
thanks, amar. [operator instructions] our first question comes from kevin mcveigh at credit suisse and tien-tsin huang from jpmorgan. you're on deck.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks so much, and congratulations on the results. i wonder if you could help dimensionalize the large booking deal you were awarded after quarter-end. give us a sense of, you know, how that settles into 2022 as well.
and again, congratulations on the results.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
hey, thank you very much, kevin. kevin jones here. so, look, on the big deal, you know, we said, you know, we'd be very selective in terms of which new deals we would pursue. and as a cloud solutions provider, you know, this deal is in our wheelhouse from a, you know, products standpoint and services standpoint and fits into our strategy.
so, we ran hard after it. we were, you know, awarded the business in october and beat, you know, some of our largest competitors. and, you know, we were selected for the differentiated cloud solutions that we provide. so, what we're doing now, kevin, we're working diligently with this customer to, you know, hammer out all the documentation and formally sign it by the end of the year.
and we're very excited, we want it, and we'll provide more, you know, more details when we can formally announce the deal. but i can tell you we believe it will be the largest deal in the history of the company.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
it sounds great. and then, obviously, it seems like you've made some progress, too, with some of these partnerships with snowflake, datadog, cloudflare. any sense of, you know, how that could ultimately impact and potentially translate to revenues as we think about the model going forward?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for that, kevin. yeah, we're pretty excited about this. you know, we want to forge partnerships that really bring best-in-cloud -- you know, best-in-class cloud solutions to our customers.
so, what we did is we strengthened our relationships with snowflake, datadog, cloudflare, and platform9. let's talk about these for a minute. you know, with snowflake, we're a select partner and on our way to becoming a premier partner. we're actively hiring more snowflake-certified engineers over the next few quarters so that's exciting.
with datadog, we're recently named a gold-tier partner and, you know, what we're doing there is we're jointly developing go-to-market sales motions. you know, cloudflare, noted on our most recent earnings call that channel partner development is a priority for them. so, you know, really excited to be early on that front, and we're developing elastic engineering for cloudflare to help our customers, you know, customize, optimize, and manage their security platforms. and earlier this year, we made the equity investment in platform9.
platform9 is a, you know, a saas-managed kubernetes platform, and what we're doing in platform9 is we're bringing edge, private, and public cloud solutions to market to help make kubernetes simple to operate and scale. so, these are really exciting partnerships, exciting growth opportunities for rackspace technology, of course, alongside our managed public cloud and private cloud solutions. so, you know, kevin, we've had encouraging progress. you know, i think it's a little early to, you know, forecast revenue contributions from the offerings, but we're on it.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
and just to add there, kevin, if i may. this is, again, in line with our strategy of moving up the stack. we know right now what's going in the market. there's a lot of businesses coming at the infrastructure layer.
the next opportunity is on the cloud-native application and then data. so, you can see that all this partnership is at an early stage and this is in line with us moving up the stack from a strategy perspective.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
congratulation again.
joe crivelli
thanks, kevin. tien-tsin huang from jpmorgan, you're up. and ramsey el-assal from barclays is on deck. tien-tsin, do we have you?
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
i think i'm on mute. can you hear me?
joe crivelli
there you go.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
hey, tien-tsin.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
perfect. thanks, joe, for moderating. it's good to talk to you, guys. so, yeah, the second half bookings, i'm just focusing in on that, the $500 million or so implied in your guidance.
can we annualize that as a good baseline to consider for 2022 since this captures your more selective client prospecting criteria as you just talked about, or was that dangerous to do given the large deal you expect to close in the fourth quarter?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
so, i want to just give you a little color, tien-tsin. thanks for the question on bookings' momentum and a little bit about the pipeline then i'll have amar, you know, jump in as well. you know, so, we feel good about the bookings' momentum. you know, we're focused this year on optimizing, you know, our bookings mix for bookings dollars and profitability.
you know, we've seen good results in the sold gross margins in the third quarter were the highest level that we've seen in years. and, you know, we think a billion dollars of new business bookings is the right number to go after, and we see plenty of business in the pipeline to, you know, to accomplish this goal. and then in our -- in terms of our pipeline, you know, it's healthy. you know, we continue to refine our sales focus.
and what we're seeing with customers is they're really grappling with the pace of change, right, particularly mid-sized commercial businesses and state and local governments. and, you know, we're seeing them come to rackspace to help them on their cloud journey. the other thing is lots of interests, tien-tsin, in our new product offerings. so, you know, elastic engineering, delivery model has redefined how managed services are delivered in the cloud.
we've got data freedom, which is extremely exciting. this is the offering we launched in september and, you know, we would launched that directly as a result of feedback that we're hearing from our customers, and that's a pain point that they're experiencing on their cloud journey. so, you know, feeling good about bookings' momentum and solid pipeline.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. thanks for that, kevin. just maybe for you, amar, if you don't mind on the sg and a leverage showing some strength there to help offset some of the gross margin pressure, as you said you would do. is there more to go there? anything unusual in the third quarter to call out?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
no, i think it came in line with our expectation, tien-tsin. and so, as i've indicated in the previous earnings call, we are focused on making sure that we also make investments on both opex, as well as cost of revenue as we see a huge opportunity in the marketplace. so, to answer your question, the sg and a came in line with our expectations.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
very good. well done. thank you.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thanks.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
thanks, tien-tsin.
joe crivelli
so, ramsey el-assal from barclays, you're up. and amit daryanani from evercore, you're on deck.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
can you hear me, gentlemen?
joe crivelli
yeah.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
hey.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
hey, how are you tonight? i wanted to ask about the apps and cross platform growth, excluding the nonstrategic exit. what was the impact from that in the quarter? and do you see any other pockets of the business that are similarly nonstrategic?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so, you know, we gave some details in last quarter earnings call, ramsey, that the nonstrategic piece of the business, the quarterly run rate was about $3.5 million to $4 million. so, which is about three to four points of growth that we, you know, since we did an end of life on that. i think that was in -- that result in a headwind. but within that portfolio, we have data that is growing very, very rapidly.
we have security services that's also growing very rapidly. we will continue to look at that portfolio, making sure that, you know, we retain the strategic piece of the portfolio that aligns to our cloud play. and i think we continuously look and -- look to rationalize the portfolio. so far, there's nothing else in that portfolio that we will deemphasize.
we already did that with a restructuring exercise we did in july.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
i would agree. i would just add, ramsey, you know, security data service is pretty hot areas of the, you know, the business right now, you know, particularly given, you know, the challenges that our customers are facing with high-profile hacks and ransomware and every company really needs to be hypervigilant with regard to security. and then data, of course, you know, as companies have moved to the cloud, they're eager to mine this data for valuable insights. and, you know, we've got, you know, strong data services practice.
and then, you know, broad, you know, more broadly within the app development word, again, we're focused on cloud-native application development. you know, a lot of companies have lifted and shifted applications to the cloud without optimizing those applications. so, you know, this is another hot area for us.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
thanks for that, and one quick follow-up for me. can you talk about the capex flows in the quarter? they came in a lot lower than our model. and anything to read into in terms of a new run rate or any type of lumpiness there that we should be aware of?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so, ramsey, from a capex perspective, again, it is in line with our expectations. if you recall, i said, for the full year, we should be in the seven percent to nine percent range. in the -- in q3, it came in certainly in line with what we were expecting.
i expect now for the full year to be at the low end of the seven percent to nine percent range, in line with our -- us moving toward a more capital-light model. so, it's going as planned.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
got it. ok. thank you very much.
joe crivelli
thanks, ramsey. amit daryanani from evercore, you're up. rob palmisano, raymond james, you're on deck.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. hopefully, you all can hear me.
joe crivelli
yes.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
i have two questions as well. you know, i guess, first off, you know, kevin, i have to look at these investments you've talked about on the cloud solution that you're, you know, you're maybe accelerating them and then you talked about cloudflare, snowflake, etc. i'm curious, is the demand for these solutions really coming from your existing customers, existing logos that use rackspace for infrastructure, and they want to scale this into helping them build and manage the cloud data solutions? or are these relationships that's been helping you go out and get new logos that you would eventually bring on the infrastructure side?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yeah. very good. so, maybe i'll start and then amar can talk about some of the investments. so, yeah, absolutely.
we do see a, you know, momentum, amit. you know, with the installed base of customers that we have on it and the the the new logos. you know, if you just look at, you know, q3 bookings, thousands of individual deals, you know, very diversified across geos and segments, 30 percent of bookings from international markets. and year to date, you know, to your point, we've actually seen a good growth on new logos signed.
as we talked about, you know, sold margin, highest spend in a couple of years. so, you know, we're pleased with our new logo progress. and we've made, you know, i think, a really good progress on our installed base account planning, you know, as we've gone forward and, you know, looked at retraining, upskilling our account executives. we've got much more sophisticated account planning.
this is all through regions of the world, and so we're seeing pipeline develop from that as well. so, really, it's a combination of new logos and installed base.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and then, kevin, can i just follow up, you know, in '21 as in so far, right, we have seen gross margins to have some downside pressure. i think it's been a big focus among folks out, but your free cash flow, i think, on the other hand, has been remarkably consistent. you know, just in the expansion of free cash flow margins and even dollars -- total free cash dollars.
i'm wondering as we think about calendar '22, do you think we are likely to see gross margins and free cash flow both improve in a much more consistent manner? or do you think you can continue to expand free cash flow even if you don't see gross margins move higher next year?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so, amit, i will give you more color on the 2022 when we announce the q4 results. but just to give you a little bit more color on gross margins, you know, our gross margins, as you know, in q3 '20, you know, third quarter came in line with our expectation. and also, my guidance that i provided to you, guys. as you know, this is a transition phase, driven by all the internal mix shift that is going on, not a mix on market dynamics.
and as we transition to a cloud-centric business model, we are undergoing some necessary shifts in the business model. so, we believe that the gross margins will stabilize at the end of this transition period, and we expect the profitability to inflect upwards with a favorable mix shift through the higher-value cloud services that kevin was talking about, right? so, we are already seeing very good traction. in our prepared remarks, we talked about our land-and-expand motion. our sold gross margins have improved significantly, and this has become the leading indicator and gives us confidence that margins will expand with higher-margin products as the opportunity for us to expand into this installed base, you know, just -- is just ahead of us.
and that's where we're making investments. as kevin mentioned, we're making investments in cloud-native application development, we're making investments in data services. these are the up-the-stack opportunities as customers migrate more and more workloads with application and data from the on-prem environment to a cloud environment, a multicloud environment. so, that's -- now, regarding cash flow, very good, you know, progress as you see.
you rightly said, you know, our cash flow from operations and free cash flow have significantly improved. we draw a lot of working capital improvement and i'm a big believer of earnings quality, and i do believe that cash flow from operations should track to roughly about 70 percent or so to the operating profits on a non-gaap basis. and that basically defines the quality of earnings, and that's what we are focused on.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much.
joe crivelli
thanks, amit. rob palmisano from raymond james you're up. and we have keith bachman from bmo, you're on deck. rob, are you there? all right.
we'll come back to you. keith -- oh, there you go.
rob palmisano -- raymond james -- analyst
right. got it. so, hey, guys, rob on for frank. so, how are the cost savings initiatives tracking? and can you give us an update on where you guys are at with your offshoring process?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes. thanks, rob. clb, if you recall, we said will drive a savings of $95 million to $100 million of gross run-rate savings. and we have taken most of this -- most of it will come from labor actions, and through q3, the majority of those actions have been completed.
and the rest of, you know, there will be nonlabor stuff that will continue and will be largely done by the end of q4 or in fiscal q1 2022. so, we will see the realized -- the full annualized benefit in 2022. we started seeing those savings even now, and we are reinvesting it back into the business. so, that's where we are, so we are tracking to our plans.
offshoring is going quite well. we are building a very good global footprint. we have accelerated that, too, in line with what we had planned for. and so, very pleased with the progress there.
rob palmisano -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you.
joe crivelli
thanks, rob. keith bachman from bmo, you're up. and then our final question will come from brian keane at deutsche bank.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. thank you. i had a few if you can hear me ok. amar, i want to come to you and follow up on the gross margin question.
two things on gross margins. a, could you -- last quarter you gave a specific number for the september quarter, and i was hoping you could do the same thing for q4 just so we all keep our models within certain parameters. and then part b of the question is, again, on the last quarter call, you indicated that, you know, gross margins would bottom and perhaps get -- move upward but you needed four to five quarters. so, we should be thinking about the september quarter, december quarter of '22.
i'd like to see if you could just revisit that because i thought slide 15, in particular, was interesting in that you've gotten pretty good gross margin performance on that -- on a cumulative process from your cohort trends in 2020. so, we could just revisit on those gross margin trends, and i have a follow-up.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes, so, i would say, keith, gross margins were in line with our expectations for q3 as you indicated. in the last quarter earnings call, i provided some color on gross margins and expected trends and have no changes from that position at this time.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. but any specific gross margin do you want us to think about for q4?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so, you know, i think i gave that color last quarter, so i think i'll go with that, whatever i had mentioned last quarter.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. all right. then turning to cash flow if i could. you also -- you're taking some restructuring charges and whatnot this year and so on.
the question is really geared toward how much of that is cash? and so, the reason i'm asking the question, could that be presumably lower restructuring charges in '22? is that a potential tailwind to your reported free cash flow metrics in '22?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes, i think that's a great question, keith. yes, that will be a tailwind in fiscal '22 because, you know, those restructuring charges that accrued and some of those cash that also go out the door in fiscal 2021. we will have some of it in the first half of 2022 but then it would serve as a tailwind from thereafter.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. any quantification on the amount that's impacting '21 versus early '22 on a cash basis?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
i don't have the numbers right in front of me but, you know, i'll give you that color when we announce the q4 earnings. we will have more model numbers tied to it.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. ok. i will jump back in queue. thank you.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thank you.
joe crivelli
next question comes from brian keane at deutsche bank. go ahead, brian.
brian keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, guys. i just want to ask about how you're measuring market share, you know, looking at those high-growth markets. although you guys are growing fast, i guess it's 30 percent to 40 percent, which is 70 percent to 75 percent multicloud. you know, is there -- are you gaining enough of the share there, or is there still room to grow because as you outlined, that area still grows significantly fast upwards of sometimes 50 percent? and then secondarily, just thinking about the nongrowth markets, which i think is the non-vmware private cloud and managed hosting.
is that an area that's going to be relatively flattish growth while the cloud side of the business should grow the fastest?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so, i would start -- i'll use some additional color based from what we have said before. so, the growth market, which is roughly about 70 percent to 75 percent of the multicloud mix is growing within 30 percent to 40 percent. and if you take a look at, you know, our competitors in this space or even the hyperscalers, we are actually growing faster than them. so, you know, you can say based on that that we are taking market share.
but again, this is such a broad market, it's so fragmented, it's hard to figure out whether we're taking market share or not. but clearly, from a growth -- you know, from a growth rate, it's a good indicator that we are winning in the marketplace. now, as it relates to the mature side of the product, you know, i will not give any specific guidance. if you do the math, that business is declining and rightfully so because, you know, some of them -- some of the business, we are purposefully moving to the growth side of the business.
we are helping the transition -- customers' transition because that's where the future is. you know, the earlier the transition to the new side -- the new -- the growth side of the business, our good side of portfolio, we have an upsell opportunities for these clients where we can go and sell assets that, you know, cloud-native application, data services, more migration services as more and more workloads get transferred as developed new work tools will have them to build modern applications. and that's the plan. and so, you -- that's the dynamics within those two sub-portfolios within multicloud.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yeah. because what i'm thinking about is thinking about the big picture here with the mix of business being pulled higher for those high-growth markets as they become a bigger percentage of revenue. and, you know, some of the mature market shrinks in multicloud plus openstack shrinks as a percentage, i think, down to six percent of mix. and it doesn't naturally.
the revenue growth accelerates a little bit just based on mix alone.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
that's -- i would say, if you think through that rationally, that's probably the case. now, we will give you more color on that and what happens in fiscal '22 when we announce our q4 results. but, you know, that -- i think you're thinking the right way.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think that's the intention of our strategy of the company exactly. i think you've summarized it well as to move to the, you know, the hyper-growth areas of the market and that's where our investment and our focus is, brian.
brian keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. thanks, guys.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
thanks, brian keane.
joe crivelli
well, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. if you have follow-up questions or if you want to schedule additional time with the team, please reach out to me at ir@rackspace.com. have a great rest of your day, and we'll talk to you soon.

joe crivelli
good afternoon, and welcome to rackspace technology's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. kevin jones, our ceo; and amar maletira, our president and cfo, join us today. the slide deck we will reference during the call can be found on our ir website.
on slide 2, certain comments we make on this call will be forward-looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ. a discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. rackspace technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call except as required by law.
our presentation includes certain non-gaap financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. in accordance with sec rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures in the earnings release and presentation, both of which are available on our website. after our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. [operator instructions] and i'll now turn the call over to kevin. 
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. i'll discuss quarterly highlights and touch on some customer case studies, then amar will go into detail on the financial results. turning to slide 5. as a best-in-class pure-play cloud solutions company, rackspace technology is well-positioned in a market that is booming.
our cloud partners, aws, google cloud and microsoft azure, grew revenue by 40% to 50% year over year in the fourth quarter. in addition, at the annual aws re:invent user conference in december, aws ceo, adam selipsky, stated that by their estimates, the market in cloud is only 5% to 15% penetrated at present. so we are very early in the growth trajectory of the cloud market. every company, whether large enterprise or small or medium-sized business, is wrestling with the move to the cloud.
customers need help modernizing and automating, and they are choosing their partners for their cloud journey. in the fourth quarter, rackspace technology continued to solidify our position as the partner of choice wherever our customers are on their transition to the cloud. the financial results reflect this. revenue and core revenue exceeded our expectations and non-gaap operating profit and non-gaap eps grew year over year.
we delivered strong operating cash flow for the fourth quarter in a row. and for the full year, operating cash flow was over $370 million, a threefold increase in just one year. we continue to introduce new product and service offerings to help customers get the most from their cloud investment and to address unmet white spaces in the cloud market. as an example, over 70% of sap and oracle erp applications still sit in customers' data centers, and these companies know they have to modernize, move or upgrade their solutions in the coming years.
so in the fourth quarter, we introduced rackspace elastic engineering for erp to address this multibillion-dollar opportunity. we also earned sap on google cloud specialization in the google cloud partner advantage program, which highlights our expertise in migrating erp apps to the cloud. in addition, we believe the just analytics acquisition we announced in january will allow us to aggressively pursue the growing data analytics market, more on that in a moment. the bt partnership we announced in january will significantly enhance our presence in europe.
turning to slide 6. we continue to deliver strong revenue growth. total revenue was up 9%, and core revenue was up 11% compared to last year's fourth quarter. non-gaap operating profit was $122 million and non-gaap eps was $0.25.
total bookings for the quarter were $329 million, bringing our total for the year to just over $1 billion. on slide 7. the bt deal that we closed on christmas eve 2021 is the biggest new business win in rackspace technology history and aligns us with one of the largest companies in the world as we jointly pursue the cloud market. bt called out our partnership on its most recent earnings call, saying that it benefited their customers by virtue of our cloud integration, automation, and ai capability.
as part of this deal, bt's hybrid cloud offerings will be based on our private cloud infrastructure, including rackspace services for vmware cloud. together with bt, we will help customers modernize their business and expedite their journey to the cloud. this partnership brings with it hundreds of new enterprise customers that will be migrated from bt to rackspace technology beginning in 2022. going forward, we will be bt's premier cloud technology partner and, together, we will jointly pursue additional cloud transformation business for our private cloud customers.
the bt partnership validates rackspace technology's right to win, complex cloud deployments in the enterprise market. as you can imagine, this is a highly competitive deal with a selection process that extended well over a year, and we prevailed against some of our largest and most sophisticated competitors. the market for cloud data and analytics is large and growing rapidly with expectations that spend in this area will increase significantly for the next several years. so on slide 8.
we also announced in january that we've acquired just analytics, a leading provider of cloud-based data analytics and artificial intelligence services in the apj region and a gold partner for microsoft azure. founded in 2011, just analytics has grown from a small start-up company to 100 employees with headquarters in singapore and 65 employees in vietnam and india. just analytics helps customers design and create scalable data pipelines using its proprietary data platform, guzzle. that, coupled with cloud-based data and analytics services that transform data into insights, gives customers a unified view of their information assets, data services aligned with our intent to build and innovate our public cloud business and help our customers move up the stack.
acquiring a market-leading company like just analytics is a fast way to build our capabilities and regional presence. this acquisition is similar to the successful bright skies tuck-in acquisition we completed in q4 2020 in that it strengthens both our capabilities and geographic presence. on slide 9. in addition to the release of our first esg report during the fourth quarter, we continue to improve our profile from an esg standpoint.
for the first time, we made our carbon disclosure project, or cdp, environmental disclosures accessible to investors. this will allow esg investors to monitor and track our progress as we continue to march toward our goal of a carbon-neutral profile five years ahead of the paris accord deadline. we continue to win accolades for our racker culture. in the fourth quarter, we were named a top workplace for the next generation of talent in the next gen 100 survey.
these differentiators matter in the current war for talent, and we believe this one, in particular, will help in recruiting with millennials and gen z-ers. we were also named the no. 2 best place to work in it in mexico by great place to work mexico. from a governance standpoint, we added an additional independent director, shashank samant, to our board.
shashank, who is the ceo of globallogic, has over 30 years of technology services industry experience and brings a passion for technology and innovation to our company. he will bring a truly global perspective, deep industry expertise, and cloud and digital transformation experience. as i've done in past quarters, i'd like to share some case studies demonstrating the value that rackspace technology delivers for its customers. on slide 10, we have a case study of a customer that fits well with our esg sustainability initiatives.
voltagrid's mobile microgrids provide power in remote locations, but their customer-facing application also provides live emissions tracking, carbon intensity and esg reporting to users on a centralized database. voltagrid needed a complete solution that incorporated machine learning, ai, iot, and edge computing, along with the portal through which clients could access and track real-time operations and emissions data. they tapped into rackspace technology's expertise for cloud-native development, internet of things, and security to build the voltagrid ai ecosystem portal. this entire project, including deployment of remote iot technology, building the entire cloud infrastructure, and creating the application was completed in less than a year.
and as a result, voltagrid was able to launch its service and enhance its product offering quicker than had initially been predicted. i'll note that in december, voltagrid completed a $100 million capital raise funded by esg investors such as canada pension plan investment board, longbow capital, pilot company, and walter ventures. on slide 11. pipedrive is a global provider of saas software that's considered to be a unicorn in the eastern european market.
pipedrive needed to scale its crm sales and marketing platform to meet the requirements of its global customer base, especially those outside of the eu. by deploying rackspace private cloud solutions, pipedrive was able to minimize customer response times while addressing the eu's stringent security, compliance, and data sovereignty requirements. the addition of a private cloud environment to pipedrive's overall cloud footprint also reduced business risk in the unlikely event of data center or connectivity issues. furthermore, we've won additional follow-on business from pipedrive, and we'll be expanding its aws public cloud environment as our customers' needs continue to grow.
now amar will take you through the financials. amar?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, kevin, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. slide 13 recaps our financial results for the fourth quarter. revenue was $777 million, a 9% year-over-year increase. core revenue grew 11% year over year to $734 million.
non-gaap operating profit was $122 million, non-gaap operating margin was 16% and non-gaap earnings per share was $0.25, all of which were on the high end of a range of expectations for the quarter. on slide 14, you see our financial results for the full year. revenue was $3 billion, up 11% from 2020. core revenue grew 14% for the year.
non-gaap operating profit was $484 million, and non-gaap operating margin was 16% for the year. non-gaap earnings per share was $0.97, up 17% compared to fiscal 2020. as shown on slide 15, the actions we took to improve cash flow in 2021 delivered strong results all throughout the year. in the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $60 million, and free cash flow was $38 million.
both of these metrics were negative in last year's fourth quarter. for the full year, operating cash flow nearly tripled. free cash flow, which was essentially zero in 2020, accelerated to $262 million in 2021. in addition, we continue to make progress to reduce the capex intensity of the business.
total capex intensity was down a point from 8% last year to 7% this year, and total capital expenditures were down 10% compared to 2020. as a result of the strong cash flow, we ended the year with $273 million of cash on the balance sheet and $648 million of total liquidity. on slide 16, i want to wrap up the data we have been providing on our 2020 managed public cloud cohorts. this data continues to validate the success of our land-and-expand strategy.
with every quarterly cohort of 2020 managed public cloud customers, we have seen consistent cumulative bookings growth, representing follow-on sales to these customers. more importantly, these follow-on sales are expanding the overall cumulative sold gross margins with these customers. in fact, the overall range for the sold gross margin expansion for these cohorts has increased to 300 to 500 basis points from 200 to 400 basis points previously reported. so while rackspace technology's corporate gross margins have been diluted by the mix shift to managed public cloud over the past two years, we believe that as we continue to successfully cross-sell and upsell higher-margin services to these customers, our gross margins will stabilize.
slide 17 shows the progression of our multicloud revenues to growth businesses for the full year 2021. multicloud represents the vast majority of our revenue at 81% of the mix and it grew 14% year over year. apps & cross platform at 13% of total revenue grew 12% year over year driven by growth in our application, data, and security service businesses. the 12% growth includes the negative impact of the crm business we deemphasized earlier this year.
openstack, which is our legacy business, declined 20%, and this segment represented only 6% of total revenue in 2021. growth market offerings are now in the 75% to 80% range of the multicloud segment and are growing over 30% year over year. on slide 18, we have our guidance for the first quarter. we expect total revenue in the range of $768 million to $778 million, core revenue in the range of $730 million to $738 million, non-gaap operating profit of $108 million to $112 million and non-gaap eps of $0.20 to $0.22.
note that we are gearing up for the onboarding of the bt business in the first half of 2022. however, we do not expect revenue to begin ramping until the second quarter. hence, there will be expenses ahead of revenue as we prepare for the transition and transformation of bt customers to rackspace technology. to help our investors model our business, going forward, we will be providing specific quarterly guidance and color on the full year.
in fiscal 2022, we expect revenue growth to accelerate through the year and anticipate double-digit revenue growth in our core business for the full year. the cloud market backdrop and the bt deal obviously point to a solid revenue growth trajectory path for rackspace technology. the cloud market is taking off. as kevin noted, aws sees the cloud market at 5% to 15% penetrated.
that is at or past the point of the s-curve where markets cross the chasm and accelerate. we spent much of the last year working on various priorities and initiatives for growth, operational efficiencies, and the right mix of business. we plan for solid growth entering 2022, but the demand we are actually seeing is even stronger and is accelerating even faster. hence, we continue working through a number of strategic choices, in particular, how quickly can we ramp the recently won bt deal and drive cloud transformation for bt's customers, the mix of land versus expand activity at a time of accelerating market growth and investments to build capabilities to capture long-term growth opportunities.
we have multiple paths forward and are in the process of evaluating several important strategic decisions. we plan to provide more details on our strategy and investments, along with the three- to five-year financial plan later this year. in closing, we are pleased with our results and accomplishments in 2021. we delivered solid double-digit core revenue growth, strong mid-teens operating margins, and double-digit eps growth while significantly improving the cash-generating ability of our business.
more importantly, we did this while continuing to execute our pivot from mature to growth businesses within multicloud, improving our higher-margin services attach, driving sold gross margins to the highest level in two years, reducing our cost to serve with significant change in our global workforce footprint and investing in new product offerings and service delivery. all told, we believe 2021 was a successful year and we look forward to 2022 and beyond. with that, we'll take your questions. joe, please go ahead and queue up the audience for q&a. 
joe crivelli
thanks, amar. [operator instructions] our first question comes from ramsey el-assal with barclays capital. and ashwin shirvaikar, you're up next. 
ramsey el-assal -- barclays capital -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. hi, gentlemen. i wanted to ask about -- the q1 guidance and the core revenue growth looks like it slowed down a little bit, maybe 8.4% is where we calculated it. that's a little bit slower than we anticipated.
can you give us your updated thoughts on the sort of normalized growth profile of the business? i know we can't see a full year guide at this point, but i'm just curious in terms of has your thinking changed since the ipo in terms of the normalized kind of core growth profile of the business.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so thanks, ramsey. let me just start with the q1 guidance first and give you some color on the q1 guidance, and i will also give you color on the full year. as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that the growth trajectory will accelerate as we go to the full year. so when you look at our q1 guidance, specifically, revenue is going down sequentially from q4 to q1, and this is as a result of typical seasonality, ramsey.
the first, in our multicloud business, volumes are the highest in calendar q4 in certain verticals. like we have verticals like gaming, retail and financial services, and this typically normalizes in calendar q1. second is, i probably mentioned this even last year, there's always some year-end it budget flush in our enterprise and mid-market customers. and these two factors typically make q4 the strongest revenue quarter of the year.
so we are off to a strong revenue quarter. in fact, we saw similar seasonality going from q4 2020 to q1 2021. and this seasonal impact in q1 of last year, however, was masked by the ramping of large enterprise deals that we signed in the second half of 2020. so just to square off that, q1 guidance is in line with the typical seasonality, ok? now let me give you some color on -- you talked about revenue deceleration in q1.
now there are a couple of things that i wanted to point out here, right? so we have been consistently growing double digits. there are two things that are playing here. one is if you look at our apps & cross platform business, ramsey, it's up against some very tough compares in q1. for example, our texas dir deal, revenue lapped in q3 of fiscal 2021.
and also remember, we deemphasized our crm business starting q2 of fiscal 2021. so those two things are sort of a headwind from a year-on-year growth perspective for our apps & cross platform business. the second aspect of it is around our multicloud segment. this is growing really double digits, but we do have some mixed dynamics within this segment, ramsey.
if you look at the growth business within multicloud, it's growing solid double digits, although it's also up against some tougher compares. but we feel that given the market momentum, that business will continue to grow. but the mature business within that mix is declining, and it has negatively impacted the overall growth rate of our multicloud segment. but it's also important to note, when you look at the slide that i presented, the growth business is now more than 75% of the multicloud revenue mix.
and so we are sort of nearing an inflection point there. so looking ahead into fiscal 2022, we do anticipate the core revenue growth to accelerate through the year, and we do expect, ramsey, double-digit core revenue growth for the year. and now let me give you some more color on this and why we feel confident about it. one is we did see strong bookings momentum in q4.
q4 was one of a record quarter from a bookings perspective. even excluding the bt deal, we saw strong bookings toward the end of the quarter in december compared to, say, october and november. and you know it takes time for the bookings to realize into revenue. it takes about two to four months.
number two, ramping of the bt deal that i talked about in my prepared remarks. number three, we saw continued strong growth in managed public cloud supported by the rapid growth in the cloud market. and you are seeing that in the print by hyperscalers. like they're all boasting about 35% to 45% growth.
and then number four, i also want to point out that our growth will accelerate in our apps & cross platform with strength in both data services, as well as cloud-native applications. our data services business today is small, but it has been growing consistently high double digits. we then also added, through just analytics, more capability in the space and we are going to expand it globally. so i would say, in summary, we do believe that our core revenue, although it's sort of slowing down from a growth perspective, it's temporary.
and we expect the growth rates to improve in the later half of the year. 
ramsey el-assal -- barclays capital -- analyst
that's very, very helpful. thank you. one follow-up for me. i was just wondering if you could give us an update on your view of the competitive environment out there.
it seems like the demand environment is pretty robust. i'm just curious if you're seeing any intensification of competition or any other factors that could impact or impair your ability to kind of accelerate that core growth?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yeah. hey, ramsey, it's kevin jones. yeah, i'll take that one. so what i'll do, i'll give you my impressions of this from a market perspective.
and then i'll tell you a little bit about what i'm hearing from our customers and our partners. so from a market perspective, we're a pureplay on the cloud, one of the fastest-growing segments in tech. and as we talked about in our prepared remarks, cloud market is absolutely taking off. aws sees the cloud market at 5% to 15% penetrated.
and this is at or past the point on the s-curve where markets really cross the chasm and accelerate. so great potential we see in multicloud both on the private cloud side and on the public cloud side. the other thing about the demand environment, ramsey, is the multicloud workloads that we've migrated, they are going up significantly. so all the workloads that we migrated over, we're seeing growth there.
and then also additional migration work is accelerating. and then some of the demand that we have in our emerging areas like data services, cloud-native apps, we're planning to make additional investments in 2022 because we see those areas accelerating. so in terms of demand environment, we continue to feel very good about it, and we're really, i think, well positioned in this fast-growing cloud market. now when i talk to customers, i've traveled all over the world, talking to customers in 2021, and have logged lots of miles in 2022 so far.
and regardless of industry, ramsey, i'm hearing the same thing from ceos. our customer ceos say they want to transform to the cloud. it's one of their top priorities. they have to do it.
they've got a mandate from the board. but these customers need our help because they don't have the people to do it in-house. they don't have the technology to manage multicloud or the processes to do it. so we're really seeing strength across all the industries we serve, public sector, airlines, healthcare, automotive, financial services, you name it.
actually, even sophisticated tech companies need our help. one of our large deals in q4 was to help a major isv customer migrate to multiple cloud platforms, including aws and azure. so as our go-to-market approach continues to evolve, we think there's even more industries that will open up to us. and then all-in with our partners, right? i mean we've got some amazing partners.
and if i just focus on the public cloud hyperscalers for a minute, i was on the west coast of the u.s. last week meeting with them, so it's really top of mind and we've got thousands of joint customers with the hyperscalers, right? we sell together. we're lined up with our go-to-market teams, our sales teams all over the world. and if you just look at the hyperscalers' growth, they added over $30 billion of new revenue in 2021.
they're expected to add nearly $50 billion of new revenue on top of that this year. that's accelerated growth even off a very large base. so demand environment remains very strong. we continue to enjoy a secular tailwind in the business and a meeting with ceos of our other partners such as vmware, cloudflare, datadog, snowflake, and others, we are right there with them alongside their amazing technology, and we're reinventing the future of cloud services.
so to kind of wrap up here, demand environment is strong, the market is strong, customers have a mandate to move to the cloud, and we're there to service this unprecedented demand. 
joe crivelli
thanks, ramsey.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays capital -- analyst
thank you.
joe crivelli
our next question comes from ashwin shirvaikar with citi research. and amit daryanani, you're on deck.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
thank you. hi, kevin. hi, amar.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
hi, aswhin.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
hey! so, you guys have previously said you needed to achieve $1 billion in bookings in '21 to get double-digit organic core rev growth in '22. so you checked the box on both of those. could you clarify if the double-digit growth expectation that you mentioned in '22, is it reliant on additional '22 bookings performance? or is it, i hate to use a term like in the bag, but is it sort of done? also is there a quota you sort of need to hit for bookings in '22 to continue double-digit beyond '21? 
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
ok. i will start, ashwin, and thanks for your question, and kevin will jump in here with additional comments. so absolutely, i think we did say at the very outset of the year that if we get to $1 billion of bookings, plus or minus, we should be able to deliver double-digit core revenue growth. and that's the reason we are confident of hitting the double-digit core revenue growth in fiscal '22 as the growth will accelerate through the year.
in '22, the beauty of this business, the positive is you have a lot of recurring revenue base in this business. so we expect our revenue base to be anywhere between 85% to 90% recurring base, which says that if you just do the math, offsetting some of the churn with some bookings, etc., you really need to go sell, build, deliver about 15% of that revenue every year, right? so that gives us confidence that since you started with a good backlog, we can go and hit the double-digit core revenue growth for fiscal '22. now your next question is a very important one. and this is where i think, as a management team, we are looking at the market opportunity.
for us, the market opportunity is rapidly growing. and we believe that if we can continue to deliver $1 billion-plus of bookings, we can continue to deliver double-digit core revenue growth in fiscal '23 and beyond. we can do better than that, ashwin. and that's where the whole strategic choices remain and decisions remain for us, right? do we want to go push the pedal down and make certain investments because the market is really exploring in data services, as an example, and cloud-native applications? can we go outdeliver that bookings growth so that we can create a good backlog going into fiscal '23? so those are some of the decisions we continue to make.
it's a dynamic market, and we want to make sure that we make a very deliberate and thoughtful decision as we go through this process. 
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
got it. got it. and on the strategic choice part of it, one of the strategic choices is the type of clients you pursue. obviously, you signed bt, which is a large client.
when i look at the just analytics client base, some of the clients mentioned are also large. but you do have sort of a preference for mid-market, as you've indicated in the past. so could you sort of clarify that push-pull? and particularly, the impact it can have on something you did well this year, which was the turnaround on the cash flow front and capital intensity?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. so i think i will start here and see if i can address the question. it's a great question actually. so our model has always been to move toward more capital-light model, right? so if you look at our capex intensity, that capex intensity has actually gone down significantly in the last three years.
and we believe our capex intensity will be between, say, 5% to 7% in fiscal '22, right? so it went from 8% to 7% to between 5% to 7%, so roughly in the midpoint of the 6% or so. we did a lot of things this year, ashwin, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks. first is we pivoted the business to growth side from mature. so you saw the mix of mature business now is less than 25% of the total mix.
this is outside of the legacy openstack business i'm talking about. this is within multicloud segment. the mix is less than 25%. so we pushed forward on the growth side.
we very selectively landed deals because it was important for us that we expand in the accounts that we land, so we were very strict about it, and that was also a very thoughtful strategy. and bt was one of our customers, but you can also expect that as an expansion from landing because this is a major deal that we landed. and we've been working on it for more than a year. so i think what you should expect is continue down this path, continue to push forward into the growth areas of the business, which is on the cloud side.
at the same time, we have also launched new offerings in our private cloud, including rackspace services for vmware, which is a multi-tenant offering, which gives the same flexibility to the customer that they would get in a public cloud environment. we went after white spaces like data freedom, by making those investments early on. we want to expand those offerings again. so you should expect us to really play hard in the multicloud segment both on the public cloud side, as well as the private cloud side.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think that's really well said, and i'll just add a few points here, ashwin. i think your question on mid-market and enterprise, i think, is a good one. we continue to see a lot of opportunity in the mid-market.
we think that's a really good, sweet spot for us. now as you noted, we're having success in the enterprise market. we've only been calling on the enterprise market for the last several years. we won the state of texas deal.
there was a porsche deal we talked about on the last earnings call and then the bt deal. and the bt deal is interesting because it brings with it bt's enterprise customers, which will further accelerate our capabilities in enterprise. but we'll be selective there, right? we want to pick our spots. i think we've proven, because of all the competitive advantages we've got, that we can win there.
so multicloud, particularly in enterprise and mid-market, is a huge area of focus for us. 
joe crivelli
all right. thanks, ashwin.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
joe crivelli
thanks. all right. our next question comes from amit daryanani with evercore isi. and tien-tsin huang, you're on deck. 
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. thanks for taking my question. i guess, you know, i want to go back to the march quarter guide a bit. and i guess if i look at it, on a sequential basis, you're guiding revenues to be flat, maybe down a few million dollars, but the eps guide is down $0.04 or high teen as a percent, sequentially down.
can you just talk about what is driving the drop in eps on a sequential basis? and is there anything on the bt deal from a cost perspective that you would like to call out there, it would be helpful as well.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
sure. i mean, thanks for the question. so there are two drivers here, right? one is the sequential revenue decline that is happening from q4 to q1 that i explained earlier, so that serves as a headwind. and secondly, amit, in our business, we also see costs go up, fringe benefit go up, from calendar q4 to q1.
and this happens every year, especially because we have a large footprint in the u.s. and also, we are making some incremental investments, amit, in that market in line with what we had mentioned way, way back in q3 of last year that we will continue to make investments in go-to-market, etc. so those are the three factors that are resulting in a sequential decline in operating profit and also eps.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. and then, you know, maybe just want to go back to the capex and free cash flow discussion. you've had a really good calendar '21 free cash flow.
how should we think about any markers or metrics around capex and free cash flow as i think about calendar '22? thank you.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so, we -- you know, as i've mentioned before, we are very focused in generating cash for this company. and we have proven that we went from $117 million of cash flow from operations, zero free cash flow, up to $371 million. we significantly improved it, amit, as you know, very good working capital management across the company.
i believe that we should be tracking our operating cash flow at about maybe 70% of our operating profit. that's the 70% of operating profit conversion to operating cash flow. that is a good metric to go with, right? now keep in mind that there will be seasonal impact during the year. i mean q1 and q4 are typically lower cash flow quarters for us.
for example, in q1, there's bonus payment, that annual bonus payout. and in q4, we had some big cash prepayments to some of our big vendors. so typically, q1 and q4 are lower, q2 and q3 are relatively stronger from a cash flow perspective. now let me give you some color on free cash flow because you asked me this question.
as i mentioned in my response question to ashwin, our capex intensity continues to go down. if you recall, at the beginning of the year in fiscal '21, i guided to a 7% to 9% capex intensity, so capex as a percentage of revenue. we landed about 6.7% at the lower end of that range. i believe we'll be between 5% to 7% capex intensity in fiscal 2022, right? so if you take these models, let's say, 70% of our operating profit turning around into cash flow from operations, capex intensity remaining within 5% to 7%, you will see our free cash flow margin will continue to remain healthy.
so just as a reference, we went from 0% free cash flow margins in 2020 to 9% in fiscal 2021. and given the sort of guidance we have provided here, it will be lower than the 9%, but it will be still healthy.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect, thank you. 
joe crivelli
thanks, amit. tien-tsin huang with j.p. morgan, you're up. and keith bachman, you're on deck.
unknown speaker
hey, thanks for taking my question. this is puneet sitting in for tien-tsin. what are the incremental gross margins on some of the high-growth multicloud revenue that you are generating? and can that segment's margins be at least flat on a year-on-year basis this year? 
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so let me make sure the -- when we are talking about high-margin segment within multicloud, are you talking about the follow-on sales, puneet? or are you talking about the overall? 
unknown speaker
i meant like the high growth, like that 75% growth in multicloud business that you are giving there.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. so you know, listen, i think it all depends on the mix of business, puneet. at this point in time, given our internal plans, we are assuming that the mix of business remains the same between infrastructure and services within that growth portfolio. so we expect the gross margins to, in that particular business, to remain sort of stable.
but again, it depends on the mix of infrastructure and services. so that mix can change if we decide to go after more landing because there's a land grab of accounts going on. so if we decide to push forward and acquire more accounts, that mix might change. 
unknown speaker
thank you. 
joe crivelli
thanks, puneet. next question comes from keith bachman with bmo. and frank louthan, you're on deck. keith, are you there? all right.
let's circle back to keith. can we promote frank louthan to speaker, please? 
unknown speaker
hey, great, thank you. maybe i missed this, but can you quantify how much the bt deal was in the bookings for the quarter? that would be great. and then where are we on the offshoring with the labor in terms of sort of the percentage of the shift and the total cost savings to date? and when do you think that will be completed? thanks.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
hey, frank, it's kevin here. so i'll start with some color on the bt deal. so bt deal was the largest deal in company history. we're not disclosing the exact dollar amount, but i'll give you a bit of detail here.
you know, it brings significant value to both parties and could be worth several hundred million dollars over multiple years. and we're looking at migrating a large number of bt enterprise customers to rackspace technology. this deal gives us the opportunity to expand our presence in 180 countries, and we're excited about this as bt's hybrid cloud offerings will be based on the rackspace private cloud solution, namely rackspace services for vmware cloud. frank, that's a new offering we introduced last year.
you know, and this deal validates several things for us. it validates our new private cloud offering, rackspace services for vmware cloud. it validates our multicloud strategy, our growth potential in the enterprise market, as i mentioned earlier. our geographic expansion strategy.
i think this deal also shows our competitive advantages against some of the largest competitors in the industry. so, we're pleased and excited about our relationship with bt. amar, do you want to talk about offshore?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. i think, frank, when we announced the restructuring program mid of last year, one of the key tenets of the program was to change approval for footprint. so if we just take a look at our offshore/onshore mix at the end of fiscal '20, we were less than about 25% offshore, right? we improved that by more than 20 points exiting fiscal 2021. so this was a significant change in our offshore mix.
and we expect by mid of fiscal 2022 to be close to 50% of that mix. now within that, this is across the company. so it's not just the delivery organization or operations, this is across g&a functions. so we did a massive heavy lifting in the last couple of quarters. 
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
i'll just add to that, you know, i'm pleased with the transformation that we're undertaking at the company and the progress so far, still more to do. of course, frank, i'm also very pleased with the quality of delivery that we're getting from our onshore centers and our offshore centers and how we're working together around the clock for customers. one of the things that the bt customer mentioned is -- you know, one of the reasons they selected us was because of our reputation for service quality and this fanatical customer experience that we're known for all over the world. so as we transform the business, i look daily at statistics regarding our customer service quality, and we continue to be among the best there.
so we're pleased with that. 
unknown speaker
ok. great. thank you very much.
joe crivelli
great. we're going to circle back to keith bachman from bmo, and then we'll wrap things up with bryan keane from deutsche bank.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, can you hear me ok? 
joe crivelli
yeah, we can hear you now, keith, thank you. 
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. sorry, i'm not sure what happened last time. but amar, i wanted to go back to margins for a second. and you're guiding operating margins to, call it, 14.2%, which is down well over 200 basis points year over year.
and you mentioned some incremental bt expense, but i was wondering if you could carve that out. and more specifically, and more broadly, you've alluded to choices. and so as you look at calendar year '22, so i was hoping you could give some context about how you're thinking about margins in '22. in the past, what you said is gross margins will experience some pressure because of mix through, i think, sort of the september to december quarter, but operating margins will stay flattish in these ranges.
it certainly doesn't seem like q1 margins expected to be flattish. so i'm just wondering if you could review, if not specific numbers for the cy '22 then, philosophically, how we should be thinking about margins? 
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. so thanks, keith. so, keith, i'll give you color on the gross margins, as well as the operating margins for the year. and again, with certain assumptions here, so i'll see if i can give you more transparency and clarity on the margin profile of the business as we roll through fiscal '22.
so keith, based on our current internal plan that we are working with, we expect gross margins to stabilize around 30% in fiscal 2022, and our operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 15%. and i'll give you more color on that shortly, ok? now our internal plan assumes, keith, a certain mix of business. it also assumes a certain level of investments and, more importantly, the rate of ramp of the bt deal. so if these assumptions changed during the year, we may have a different outcome.
for example, i mentioned in my prepared remarks, keith, that the demand is even stronger than what we have planned for in 2022. by the way, we had planned for a solid double-digit growth in 2022 from a core perspective. so if you see this demand increasing, which we are, we may decide to put the pedal down and go after additional long-term growth opportunities, which may change the mix and the level of investments in 2022 versus our internal plan. but as i said, i'm very committed to update you every quarter on the strategic decisions we may make around that and any material changes to the financial model.
so that's roughly what we are seeing, and we have baked in some level of investments in the plan, in our internal plan. and we want to go after growth, keith. i'm sure you're hearing this from all the cloud providers in the cloud ecosystem, everyone is seeing good growth to go after. and when we start onboarding some of these deals, it might impact our margins in the short term, but these are the right things to do because we have shown, based on our 2020 quote of customers, that we can expand the sold gross margins once we land these deals.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
and then --
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and -- yeah, sorry, kevin, did you want to say something?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
no, i think that's good, keith.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and so, if i think about that, i mean, i think those margins, 14% to 15% is a little bit lower than what investors are thinking. you said previously ocf would be 70% of the operating dollars of profit. obviously, i haven't run through my model yet, but i mean that suggests some pressure on free cash flow as well, i would think.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think you are right from that. directionally, you're right, keith, that, that will put some pressure on free cash flow. but also keep in mind that there is a sort of a tailwind from the restructuring cash charges that we saw in fiscal 2021. we won't see that kind of restructuring cash charges in fiscal '22, so i think those two might balance out.
but you're absolutely right, as a percentage of revenue, i expect free cash flow margins to be below the 8.7% that we delivered in fiscal 2021.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. do you mind just if i sneak one in, what were those cash charges in '21, just so everybody knows how to model that?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. s, you know, i don't have a specific data here. but i would say, net-net, it was in the, i would say -- again, i'll give you more color on that in the callbacks -- which should be about $40 million to $50 million, net-net. so i will give you more color and look at the data for you during the callbacks.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you.
joe crivelli
thanks, keith. our final question comes from bryan keane with deutsche bank. bryan, go ahead.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.
joe crivelli
bryan, it looks like you might be muted.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
can you hear me now? 
joe crivelli
yeah, there you go. thank you. 
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys. so most of my questions have been asked and answered. just i guess two clarifications. you know, kevin, on the bt deal, when you sell into their enterprise customers, how does that relationship work? is it a rev share agreement? and just trying to think about the economics and margin implications if that business takes off and a lot of bt enterprise customers start to use rackspace.
and then secondly, i guess for amar, the cost savings, it wasn't clear to me, that massive move to offshore that you had this year. is there a cost benefit to the model? and are we seeing that yet? 
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll start with a little bit about how the bt kind of relationship with work, bryan, and then i'll let amar provide some color on the second question. so yes, so we're excited about this. i mean, basically, bt has got great relationships with some of the largest enterprise customers not just in europe but all over the world.
and so we are bt's hybrid cloud partner. and what's going to be happening is, for a good section of those customers, we'll be migrating those customers to our private cloud environment and our hybrid cloud environment, rackspace services for vmware cloud, which is kind of a combination of kind of private cloud with public cloud attributes. and it will have margin profiles similar to the rest of that part of the business for us. so it's something that, as amar mentioned, is kind of ramping up throughout 2022.
we're already very engaged with bt as we speak. and not only do we have a chance to work and modernize these enterprise customers of bt and bt itself, but then we have the opportunity to introduce them to our applications offerings, our data offerings, given the acquisition that we just did, and then further public cloud offerings depending upon where some of these enterprise customers need their workloads. so it's pretty exciting, and we'll keep you updated as we progress. amar, anything to add? 
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
well, i think, that it's -- on the cost savings side, we have baked in all the cost savings in our model. we have moved very fast in the second half of 2021 to execute on most of the cost actions. and the cost savings that we have laid out on a net basis is already baked into our fiscal 2022 plan, our internal plan. and that's how we deferred some of the investments that we are making in the business. 
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
is there a way to quantify the different types of investments you're making, amar, just so we can try to get a sense of how much of this is ongoing, could be additional one-time those kinds of charges?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. so i think most of the investments are -- let me give you -- there are three or four big buckets of investments. and it all depends on, for example, we continue to make investments in launching new product offerings in data freedom, in private cloud, etc., that's one big bucket. and that's across our product groups and also across those delivery, as an example.
the second big bucket is around 12, right? so as kevin mentioned, we have opportunities in data services, in cloud-native application development across all the three platforms. we have done very well on the aws side because we acquired onica and we got a lot of skills and capabilities in aws. we'll be scaling that. and at the same time, we'll also start scaling gcp and azure.
and those investments show up either in cost of revenue because you have to get ahead of the demand. so we will be hiring resources and cloud architects, as an example, professional services for migration, as well as for, you know, data services. and we will also be investing in sales and go-to-market very selectively because we are also improving the productivity of our salespeople. so we will be selectively investing in those areas.
and all investments are baked into the plan. but in case we need to -- if we see more growth in the market, we may go ahead and make some changes in those investments. so that's all -- it's not one-time, some of it is one-time start-up investments that flows through as an ongoing, but it's supported by revenue.
joe crivelli
thanks, bryan.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for taking the question.
joe crivelli
you bet. all right. well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. if we didn't get to your question or if you have a follow-up, please give me a shout at ir@rackspace.com.

joseph crivelli
good afternoon, and welcome to rackspace technology's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. kevin jones, our ceo; and amar maletira, our president and cfo, joining us today. the slide deck we will reference during the call can be found on our ir website.
on slide 2, certain comments we make on this call will be forward-looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ. a discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. rackspace technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law.
our presentation includes certain non-gaap financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. in accordance with sec rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures in the earnings release and presentation, both of which are available on our website. after our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. to queue up for a question, please use the q&a function in zoom.
i'll now turn the call over to kevin. 
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. i'll discuss quarterly highlights and the strategic direction of our business, then amar will go into detail on the financial results. turning to slide 5. rackspace technology benefits from secular tailwinds in a cloud market that continues to grow with no signs of slowing.
in the first quarter, our cloud hyperscaler partners all grew year-over-year revenue by 35% to 50% that represents $10 billion of new cloud revenue in the first quarter alone. so cloud revenue continues to accelerate, and the cloud revolution is in the very early stages with winners still to be determined and plenty of white space to attack. and rackspace technology remains well positioned as the leading pure-play, multi-cloud services company. in the first quarter, our financial results were in line with our guidance and expectations.
and we, once again, delivered solid growth profitability and cash flow. on the new business front, it was a very productive quarter. we renewed and strengthened our relationship with aws and closed a major new deal with vmware to support their global edge offerings. we also just launched a new partnership with nvidia, which i'll touch on in a moment.
we closed the acquisition of just analytics and began introducing their products and services to our customers globally. rackspace technology was recognized as an industry leader in two major analyst reports that were published in the first quarter, including the isg provider lens aws ecosystem partners report, where we were named a leader in three quadrants; and the isg index, where we were named a top 15 sourcing standout in the breakthrough 15 category for the global, americas and emea regions. turning to slide 6. revenue growth was solid, with total revenue up 7% and core revenue up 9% compared to last year's first quarter.
non-gaap operating profit was $112 million and non-gaap eps was $0.22, both at the high end of our guidance range for the first quarter. as noted on the slide, our first quarter bookings put us on track to achieve our targeted $1 billion of new sales bookings in 2022. as we discussed with investors last quarter, rackspace technology and our board of directors have been carefully examining every area of our business, weighing the company's strategic options to increase shareholder value. i'd like to share with you how we're thinking about this.
as slide 7 notes, we operate in two very different multi-cloud markets with different operating models, growth trajectories and investment prospects. on one hand, public cloud is writing a long-term secular growth wave and is a services-centric, capital-light product line where we can make smart investments to capture additional white space and growth opportunities. and on the other hand, private cloud and managed hosting is in a low-growth market where we're focused on optimizing profit and free cash flow. our strategy to maximize shareholder value is now coming into focus.
and we are, therefore, considering reorganizing rackspace technology across these two markets. we are also exploring other strategic alternatives as noted in our press release. amar will discuss this more in a moment. we will provide shareholders with details, as well as the growth drivers, profit dynamics and long-term financial model at an analyst day in september.
on slide 8, you can see how development of our partner network is essential and different in each of these two markets. we have painstakingly build our partner network to add value across the two operations, and we work to strengthen these partnerships every quarter. on the left side of the slide, in public cloud, long-term success starts with a strong relationship with the hyperscalers. we must act as a bridge between the needs of our customers and the hyperscalers as we onboard an ever-growing volume of new clients to the public cloud.
in this pane, in the first quarter, we extended our strategic collaboration agreement with market leader aws for an additional multiyear period, which serves as a strong validation of the value we've delivered to aws' ecosystem to date. it is also essential in public cloud to provide customers with up-the-stack functionality once they've migrated to the cloud. again, as an example, on the first quarter, we achieved premier partnership level with snowflake, making us one of their top 30 partners in the u.s. on the right side of the chart, you see our key partners for private cloud and managed hosting.
here, strategic partnerships have served to provide upside through access to exciting, strategic service adjacencies. as an example of the former, in the first quarter, we launched our new private cloud relationship with bt and started onboarding their customers to rackspace technology. as a reminder, the bt deal was the largest in rackspace technology's history with the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue. we are encouraged that even in the early going, we're seeing plenty of opportunity for further expansion of our relationship with bt.
earlier this week, we announced that we are now certified to deploy nvidia's ai computing platform, and we've been named an advanced technology partner in the nvidia partner network. we are excited about this new partnership with a leading technology company, which we believe will help us grow private cloud and facilitate development of highly compelling services for our customers. now, let's talk about the different ways we support our customers. on slide 9, carrier global is a world leader in heating, air conditioning and refrigeration solutions.
after spinning off from its parent company, carrier was looking to modernize their infrastructure and existing applications. we worked with carrier to transform the iot technology that powers all their connected thermostats and build a scalable, robust, cloud-native platform that they could use as the basis for their entire connected device portfolio. after this modernization effort, carrier reduced technical debt, increased security, sped up infrastructure provisioning time from 35 days to 30 minutes and reduced infrastructure costs by 45%. on slide 10, provenir provides artificial intelligence-powered software to help the fintech industry manage risk across identity, credit and fraud.
provenir had multiple micro services deployed in kubernetes clusters running in aws but didn't have the capacity to quickly create monitors and dashboards. rackspace professional services helped provenir integrate their software with datadog, resulting in enhanced visibility into their micro services and infrastructure, along with increased accuracy and consistency across multiple environments. more importantly, we built automation into the process, enabling provenir to launch additional monitoring and alerts for its applications and infrastructure without having to write a single line of code. now, amar will take you through the financials.
amar?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, kevin, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. slide 12 recaps our financial results for the first quarter. revenue was $776 million, a 7% year-over-year increase. core revenue was $735 million, up 9% compared to the first quarter of 2021.
non-gaap operating profit was $112 million, which was at the high end of our guidance for the first quarter and was down 6% year over year, primarily due to the impact to gross profit from revenue decline in our legacy openstack and mature managed hosting. non-gaap operating margin was 14% and non-gaap earnings per share was $0.22, both at the high end of our guidance for the first quarter. slide 13 shows the company's revenue mix in the first quarter by segment and by geography. multi-cloud continues to represent the vast majority of our revenue at 83% of the mix, and it grew 10% year over year.
apps and cross platform at 12% of total revenue was down 3% year over year. as we have discussed previously, year over year compares in this segment were impacted by the discontinuance of a noncore product line in 2021. we lapped that strategic change in the second quarter. openstack declined 17%, in line with our expectations.
this segment now represents only 5% of total revenue. from a regional perspective, americas continues to represent 75% of our revenue and had 7% year-over-year growth. apj grew at 32%, while emea grew 2% year over year. excluding currency impact, emea growth would have been in the mid-single digits.
on slide 14, in the first quarter, operating cash flow was $65 million and free cash flow was $45 million, an increase from $38 million in the fourth quarter. first quarter 2022 operating cash flow included the 2021 annual company bonus payout. total capex was $31 million and cash capex was $19 million, with capex intensity of 4% and 2%, respectively. we expect total capex intensity of 5% to 7% and cash capex intensity of 3% to 5% for the full year, in line with our previous guidance.
cash at quarter end was $269 million, up $71 million year over year. on slide 15, i want to remind the investors that we have a strong balance sheet with no material debt maturities until 2028. in addition, all of our debt was refinanced in late 2020 and early 2021 at historically low rates with minimal financial covenants. at quarter end, total debt was $3.4 billion and net debt was $3.1 billion.
our net leverage ratio of 4.3 times the adjusted trailing 12-month ebitda is very manageable for a company with our growth profile. on slide 16, we have a guidance for the second quarter. we expect total revenue in the range of $780 million to $790 million, core revenue in the range of $744 million to $752 million, non-gaap operating profit of $93 million to $97 million and non-gaap eps of $0.15 to $0.17. now, let me provide you some additional color on our outlook.
as i mentioned last quarter, we expect revenue growth to accelerate through the year. this is due to three main reasons: first, the ramping of bt related revenue in the third and fourth quarter, which will bolster private cloud and managed hosting within the multi-cloud segment; second, continued growth in managed public cloud as we have a growing pipeline of large opportunities in the multimillion-dollar range that we expect to close in the second half of the year; and third, because of the investments we made in go-to-market, we have many new sales professionals that are ramping in the first half and who will become more productive in the second half of the year. now, with regard to the operating profit and non-gaap eps. the second quarter will be impacted by $15 million to $20 million of investments that we are making to support growth acceleration in cloud services and the start-up of our bt partnership.
these investments are primarily in cost of revenue and some in operating expenses. they represent most of the divergence between our guidance and the current street estimates. given the secular growth opportunity in the cloud market, we will prudently invest in long-term profitable growth. on slide 17, in closing, i would like to recap and summarize what kevin said earlier.
we operate across both public and private cloud. we are the only pure-play, multi-cloud services company that is addressing both of these markets at scale. that said, the market has evolved rapidly in the last 18 to 24 months. we have been proactively evaluating all of our strategic options to take advantage of this opportunity.
to that end, we have taken a number of actions. first, we completed an in-depth strategic review of the company. second, we have a clearly defined strategy for the company across public cloud and private cloud managed hosting. third, we are working on aligning our operating model and reorganizing the company to sharpen our focus in these two markets.
and fourth, we are also working to align our financial models and plans accordingly. as we completed this strategic review and also based on inbound interest for one of our businesses, we concluded that some of the parts valuation of rackspace technology could be greater than our current enterprise value. this is in part driven by the attractive growth profile of our public cloud offerings. accordingly, we are evaluating strategic alternatives and options.
we plan to share details on our strategy, operating organization and long-term financial model at an analyst day to be held in september. with that, we'll take your questions. joe, please go ahead and queue up the audience for q&a.
joseph crivelli
thanks, amar. [operator instructions] our first question comes from bryan keane at deutsche bank. and ramsey el-assal, you're up next.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, guys. just wanted to ask about the margin profile. i know we talked about 14% to 15% ebit margins for the year. just any update on that, amar.
and then on gross margins as well, what's the outlook there?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thanks, bryan. can you hear me?
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes, i got you.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so yes. thanks. so bryan, as noted in the last quarter's call, we are going to continue to guide the street one quarter at a time. now if you look at our q2 guidance, the midpoint of our guidance implies that the operating margins in q2 are about 12%.
but also keep in mind, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, within our second quarter, we do have growth investments of about $15 million to $20 million that impacts operating margins by about 200 basis points, which implies that our operating margin, excluding these investments will be approximately about 14%. so bryan, long term, we do see operating margins in the low to mid-teens. and so, that's what our long-term outlook is. now, with regard to -- let me just also -- yes, let me also give you some color on the gross margin since you asked that question.
now, when you look at our q2 investments of $15 million to $20 million, bryan, most of these investments are primarily in cost of revenue to deliver incremental services growth in the second half. and these investments are primarily in building out our delivery capability in both professional services and elastic engineering. and so including these investments, q2 gross margins will be in the 28% to 29% range. but if i again exclude these investments, we would still be in the 30% range for q2.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. and just a follow-up. on the strategic review, it sounded like there was an inbound inquiry that came in. which business was that that got that inquiry? is that a smaller piece of the business, a larger piece? just trying to get a sense of what that business unit was.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
bryan, it's kevin. i'll take the strategic question. so right now, we can't provide specifics due to the ongoing nature of our conversations, both internally and externally. as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're addressing two markets that are very attractive, and we're really organizing around those two markets.
but i can assure you in terms of strategic alternatives, everything is on the table and we're evaluating all options, including this current and down interest for one of our businesses. and we'll provide further information as appropriate in light of the developments.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions.
joseph crivelli
thanks, brian. ramsey el-assal from barclays capital, you're up. and frank louthan, you're on deck.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays capital -- analyst
ok. can you guys hear me, ok?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes. hi, ramsey.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays capital -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. i was wondering if you can give us some color on the demand environment. i guess just given the more kind of challenging macro backdrop, are you seeing any impacts out there on client decisioning? any color here would be helpful.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. sure thing. so let me take that one, amar. i'll talk a little bit about the economic environment in general, and then i'll sort of transition into the demand environment that we're seeing.
and i would say just kind of upfront while there are near term headwinds in the economy such as supply chain disruption, the war in ukraine, we do not see any recessionary pressure in this business. if you just think about it, our hyperscaler partner's group cloud revenue by a record amount, over $10 billion in the first quarter. so cloud is really only accelerating even in the challenging economic environment we've seen so far this year. now if the economy does slip into recession, we think that multi-cloud becomes even more of a must-have for customers because it helps customers save money, quickly scale up or scale down and change their business model.
and we saw this in early 2020 when the economic slowdown caused by covid, resulted in acceleration of demand for digital services and multi-cloud. so -- and that's the economic -- the broader macroeconomic picture and how it relates to our business. now if i just look at the demand environment, let me give you a little bit of color on how i see the demand environment. and i'll start out with the market, and then i'll go through what we're hearing from customers and partners.
now the market, ramsey, really is very strong. we believe that at this point, only 10% to 15% of workloads have been moved to the cloud. so there's many years of growth runway ahead, and our view is that will result in lots of opportunity for migrations and integrations and managed services. that's one piece.
multi-cloud continues to be really the overwhelming choice for customers that are moving to the cloud. and as the hyperscalers continue to innovate, they're innovating at such a pace that choice is now really abundant in the market for customers, and customers need firms like rackspace technology to help them make the right decisions for their cloud environment. so that's another piece. and then, we see lots of desire for innovation beyond infrastructure, into the apps and data layers of the it stack in particular.
the other thing we're seeing is industry. industry specialization is becoming a trend in a lot of areas. and from a geographic perspective, demand for multi-cloud services continues to pick up pace all over the world, particularly in europe, in the u.k. and asia and south pacific latin america and, of course, the united states.
so that's the market. now from a customer perspective, it's quite interesting. i was just with a large healthcare ceo last week, and they're a big customer for rackspace technology and a multi-cloud customer. and the ceo told me, ""thank goodness, rackspace handles cloud for us."" the complexity of multi-cloud really is mind-boggling, and rackspace takes all that off his plate.
and the other thing he said, and i keep hearing this over and over from other customers, is data. data is becoming a huge differentiator in healthcare, and customers are saying we want to increase the pace of innovation, both in cloud-native data and cloud-native apps. and we hear this from customers and a lot of industries now that data and apps innovation is important to them and a focus of how they're becoming more competitive. and then finally, just to wrap up from a partnership perspective, right? the demand for the hyperscalers products continues and what i would say at a breathtaking pace.
now as with all three hyperscalers last week, and the demand for cloud continues to be amazing. aws, google, microsoft, they're adding giant, giant amount of sales and revenue every quarter. it's unlike anything i've ever seen in my career. and when i talk to my friends at dell and vmware, there's big demand from customers for private cloud and multi-cloud as well.
so our partners all tell me, ""we need rackspace technology. we need rackspace to help make sure these customers have the very best services partner to help them on their cloud journey."" so overall, ramsey, i'd say a very strong demand environment. we're extremely encouraged by the opportunity.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays capital -- analyst
great. thanks for the detailed answer. i'll hop back in the queue. thanks for taking my question.
joseph crivelli
thanks, ramsey. our next question comes from frank louthan with raymond james. and bradley clark, you're on deck.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. so maybe go in a little more detail on the dip that you're forecasting here for the operating income in q2. what's kind of causing that sequential decline? and then, if you don't end up selling the whole company, give us a little more color on what does the reorg look like? what sort of things will you be adjusting going forward in areas you think you need some more help?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so i'll take the first question. and kevin, you can address the next one. so ramsey frank, in terms of the dip, sequential dip in our operating profit, we did about $112 million in q1. it's going down to about $95 million in q2.
that's the midpoint of our guidance, and that's mainly the investments that we are making, frank, in the -- in our business. and if you take a look at the investments, and i'll give you some additional color on where we're making those investments. investments are in three areas, right? first is we are making investments, as i mentioned earlier, to expand delivery capacity for professional services and elastic engineering across all three cloud platforms. so that includes aws; gcp, which is google; as well as microsoft azure.
second, we're also making some investments, frank, in our go-to-market organization. and third, we are making some investments, which are mainly start-up investments as we ramp our bt accounts, and bt is expected to reach a full run rate revenue by the end of second half. and so as i mentioned earlier, most of these investments are in cost of revenue in q2, and so this is more basically creating the decline in operating profit going from q1 to q2. that's mainly the reason.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
very good. and the second question that you had, frank, around how we're going to kind of reorganize and manage the business and the company, just a little bit of a backdrop. we operate, i would say, a very attractive multi-cloud market, right? and it spans across both public and private cloud. and as we talked about, we're the only pure-play, multi-cloud services company that's addressing both of these markets at scale.
having said that, when you look at the market, the market's evolved, and it's evolved pretty rapidly in the last 18 to 24 months. and we have a public cloud business that has significantly scaled from 18 months ago, and we've been proactively evaluating all of our strategic options to take advantage of those public cloud market opportunity and sharpened our focus. so public cloud and private cloud. we've got very different business dynamics as we talked about on the call.
they also require very different skill sets and levels of investment to manage. so -- and we're basically developing a plan to best align our resources with these findings. and what we're going to do, frank, at this analyst and investor day in september, we'll provide additional details on what this looks like, both from an operational standpoint and a financial standpoint on a go-forward basis. but hopefully, that gives you some color.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you.
joseph crivelli
thanks, frank. bradley clark from bmo capital, you're up next, and matt roswell after that.
bradley clark -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my question. got two parts here. first, i want to ask the incremental investments in the june quarter focused around expanding delivery capability and the bt account.
more broadly, you potentially win other large deals. you mentioned to multimillion dollar opportunities in the pipeline in the second half. how do you think about the incremental investment that these large deals are going to take? and the idea of that with every one of these large deals that's more incremental investment that's not already in the model? or are you investing more so ahead of time so that this $10 million to $15 million becomes less and less over time? and then part two of the question, i wanted to ask about pricing. and in an inflationary environment with higher wage inflation, the operating environment may be different than some other services companies.
but are you having pricing conversations with your customers to potentially offset some higher wages and expenses? and if so, any comments you can make sort on the strategy there?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so let me take the first one, bradley, thank you very much for asking the question. to give you a little bit of more specifics on investments, so you're absolutely right. we are making investments ahead of the demand that we are seeing, mainly in cloud services.
as you know, there's a lot of demand in cloud services. so this $15 million to $20 million of investments we are making in q2 will also carry forward into q3 and q4, but it will be a run rate cost, but it will be supported by incremental revenue, right? so you've got to build ahead of the demand. that's what we are doing. now as we see more growth opportunities, we may prudently make additional investments to capture further growth, and these investments will be primarily in cost of revenue to build capability in advance of the services demand that we are seeing in cloud.
and we will continue to update the street if there is any change to our investment outlook per se, right? so it's a very dynamic market. we see a lot of demand, as kevin talked about. and it is very prudent for us to continue investing and capturing those demand because, as you know, services is a very sticky business. and it has a -- and we have a very high recurring revenue base, too.
so these are the kinds of investments we'll make to continue driving profitable growth in the business. now regarding your second question around pricing, that's a very interesting question. we -- if you look at -- and i will have kevin jump in here too. we are not having a kind of a pricing pressure, so to speak, from our customers.
the markets that we play in, in cloud services, whether it is application migration or modernizing of those applications or even data migration and data ops, these are very hot areas of the market today, and it is sometimes very difficult to find skills in those markets. so we do not see a lot of pricing pressure. we're also not a very labor -- we'd not have a very labor-intensive model, so to speak. we have -- and our key differentiator is combining labor with automation, and we have talked about it at length in the past that we have driven about 75% of automation on our workflows.
and so, that's the reason why we do not see a lot of pressure neither on the pricing side and on the labor cost side because we are not a very labor-intensive model. kevin, do you want to add anything here?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
i think you said it really well. yes, we -- bradley, we don't have nearly as many employees, there's a lot of firms out there in the market. so we don't have that same exposure to the labor inflation that's happening in the broader economy. and yes, we definitely don't see any pricing pressure per se.
and where it makes sense if we're delivering more value, it makes sense for us to reflect that additional value in our pricing, then we certainly are happy in those conversations. but in general, it's not as much of a factor in our business, particularly because we're very automated. we've got 75% of our multi-cloud transactions automated, highest automation in the industry and really a technology automation-driven business if that makes sense.
bradley clark -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much.
joseph crivelli
thanks, brad. our next question comes from matt roswell at rbc capital markets. go ahead, matt. matt roswell, are you there?
matt roswell -- rbc capital markets --- analyst
yes. hello, can you hear me?
joseph crivelli
yes, we can hear you now.
matt roswell -- rbc capital markets --- analyst
sorry about that. i was wondering to follow up on the investments, and i apologize for this. i was wondering if you would be willing to kind of bucket how much of them are going into the three areas, i.e., the cloud investment, the go-to market and for bt? and i think you just said we should kind of expect the same level into the third and fourth quarter. when would you expect to see kind of the revenue return on the investment?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so let me start with the last question first. the revenue return on the investments are typically fast. it's within three to 12 months -- three to six months.
it's a very fast return on the investments because we need to build delivery capability ahead of the services where we can deliver the services to our customers. now, in terms of giving you a little bit additional color on the investments, as i mentioned, most of the investments are in cost of revenue, ok? so when you take a look at our investments, i would say 75% to 80% of those investments are roughly in cost of revenue, and the balance is in opex. and the 75% to 80% of that -- the investments are into hiring professional services resources, elastic -- resources for elastic engineering, etc. so that's where our investments are going.
so opex investments are mainly in go-to-market as we continue to expand our go-to-market and some in starting up our bt environment.
matt roswell -- rbc capital markets --- analyst
if i could sneak in a quick one. how should we think about cash conversion in the second quarter?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so i will just talk about cash conversion in general.
matt roswell -- rbc capital markets --- analyst
ok.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
as you know, we had a very strong cash flow year in 2021 with all the improvements we drove, and those improvements are very sustainable. and long term, we expect cash flow from operations to track to anywhere between 60% to 70% of our operating profit. for example, in q1, our operating cash flow was quite solid at $65 million, which was at about 58% of our operating profit. but also keep in mind, the first quarter is typically the seasonal low for cash flow as it is a quarter in which we pay employee bonus.
so there was a big cash payout from an employee bonus perspective. so i would say if you're tracking to 60% to 70% of our operating profit conversion to cash flow from operations, i would say the quality of earnings is -- i consider a very high-quality earnings. now, our cash capex is also going down. and our cash capex should be anywhere between, say, 3% to 5% of our revenue and that the capex intensity continues to go down, so which means our free cash flow margin should be really good.
this is a comment overall for fiscal '22.
matt roswell -- rbc capital markets --- analyst
ok. thank you.
joseph crivelli
thanks, matt. we haven't had anyone else queue up, so we'll shut it down there. i want to thank everyone for joining us. if you have a follow-up, please give me a shout at ir@rackspace.com, and we'll talk to you soon.

2022-Q2,RXT,2022-08-09 17:00:00,"prepared remarks:
robert watson
good afternoon, and welcome to rackspace technology's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. my name is robert watson, vice president of corporate finance. as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. i am joined today by kevin jones, our chief executive officer; and amar maletira, our president and chief financial officer.
the slide deck we will reference during the call can be found on our investor relations website. on slide 2, certain comments we make on this call will be forward looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ. a discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings.
rackspace technology assumes no obligation to update the information provided on the call, except as required by law. our presentation includes certain non-gaap financial measures and certain further adjustments to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. in accordance with sec rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures in the earnings release and presentation, both of which are available on our website. after our prepared remarks, we will take your questions.
[operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to kevin. 
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. i'll discuss quarterly highlights and the strategic direction of our business. then amar will go into detail on the financial results. on slide 5, hyper growth in the cloud market shows no signs of abating.
in the second quarter, year-over-year cloud growth for the hyperscalers was impressive. aws grew 33%. google cloud grew 36%. and analysts estimate that microsoft azure grew 40%.
this represents $10 billion of additional public cloud revenue compared to last year's second quarter. the rackspace technology benefits from overall secular cloud growth, and this growth is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. in the second quarter, we executed well with non-gaap operating profit and non-gaap earnings per share both at the high end of our guidance. in the current market, tech investors are extremely focused on cash flow.
and in the second quarter, both operating and free cash flow were very strong for rackspace technology for the sixth quarter in a row. we are proud of the fact that we've delivered $365 million of free cash flow over this 18-month period, a testament to the underlying cash-generating power of our business. we made solid progress on the strategic initiatives we announced last quarter, and we also continued to expand and enhance our partnerships. more on these accomplishments in a moment.
on slide 6, you see a snapshot of key financial metrics for the quarter. revenue growth was solid with total revenue up 4% and core revenue up 5% compared to last year's second quarter. non-gaap operating profit was $99 million, and non-gaap eps was $0.17. as with most u.s.-based global companies, revenue in the quarter was impacted by foreign currency headwinds, as amar will discuss in a moment.
as noted on this slide, we had a very strong quarter for bookings. and through the first six months, bookings were relatively flat compared to the first half of 2021. on slide 7, last quarter, we previewed changes we're executing in our business. these included aligning and repositioning the company into two separate lines of business, public cloud and private cloud, to capitalize on the immense market opportunity we see today.
we are pleased with the progress we made on this front across a number of facets, people, organization structure, reporting and go-to-market. the team is working overtime to finalize this transformation. as we met with customers, partners and other stakeholders to preview these changes, we received very positive feedback, in particular, from our key hyperscaler partners, amazon, google and microsoft as well as vmware. we're nearing the point where we can provide additional details on our go-forward game plan, including any additional decisions regarding the structure of the company later this fall.
on slide 8, we announced that dk sinha joined rackspace technology as president, public cloud business unit. dk is an entrepreneurial business leader with a strong growth focus and three decades of global expertise in technology and digital transformation services. most recently, he was president of north america for cognizant, where he spearheaded the short and long-term growth strategy and execution for a region that represented approximately 75% of cognizant's revenue. while there, he also built and led a global go-to-market team encompassing key functions of sales, field marketing, partnerships and industry alliances.
dk also previously worked for tata consulting services. i'm thrilled to have dk on the team as we accelerate our public cloud strategy. he is the perfect leader to help us capitalize on this amazing market opportunity and has already made an impact on our business. on slide 9, in the second quarter, we announced several exciting new product offerings.
we introduced elastic engineering for government. now this offering extends our successful and innovative elastic engineering service delivery model to the government sector, where rackspace technology government solutions has been a leader for over 20 years. we are also proud that rackspace technology government solutions was named the leader in the 2022 isg provider lens report for the u.s. public sector.
we believe this recognition will positively impact our sales efforts in this important vertical.we expanded service offerings from our recent acquisition just analytics to target the aws markets with data analytics, machine learning and ai. this complements just analytics' strong set of offerings on azure. we enhanced our cloud data services portfolio to incorporate the data cloud capabilities provided by snowflake and databricks. and finally, we've announced a new security service to architect, design, implement and operationalize zero trust access with our partner, cloudflare.
on slide 10, our unique corporate culture and employee value proposition continues to receive acknowledgment in the way of awards and recognition this quarter in the form of two inspiring workplace awards. in the second quarter, we received the inspiring workplaces award for 2022 in both emea and north america. in addition, we were certified as a most loved workplace because of our commitment to fostering a culture where team members can develop and sharpen their skills, grow in their careers and feel valued for their expertise. these awards are a strong validation of our company, our corporate culture and our value proposition for our rackers and will help us continue to win in the market.
we also invested in our team members who earned 894 certifications across various cloud disciplines in the second quarter through rackspace university. on slide 11, we made a great deal of progress with our hyperscaler partners in the second quarter. we're recognized as one of the top aws partners in the mexico market. we joined the microsoft intelligent security association ecosystem of independent software vendors and managed security services providers.
and we completed and received formal validation of our capabilities on google cloud and renewed our designation as a google cloud managed services provider in the latin america market. let's look at a few case studies of rackspace technology customers who are benefiting from our cloud expertise. on slide 12, bmg rights management strives to be the best business partner for songwriters and artists in the digital age. the transition to digital streaming platforms like spotify and apple music has transformed the music industry.
one stream is roughly 1,500 times more data intensive than the sale of physical media such as a cd. so with digital music consumption at an all-time high, bmg had to enhance its data management expertise to ensure it received the correct royalties on its music portfolio. within six months of our engagement, rackspace technology helped bmg migrate most of its applications to google cloud, including the business-critical applications behind supply chain management, royalty calculation and data analytics. ultimately, we helped bmg migrate 70% of its applications to google cloud, generating significant cost savings.
in addition, we're exceeding bmg's targets for migration speed due to our in-depth knowledge of on-premise environments, application modernization best practices, google cloud architecture and around-the-clock support. on slide 13, we also strengthened our relationship with vmware when we were selected as their strategic partner for the secure access service edge or sase platform. vmware will leverage the rackspace technology data center in a box solution to deploy vmware sase, a solution that includes cloud networking, cloud security and edge compute services. vmware sase will be initially deployed in 15 rackspace technology data centers with another five data centers planned for additional phases.
this supplements our broad and deep end-to-end portfolio of managed services for vmware such as rackspace services for vmware cloud, which was launched in 2021. this is also another proof point of the potential in our private cloud business. now amar will take you through the financials. amar?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, kevin, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. slide 15 recaps our financial results for the second quarter. revenue was $772 million, a 4% year-over-year increase. core revenue was $733 million, up 5% compared to the second quarter of 2021.
revenue was slightly below guidance due to foreign currency fluctuations, as well as a slower ramp for the british telecom deal. non-gaap operating profit was $99 million, at the high end of our guidance for the second quarter. this was down 18% year over year, primarily due to the impact to gross profit from revenue decline in legacy openstack and our mature managed hosting. non-gaap operating margin was 13%, and non-gaap earnings per share was $0.17.
slide 16 shows the company's revenue mix in the second quarter by segment and by geography. multicloud continues to represent the vast majority of our revenue at 82% of the mix, and it grew 5% year over year. apps & cross platform at 13% of total revenue was up 8% year over year. openstack declined 16%, in line with our expectations and represent just 5% of total revenue today.
from a regional perspective, americas represents 75% of our revenue. as you can see on the chart, regional growth rates were materially impacted by foreign currency fluctuations in the second quarter. on a constant currency basis, americas growth would have been a point higher at 5%, apj growth would have been two points higher at 29%, and emea would have flipped from a 3% decline to 3% growth, a six-point swing. on slide 17, rackspace technology continues to drive strong cash flow.
in the second quarter, operating cash flow was $84 million, and free cash flow was $57 million, up from $65 million and $45 million, respectively, in the first quarter. this is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive operating and free cash flow. over those six quarters, we have delivered a cumulative $365 million of free cash flow. this demonstrates the tremendous cash generation ability of the business.
total capex was $37 million and cash capex was $27 million with capex intensity of 5% and 4%, respectively. we expect total capex intensity of 5% to 7% and cash capex intensity of 3% to 5% for the full year, in line with our previous guidance. at june 30, cash was $261 million compared to $215 million at the end of last year's second quarter. on slide 18, i want to remind investors that we have a strong balance sheet with no material debt maturities until 2028.
in addition, all of our debt was refinanced in late 2020 and early 2021 at historically low rates with minimal financial covenants. at quarter end, total debt was $3.4 billion, and net debt was $3.1 billion. our net leverage is very manageable for a company with our growth and profit profile. on slide 19, we have a guidance for the third quarter.
we expect total revenue in the range of $769 million to $779 million, core revenue in the range of $733 million to $741 million, non-gaap operating profit of $73 million to $77 million and non-gaap eps of $0.08 to $0.10. now let me provide some additional color on our outlook. third quarter revenue guidance is impacted by the shift in our sales focus away from resale revenue toward higher-margin offerings as well as expectation for continued foreign currency headwinds. the third quarter operating profit guidance is impacted by three primary factors: first, the continued and expected decline of our higher-margin managed hosting and legacy openstack businesses; second, the investments we are making in people, which includes retaining, retraining and hiring additional resources to drive growth in our cloud services business and support our long-term strategy; and third, although our power costs are partially hedged, we are seeing increased data center costs.
this is in part driven by record-high temperatures around the world, and we expect the impact to moderate over the intermediate term. as you know, we spent the last few quarters establishing our go-forward strategy and designing the best operating model to execute on it. the opportunity is clear, but we need to better position the company to address it. job 1 in this regard is realigning the company to sharpen our sales, product development and operational focus on two key markets, public cloud and private cloud, and higher-margin opportunities within them.
we have our executive leadership team identified, and we are accelerating this transition, which we expect will create some near-term disruption over the next few quarters. hence, we are moderating our outlook. we believe the end result will be a better and stronger rackspace technology focused on high-margin products in growing markets. before we open for questions, i want to reiterate that our cash flow is strong with six quarters of positive free cash flow and ample liquidity and a strong balance sheet that enables flexibility.
all told, we believe we are well positioned to win in the fast-growing cloud market in the years to come and excited to share the go-forward plan with you this fall. with that, we'll take your questions. robert, please queue up the audience for q&a.
robert watson
[operator instructions] our first question comes from bryan keane from deutsche bank. our next question comes from ramsey el-assal from barclays capital.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
we're having some technical difficulties here, guys. just give us a few minutes [technical difficulty] ok. we still have an echo here, but let's try it again. bryan, are you on the line?
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
there we go. can you guys help us a little bit just with the piece of the business that's kind of you're focusing away, which is kind of the resale? how much of the business is that kind of resale business? and then the push toward obviously the higher-margin business, like what kind of components is that? just trying to figure out the mix of business and what percentage of revenues those mixes make up.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so bryan, we are going to give you all the details. that's what we are actually doing right now, realigning the company across those two business units, public cloud and private cloud. and i'll be able to give you more details on what's in the public cloud business unit at this forum. so that's in the works right now, and i'll be more than happy to give you all the details.
now to answer your question specifically, bryan, as we mentioned on our previous call, we are in the public cloud business segment. we are putting more focus and emphasis on driving higher-margin cloud services business compared to resale. and even on the resale side is there are certain resale business that are lower margin, and when it comes up for renewal, we do a thorough assessment to understand whether we can actually expand our services in those accounts and if it meets certain profit thresholds or objectives. and if not, we are letting those lower-margin public cloud resale business churn.so that's what we are doing within the public cloud -- the overall public cloud segment.
that business is growing double digits. i think we are -- we see a good demand environment in the public cloud business, and i will let kevin talk about a little bit on the demand one you've seen on the public cloud side.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
sounds great. bryan, so look, i would say we're excited about this organization into two business units. we see really strong demand on the public cloud side of things and also strong demand on the private cloud side of things. if you look at the overall market opportunity, it's enormous, right? we believe customers have really only started the shift to move their workloads to the cloud.
so we've got many years of growth potential ahead of us and a very strong desire from customers to scale, driving demand to multicloud, causing us to become the default architecture for modern workloads. so we see demand in both public cloud and private cloud, and this is going to result in lots of opportunities for migrations, for integrations, for managed services. these are, of course, great businesses and good margin businesses for rackspace technology and the hyperscalers around the world, right? they continue to innovate. they're progressing now at such a pace that customers have lots of options and customers need help to handle the massive complexity of the multicloud environment.
so we're certainly continuing to double down on public cloud. and we need to do it certainly at the right margin, which is what amar mentioned before. now the other thing that i'll mention that we're seeing, and this is going to help with our strategy, is there's a trend toward customers wanting help beyond the infrastructure layer, right, into apps and data layers of the it stack in particular. so that's usually a very high-value business for us.
and then industry specialization is gaining traction as a defined need in the market. and then from a geographic perspective, look, multicloud continues to play a huge factor in what i'll call the technical revolution around the world, right? we're seeing strong demand in europe, in asia, in the south pacific, in latin america and in north america. so from that kind of the market, bryan, i mean, from a customer perspective, i talked to a lot of customers. we're seeing some fascinating trends there.
customers need talent. customers are really struggling to find people with the skills they need to complete these complex cloud transitions. and we keep hearing from customers over and over. they're short for talent.
they need expertise. they need help to augment the staff. and they're seeing value in offerings like rackspace elastic engineering, rackspace professional services. we saw that in action with the recent win that we have with a large technology and media company, providing our cloud expertise as a service.
and we had another big win with a u.k. banking firm leveraging rackspace to supplement resources through a professional services agreement. and from other conversations, particularly in this economic environment, customers are trying to cut costs. so they need help from rackspace to optimize their spend.
and we've got financial spend optimization tools and practices that take advantage of our expertise to help customers actually reduce a lot of cost. and then finally, back to your question about public cloud, from a partnership perspective, the demand for the hyperscaler products is very -- it's going very fast. and the demand for multicloud is strong. our new public cloud business unit leader, dk sinha and i, we just visited the west coast.
we met our partners out there. and i can tell you, aws, google, microsoft are continuing to see massive increases in sales and revenue every quarter, had another $10 billion of new revenue in the second quarter alone. so this is exciting new growth for us. and our partnerships on the private cloud side with dell and vmware, dell and vmware continue to take us into customers.
big demand from customers for private cloud and multicloud as well. so partners continue to tell me, we value bringing rackspace into the customer conversations early, right, if they're early, so we can shape the technical dialogue and then help customers get into execution mode. so overall, bryan, strong demand environment, very encouraged by the opportunity.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. and just as a follow up, when you talk about the division into public and private cloud, there's going to be near-term disruption. are you talking specifically about sales disruption? or what exactly are you talking about? and the analyst day that was planned, i think, for september, maybe october, are we still on for that? or is this just going to be kind of an update on the segments?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, bryan. so look, in terms of the disruption that we talked about, anytime you see a shift, you shift the sales organization, structure and its goals. so you're going to see some near-term disruption for long-term benefit, right? and with our restructure, we are realigning the go-to-market organization.
so we think it's prudent to plan for a little bit of disruption in the back half of the year as the teams kind of work through these changes. now with that said, our leadership team is experienced, and we're confident that we're driving the company toward the right operating model. so as the go-to-market teams break the changes, the business is stabilized, we'll then accelerate. and as i've talked about, our partners expressed very strong support for the transformation we're making.
ultimately, we're excited about these changes. they're going to be great for rackspace technology and aligning the company into two business units with clear accountability and ownership end to end. so that's a little bit about the transformation.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes. i'll take the analyst day question, bryan. no, listen, we look forward to sharing more details on the financial profiles of both the public cloud and private cloud businesses. and currently, we are deep into the detailed planning of this realignment that kevin talked about, and we'll begin the early stages of implementation of the new operating model in our fiscal q3.
so as we speak, i think we would like to accelerate that transformation. now once we have completed the planning phase, we can more accurately forecast the revenue and profit expectations of each of those business units. and i'll tell you, we are committed to providing the investors with more granularity on our performance, and we'll communicate more in the coming months. thanks, bryan.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for taking the question.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
thanks, bryan.
robert watson
all right. sorry for the technical difficulties. [operator instructions] our next question comes from bradley clark from bmo, and then we'll go to irvin from evercore after that.
bradley clark -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. can you hear me, ok?
robert watson
yup, bradley.
bradley clark -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i wanted to ask a question about -- you mentioned that you're being a little bit more strategic on some of the public cloud deals you're going after. specifically, it has to meet a better margin profile. i just want to understand, are you leaving deals on the table that, in the pipe, you're sort of walking away from? or are you being more granular about what's going into the pipeline? and if so, how can we think about this being different than sort of past deals that rackspace went after? thank you.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
very good. thanks for that, bradley. i'll start and then amar can add some color. so the first thing i should mention is we've created this public cloud business nearly from scratch over the last several years, and we scaled it to a point now that we're seeing a lot of success across all three hyperscalers, right? we're growing fast with microsoft, with google, with aws.
and what that's allowed us to do is to continue to go to market in different parts of the world with all three hyperscale. and it is allowing us to be more selective, right, and to make sure that we are pursuing deals that make the most sense for our customer and for the hyperscaler and for rackspace. and this is the right time to shift that strategy. for the last three years, we've been building the business, and we had -- and still have a land and expand strategy.
and look, if we'd landed in a particular customer account for -- with more of an infrastructure resale deal, and we've had it for a couple of years, and we don't see a lot of opportunity to get into higher-margin service offerings then it's prudent for us to look for other places to grow, if that makes sense. and this is possible now because we are scaled and scaling with all three hyperscalers, which is a great place to be. but amar, i'll let you comment.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
no, i think you said it very well. i think we are very, very focused on changing the mix of the business even within the public cloud business unit. and as kevin mentioned, more focus on services. and as you see, even the customer journey is moving from more infrastructure as they go modernize their applications, as they move more data, they have to modernize data, their security offerings, and that's what we are focused on.
so it's all about selling higher-margin services and solutions into our public cloud installed base and also capturing new revenue stream. so we're very, very thoughtful and mindful on how we do that. so instead of leading with infrastructure with services is an attach. we're actually now leading with services with infrastructure as an attach.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
where it makes sense.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
and that's the -- and where it makes sense. so that's the focus. and that's a change of focus. the demand environment remains rich.
i do believe that there is a lot of opportunity going forward as we move up the stack.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
so we're moving up the stack. we acquired this company just analytics, which has been a huge benefit for our global data business. we're continuing to expand into, as amar mentioned, apps and security layers, leading with our tip-of-the-sphere professional services business, which performed really quite well in q2. so that's a little bit of the shift if that makes sense, bradley.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
now as we go through this bradley -- i'll just take this question and take it a little bit forward, right? so we are changing the mix of the business. we're looking at managed hosting business and openstack business declining. and where private cloud business is in a growth market. as kevin mentioned, we see good demand in private cloud.
we have to capture the demand and public cloud, of course, is a secular growth market. so as we make all these shifts, we are going to balance growth and profitability. so if you look at our guidance for q3, it reflects some of those. plus there is fx headwind that we saw, plus we also saw a slower ramp in bt deal.
but if i look forward in q4, as well as next few quarters, we do expect the core revenue growth trend that you see in q3, basically continuing. so we should see low single-digit core revenue growth for the next few quarters as we make the shift happen. so ultimately, for us, we will be focused on revenue growth, but revenue is panicky, profit is sanity and cash is reality. and that's the reason we are very focused on generating good cash flow and good profitable growth for the company.
robert watson
all right. our next question comes from irvin liu from evercore. and then frank louthan from raymond james, you are up after that. all right.
let's go to frank louthan and then we'll circle back.
frank louthan
all right. there we go. sorry about that. thanks.
i lost audio for a minute, so you may have gone through this. but as you go through the transition, can you be clear kind of what areas are being restructured? any change in the sales organization? and is -- are there any key positions you need to add too as you're making the transition?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
very good. hey, thanks for the question, frank. i'll start and then amar can talk about some of the investments we're making and positions we're adding, etc. so if we're excited about this, we're on track with our reorganization across public cloud and private cloud.
as we've talked about, received really good feedback from our partners and our stakeholders, amazon, google, microsoft, vmware, dell technologies, good feedback there. so where we are, we've completed the blueprinting phase and we'll be wrapping up the detailed design work and begin implementation this quarter. a big milestone was the hiring of our public cloud services leader, dk sinha. and dk's got three decades of experience in scaling technology businesses and digital transformation.
so that was a big milestone. and then we've made excellent progress, i would say, overall, on the transformation, and we're on track. but let me just take a step back and just talk a little bit about why this transformation is so important for our company and our stakeholders. first of all, if you just look at the fundamentals of our business, they're very strong, right? and we will be uniquely positioned to win in two great markets, public cloud and private cloud.
businesses are more agile when they're operating end to end, right? and that's what we're moving to. we're moving to an end-to-end model and public cloud and end-to-end model and private cloud. so when you're end to end, you can have faster decision making and you can accelerate progress across the board. and quite frankly, we've scaled our public cloud business so fast, it demands having its own business unit now.
so what this means is every employee in the company is going to be laser-focused on being the best in class for a public cloud and the best in class for private cloud. so this means we're going to have dedicated product teams, which leads to higher expertise across both portfolios. a simple, clear go-to-market model with accountability aligned to each business unit. and then another thing i'm really excited about is the collaboration and the goal alignment we're going to get between what the market wants, our sales teams, our product and service delivery team.
so we're going to have that closed-loop feedback process between those organizations, including, as you mentioned, our sales and go-to-market teams. so overall, pleased with the progress we're making, and i get more excited about this transformation every day. amar, do you want to talk about the investments?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes. yes. the investments that we are making here, frank, just last quarter, if you recall, i did mention that we are planning a $15 million to $20 million of investments in the quarter to support both the growth acceleration in cloud services, as well as the start-up of a bt partnership. and as i noted in my prepared remarks, bt is ramping slower than we initially expected.
so some of the planned investments in q2 are also slightly delayed. but we did execute on most of our planned investments, which includes, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, retaining -- retraining and hiring delivery resources to support our public cloud services as well as some of the sales investments we are making in the americas region. so based on the strong demand that we are seeing, we also have planned approximately about $5 million to $7 million of additional investments that are already baked in my q3 guidance. and needless to say, we'll continue to manage investments more judiciously as we balance both profitability and growth given the strong market opportunity we have in cloud.
frank louthan
and are those investments you're making in personnel?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes, frank, that is mainly in personnel.
frank louthan
right. great. thank you very much.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
all right. thanks.
robert watson
irvin, are you there and still want to ask the question? if not, we'll move on.
irvin liu
i am here. can you hear me?
robert watson
yes.
irvin liu
so yes, if i could tack on another question related to the overall realignment of your business around public cloud and private cloud. what percentage of your customers are both public cloud and private cloud customers? and then which of these two businesses do you see more prone to disruption?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so that's a great question actually. we did a very thorough analysis to see the overlap between the two segments. and the overlap is not big today, right? but it can be tomorrow. so the way we are designing the organization is if we see opportunities for a multi cloud in a particular customer, so one of the business unit will be the hosting business unit and will bring the other business units in.
the beauty of this model is, ultimately, we will be selling multi-cloud to our customer, but we will be doing that with very focused solutions across both public cloud and private cloud, and that's clearly a big advantage when we take the solution to the market.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
that's right. that's really well said. i would add, irvin, we're getting the best of both worlds with this reorganization, right? i mean, on the one hand, we're able to offer multi-cloud solutions to customers, but we're going to have one salesperson per customer. so our salespeople will be incented to sell both public cloud and private cloud.
but their laser focus is going to be on their primary business unit where we want to make sure that we grow and grow profitably. so we've done lots of these reorganizations in our careers, and i think we found the perfect model for us. and it's made a little easier because we really only have two businesses here as opposed to some of the sis, which got over 100 different types of service offerings. so very straightforward execution from a go-to-market perspective.
we will be offering multi-cloud offering one phase to the customer. but we're going to have, as a result of the focus, we're going to have the best in class in private cloud offerings and the best in class in public cloud offerings, therefore, the best in class in multi cloud.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
yes. and let me just add to this. as we realign the company and in particular, the sales organization that kevin talked about, from a planning perspective, it's very prudent to plan for some near-term disruption. so our leadership has the runway to make the required changes and we can accelerate our transformation.
and hence, we expect to grow moderately over the next few quarters as we pivot to this new operating model and execute our long-term strategy, again, to drive profitable growth.
irvin liu
and i wanted to ask another question on q2. i may have missed this on the prepared remarks, but can you talk about how your bookings performance trended in the quarter? and just can you provide color on how overall bookings linearity trended as well?
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
sure. sure. absolutely, irvin. i'll give you a little bit of color on our bookings performance for the second quarter.
so look, first of all, it was the third highest bookings quarter in the history of the company. bookings in the quarter continue to be highly diversified by geography, by industry, by market segment. there were over 5,600 individual deals closed in the second quarter. we saw strong performance in our tip-of-the-sphere professional services business in both the americas and the emea regions.
and we had good traction with sales in our public sector business. our managed public cloud service offerings, yes, they continue to be well received in the market, supported by these new offerings that we've launched. and the other thing that we're seeing, irvin, is we're signing bigger deals, right? we're seeing increased deal sizes as customers are bringing larger workloads and purchasing multiple services. and our focus on higher-margin deals, balancing revenue and profitability, our focus there is driving good results.
so overall, very pleased with the quality of the bookings.
robert watson
ok. thanks, irvin. our next question comes from ryan campbell from barclays. ryan, go ahead.
ryan campbell -- barclays -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my question today. would you be able to provide us some additional color on how pricing is structured in your contracts and how you're seeing wage inflation in the market right now?
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so our pricing, i think one of the things that -- because the demand environment remains rich, we are not seeing any kind of pricing pressure, so to speak. i think this is a good market to operate from that perspective. and when it comes to labor, i will let kevin talk about, we don't -- our model is not a labor-intensive model. we don't operate on the labor plus model.
we operate mainly on the labor minus model. by that, i mean we basically embed our technology automation with labor. and so from that perspective, we are not seeing labor inflation or cost inflation actually hit our -- have any pressure on the pricing side as such.
kevin jones -- chief executive officer
yes. i think that's well said. yes, this is an interesting -- this is a great business because there's not a heavy labor model here. if you think about how we go to market, we go to market with our technology, specifically rackspace fabric, which is our software and it platform.
we're automated 75% of the multi-cloud transactions, right? so that makes us have the highest automation in the industry. so we don't have a lot of heavy labor cost in our solutions. and in terms of pricing, because our solutions are standardized, we don't have a lot of pricing complexity. so it's a pretty straightforward type of pricing model.
we standardized it. we've got an excellent cfo organization to make sure that we're pricing at the right margins and price to win. so very -- compared to the industry and certainly my three decades of experience in this industry, very standardized pricing, not very labor intensive, automated kind of base platform that we use to differentiate and to win.
amar maletira -- president and chief financial officer
so ryan, i'll take this opportunity also because the pricing typically in some other -- when we look at our competitors, who are very labor focused or labor intensive, pricing does impact the gross margins. in our case, we do not have impact from pricing on our gross margin. it's mainly mix related. for example, in q2, we are very pleased with our 30% gross margins that we landed.
it was because we managed the mix of the business it was a very favorable mix. in q3, we expect the gross margins to be around 27% because we are seeing the impact of mix as well as the investments we are making and onetime costs, especially on the data center side that is impacting our gross margins. nothing to do with pricing, right? so this is about 27% gross margins. we expect that gross margin to be around 26% in q4.
and in fiscal '23, even that we are making this mix shift to from low margin to high margin, it will be in a transition phase, and we expect our gross margins to be mid-20%. so low single-digit core revenue growth with mid-20% gross margin plus or minus one percentage point.
