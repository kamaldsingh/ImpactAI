[operator instructions] our first question comes from steven cahall of wells fargo. your line is open.
steven lee cahall -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
thanks. rich, a couple for you. and then bob, i've got a podcasting question. rich, maybe just how should we think about being ebitda or free cash flow positive in the second half of the year based on all the proactive cost reductions that you've taken, which i think you probably didn't get a lot of the benefits of in the second quarter? and maybe included in that, can you give us an indication as to what you think the cash interest is going to look like in the back half of the year?
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
sure. thanks, steven. good morning everybody. so just got a couple of things. i'm not going to make any specific comments about cash flow for the second half of the year because i think that would be tantamount to giving guidance, quite frankly, out there. but if you kind of think about -- and i think what's really great about this business -- and when bob articulated in his opening remarks the business, what's happening on an operating basis, i don't think any of us should lose sight of the fact that the cash flow characteristics that this business has. if you look at q2, we -- and again, none of us are happy with these results, but there's a reality of operating in the pandemic. while we declined 47% on revenue, our ebitda was down a little over $260 million or $270 million for q2, so significantly less in revenue. but i think what points to the cash flow part of the business is we only used and i don't ever want to use a dollar of cash, but we only used $6.77 [phonetic] million on free cash flow, which i think is a pretty good free cash flow performance considering the headwinds we have on revenue.
so i would just point to that without giving any specific guidance for the rest of the year and the fact that we're continuing to aggressively manage capital expenditures. as we reiterated, our guidance is of $75 million to $95 million, the low working capital. and again, the fact that we effectively have zero cash taxes this year, the largest part of which is driven by the cash tax savings for interest deductions that we get as a result of the cares act and also our ability to defer employee taxes for -- employee taxes also as a result of the cares act.
steven lee cahall -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
and cash interest?
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
well, look, our weighted average cost of debt at june 30th, so i think you guys can compute, this is about 5.3% overall. and so i would just -- we've got about $5.8 billion of total debt. i think if you go to page 11 of the investor deck, we break it down kind of piece by piece. and i think you guys can look through that and compute the number there.
steven lee cahall -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
great. and then on capital structure, i mean we've seen some peers that have been impacted by covid look at sort of strategic partners for preferred types of investments. you guys have a lot of liquidity runway. so i'm just wondering how you think about the capital structure and whether you think this is an opportune time to sort of talk to strategic partners for anything like that or do you just really like the liquidity runway that you have?
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
well, taking the last part of your question first. i think we've done a nice job in terms of the cap structure liquidity runway. and i think in our opening remarks, bob and i pointed out that whatever your time period of the recovery, whatever your time period of the acceleration, of the return of advertising, whether that's the end of this year or 2021, we've got a capital structure that's built to endure those periods of time. and again, i won't repeat myself, but i think the second quarter is just very instructive in a positive way about the free cash flow and our ability to continue to weather any downturn here in the capital structure there.
bob, myself, the rest of the management team, our board of directors, we have one objective here, which is to drive the value for stakeholders. it's to drive the equity value of this company. so we continue to evaluate it. but again, we have the benefit of having a capital structure and a liquidity position, steve, as you pointed out, that we don't need to do anything unless we think it's going to be value-accretive for our stakeholders.
steven lee cahall -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
yeah. thanks. and then maybe just, bob, one on podcasting. i feel like we'd be remiss not to maybe just talk about the competitive dynamics with spotify. how do you think about that relationship? would you sell them exclusive content at the right price? will you continue to make your content available on all platforms, including spotify? how do we just think about those competitive dynamics? thanks.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
look, i've mentioned [indecipherable] there are really two models for podcasting. ours is a distributed content model. we want our content available anywhere a consumer might be to make it easy for them to consume it. we would not sell our products exclusively. we think that, one, it limits the size of the audience. and for creators, i mean most creators want to create a hit podcast. i guess there's some amount of money at which they said they'd rather have the money than create a hit podcast. but i think that's the goal. and i think when you -- and so therefore, you attract more creators, the more -- the bigger the audience you can offer them. and i think the other avenue is that advertisers, if you're advertiser-supported, really demand the biggest audience possible. if you go behind the paywall, i certainly -- you can justify it as you're going to help build some other service, but we've yet to see success with that anywhere.
so i think we like the strategy we have. we're really pleased with the growth we've had on podcasting. if you think about it, way back when we were about 5 million of unique users, stuff media was about 5 million, we acquired them. so combined, we have about 10 million. we've more than doubled that. so we've not bought our way to the audience size we have. we built most of it. and i think that was our goal is to build this platform that can create hit podcast after hit podcast. and of course, one of our not-so-secret weapons is that we're able to use all of our broadcasting reach to build podcast, and we've had great success with that and continue to use that in new and innovative ways. so we like the model. we think we're in the right place with the right model. we're certainly with the only model that's proven it can generate real profits and real growth. so we're sticking with it, and as you can tell, driving forward with it quite aggressively.
steven lee cahall -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from zack silver of b. riley. your line is open.
zachary alan silver -- b. riley fbr, inc. -- analyst
hi, great. thanks for taking the question. the first one, i know you said that you were not going to talk about forward guidance, but you did give the revenue for july, how that was pacing. and i just wanted to first ask if you could point specifically to what's driving the recovery, both in terms of the revenue lines and the advertiser categories.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i'll let rich jump in on that. but i think we're seeing there is some demand. some return in advertising demand, i think, is the primary driver of it. i think when the pandemic began, we saw advertisers, they could -- just pulled all the chips off the table and said, let's wait and see what's happening. i think they're beginning to just get a flavor of where it's going, what's working, what's not, where they want to invest, how they want to build their business back.
one of, i think, the encouraging things is that almost every business now has to think about reopening or at least selling themselves again to the consumer and radio has historically been the place that people have used for any opening, grand opening, reopening, because we do get the word out quickly. we have the number one reach. if you think about what radio is, it's your companion, telling you what's going on in the world on a continuing basis and obviously a business offering a new service per pickup. we've opened our doors again. we've got a new service for you. the brands redefined is the perfect place to get that into the consumers' mind. so we think that radio will be a beneficiary of this. and we think that's probably behind the return in the advertising demand we've seen so far, and our expectations will continue.
now i think we've also built out capabilities that allow us to match what the advertiser needs. we didn't get into it in the call but we have in previous calls that we've really built out our data capabilities, our analytics capabilities, so that we begin to look more like the capabilities offered by the major -- and the digital giants, the major digital players. we think that allows us to even be attractive to people who say, i'm looking for the analytical approach to advertising, the performance advertising. and now we have those capabilities. we continue to build them out even during this pandemic. and we have been able to even push those kinds of capabilities over on to our podcasting as well, which i think puts us in a unique position.
richard, do you want to add something?
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. and bob, just to -- zach, thanks for the question again, and just to add on to that just for a minute. overall, and this won't surprise you, a couple of simple statements and then a couple -- give you a little more detail on categories. placements are increasing, quite frankly, and cancellations are decreasing, and we've seen that since the start of the pandemic. in the beginning of the pandemic, clearly, national for us took a bigger hit, and we've seen that start to reverse itself. and i think this goes to bob's point. as bigger advertisers, bigger brands are coming back into the marketplace, it's been interesting. i'm sure we've all read the same things, but whether it's today or over the last couple of days, the number of articles, particularly in the wall street journal, that have talked about ceos that just said, ok, we're going to be in this operating environment for a while. so we need to learn how to run our companies in this operating environment and we're starting to see some of that come into the marketplace. and you see that in numbers and the trends that we just gave.
and if you look at specific categories that have done better than others, it's probably the right way to say it, i don't think any of these will surprise anybody on the call. categories like cpg, consumer product group, home improvement, insurance, financial services, medical healthcare, those have clearly been categories that have done better than categories like entertainment, which has been a nice category for us over the years. although having said that, we've done very well with the streaming services, whether it's the netflix, the hbo max, the new nbc service out there, amazon along the way. so again, we do have some bright spots out there. and all of those take advantage of the new capabilities that bob touched upon in terms of our data-infused offering. and clearly, podcasting, as we've just touched upon also on the first question, continue to lead the pack, not just for us, but quite frankly, i think in all medium -- all media-related businesses today.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
can i add one more thing? i also think that as you're analyzing what's going on in the advertising world, we see two trends that are emerging. one, either the advertiser wants a big idea and we're doing a lot more brainstorming with cmos and marketing departments about new approaches, new ideas, new things they need to do that are very specific to their situation, sort of think about it as custom solutions. and fortunately, we built out that kind of marketing support and ideation capability in our company over the past four or five years. and the other side of it is, and they're looking for or they're looking for performance. i'm going to spend a dollar. i need to maximize the value of that dollar like i never had before. clearly, the smart audio capabilities we have with the data analytics help enormously there. and also, we hate to say it, but it is an advantage for the advertiser is that if you think about radio and tv historically, they both deliver about the same impact at the same weight level. however, radio is about a third the price of tv per person reach. so if people are looking for efficiency, again, radio has a real advantage there.
and finally, i think as you think about reach in the old days -- five, 10 years ago, tv was the big reach medium. today, radio is the big reach medium. and so anybody that's putting together a campaign that has gone quiet or has been working segments instead of the mass realizes right now, they got to tell everybody something. and again, that reach becomes probably more important now than it has in recent times.
zachary alan silver -- b. riley fbr, inc. -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then one more if i could, just around sort of the strategy of -- clearly, there's good demand for advertising on podcasts. and one of the things that you guys have talked about before is using podcast to get more advertisers involved in broadcast radio. just wondering if you can talk about how the current state of affairs may have impacted that strategy, and maybe what the attach rates on advertisers using podcasts are also coming in to use broadcast [indecipherable].
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
we haven't announced anything like that, so i don't want to get into that specific information. but i will tell you that i think that they continue -- that people are interested in podcasting. they certainly should be interested in radio because, to us, it winds up being sort of the same thing. i think it's no accident that npr and iheart go back and forth as to who's number one overall and that we have a 2:1 lead over the next largest podcaster because it is, to me, the equivalent of radio on demand, and it's very much the radio form. we find that in successful podcasts, it's very host driven just like radio, that people want that companionship. they sort of like somebody keeping them company. they like the conversation even -- it's like telling them a story. they like hearing that voice.
so we sort of treat podcasting and radio as one experience expressed at a slightly different way. and i think being able to not only do that creatively for the consumer, but being able to do that for the advertiser is really a unique advantage that our company provides. and we are finding people, they either directly want to say, ok, let's do a campaign that's all tied together. we're doing this on broadcast, this on podcast, this on digital. we're using smart audio here, and they're using all of our capabilities, or as you correctly point out, for some people who sort of weren't so interested in radio, they are interested in podcasting. and it's the door for them to come into the company. once they come into the company, we can expose them to the other assets we have, which can help drive their ideas. and we've had a number of successes there and really expect that to continue.
zachary alan silver -- b. riley fbr, inc. -- analyst
got it. thank you, bob.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks zach.

your next question comes from sebastiano petti of jpmorgan. your line is open.
sebastiano carmine petti -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
hi, thanks. rich, you touched upon the decline in ebitda on a dollar basis coming in a little bit better than the revenue decline, which demonstrates a lot of the cost savings initiatives that you have in place. wanted to see if you can give us an update toward the $200 million run rate savings by the end of the year. where are you on that today? and should we expect the decline in ebitda to continue to narrow relative to revenue as we go through the rest of the year just given, i guess, some of the initiatives that were kind of launched in 2q?
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
sure. thanks, sebastian. look, again, just going back, i'm not going to -- i think going to any detail on that would be tantamount to giving guidance, so i'm not going to do that. the only thing i will comment is we are and continue to be on track for our cost savings initiatives. and i think in bob's opening remarks, he talked about the $250 million number, which was $50 million, just to remind everybody, for the modernization efforts that we announced in the first quarter of this year. and just again, as a reminder, it's in the press release, that is $100 million on an annual basis by the time you get to mid-2021 of $50 million this year and an additional $200 million that we articulated related to everything happening as a result of the virus and continue to be on track with that.
having said that, and i think bob talked about this a little bit and touched upon in his opening remarks, we are taking a step back. and by the way, i'm sure like a lot of companies in america, and doing exactly what we're supposed to be doing is people running this company, looking at our organization, looking at things like real estate, which is a significant cost in this company. that we're already taking a hard look at real estate is also the modernization. we're obviously taking a much harder look at it right now, just the realities of the way people are working, whether it's teams or zooms or it's all looking to work more remotely. t&e was not an insignificant expense for this company. we never disclosed exactly what it was. clearly, we never expect t&e to come back anywhere near the levels that it was pre-pandemic.
so just looking at the way people are doing business differently that we talked about, look at the way that we need to do business differently, look at the size of the company to support the infrastructure size of the company, to support the revenue size of the company and how do we just become more efficient? and what have we learned during this period of time? it's pretty interesting when you've got a company that's across the united states, and we're now in 150 offices and we have this, bob and i both talked about, just phenomenal employee base that has really gone the extra mile during this period.
well, what have we all learned? not just bob and me, but the entire company, our entire employee base and how do we just operate more efficiently, drive new revenue, have product innovation like black information network, which we're so proud of, that was innovative and incubated during this period of time and bring more down to the bottom line and improve our operating margins, improve our operating efficiency and still deliver a great experience to our advertisers. and i would say on the one -- a little more specific around the timing of savings, they're probably a little more weighted to the second half of this year as you think they'd be, based on the time we implemented them and just the rhythm of our business than the first half of the year.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, could i have add one thing on that, rich? just to put a point on it, too. as managers, to be a great manager, i think you constantly have to experiment. you constantly have to change and move and find new ways to do things. this is awful as this has been for our business. the one thing it's done for us as managers, it's allowed us to look hard at some different ways of doing business. and for example, there's no way we would have ever taken the chance of saying, hey, let's experiment by working from home for three months and put the whole company there to see what the impact is. but now that we've done it, we've been able to examine productivity by each group, by each employee. we've asked our employees what works better, what works -- what's worse and we've been able from that to figure out some new ways of working, which i think will improve the company that we would have never known and never been able to reasonably test except through some disaster like this.
so rich and i are spending an enormous amount of our time with our management team, really examining everything we're learning about how we operate and how we can operate better going forward. and i will tell you i was not a fan of a work-from-home company at all, but i've realized that there are some people in our company who can work as productively or more productively from home, and it has very beneficial financial impacts for us. so we're examining everything. and again, it's been one giant experiment, the positive side of it. and we have not wanted that to go without us really examining and learning a lot from it, which we have.
sebastiano carmine petti -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
that's great. and one quick follow-up on the digital. just if you could unpack perhaps some of the moving parts within the digital bucket? obviously, podcasting up 103% year-over-year but a sequential deceleration just overall in the digital category. so how should we be thinking about total listening hours on the iheart -- on the app as well as maybe some of the other buckets within that? thank you.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
rich, you want to start or you want me to --
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. why not start with that? why not start with that, sebastian. so bob articulated the strength of our podcasting business. and we talked about this in the first quarter, we talked about it now and it continues, that revenue is up over 100%. we don't give a lot of details in terms of digital, but you kind of unpack it a little bit. and if you pulled podcasting out of that, the overall digital would be down dramatically better than the rest of our line. so i would say down high single digits, about double digit, somewhere overall in that 10% but continue to improve significantly. so i think if you look at the overall digital line ex podcasting, and i don't think this will be any surprise, it's doing dramatically better than pretty much any other advertising business has done right now in the united states, again, put aside just facebook and their announced earnings and google and some of the smaller players out there. so we feel very good about that and continue to see momentum overall in that business.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, can i also say that we have a wide range of digital services, too, for anyone who follows the company. we not only have streaming through the iheartradio app but allowing the consumer to hear our radio stations on a digital platform. and by the way, when they're listening to it, sort of crazy. but when they listen to it on the iheartradio app, it's exactly the same program as am/fm. there are many people who will buy us now for digital and we've fallen into a digital bucket. now we hope the smart audio over-time begins to blur of that distinction as it should. we also provide other digital services for our clients and have a robust suite of services that we offer. we have big digital sites. if you look at comscore, you see we're one of the major players there. there's the z100.com. there are all sorts of other services we provide from other vendors as well, some we own, some we don't. so we've got a pretty diverse offering there. and they all have disparate growth rates during this pandemic.
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
but -- and one, by the way, listening. i just -- i want to reiterate what bob talked about upfront like in his opening remarks again just not to [indecipherable]. we answered financially. bob talked about products. but if you look at the in-home listening, whether it's web, roku, alexa, google, all up, and i think bob went through a number of the percentages, all up very significantly during this period of time. so again, a silver lining as you look for silver linings during the pandemic is the consumer habit -- consumer habit of in-home listening. and we don't have any reason to believe that, that won't stay with us in some form as we exit the pandemic.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. let me go back to -- i'm going to add one more thing. go back to the basics. the more devices you can receive a service on, the more listening you'll get. and so for us, the weakest place for us has been -- over the past 10 years, has been the home because i think people have moved to more digital devices as opposed to a freestanding am/fm radio. and so for us, what we've done rather than trying to get people to make more am/fm radios is to say, fine, our products are not limited to am/fm. we'll build the product. and we were, as you know, one of the foundation services on alexa when it launched. we had worked with amazon on the development of that. and we tend to be there early, whether it's with comcast on their box, whether it was alexa, as we've got a group that continues to work on those new locations. so if we build out all these capabilities for all these new devices, we know over-time, as those devices grow, it gives us more listening. so very positive for us.
operator
your final question comes from jim goss of barrington research. your line is open.
james charles goss -- barrington research associates, inc. -- analyst
thanks. iheart has tended to have a different mix of radio revenues than the industry. rather than 85%-15%, it might be more 60%-40% in the split between national and local, or the other way around, the way i stated them. if you consider that, i imagine that traditional strength might have hurt you a little bit more in these last several months. and i wondered if you could go through those, the 50%, 49%, 41% decline, and talk about how that mix of revenue might have affected those, like which categories might have impacted what you've already reported.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
we don't do a lot of detail on that. we haven't done the breakout side. i don't want to do it here, but i think your point is correct that this company, one of the strengths we have is we're actually the only company that delivers broadcast radio that has a real national reach. so they can -- the advertisers can look at us not only for local, but also as a national partner. and you're correct, i think, as rich pointed out earlier that we did see big advertisers had the luxury of these big dollars, just pull the chips off the table and hold it until they figure out what their new strategy is. and if any of you remember living through 9/11, which i do, is every advertiser pulled their dollars because they couldn't figure out what message they should have in that new world. and it took them a little while to figure it out. i think the same happened here that for [indecipherable] media or saving the money, they just couldn't figure out what the creative message should be in this pandemic.
well, i think at this point, they have. and i think, of course, we had the double layer of the tragic death of george floyd. and suddenly, advertisers again pulled back and said, wait a minute what should my message be? and how should i communicate to the marketplace? and so -- but the good news is once they figure it out, and then they can turn the spigot back on. and as rich pointed out to you, we are seeing that balance change a little bit. initially, national hit harder than local. i'm beginning to see that more equalized.
james charles goss -- barrington research associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. and the television broadcast, as we follow, have been pointing out that they've been doing sequentially better as you have since bottoming in april. i wonder if that could accelerate your gains as you recapture some of the things you had lost. is that a reasonable conclusion?
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think we're at this point --
james charles goss -- barrington research associates, inc. -- analyst
[speech overlap] declines?
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're reluctant to predict the slope and the recovery because what do we know in this world? but i think the trend lines would suggest that, but i'm just a little hesitant to be so certain. rich, i don't know if you have --
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
no. but the only thing i'd add to that, bob, jim, is just -- the two things i would say on that is -- and again, i'm sure the unemployment -- the employment numbers, again, today, i think, looked a little better than most people's expectations. so there are aspects of recovery there. but as things start to recover, they're going to recover on -- as we've talked about earlier in this call, they're going to recover on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood or city-by-city or state-by-state basis. however, they're going to recover, then all of a sudden -- i think we can all agree on one thing; they're not going to recover all of a sudden, snap your fingers and the whole country is going to recover at the same period of time.
and if you think about just the ability to generate demand on a city-by-city basis or municipality-by-municipality basis, based on the facts and circumstances, there's no better company in america that's built for that. our ability with our 850-plus radio stations in 150 markets to reach the local consumer with four advertisers that have messages that are tailored to them, important to them on a local basis. you could talk about tv broadcast. you could talk about the big digital players. no one else has that capability out there. and to be clear, we have that capability across the board, not just in our broadcast area.
so we have the ability, as bob has talked about a couple of times on the call. we talk about data-infused solutions and the ability to provide real-time solutions to advertisers. we can do that on a local basis also. these are just not national solutions. you talk about podcasting, and we always talk about our big national podcast. we can provide local podcast and we do, which i don't think people focus on enough that appeal to that local commuter, that local advertiser. so again, when you take a step back, i think an objective we look at our asset base, an objective look at the way the economy is going to continue to come back, i don't think there's any company in america that's more prepared to receive that advertising demand than we are.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
and by the way, i would add one last point on that, which is that it's not only they want to reach one market and not another market, but they might have one message they want for one market and another message for another market. and again, having -- and the numbers actually, 160 markets we're in, that we have feet on the street in those markets. they're not affiliates. they're our owned markets. so we have the capability to activate in the markets. we have an ability to do special creative for those markets. we've had some examples in the past where we've made hundreds of different commercials for one single advertiser because they wanted slightly different messaging in each market. we have the capability to do that. so it puts us in a unique position to be able to have both the national reach and the local capabilities as well and we can even blend the two in ways and times like this that probably become more important than ever.
james charles goss -- barrington research associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. and one other thing in terms of the analysis of your cost structure and expense structure. do you think you're able, through this, to effectively lower the break-even plan such that, say, a year ago, your adjusted ebitda margin was 28.8% in the quarter as opposed to the loss you created this quarter. is that a number that can go higher with the cost structure adjustments on the mix of revenue changes that are going on?
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
look, again, jim, we're not going to go back. and i think that would be tantamount to giving guidance. and by the way, one thing i should say, clearly, bob and i and the rest of the team, mike mcguinness and everybody and kareem, we have the same frustration as you. we'd love to, quite frankly, give you -- we'd love to give you more information. we'd love to give you more detailed information. but for all the reasons i think everybody knows and understands, we haven't provided guidance. so it's much of a frustration on our standpoint as we know you guys have to go back and do your jobs and build models, but -- so it has been painful.
but the one thing i would say without making any specific comment is our objective here -- again, it's great shareholder value. that's going to include improving our operating margins. it's going to -- it's absolutely going to include improving our operating leverage with the cost savings that we announced and directionally, the cost savings that bob and i have talked about, i think, at length on this call from a directional standpoint. but we're not going to do any further than that today.
james charles goss -- barrington research associates, inc. -- analyst
[speech overlap] quarter. i was talking longer term.
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
no. i think -- so that's what i'm saying, longer term. we're absolutely going to improve the operating margin of this company. it's going to get better, but we're not going to give guidance. and again, i think if you keep that focus, which we are on a great track. just as a reminder, if you look at the track here alone, when we emerged from the restructuring for the second quarter of 2019 -- i'm sorry, the second half of the q2, q3, q4 2019, the beginning of 2020 before the pandemic hit, i think that's very tangible evidence of the potential of this company and bob and i was focused in terms of direction we're going to take the capital structure and value creation.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
and let me put a specific point out there, because i think your point is are these costs -- are the cost savings here, they're going to be permanent? the answer is yes. and some of what we're discovering here, we're never going to put back. i can't imagine our real estate costs are ever going to be what they were. i know our t&e is not going to be what it was. i know we're finding efficiencies and ways to do things we haven't found before. and mathematically, you're absolutely correct. if we lowered the cost bases of the company and we returned to the revenue levels we have before, mathematically, it will be a better margin.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the iheartmedia q2 2020 earnings call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference to your moderator, kareem chin, senior vice president of investor relations. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
kareem chin -- senior vice president and head of investor relations
good morning, everyone. thank you for taking the time to join us on our second quarter 2020 earnings call. joining me for today's discussion are bob pittman, our chairman and ceo; and rich bressler, the president, coo and cfo. at the conclusion of our prepared remarks, management will take your questions. please note that in addition to our press release, we have an accompanying investor presentation that you can follow along with our remarks.
before we begin, let me quickly cover the safe harbor language on slide two. during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including the current and expected impact of covid-19 on the company's liquidity, financial position and results of operations. these estimates are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could materially differ from these expectations and assumptions, and these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the sec.
in addition, as noted in our march 26, 2020 press release, due to the uncertainty surrounding the impact of covid-19, we reiterate that the company will not be providing full year 2020 guidance on this call. during this call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures can be found in our earnings release or in the presentation available on our website.
and now i'll turn the call over to bob.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, kareem, and good morning, everybody. thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. the challenges that we and most of the world have faced since march due to covid-19 were unprecedented and had a severe negative impact on our revenue through the sudden and dramatic decline in advertising demand in the quarter.
before rich and i get into a discussion of the specifics of the second quarter and even into the just completed month of july, there are four points we want to highlight. first, broadcast radio remains the number one reach medium in the us and our other audio platforms are also strong with consumers. by consumer reach, we're the number one audio company in america by a wide margin. the consumer reach of broadcast radio during the pandemic lockdown still exceeds both tv and digital. the only direct measurement of our listening, the listening on our digital platforms showed an overall increase year-over-year as well as an almost 20% increase on home ce devices, including smart tvs, gaming platforms and smart speakers. and our podcast listening was also up with a 62% increase in downloads year-over-year for q2. we believe this resilience in radio listening is further proof that the consumer depends on radio in times of need for both the information and the companionship that's at the core of the radio experience and is the inherent strength of broadcast radio as a consumer medium. and we believe the strength of our podcast listening is an indication that podcasting is providing a similar benefit and it's an extension of the radio listing experience. so it's no surprise that the two largest podcast publishers, iheart and npr, are both major broadcast radio companies, and we both have a 2:1 lead over the next largest publisher.
second, our revenue suffered with a big drop in april, but it's been showing improvement in each successive month, including the just closed july. it's still too early to predict the slope of the recovery with any certainty, but we're confident we have ample liquidity even if the recoveries are slow and extending through 2021. third, it's worthwhile to note that our non-broadcast consumer and revenue platforms, networks, smart audio programmatic, digital and podcasting, the ones that have been the focus of our company's efforts and investments had meaningfully better revenue performance than our broadcast revenue. we believe this is strong validation of our multi-platform strategy, investments and successes.
fourth and finally, we responded quickly to partially mitigate the impact of the sharp revenue declines, demonstrating flexibility even in our fixed cost structure. we have made deep cuts before the pandemic, deeper cuts at the beginning of the pandemic lockdown and even more after it became apparent this downturn was going to last longer than originally expected. many of these are permanent cuts, and we're evaluating additional permanent cuts based on how we expect to operate for the remainder of the pandemic and for our new normal thereafter. that includes an expected permanent reduction in real estate cost, a substantial reduction of travel and entertainment expenses, the elimination of the use of many outside consultants and the development of new technology-driven processes and operations to drive additional efficiencies.
but before we get into more detail, i want to take just a moment to soothe our employees. this is a tough time for everybody, and our employees have risen to the occasion to keep the company moving forward during this period. they've never worked harder. they've never been creative and innovative. they've never had to adapt so quickly to a major disruption, in this case, moving from an office to working from home. many of them have kids and have had to deal with issues like school and child care and many other factors. but in spite of all that, they continue to make progress on key initiatives, to build out new ideas, to serve our communities and service our clients. it's frustrating for them as it is for rich and me and all of you who are stakeholders in this company because they don't see this translate into financial success right now. however, as we look to the future, as we begin to see an upturn and look past this period, we know all the work they're doing now is setting the stage for accelerated growth.
and with that, i'd like to provide some real-time color around what we're seeing in our business. the challenges we face from covid-19 resulted in a decline in total company revenue of approximately 47% and an adjusted ebitda loss of $29.3 million in the second quarter. as i said, we have seen sequential improvement in the rate of revenue declines in each month since april, the low point, all the way through july. and q3 pacing is showing meaningful improvement over q2. however, even as the revenue trajectory improves each month, the speed of the return in advertising revenue is still uncertain. so we're prepared for a wide range of possibilities, even including a more drawn-out recovery scenario. and as rich will discuss in detail, we have proactively taken steps to fortify our balance sheet and our liquidity. we placed a premium on having a resilient capital structure with ample liquidity.
while this financial performance has been disappointing, there are some bright spots. as i mentioned earlier, our broadcast radio business was most hard hit with covid, with year-over-year revenue down 57% in the quarter. however, the other areas that we've chosen for strategic investments to drive growth, diversify our revenue base and give us a multi-platform offering, networks, smart audio programmatic, digital and podcasting, are proving to be the right ones. in contrast to broadcast, networks is down 38.4%; smart audio down 28%; and digital is up 2.4%, driven by podcasting, which is up over 100%.
and our relationship with consumers is stronger than ever, both because of our deep connection to the communities we serve and because we have prioritized being everywhere consumers want to find us with the products and services they expect. today, in addition to our am/fm platforms, consumers can find us on over 2,000 devices and 250 platforms, from pcs and smartphones to smart speakers like alexa and google home, smart tvs, sonos, roku, gaming consoles and even apple tv. and we were the first streaming audio service on the comcast xfinity x1 box. our leadership position on devices has ensured that we have more touch points than ever with the consumers since they shifted their lives more into the home in late march, giving us a uniquely strong position to participate in this increased at-home listening.
from a consumer engagement perspective, since the pandemic began, listening on the web is up 19%; gaming console is up 25%; and smart tvs are up 13%. even in july, as things showed signs of returning closer to normal, digital listening on home devices is still up. and our hope and expectation is that after patterns go back to pre-covid levels, we'll continue to benefit in-home from consumers having to learn to find and use our products on additional in-home devices.
our strongest-performing new business is podcasting. and we have built iheart into the number one commercial podcast publisher with a goal of leadership in listeners, revenue and earnings. and that strength in podcasting highlights how the decisions we have made are paying off. today, iheart is the number one commercial podcast company in america. and our podcast division, which is part of our digital business, continues to grow at a rapid pace with revenue outstripping even audience growth. with almost 500 premium titles and 225 million downloads a month, we partnered with the very best creators in the world, distribute their content to the largest audience as possible, backed up by the massive marketing power of our broadcast radio assets, which gives us a huge amplifier for every new podcast title we release, and then we monetize it in the hands of the largest and best audio sales team in america.
and as you try to understand the disparate podcasting models, let me explain our view of the current landscape. there are really two different approaches out there; one, paywalling exclusive content on a single app. good for the app, not good with the listeners because they now have to pay for content that was previously free. not good for creators because their audience and impact will be small. and not good for sponsors because there is insufficient scale in exclusive distribution. ours is the opposite model and, we think, better model. wide distribution, so listeners find the content they want, where they want. creators build the largest audience size possible, and sponsors can scale their messages across these large audiences.
looking at the listing as measured by podtrac and the associated revenue and earnings, the latter strategy is working and we have yet to see an example of success anyone has had with the paywalling strategy in podcasting. as i mentioned earlier, our new platforms we've built and invested in have performed better than our broadcast platform, validating our multi-platform strategy. we even reimagined our events business. even though it's down dramatically overall, we've been able to build successful virtual events, including the iheartradio living room concert for america on fox hosted by elton john, wednesday night living room concerts with state farm and commencement: speeches for the class of 2020, which were delivered on both podcasting and over our 850 radio stations nationwide. this has allowed us to generate sponsorship revenue even though we had to forgo the lower margin ticketing revenue from physical events.
as a company, we innovate. and in times like this, we can't forget that we must continue to follow the consumer and build products and services that keep us in the forefront of media. to that point, we've not only made significant investments in our podcasting business, which has seen record growth, we've also seen the same with our iheartradio app and even developed an entirely new broadcast and digital network, bin: black information network, which is the first and only 24/7 national and local all-news audio service dedicated to providing a trusted source of continual news coverage with a black voice and perspective and is focused on service to the black community and providing an information window for those outside the community to help foster communication, accountability and a deeper understanding. all of this is enabled by the fact that we have a reach larger than any other media company in america.
we are the number one audio company in america by reach, and we also have leading engagement as well. in fact, our listeners spend 30 minutes a day with us, more than google at 27 minutes per day and facebook at 18 minutes per day. we serve our communities first and foremost. and from that, we derive our power. we track consumer sentiment on a continuing basis, which allows us to respond quickly to any sudden change. for example, during the protest in support of racial and social justice and communities across america, we responded quickly as a company to foster understanding with our personalities taking a leading role in the discussions so critical to bringing the country together. over-time, being there for consumers, communities and society make us even more important to consumers going forward.
as we navigate the financial impact that the pandemic has had on our business, we're working hard to make sure iheart is positioned to capitalize on the ongoing recovery in the ad market. even though we're already taking $250 million out of operating expenses in 2020 with further savings from variable cost, we're taking a hard and fresh look at our cost structure to understand what we've learned from this period, they can have a positive and lasting impact on the cost structure of our company, from the utilization of real estate to our adoption of technology to provide us with more efficiency and effectiveness in our operations. this will give us an even stronger operating margin profile as the economy recovers. this crisis has challenged us to think opportunistically about our operations and there will be more to come on this front as we develop new ideas and practices.
rich will take you through the details of our q2 performance, but i wanted to leave you with these points: we wish we had better news on the financial front. but we are encouraged that revenue is improving sequentially and expect that trend to continue into the fall and the end of the year. the downturn has been a little longer and the pandemic has been a little more persistent than most predicted. and although it's been hard, we are seeing a more normal advertising demand starting to come back. the current dislocation between our listening and revenue is a temporary state as we know eventually advertising reflects consumer usage and demand, and we do have strong consumer demand.
we continue to be very disciplined about spending and continuing to reduce costs to mitigate as much of the revenue impact as we can. and finally, we remain extremely focused on making sure that we have ample liquidity to not only ride-out this downturn but to continue to fuel the higher growth parts of our business.
and with that, i'll turn it over to rich.
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
thanks, bob. as you're all aware, our second quarter results reflect a severe impact that covid has had on advertising demand. the pandemic caused a significant economic downturn, which in april, resulted in the steepest year-over-year revenue declines we have witnessed, with modest sequential improvement in each of the months that followed as reopenings in certain markets were delayed due to resurgent covid cases and protests related to civil unrest in many parts of the country.
as we look ahead, it's important to remember the power of audio before covid began, when we were in a healthy business environment. that power translated into the strong financial results that we saw in our business after we emerged from our restructuring in may of last year, all the way through february of this year before our momentum was interrupted. and while we can't predict how fast or what shape the economic return will take, we know that it will come back from this period of dislocation and we have to have the right set of products and services in place, and the users of those services to take full advantage and benefit from it in ways that we were prepared to in the past.
as bob mentioned, our strategy over the last several years has been focused on developing and investing in our multiple platforms, sales infrastructure and data and analytics capabilities to continually strengthen our position as the number one audio company in the united states by reach. we believe that the diversified offering we have today, combined with our focus on cost and capital structure management enables our business to be more resilient during this downturn and positions us favorably to capitalize on the continuing advertising recovery.
in terms of our second quarter results, if you turn to slide six of our investor deck, on a reported basis, our consolidated revenue decreased by 46.6% over the prior year period. direct operating expenses decreased 15.9%, driven primarily by cost reductions associated with our modernization initiatives as well as those taken in response to covid-19. in addition, variable operating expenses, including music license and performance royalty fees, decreased in relation to lower revenue recognized during the period. variable expenses related to events also decreased as a result of the postponement or cancellation of physical events. sg&a expenses decreased 19%, driven by cost reduction initiatives along with lower sales commissions, which were impacted by the decrease in revenue. trade and barter expenses also decreased. the decrease in sg&a expenses was partially offset by higher bad debt expense. corporate expenses decreased 36.1% during the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter as a result of lower employee compensation, including variable incentive expenses and employee benefits resulting from expense reduction initiatives.
our gaap operating loss of $159.1 million for the second quarter compared to the gaap operating income of $181.6 million in the prior year quarter as well as the year-over-year decline in adjusted ebitda from $262.9 million to a loss of $29.3 million were driven by lower revenue.
turning to slide eight. i will provide additional color on the performance of our revenue streams. in our broadcast business, revenue declined by 56.5% on a reported basis, while networks declined by 38.4% year-over-year. our digital revenue stream grew by 2.4% driven by continued growth in podcasting, which increased 102.7% year-over-year. audio and media services declined by 32.9% on a reported basis and by 36.3%, excluding the impact of political revenue. sponsorship and event revenues decreased by $27.6 million compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of the postponement or cancellation of physical events.
turning back to our consolidated results and looking at the items below the line. interest expense increased $12.7 million compared to the same period of 2019 as a result of the interest incurred on our new debt issued upon our emergence from chapter 11 on may 1st, 2019.
on slide 11, there is a summary of our balance sheet. at quarter-end, we had approximately $5.3 billion of net debt outstanding, which includes a cash balance of approximately $517.7 million. despite what has been the most challenging quarter we could imagine, our free cash flow used in continuing operations was only a negative $6.5 million. as a reminder, we took early actions to focus on aggressive cost management and maximizing liquidity to be prepared for a potential protracted recovery. and in a quarter like this, the fact that we used only $6.5 million is one more proof point of our company's strong free cash flow characteristics.
as bob noted, we continue to focus on maximizing liquidity and strengthening our capital structure during this period of uncertainty. in july, we completed an amendment to our credit facility to issue $450 million of incremental term loan. the proceeds we used to repay the remaining balance outstanding under our abl facility of $235 million with the balance going to cash on our balance sheet. adjusted for that amendment, our cash balance as of june 30, 2020, was approximately $708 million. and following the repayment of the balance on our abl facility, we had total available liquidity of approximately $868 million. as a reminder, the terms of our debt structure include no material maintenance covenants and there are no material debt maturities prior to 2026, providing significant structural resilience in the current uncertain macro environment.
as we look forward to the rest of 2020, we expect that revenue will remain challenged given the impact that covid-19 continues to have on the macroeconomic and advertising environment. however, we are cautiously optimistic, and we have seen an improvement in the rate of year-over-year revenue declines in each month since the 50% decline in april, with may, june and july declining 49%, 41% and 27%, respectively. while we will not be providing pacing for q3 or full year guidance, we can tell you that q3 is shaping up to be materially better than q2 and remind you that the bulk of political advertising is placed in q3 and q4.
i also want to provide an update on the modernization and cost-saving initiatives that we announced earlier in the year. together, these initiatives remain on-track to deliver the expected $250 million of expense savings in 2020. as we have said previously, we expect our modernization initiatives to deliver $100 million of annualized run rate savings by mid-2021. in addition to those savings, we are continuing to evaluate our cost structure to identify efficiencies [indecipherable] lasting benefits to the company and will drive stronger margin growth as the economy recovers. our areas of focus will include continued optimization of our real estate footprint and the adoption of technology solutions that will drive increased efficiency and effectiveness in our operations. we will provide more details on that amount and timing of those savings later in the year.
our full year capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at approximately $75 million to $95 million and we continue to expect minimal cash taxes as certain provisions of the cares act should partially offset the negative impact that covid-19 is having on our 2020 free cash flow. as a reminder, the provisions of the act that pertain to us result in our ability to deduct 100% of our 2020 interest expense as well as a portion of interest from prior years that was disallowed and the deferral and potential avoidance due to certain credits we may qualify for of 2020 payroll tax payments.
in wrapping up, we believe that our previously announced modernization initiatives and cost-saving actions, in combination with our resilient capital structure will provide us both financial flexibility and ample liquidity to operate effectively even in an extended period of economic weakness. while we cannot predict the shape or timing of the recovery in advertising demand, we are confident in our ability to drive shareholder value through operational discipline and continued investment in the areas of our businesses that will position us for growth as advertising demand continues to return.
and again, we would like to thank our employees who have been committed to serving our listeners, our communities and our business partners during this challenging time. we appreciate you all joining our second quarter earnings call.
and we will now turn it over to the operator to take your questions. thank you.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of jessica reif ehrlich of bank of america. your line is open.
jessica reif ehrlich -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. you guys talked a lot about the cost savings and the continued benefits from that. you've been streamlining. how are you thinking about opportunities to invest in growth as you continue on this path of recovery? and all the news lately has been really good news. so, hopefully sequential -- we'll see sequential improvement. but how do you think about the size investments in growth in areas like podcasting versus like deleveraging the balance sheet? so, it seems like you'll have great operating leverage.
and then, secondly, can you just talk a little bit about the -- you mentioned, and it's in the press release, the agreement with pushkin industries is to distribute and monetize content. is this something that we should expect more of? can you talk about the economics of a deal like this? how it's structured? what are the benefits to co-producing shows? how does it affect you producing your own podcasts? thanks.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. let me -- jessica, let me start with the second one and i'll let rich jump in on the first part of that. i think, on the agreement, we announced today with one of the major podcasters pushkin industries, which is malcolm gladwell and jacob weisberg who were the founders. i think that what we've got and it gets into this whole area about the talent wars and podcasting is, we probably have the best weapon anyone does, which is we have the biggest platform. and if you've got a podcast or you think you're going to have a big podcast, you really want it on the biggest platform. you want to be able to use the power we've got of our radio promotional platform behind it and we've got the largest sales force in audio and podcasting to maximize monetization.
so as opposed to us having to go buy people, we're able to offer them something that's very healthy, which is an opportunity to have the biggest return on their investment -- creative investment and dollar investment by joining our platform. and i think, if you look at the podcast we have today, we make some completely ourselves with absolutely no private participants. we have some like -- this is like doing television show or movies. we have some that have small private participation, some that are larger, some that we do in partnerships, some we co-produce and it's the full range of it. but for us, we're very cognizant of profitability and we're very cognizant of margin. and we want to make sure we keep our podcast margin higher than the overall margin of the company so this indeed is a growth business in every way.
rich, do you want to add to that?
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, bob. and jess, thanks for the questions. just -- i mean, just one thing i'll end with one on -- bob has pointed out podcast, and maybe i'll [phonetic] point on cost. as bob noted in his opening remarks, the people not just pushkin, so you kind of look back at facts as opposed to what people say to reiterate bob's points factually whether it was [indecipherable] that we all know about hillary clinton or bobby brown or charlamagne and committing tests for black effect's network, which is our partnership with charlamagne, enrique santos that bob talked about in his remarks.
so, everybody could say a lot of words, but i think the proof is in the facts about people that are both committed to us and recommitted to us because of our asset base and the ability for both of us to make money in partnership with all of our talent.
on the cost side, again, we highlighted in the opening remarks and i think i highlighted in my remarks that we expect a substantial piece of the cost savings that we announced this year, the $215 million to be permanent. i'm not going to give you an exact number on that because i would really be tantamount to giving guidance and we're not giving guidance out for the rest of this year.
other than bob's comments, there he talked about on revenue for q4 or going into next year. but i think like a lot of companies in america we've learned to be honestly just wildly more efficient as we've been in the past. and i'd say, we all as a management team, bob, myself or mike mcguinness on this call with the rest of our leadership. and by the way also in podcasting and on the investment front, again, i would just point to the facts over the last couple of years if you look at the investment that we just announced and bob highlighted in his remarks, if you look at jelly that we did about a year and a half ago or a little longer than that, which again, as a reminder, was the foundation that makes our broadcast inventory look like digital and give us a foundation of a lot of the technology advancement.
if you look at stuffworks, each of those investments were not significant to the company's overall capital structure. bob mentioned in his remarks about fox assumed about $50 million -- approximately $50 million in total. we owned a small piece of the company before. the jelli and stuffworks to that, like all three in total, or maybe are may be $150 million approximately. but i think the key is that they all make the rest of the iheart base that much more valuable in terms of the ability to generate ebitda and most importantly to generate free cash flow.
and just the final thing i'll add is that i think also the highlight if you look at our free cash flow in the investor deck, i could get handle [phonetic] on pages on toward the end. but even in the toughest operating environment, any of us who've ever seen, we've generated approximately $75 million, $77 million of operating free cash flow this year. so i think that just reiterates whatever environment we're in, the real great free cash flow generation ability of this company.
jessica reif ehrlich -- bank of america -- analyst
okay.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey. i have one little thing to it too is that i think going to your point, jessica, when we look at our future and where our growth opportunities are, we look at the pieces that are necessary to make it happen. and we look at do we make, buy a partner. and when we buy, we want to buy efficiently. we try and buy something that has what we need but that can benefit from what we can add so that we don't have to pay outrageous prices for. we're able to buy the piece and then we add a lot of value by putting our scale to it. and i think you've seen us do that as rich mentioned with jelli, you've seen this do that with stuff media, where we bought less than 5 million unique users. today, i think our podcast number is over 27 million. so we've really added 22 million on top of the 5 million organically. and those are the kinds of acquisitions we go for once that we think we get enormous leverage out of. and that we think are the most efficient way and the most effective way to get the value creation as opposed to making it ourselves or partnering for it.
jessica reif ehrlich -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from line steven cahall from wells fargo. your line is open.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks. just wanted to dive a little more into podcasting. so maybe first, where does the inventory for voxnest primarily come from? and we've seen some similar ad-tech investments from siriusxm and from spotify. and i was just wondering if you think about that as competition at this point or is it kind of everybody growing the pie and getting advertisers to commit more funding to this. so is it is it a market share battle or is it kind of good for the whole industry right now as everyone invests in ad-tech?
mike mcguinness -- executive vice president, deputy chief financial officer and head of investor relations
we're seeing a huge expansion of the pie. so, i think, for the foreseeable future, we're all benefiting from a growing marketplace. i think, when you look at voxnest, what it really allows us to do in simple terms is have an electronic trading platform for our non-premium inventory. we've done extraordinarily well selling the big premium inventory for our very high profile big podcast we have. but there's always a piece of it that remains unsold, that's not premium inventory in the sense of what podcasting will get on the premium level. and so by putting an electronic platform together, being able to combine that with data, being able to combine these fragmented podcasts marketplaces that are out there and being able to deliver it as a real time bidding platform, i think, give us a tremendous way to add additional value to what we already have and becomes important to us. and then there is some secondary benefits. there's some tools, there's some ad serving capabilities, etc. but i think the marketplace in going after any unsold inventory or getting more efficient with unsold inventory is a great way to, to help the bottom-line of the company and the top-line.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks. and then, on ad sales, i was wondering if you could maybe give us what political ad sale dollars were in q3 and maybe also in q4? and just as we think about the core trend, is it possible for you to help us think about how core advertising is improving, excluding what the impact of political might be since that can shift it around on those months pacing that you gave?
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. rich, you want to hit that?
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
sure, sure. so, first of all, we've said, in terms of political, this would be by far the biggest political year that we've ever had. and just as a reminder, we also benefited not just from the core of the iheart business but we also benefited from the fact that we have cash. remember cash [phonetic], tv rep business is one of the largest tv rep firms out there. but if you look at it, we were -- in q3 political revenue, we were approximately about $40 million. october was up you know also and we're about $55 million in october. and then as you look forward, we'll continue to benefit from political, but i'd say november much less to an extent than we did in october. but we'll still get some significant benefits there in total.
but just to be clear, so $40 million in october was $55 million and then we'll get some benefit in november, which will be less than october out there. and then, we continue to see, as bob i think pointed out in his remarks, maybe just as a reminder we're dealing all the same inventory here so clearly we're getting a benefit from political, we're getting a benefit both within the company and the type of the inventory in the advertising market. and then, we talk about [indecipherable] going forward in terms of the value is the guidance we gave for q4. we'd be low to mid-teens digit down in revenue but we continue to expect to see sequential improvement in q4 compared to q3 even as we leave the benefits of political as we talk to that.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. let me just add to it to be clear. without political, we still have seen the sequential improvement of ad revenue, which i think you were asking?
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah, great. that's perfect. and then, last one for me. rich, you have the cash tax benefit this year, which you called out. as we just think about how you might convert adjusted ebitda into cash flow next year? anything else i mean you talked about maybe some capex stepping up and you'll, i guess, become a full cash taxpayer. anything else we should be thinking about in terms of your cash generation?
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. i mean, look, again, we haven't given a guidance but i would, as you go through the 10-q, and again none of us know what the tax landscape is. we can't speculate, but another thing which we would have been able to speculate but none of us don't know what the tax landscape may or may not look like there's really any changes. but just as a reminder, as everybody kind of goes through the 10-q today, we sell some pretty significant tax attributes starting with nol -- nols, excuse me, that we can utilize for the company going forward, obviously including 2021. and so, the bottom line is, just going back to what i said earlier, the attributes of this company on the ability to generate free cash flow, i think we've demonstrated this year and we expect to continue to demonstrate going forward.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of john janedis from wolfe research. your line is open.
john janedis -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks. maybe a quick follow-up to steve's question on podcasting. you talked about the ebitda margins of modernization along with voxnest. given the current margins and cost of the content, is there meaningful upside on the margin front in podcasting from here? and i think you alluded to this a little bit, but from an advertising perspective is that bucket of money coming from a different part of the client budget away from traditional broadcast? thanks.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, the good news about podcast is, it is sort of the shiny new thing. and i -- look, i'm an old guy, so i go back all the way doing cable networks came about. and what's interesting is, every time there has been a big economic downturn, the advertiser decided to take a chance on something new. in good times, when you say, hey, i've got a great new idea of these cable networks, they say, sounds great, but my business is doing well, i don't want to rock the boat. when things are not so great, they say, ok, i'll try that new thing.
if you look in the recession of '88, that was really the time at which the advertisers began to give cable networks a shot. you saw a big upturn in revenue there in the later '90s. you saw in '97, the downturn there. you saw them give a chance to the internet -- internet advertising, the turn of the new century, we saw search emerge. in '08, '09, we saw social emerge. and we're seeing podcasting is that now.
and what's interesting to us that we really love about podcasting is, we're bringing some advertisers into podcasting who are not major advertisers and anything to audio much less just radio. and they are pulling the money from wherever they pull it from, presumably tv or digital budgets. i think it's probably more lined with digital budgets in their minds. and they are making this a priority spend and then things fall behind podcasting. all really good news for us. and i see no signs of that abating. if anything, i think it is increasing. what it also does is, it's one more door to get people to do business in audio. we've had some advertisers that have started in podcasting and then decided they wanted to use -- they liked it and want to use some radio too at first associated with a podcast, second to just say, i like the way it works, i'm getting an understanding of audio and the impact it can have. and so we spread them across our other assets.
so, if we think about all of our platforms as separate doors to bring advertisers in, by the way, we've brought some major advertisers into the company initially through events, that did not think they wanted to buy a radio, didn't think they want to buy audio, they just wanted to be associated with an event and eventually became huge advertisers on radio as well. so, we see podcasting as that and probably stronger than we've seen with any other platform. so we're very encouraged by that.
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
hey, bob. and if i could just add one thing. i just want to maybe just come back on one point back to maybe each of the three questions so far on bob's point. i think, reinforcing our view, so you have another you view, i think it's objective third party view is the point that bob made when we made the announcement today with malcolm -- with malcolm gladwell and all the other podcasts that we name and not to repeat them. we don't know that factually, but you could assume with each of these individuals or teams, i chose to come with iheart or have many, many, many other choices. and where there were choices, they go behind. the payroll, other very appealing financial characteristics that maybe have more appealing guarantees, again, not knowing anything on each of the ones we named obviously chose to come with us. and they chose to come with us for all the attributes that bob said. so i just think it's another validation and confirmation not just in the medium but iheart's place in that medium as in the mergers.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
and rich, i think going to that point -- to hit it head on, we've got the number one platform. and so, we don't think we have a need to and we don't intend to go buy share. we're looking for everything we do, we're looking to be profitable, we're looking to be a nice profit contributor, we put it through a pretty tough screen of economics for us. now, presumably using our platform and our monetization engine, we probably can get more revenue out of any podcast than we think anyone else can. so it gives us the ability to perhaps reach a little farther just like with air talent, we have the ability to spread talent across multiple markets or to put them in a situation where they have a bigger platform. therefore, the economics are better for them and better for us. so we see that in podcasting and we are so far have been successful with that. we continue to -- the deals we've done has helped people build hits, which by the way the more people we help build hits the more people want to come to this platform for us to build them they're hit.
john janedis -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's helpful. and rich, maybe a quick one. the release mentioned potential reduction in real estate footprint. i'm wondering if that includes potential asset sales?
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
no, look, let me take one step back. so we have nothing -- there's nothing that's planned in terms of any asset sales. i think, we are not -- i think, we do have one job in this company. and you've heard bob and i say it time and time again, which is to focus on driving the equity value of this company, driving the value for our stakeholders. so we're constantly challenging ourselves as to what the right asset base is today. i think bob hit it head on and put a very fine point on it. we don't -- when you reach 93% of americans, when you look at all of our staffs whether it's podcast or digital or all of our attributes, we don't see need to add anything. and at the same time, as you go back over the last couple of years period of time, right down to the towers sale leaseback we did a couple of years ago, we're saying, gee, what's the best financial transaction to do that gives us and maintains our strategic footprint, drives ebitda but constantly keeps this unique asset base together in terms of size and scale and reach and uniqueness? so, i don't see that's a little bit of a long winded answer, but it combines both -- but the filter that we have, i think bob's used the term filter a number of different times, whether it's capital allocation, however, you think about the term filter, sales are in that same filter. but i don't see anything out there today that's going to come out to the market for us.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
let me also talk about real estate. rich, if i could just hit the real estate point here.
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
sure.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think that when we said it before, i just want to say it again that we've learned a lot through covid. and our people, if you think about it, they've had 10 years of technology learning in three or four months. and as a result, we envision operating differently in terms of how we operate our space. i think they're going to be -- although i think everyone will probably come to the office some, i don't think we're going to have the need for the same amount of space even with the same number of employees, understanding that some people can get a lot more of their work done outside the office and don't have to be in the office 100% of the time. and how they work and where they want to work in the office is also changed as a result of covid. and i think we're taking that into account and we're going to move aggressively on downsizing our footprint to accommodate that.
john janedis -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of jim goss from barrington research. your line is open.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
thanks. in terms of downsizing your footprint, how do you think? because that involves station sales, for example, makes you [indecipherable] to be in some of the smallest markets, for example?
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
let me hit that head on. when i said footprint, i mean, in each location, we'll make do with less space than we have. we have no intention of walking away from any of our locations. and i think you see one of the real strategic values of this company that makes it different from everybody else is how many locations we're in. we're in 160 markets with owned stations. there's no one in america that comes close to that radio or tv.
and having that kind of distribution and that kind of control lets us offer things to advertisers no one else can. it lets us develop these -- the value of scale. and indeed you saw it in this political season is, if we're everywhere and we're at this kind of footprint, no matter what states are hotter, cities are hot, we've probably got a product there to take advantage of it. so we like that. we think it's one of our strengths. we don't see a need or a value in reducing that because we think that's one of our strongest strategic differentiators. i mean, in radio, we're the only radio player that really offers national coverage with our own stations, in addition to our networks. and i think that makes us very unique.
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. and bob, john -- jim, if you wouldn't mind me, just adding one thing to what bob just covered.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
yeah.
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
i think, if you actually go back to bob's opening remarks, there were four points that are highlighting this company about our future about the growth strategy. one of those points was modernization. and we said end related cost savings, so it's a lot more than just cost savings. it's also developing the studios in the future that we've talked about utilizing cloud-based technology and really taking advantage of ai, as bob noted. these number of years of investment and the experience of our team that really helps us maximize the performance not just on advertising front but quite frankly on a listener front, on a programming front each of our markets. and we've created centers of excellence across the organizations that really consolidate key resources for the whole company to take advantage of increasing quality and prudent cost -- and prudent service, i'm sorry. cost reduction happens to be a benefit of that and a byproduct of that. but we are improving our quality and service at the same time for our listeners. and so, i don't think, bob and i really need to emphasize that when we talk about footprint and efficiencies, it really is on both sides.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
and rich, if i can just add to that because i think that's an important point that we should make sure to get out is, we talked about how many markets we're number one in. and i think the reason we have that kind of audience advantage is because of the quality of the programming we do. and we've made great investments in tools to help our programmers. and one of the things we have today is, i think we have -- if my memory serves me correct, something like 3,000 data inputs into music selection, music balance, understanding how the flow goes. at that level of data inputs, a human mind can't absorb it but ai can. so we've built ai over time that can assist the people making those choices so they can make higher quality choices. and those kinds of things we've been building over the years are, i think, paying dividends and you can see it in the performance of the company. and we continue -- so, yes, it will to save money, yes it will make us more efficient, but i think primarily it will make us better.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
i was thinking of asking whether you were doing any additional multicasting using the top tier talent that you have. but now i'm wondering if -- with the ai that you've mentioned, i think, in past calls, if instead you might look at spot loads and maybe have fewer or perhaps more expensive ones and try to address a revenue situation that way, maybe not just now but going forward as the economy begins to improve hopefully with the new vaccine?
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, look, we look at everything. and i will say though, we have not found spot loads to be an issue since the cassette player went into the card decades ago. radio has not been the place you go if you want no commercials. radio has been the place you go if you want companionship and you want to find out what's going on in the world.
and i actually think that if you've ever listened to a radio station with no commercials on it, you feel a little lost because those commercials actually tell you an awful lot about what's going on that people are not coming to us for music for the primary goal because probably 25% of our stations don't even play music, they come to us for companionship. we're keeping people company. and what do people do when they have a relationship? they often play music for each other. so that's the reason we play music. we talk about it a lot. we have the people on the air who make it to talk about it. and part of our mix are commercial. so, again, that's not a problem we're trying to solve for. we're trying to make sure that when people tune to us that they indeed are engaged. they bond with us and it becomes a habit for them.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. maybe lastly, with this more optimistic look at a potential vaccine or multiple vaccines, what impact do you think that would have and maybe trends accelerating anything with your business model?
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, it's a really good question and one we've been talking a lot about before today and certainly today that i think the vaccine is certainly encouraging news for society but certainly for our business too. there have been harder hit categories, which haven't come back much. from q2 to q3, a lot of our growth came from categories that were down a lot in q2 and are just beginning to come back, like food and beverage, auto, restaurants, retail. but if we get a vaccine, we can see the return of some big spenders like movies, concerts, some of the retail that has not come back so much, local businesses like the local restaurants. so, we think it's -- it has a tremendous -- can have a tremendous impact on our business and are watching it carefully.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
all right. thank you very much.
operator
thank you.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
we have time for one more question, operator.
operator
yes. one moment please. unfortunately we do not have any further questions at this time. i turn the call back over to rich bressler.
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
well, first of all, i want to thank everybody on behalf of all of us for taking the time today. thank you for listening to the iheart story. one thing i will just add in closing is that because i know for the last couple of years when bob and i have met and talked to a lot of you, we had constantly gotten the question about when we were going to get approval from the fcc and i know it was in our press release and in my opening remarks. but i just want to reiterate that the fcc has approved the ability for our warrant holders to convert into class a. there's a process they need to go through, which is on the website. we don't need to go through right here. but it's a fairly automatic process that will allow people to convert in the beginning of january, which will double -- approximately double the public float of our market capitalization out there.
so, again, that's been, i think, at least some period of time closer to the number one question we've gotten from people. so i just wanted to proactively reiterate that before we close. and thank you everybody, again.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the iheartmedia q3 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mike mcguinness, deputy cfo and head of investor relations. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
mike mcguinness -- executive vice president, deputy chief financial officer and head of investor relations
good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our third quarter 2020 earnings call. joining me for today's discussion are bob pittman, our chairman and ceo; and rich bressler, our president, coo and cfo. at the conclusion of our prepared remarks, management will take your questions. please note that in addition to our press release, we have an investor presentation that you can use to follow along with our remarks.
before we begin, let me quickly cover the safe harbor statement on slide 2. during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including the current and expected impacts of covid-19 on the company's liquidity, financial position and results of operations. these estimates are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could materially differ from these expectations and assumptions. and these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the sec. in addition, as noted in our march 26, 2020 press release, due to the uncertainty surrounding the impact of covid-19, we reiterate that the company will not be providing full year 2020 financial guidance on this call.
during this call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures can be found in our earnings release or in the investor presentation available on our website.
and now, i'll turn the call over to bob.
bob pittman -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mike, and good afternoon, everybody. thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. i'd like to start by recognizing our employees who continued their strong performance despite what is the most challenging environment any of us have ever encountered. despite these challenges, our employees continue to make great strides across the organization moving key initiatives forward, building out new products, testing new ideas and serving our communities and our clients.
we've developed plans in accordance with the most up-to-date safety guidelines to open each of our markets when their individual local safety criteria are met. and in fact, approximately half of our 160 markets have returned to the office and we expect more to open in the coming months. and it's encouraging to see that on average, in q3, markets whose offices are open are performing about 600 basis points better than markets that are not, providing us with even more confidence in our post-covid growth opportunities.
i want to mention a few headlines before i get into the third quarter results. one, we're pleased that revenue continues to recover and improve sequentially. while revenue in the third quarter remain below prior year, it substantially improved when compared to the second quarter and continues to improve sequentially month over month.
two, we feel our results this quarter clearly validate the value of our multi-platform product and revenue strategy and the investments we've made in our growth areas. our revenue is now split approximately 50% broadcast revenue and 50% other revenue lines. these other revenue lines, which include digital and podcasting and networks, all of which are businesses that have been the focal point of our growth efforts, have meaningfully better revenue performance than our broadcast segment. for example, digital grew 17% year-over-year and was still up 8%, excluding the impact of podcasting, which grew 74%. additionally, smartaudio, which is a part of our broadcast revenue line, also had superior revenue performance, down just 12% year-over-year, better than the entire broadcast line, which was down 29% year-over-year, again more validation of the transformation and modernization of this company and our growth potential.
three, even in an economic downturn, we continue to invest in our strategic goals, like podcasting, to accelerate growth. for example, in october, we completed the strategic acquisition of voxnest for approximately $50 million. we believe this addition will be another driver for increased monetization of our podcast business and that it will strengthen our position as the number one podcast company as measured by podtrac.
also, we continue to attract and collaborate with leading creators and creative talents, including the just announced partnership with malcolm gladwell's pushkin industries; the black effect podcast network, which we created with one of our leading personalities, charlamagne tha god' a new latino podcast network led by our own enrique santos, 13 days of halloween, produced in partnership with blumhouse and aaron mahnke; hillary clinton's you and me both, and much more coming from our growing partnerships with will ferrell, alec baldwin, shonda rhimes, tenderfoot tv and others. i know many of you were interested in our podcast business and i will talk in greater detail about more exciting developments there in a few minutes.
four, an important component of our growth strategy is modernization and the related cost savings. we continue to lead the industry in how advertising is bought and sold. we've also developed the studio of the future utilizing cloud-based technology and ai that helps us maximize the performance of each market. and we have created centers of excellence across the organization that consolidate key resources for the whole company into one location, all this increasing quality, improving service and significantly reducing cost.
and with that, i'll turn to a few specifics of how this business performed in the third quarter.
i'm pleased to report that we've seen strong signs of revenue recovery with q3 revenue improving significantly compared to q2 revenue with each month through october improving on a sequential basis. while q3 revenue of $744 million increased 53% over q2, q3 revenue was down 22% year-over-year due to the challenges that we and most of the world continue to face as a result of the macroeconomic impact of covid-19. we're seeing encouraging signs across our markets in a multiple revenue streams that indicate that recovery of our business is gaining traction. since our low point of $137 million of revenue in april, monthly revenue has more than doubled in september, increasing to $291 million.
looking to q4 revenue performance, october increased 2% year-over-year, benefiting from a very strong political advertising cycle as well as a stronger business environment. while we don't believe that october results will be representative of q4 as a whole due to the heavy political spending in the month, we do expect q4 revenue results do better than q3 and to be a continuation of the improving revenue trends. rich will speak to these monthly trends in greater detail during his prepared remarks, but based on what we see now we expect q4 revenue to be down in the low to mid-teens.
let me start with political revenue. this year has been our best year on record and compared to the last presidential election in 2016 we expect political revenue to be up 67% for the full year. if you compare our total revenues for the company for the just closed month of october, which again were up 2% to the performance of our markets in battleground states such as michigan, florida and wisconsin, you can see how strong the political impact was with those markets up 25%, 14% and 12% in total revenue respectively while there was clearly unevenness in the political spend by geography, our results demonstrate the value of a broad distribution of markets. it positions us well to take advantage of geographically isolated trends in political spending.
we remain committed to serving our diverse advertising partners with our barbell approach. on one end, we operate as high touch marketing partners helping advertisers to craft and deliver a message to the customers. and on the other end, we offer products that allow our advertisers to get to market quickly using our data, targeting and technology capabilities. we also continue to benefit from the diversity of our advertising base with no category making up more than 5% of our total revenue and no single advertiser making up more than 2% of our total revenue.
turning to adjusted ebitda and liquidity. after reporting a small loss in the second quarter, we're pleased to report that we've returned to profitability in the third quarter generating adjusted ebitda of $162 million, a $191 million improvement over the loss of $29 million in the second quarter and positive free cash flows of $14 million, a $21 million improvement over negative $7 million in the second quarter. even as the revenue trajectory improves each month, i will note that the speed of the recovery in advertising revenue is still uncertain and unpredictable.
with that in mind and out of an abundance of caution, we remain prepared for a wide range of possibilities through year end and beyond, including a more drawn out recovery scenario. as rich will discuss in detail, we've proactively taken steps to reduce cost, to fortify our balance sheet and to preserve liquidity. one of the great things about this company is its strong free cash flow generation characteristics.
the foundation of our company is our unparalleled scale. our business model has always been to build engaged consumer relationships by providing the best audio content by having the most trusted personalities and by offering always available companionship to our consumers. we then monetize those relationships across each of our multi-platform products and services. indeed, behind our return to profitability, our positive free cash flow and our steady progression toward full revenue recovery is the fact that we have a uniquely powerful media platform anchored on our broadcast radio business that we have successfully used as the foundation to build our other platforms.
our broadcast radio business has the largest reach of any audio company in the country and now extends across more than 250 platforms and 2,000 devices. according to nielsen, we're ranked the number one broadcast company in 97 markets in the 18 to 49 audience and we're ranked number one in 30 of nielsen's top 50 metros. in both cases, we have about 3 times more number one markets than our nearest competitor.
in terms of consumer reach, broadcast radio remains the largest medium in the us. and iheart has the largest broadcast audience in the country by a lot. we are twice the size of the next largest company in broadcast listening and 5 times their size in digital listening. this scale also gives us the biggest platform to attract the best on air talent including, ryan seacrest, charlamagne tha god, dj envy and angela yee of the breakfast club, elvis duran, angie martinez, big boy, steve harvey, mario lopez, ellen k bobby bones, woody delilah, enrique santos and many more who are big nationally, regionally and locally as well as the biggest talk show host in america. and it attracts the best creative talent and podcasting as well.
we've also used the unparalleled scale of our broadcast radio platform and our strong personalities and creators helped build out our many other businesses, like our digital business, which includes our iheartradio app in service, which has been downloaded over 2.9 billion times, our newsletters that reached almost 12 million subscribers, our social media following of 223 million fans which is over 7 times larger than the next audio player in social and our digital services associated with our stations and personalities that according to comscore reached an average of 71 million unique visitors a month in q3. additionally our broadcast platform has helped build our number one podcast business and our events business which although down this year for obvious reasons has had great success with virtual events like our recent iheartradio music festival and the iheartradio country festival which actually exceeded last year's live events both in social impressions and live streams. this platform has also helped make totally new businesses like the black information network, an immediate success.
we'd launched bin across 15 markets in the second quarter and have since expanded to 25 markets in q3, including new york city. and we're pleased to report that peak moments of audience engagement have coincided with major news stories indicating that has established itself as a trusted go to source for breaking news and information in the black community. as i mentioned earlier, i know many of you are interested in hearing more about our podcasting business. and i want to spend some time discussing this growing part of our company. podcasting continues to be our strongest performing business line, reflecting the fact that we built iheart into the number one commercial podcast publisher in america with 252 million downloads a month as of september, which is up 71% year-over-year. in q3, as measured by podtrac, we were number one in downloads each month. our audience continues to be more than twice the size of the next largest commercial podcaster and we extended our lead over all other ranked podcasters.
let me share with you our model. we partner with the best content creators in the world. some of who are very own radio talent, distribute their content to the largest audience possible without a paywall and use the unparalleled scale of our broadcast radio business as a built-in marketing machine to drive engagement with our podcast shows. we feel this is an important part of our secret sauce. it's how we continue to build hit podcast after hit podcast and how we continue to grow our leadership position. according to podtrac's latest data, not only are we number one overall, but we currently have the most shows featured across all categories and we have ranked shows featured in all 19 possible categories, the most among all publishers.
let me be clear. podcasting is already a profitable business for us and has an ebitda margin that is higher than the overall company margin. our podcast business is advertiser supported, it's not subscription based. and it's not behind the paywall, which enables our creators to share their passion with the widest audience possible as we distribute their podcasts not only on the iheartradio app but across as many other distribution platforms as possible.
i want to point out that because podcasting is an adjacent business to our radio business, we've been able to use our broadcast radio assets to drive podcast usage and build hit shows. if you think back to a similar situation that television faced and how they missed an adjacent business, which is called netflix by the way, we not only did not miss our chance but we are currently the industry leader in our adjacent business.
to further strengthen our position as the number one podcast publisher, in october, we acquired voxnest to continue to increase our modernization capabilities. the voxnest acquisition provides two crucial benefits to our podcast business. first, it opens up meaningful additional targetable inventory to our podcast advertisers. and second, it will allow for the more efficient monetization of our inventory by helping to connect the fragmented programmatic marketplaces that exist in podcasting and establishes the first at-scale real-time bidding podcast platform for non-premium podcast inventory.
we believe the addition of voxnest has the potential to be a significant contributor of growth for our podcast business when combined with the audience, distribution and quality of content that iheart can provide. as a backdrop to podcasting all of our other growth opportunities, they are made possible because we have a deep connection to the communities we serve.
we provide our consumers with the products and services they expect from us regardless of where they are and what platforms they're using. and as our consumers listening behaviors have changed, our leadership position across multiple devices has ensured that they have a multitude of ways for our consumers to engage with us.
even now, as certain areas of the countries have shown signs of returning to normalcy and people have begun to resume many of their old habits and lifestyles, digital listening on home devices is still up. consumers continue to engage with their multi-platform offerings at rates equal to and, in some cases, greater than they did in the second quarter lockdown. and our hope and expectation is that we will continue to benefit from consumers having learned to find and use our products across these many new devices. early indicators show consumers are sticking with these new habits. iheart radio digital listening has seen double digit year-over-year growth across digital devices like up 42% on smart tvs and even up 11% on smart speakers.
since our company reaches 90% of all americans every month listening to, understanding and integrating input from diverse voices and views are critical to our business success. as a company, we value diversity and we respect all voices from both inside and outside our company. at the beginning of 2020, we announced our company our latest steps to enhance diversity at iheart with an increased focus on recruitment, education, mentorship and accountability.
we remain committed to further increasing the diversity of our organization from more board diversity to appointing a chief diversity officer to acquiring [phonetic] consideration of diversity candidates for all of our major hiring and promotion decisions, improving our interviewing process to include a wide representation of interviewers, instituting a diversity, equality and inclusion advisory board and on the content side making diversity a real priority, including pledging that 50% of the new podcast we launch in the iheart podcast network will be from female and diverse creators as well as a number of major programming initiatives on our stations designed to foster understanding through more diverse voices.
serving our communities is more than a platitude. it's at the heart of our product strategy. during the pandemic, we built a virtual events business from the ground up, producing virtual concerts and filling the void in people's lives left by missing events due to the pandemic, like commencement, speeches for the class of 2020, our virtual commencement address podcast for graduates, a virtual homecoming celebration for hbc use and the iheartradio music festival which generated a total of 19.4 billion social impressions up 20% over last year's event and more than double the total live stream of last year's live and in-person event. the iheartradio music festival owned the night of social media with a hashtag-iheartfestival2020 trending worldwide in 14 countries and 64 cities in the us. post-pandemic, virtual events will certainly be a new category for us and we expect it will be accretive to our sponsorship revenue line.
we also continue to pioneer new products and technologies like the blumhouse and airmonkey produce 13 days of halloween, a thrilling horror anthology they use cutting edge 3d audio and sets a new standard for podcasting. if you haven't already, i highly recommend that you listen in order to experience and understand the power of this new audio technology. this is just one more example of our commitment to delivering the entertainment, the information and the companionship that our listeners seek.
rich will take you through the details of our q3 performance, but i want to leave you with just these few points. first, scale matters. it bears repeating that broadcast radio remains the number one reach medium in the us that we are the number one audio company in america by a wide margin and that we have used that position to transform iheart into a true multi-platform company with diverse yet complementary revenue streams and to use our leadership position to build new businesses like the black information network and a recently launched iheartradio sports network. we're encouraged that revenue continues to improve sequentially and that while there is still some uncertainty about the future, we believe that if current macro trends persist, we're on a path to full recovery.
our performance this year has shown the value of our multi-platform and investment strategies as the parts of our business that have been the most resilient and performed the best during the downturn have been our newer diverse offerings. our relationship with the consumer has only grown stronger during this downturn. in the past, we've seen consumers turn to us during times of crisis and need. the same has occurred during the pandemic, but on a national scale and for a longer duration. and we expect this strengthened relationship to continue after the pandemic ends.
we continue to be disciplined capital allocators with a focus on reducing cost and creating efficiencies. covid hit everyone hard and quickly. but the economic downturn has continued to prove that one of the core strengths of the company is our free cash flow characteristics. even during the pandemic, we saw positive free cash flow of $14 million in the third quarter.
finally, i want to remind you that before covid hit, we had already taken steps to modernize the company, investing in growth areas and creating centers of excellence across the organization resulting in savings of $50 million in 2020 and a run rate of $100 million by mid-2021, both of which were on target to achieve. when covid hit, we again took decisive action to further reduce our in-year expenses to help mitigate the impact the economic downturn was having on our business and to accelerate our modernization efforts by identifying another $200 million of savings. we remain on track to achieve the $200 million of additional savings in 2020 and have plans to make the majority of the $200 million of savings part of our cost structure in to 2021 and beyond. this downturn accelerated our discovery of new ways to operate that will make us a leaner, more efficient organization with improved operating leverage that will carry forward into the future as revenue continues to recover.
before i turn it over to rich, i want to emphasize that while we're working hard on our recovery through covid, we're also laser-focused on ensuring that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities post-covid. rich?
rich bressler -- president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
thanks, bob. the challenging macroeconomic environment, which began in april, has improved significantly. and while we've experienced sequential improvements in each of the months that have followed and see multiple areas that give us reason for optimism, we continue to experience year-over-year revenue declines.
in terms of our third quarter results if you turn to slide 7, of our investor deck on a reported basis our consolidated revenue decreased by 22% over the prior year period. direct operating expenses decreased 13%, driven primarily by cost reductions associated with our modernization initiatives as well as those taken in response to covid-19. in addition, variable operating expenses decreased 13%, in line with lower revenue recognized during the period. sg&a expenses decreased 11%, driven by cost reduction initiatives and lower sales commissions, which were driven by the decrease in revenue.
corporate expenses decreased 41% during the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of lower employee compensation, including variable incentive expenses and employee benefits resulting from expense reduction initiatives. the decrease also included the impact of an $11 million decrease in share-based compensation expense compared to the prior year quarter. the declines in our third quarter gaap operating income to $39 million compared to $141 million in the prior year quarter as well as the declines in our adjusted ebitda to $162 million, down from $275 million in the prior year quarter were driven by low revenue.
turning to slide 9. i'll provide additional color on the performance of our revenue streams. in our broadcast business, revenue declined by 29% on a reported basis while networks declined by 26% year-over-year. our digital revenue stream grew 17% driven by continued growth in podcasting, which increased 74% year-over-year. audio and media services increased by 25% on a reported basis, driven by cad who benefited from extremely strong political sped particularly in tv. sponsorship and events revenue decreased by $27 million or 48% compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of the postponement or cancellations of physical events, again partially mitigated by the success of our virtual events.
turning back to our consolidated results. i look at beyond and below [phonetic] the line. interest expense decreased $15 million compared to the same period in 2019. on slide 12, there's a summary of our balance sheet. at quarter end, we had approximately $5.3 billion of net debt outstanding, which includes a cash balance of $714 million. our net debt of $5.3 billion is down over $200 million from $5.5 billion at the same time in 2019. importantly, we generated $14 million of free cash flow in the third quarter after having negative free cash flow of $7 million in q2 2020. we took early actions to focus on cost management and have continued to analyze and enturest [phonetic] our cost base throughout the year in order to maximize liquidity to be prepared even if there was a protracted recovery. the fact that we've been able to quickly return to cash generation is proof of our strict cost controls of our sequentially improving revenue trends and, most importantly, of the company's strong free cash flow characteristics.
as a reminder, the terms of our debt structure include no material maintenance covenants and there are no material debt maturities prior to 2026. as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect that revenue will remain challenged given the impact that covid-19 continues to have on the macroeconomic environment and advertising trends. however, we are cautiously optimistic as we continue to see improvements in the rate of year-over-year revenue declines. july, august and september declined 27%, 21% and 18% respectively and we just closed the month of october and finished plus 2% year-over-year. although we recognize that there is still some uncertainty, right now, we project q4 revenue will be down mid to low-teens on a year-over-year basis. i also want to provide an update on the modernization and cost initiatives that we announced earlier in the year.
together, these initiatives remain on track to deliver the expected $250 million of expense savings in 2020. as we have said previously, we expect our modernization initiatives to deliver $50 million of savings in 2020 and $100 million of annualized run rate savings by mid-2021. we are fully on track to achieve these savings. we are also on track to achieve over $200 million of post-covid savings in 2020.
further, we have developed detailed plans to make the majority of the $200 million of post-covid savings permanent as we have developed long-term structural expense savings within our cost structure. these savings include continued optimization of our real estate footprint, the adoption of technology solutions that will drive increased efficiency and effectiveness in our operations, the centralization of resources into centers of excellence, significant reductions in tv, consulting fees, discretionary spending and employee hiring and continued modernization of our organization.
the pandemic forced us to transform the way we do business, more rapidly than we could ever have imagined. and the actions we have taken leave us exceptionally well-positioned for margin expansion as advertising activity continues to recover. our full year capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at approximately $75 million to $95 million, but we will come in on the higher side of the range as we expand capital in q4 to drive operational efficiencies. we continue to expect minimal cash taxes in 2020 due to the cares act.
as a reminder, the provisions of the act that pertain to us result in our ability to deduct 100% of our 2020 interest expense as well as a portion of interest from prior years that was disallowed and the deferral and potential avoidance due to certain threats we may qualify for of 2020 paywall tax payments. we also wanted to update you on the company's fcc petition with respect to the foreign ownership of our equity.
on november 5th, the company received a declaratory ruling from the fcc granting the company's request to allow to 100% of the company's equity and voting stock to be owned by non-us persons subject to individual hold of foreign ownership and media cross-ownership limitations, which continue to apply. this ruling will allow for the simplification of the company's capital structure and enhanced liquidity for the company's class a common stock by facilitating the conversion of the warrants, which currently represents a little over half of the company's equity. warrant holders will receive the instructions through us mail from computershare, the company's warrant agent, regarding to how to participate in the exchange of warrants.
in wrapping up, we believe that our previously announced modernization initiatives and cost savings actions in combination with our resilient capital structure will provide us with financial flexibility and ample liquidity. we are confident in our ability to drive shareholder value through our operational discipline and continued investment in the areas of our business that will position us for growth as advertising demand continues its return. and again, we'd like to thank our employees who have committed to serving our listeners, our communities and our business partners during this challenging time.
we appreciate you all joining our third quarter earnings call. and now, we'll turn it over to the operator to take your questions. thank you all.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of jessica ehrlich from bofa securities.
jessica ehrlich -- bank of america securities -- analyst
i have two questions or two topics. one is on draftkings. can you give us a little bit more color on the economics, timing of impact? and is it exclusive, meaning can you do other sports betting deals? and can they do other radio deals? and then just one on podcasting. with more players coming into the market, there's just some -- so much money kind of chasing content. how is it impacting your costs? or how do you expect it will impact your costs? and on the other side of that, maybe how is it impacting industry growth? is it driving growth higher than expected?
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
let me start with the second one, and i'll let rich hit the first one on draftkings. i think on podcasting, i think you saw, jessica, in the numbers here that if you look at podtrac, we're actually increasing our lead over the other podcast publishers. and if you look at the revenue, i think it's on slide 8. if you look at the magna estimates, with an industry, including us, it's up 60%, we're up 184%, again, clear evidence that we continue to gain share. and i think that is really the flywheel effect that we have. and no matter how much money people bring to the party to play in the podcast game, the reality is it's about having a hit show. and every creator who comes to podcasting has a dream of having a hit show. the best way to get a hit show is to start with the biggest podcaster publisher which is us. so, we journey on sort of that flywheel is because we tend to get first look as a result of being the biggest. in terms of costs, not only do we do deals with shonda rhimes, with the nba, the nfl, but we also produce podcast ourselves internally with no profit participation. and we have hits there as well. so we have sort of a marvelous diversity here, which gives us a lot of control over it. and by being number one and probably getting more looks at product than anyone else, we're able to be pickier. and given our kind of economic position, we're able to say no to something that doesn't make sense. and really carefully watch the economics and not fall into the trap some people do of chasing profitless prosperity. you're not going to see that from us.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
jess, it's rich. let me -- i just want to add one thing to what bob commented on podcasting and then go specifically to your question on draftkings. just to remind everybody, we, as bob articulated, now get 184% of revenue in this quarter. but if you go back, i think the numbers already up 142% in q1 on revenues. we were up 152% in q2 on revenues. and obviously, we're starting to lap bigger and bigger numbers in terms of the overall growth. so i think that really proves out and you've been hearing from us about podcasting for some period of time. this strategy that we're on, the ad-supported strategy as opposed to going behind a paywall and the way to bob's point in terms of the flywheel effect, the benefit we get, not just on the top line on the numbers, but obviously also on the bottom line, as we said, because it's accretive to our overall margin. so i just wanted to remind everybody that with respect to podcasting because there is a lot of noise in the marketplace out there. when it comes to draftkings, we really can't disclose any more financial details. what i would say is, as we're all well aware, this is one of the fastest-growing advertising categories and then to partner with draftkings and the number one company in audio is pretty exciting, i think, for all of us. and i think also the larger point because there's a lot of people making a lot of claims out there, but we've got the leading audio sports assets and bob articulated this during the release. but just as a reminder, we're with the largest sports podcast network in the industry, we have our deal with the nfl. we have our deal with the nba. we've got the iheart sports network, which reaches 75 million people. so yes, this deal is significant. and what i think -- and by the way, it is not exclusive. and what i think you should think about is it's a deal that touches all of our platforms. and as everybody starts to think about modeling out the future and we continue the momentum into 2022 into the fourth quarter this year and into 2022. looking at this, should give everybody a lot of confidence in terms of projecting out our future growth.
operator
your next question comes from the line of steve cahall from wells fargo.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
maybe first just to talk about what you're seeing in the ad market, bob, i think you're the first advertising company this quarter to say that what's going on in supply chain isn't really impacting the business. and i know you had audiocon in las vegas recently. so maybe you can just talk about what you think is going on there? i mean, is it that folks are moving share into audio? or how can you maybe kind of put some context around maybe the difference in what you're seeing in ad trends versus a lot of your peers.
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
sure. well, look, i think certainly, there are some people that are being affected by it, but there are some people that are doing better at the same time, so it's sort of give and takes. but i think we also see is anytime somebody -- and what we're hearing is anytime somebody's got a temporary supply problem, but they've got demand, they -- i think most people we talk to realize they're going to get their supply sooner or later. and what is important is to hold that demand. during a period like this, we probably have -- and it's hard to prove this, but probably have a slight advantage because we're more efficient. if you look at tv, for example, most people think tv and radio deliver about the same impact at the same weight level, yet tv is about 3x to 4x the cpm of radio. so if you want to keep your demand, one of the most efficient/cheapest ways to keep your demand is to substitute radio into some of the slots for some of the more expensive media. so in a sort of a strange perverse way, people who want to hold on to the demand, but don't yet have a supply to fulfill it, probably are looking for efficiencies in marketing. and if they're really thoughtful about it, we probably are a good solution to that. so look, i think that's sort of the major issue. and again, as we talk to people, i don't think we've talked to any advertisers that think this is sort of a permanent supply problem or they're going to have to sell diminished quantities. so they think they'll catch up. and i think every one of them is focused on, wait a minute, i don't want to have to restart my demand because they realize if they step away from having that desire for the product, they are giving up a huge advantage they have in something they've built.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
steve, the only thing i just -- again, just to reinforce one of a few things we mentioned early in support of what bob just said, there is the general trend, obviously, in terms of audio being hot. second thing is, i think, again, brings to light a multiplatform because whether you've got broadcast or network or ttwn or everything we're talking about podcasting or digital or digital ex podcasting, a lot of events that bob touched upon, you can work with us in so many different ways in terms of coming into our company. and then i also think we've got the technology solution and the ability to meet the needs of advertisers and play in the big digital tam and capabilities, and you've heard us say this before that we didn't really have a year ago or even 6 months ago, that full and integrated acquisition of triton. and then finally, we benefit from the diversity of our advertising base. we have no one category that's more than 5%. we have no individual advertisers that's more than 2%. and that really touches upon bob's comment is, sure, we have some categories that are down but we've also benefited greatly from some categories that are up also. so it's a total mixture.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes. and then maybe expanding on that, could you talk about what smartaudio is running as a percentage of multiplatform sales and maybe where you see that going over the next year or 2?
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, we haven't given out the number, but obviously, we think that is going to continue to increase. we've built out the whole smartaudio platform so that our broadcast radio can be bought and sold like digital can be built around the cohorts. and with the triton marketplace, which we announced, which we're going to launch in january of next year, we're talking about the first truly integrated audio marketplace in which you will be able to buy one set of audiences cohorts on an integrated basis across podcasting, digital radio, into broadcast radio using smartaudio. and i think that gives us -- not only us, but i think the audio industry, a great new tool to bring money broadly into this business. and when you look at the kind of reach radio has, every advertiser today has got a problem. they need reach. digital doesn't reach the numbers that radio does. tv is declining, and certainly doesn't reach what radio does. and people at least have to be able to see or hear your commercial for it to have an impact. so radio winds up, i think, in this pretty good position of being this reach enhancer for everyone. well, by using smartaudio, we're able to put it into a language and a technology that they're comfortable with and looking for us to do. so i think as an overall percentage of our advertising on broadcast radio, we look for smartaudio to be continuing to climb.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
and by the way, steve, and if you think about it, if you look at the significant progress we continue to make on the multiplatform line and what bob just touched upon, which includes smartaudio, and we've talked about as people growing past but getting back to '19 levels, and we've talked about as a total company, and we commonly get the question, do you want to get back there on the multiplatform line and your confidence in getting back on the multiplatform line. remember what bob just articulated, our capabilities of smartaudio in the multiplatform line, that too enables us to tap into the digital tam, the $160 billion plus $170 billion digital tam. it's not just our digital line that could tap into it, but it's also our multiplatform line.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
and maybe last one, kind of a housekeeping one. as we think about next year, any major changes on either cash interest, cash tax or capex we should be mindful of?
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
well, we're going to see capital expenditures go down. i think we said this quarter, we spent approximately $50 million of capital expenditures, an increase from the mid-30s last year, and the major increase in that is due to our real estate, in terms of our downsizing of our real estate, just getting more efficient in that. and again, those operating savings are already in the expense saving numbers that we've talked about on the modernization efforts and on the $200 million that we said would be -- a substantial piece would be permitted for this year. and also on interest expense, i think, as you all know, one is we just had the preferred that we retired. that we retired early from may of last year, which is going to bring some interest expense savings coupled with the fact that reinforces our confidence in the business. and i think everybody should take our payment of the $60 million on both accounts. and then finally, as a reminder, we do have the refinancing on [indecipherable] coming up, which is about one-third of our interest expense. and we're heavily looking at our options, but rest assured that we expect that interest expense to go down and be another lever for value creation for us.
operator
our last question comes from the line of dan day from b. riley securities.
daniel day -- b. riley securities -- analyst
just first one, we've talked about this 4x leverage target for a while, and you look to be getting there in the next quarter or two as long as -- at least on a forward-looking basis. i guess once you're there, talk about the priorities for free cash flow between paying a dividend, buying back shares, how you weigh that against m&a opportunities, whether this is a business that you see given how cyclical it is, can even support a dividend there might be a debate out there on that. so, curious your thoughts on that.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
well, i'm not -- this won't surprise you and really appreciate the question, but i'm not going to comment on anything specifically including your comment on when we're going to get to -- including your comment on when we're going to get to 4x. again, all we've said is our target is to get to 4x leverage, and i think everybody could see the significant progress we've made toward doing that. and when we get in around 4x leverage, bob and myself working with our board and working with mike and the team will look at our options and what's the best way to get money back to our shareholders, which i would suggest that just paying down debt right now in our capital structure is just another form of returning capital to our shareholders because just from a numerical basis, what it goes to the equity value out there. and we'll always continue to look at any potential assets that can help the total iheart base. but i think if you look at our history since bob and i have been with the company, whether it's jelli or stuffworks or any of the assets -- acquisitions that we made, they've always been -- none of them, i would suggest, individually have been significant to overall iheart, quite frankly, even in total, that make significantly iheart capital structure, but each and every one of them have made the rest of the iheart base more valuable. and so i don't see any change to that pattern.
daniel day -- b. riley securities -- analyst
got you. i want to turn to another topic. just the draftkings deal here that you announced. obviously, sports betting being such a big opportunity here for radio advertisers. i mean do you see either at the local or national level, maybe the calculation changing for how aggressive do you get in terms of going after the live sports radio rights? is that something you see as changing and getting more aggressive there?
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
we're actually pretty aggressive. and actually, we have quite a number of major teams carried on our radio stations play-by-play. we have a number of big sports talk radio stations. we have a -- even have some specific sports betting stations, the gambler is the name of them, where we run them. and then we are doing the iheart sports network, which is sports information, even on our music stations, reaches about 75 million people according to nielsen, and i think probably is the largest sports network. so we cover the gamut. and when you go to podcasting, we've got the biggest sports podcasting network as well, not only the leagues that rich talked about earlier, but also colin cowherd, dan patrick. we've got a lot of big names there with a lot of success. so we continue to invest heavily in it, and i think it's a great investment for us.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
and by the way, one thing i'd say, maybe relative to all of these comments and the questions we're just talking about is our focus here is really to drive the value of this company -- drive the equity value of this company. so everything you hear, bob and i talking about, whether it's from an operating standpoint or a balance sheet standpoint, is put through that filter with the two of us and our board of directors. well, first of all, there's no other questions. i want to thank everybody for taking the time to hear the iheart story. thank everybody for the support. and bob, myself and mike are available any time for follow-up in your questions.

operator
good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to the iheartmedia third quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr. mike mcguinness, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
michael mcguinness -- executive vice president, deputy chief financial officer & head of investor relations
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. joining me for today's discussion are bob pittman, our chairman and ceo; and rich bressler, our president, coo and cfo. at the conclusion of our prepared remarks, management will take your questions. please note that in addition to our press release, we have an investor presentation that you can use to follow along with our remarks.
before we begin, let me quickly cover the safe harbor statements on slide 2. during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including the current and expected impact of covid-19 on the company's liquidity, financial position and results of operations. these estimates are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could materially differ from these expectations and assumptions, and these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the sec. during this call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures can be found in our earnings release or in the investor presentation available on our website.
and now, i'll turn the call over to bob.
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
thanks, mike, and good afternoon, everybody. thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. we feel great about being able to deliver a quarter like this. we think it's further evidence of the success of our company's continuing transformation, data-led digital and podcast focus, along with the unparalleled audience reach of our broadcast radio assets, supported by the largest sales force and the only unified ad tech stack in audio advertising, all with the strong flywheel effect of our scale and leadership position.
rich and i want to again acknowledge our employees. it's their ongoing commitment to innovation and creativity that's behind our momentum and the strong results we're announcing today, and it will set the stage for a full recovery to 2019 adjusted ebitda levels by the end of this year. rich will take you through our detailed financials, sharing the performance of our individual business segments and highlighting both the strong growth and potential of our digital business, including podcasting and the strong recovery and growth potential of our radio business. we hope this gives you the information you need to accurately evaluate each of our business segments and our business as a whole.
our business continues its strong revenue and profit growth in the third quarter. our third quarter consolidated revenue grew 25% compared to prior year. you'll recall that our guidance was an increase of 20% versus prior year. when excluding political, q3 revenue increased 31% versus prior year. we generated adjusted ebitda of $230 million, which grew by 42% versus prior year, while generating $45 million of free cash flow. our revenue in q3 2021 is now 98% of our revenue in q3 2019, continuing our trend of sequential quarterly improvement compared to 2019. the multiplatform group grew q3 revenue by 19% versus prior year and adjusted ebitda by 50%. and the digital audio group grew q3 revenue by 77% versus prior year and adjusted ebitda by 91%. podcast revenue was up 184% versus the prior year, and digital ex-podcast revenue was up 51% versus the prior year. additionally, our adjusted ebitda margin significantly expanded in the quarter, reflecting the revenue growth, the success of our previously announced savings initiatives and our continued focus on expense management. we have a high operating leverage business. in q3 2021, the multiplatform group margins were 32% and the digital audio group margins were 33%, both of which represent year-over-year and sequential quarterly margin expansion.
turning now to the results of our two largest segments; our iheartmedia digital audio group, which includes our high-growth podcasting business and the iheartradio digital service, the industry's number one digital radio service with a 5x lead in digital usage over the next largest commercial broadcast company as measured by triton. it also includes our websites and newsletters with their monthly audience of over 135 million unique users in the united states according to omniture, our digital services and programs for both national and local partners and our digital ad tech companies. our iheartradio service also has a social footprint that includes 241 million fans and followers, which is approximately 7x larger than the next largest audio player.
the digital audio group continues to increase its importance relative to the company's consolidated results and it delivered another strong performance in the third quarter with revenues up 77% year-over-year and adjusted ebitda up 91% year-over-year, making it one of the best digital performers in the marketplace today. digital revenues are now about one-third the size of our multiplatform group revenues and have more than doubled over the last five quarters. even with the expected growth of our multiplatform group, we believe digital will ultimately grow to multiplatform group revenue levels and beyond due to the high-growth assets of the digital audio group and the size and expected expansion of the digital advertising tam.
included in the digital revenues are our podcasting revenues, which were up 184% year-over-year. it's important to note that our podcast business is not only profitable but has margins that are actually accretive to our overall company margin. our podcast business continues to reach new levels for revenue, profitability, listenership and downloads. according to podtrac, the industry standard for third-party podcast measurement, we are the number one podcast publisher with 30 million u.s. unique monthly listeners and 282 million global monthly downloads and streams, an all-time high. not only do we generate an audience 1.5x larger than the second largest publisher in the space, it was 3x larger than the next largest commercial podcaster. also consider the scale of our podcast offerings, iheart has 2.5x as many ranked shows and top 10 shows across podtrac's 19 content categories than the next largest podcast network. we also have the most shows with over one million downloads. these stats highlight the breadth and depth of our leadership position and the power of the flywheel effect that comes with it. and remember, the economics in podcasting are with the publisher, not the distributor. it is the publisher that generates the ad revenue and profit, and we are the number one podcast publisher by a substantial margin.
our non-podcast digital business also continued its strong performance, growing 51% in q3. these revenues, which include our digital audio streaming product, display advertising and digital services outperformed the digital ex-podcasting industry growth of 34% as reported by magna for q3 2021. this strong outperformance is driven in part by the fact that we have the largest audio sales force in the united states, executing our strategy of any seller anywhere can sell anything, supported by our unique technology. although our podcasting success understandably gets a lot of attention, we want to make sure that we also highlight the strength of our non-podcasting digital businesses.
now, let's move to the iheartmedia multiplatform group which includes the largest broadcast radio group in america by all metrics, reach, audience size, revenue, earnings and even number of stations. it also includes our national sales organization, our live and virtual events business, our networks business and our bin, black information network business. the multiplatform group audience is twice the size of the next largest broadcast radio company and also has twice the audience of the largest digital music streaming service and almost 5x their ad-enabled audience. we are the only audio player in broadcast or digital that has broad national reach in addition to an unparalleled local footprint.
the iheartmedia multiplatform group also reaches more people every month with its broadcast radio assets alone than any other media company in america, and that includes both google and facebook. multiplatform group revenues were up 19% year-over-year in q3 and were down only 17% compared to 2019, continuing our sequential quarterly improvement compared to 2019. these year-over-year and sequential results are evidence that our multiplatform group revenues are well on their way to recovering to 2019 levels and that they will continue to grow beyond that. our share of the broadcast radio sector revenues continues to expand, outperforming the broadcast sector as a whole, as reported by miller kaplan, which measures the revenue performance of select broadcast markets. i'd like to give you a couple of data points about why we're so confident in the growth potential of the multiplatform group and the future of broadcast radio as an advertising medium.
let's start with a quick overview of the entire audio listening landscape and the revenue potential for each segment. using nielsen and comscore, which are the industry standards for audience measurement, when looking at the split of listening between broadcast radio and streaming digital audio, broadcast gets about 75% of all listening and streaming digital audio, which includes spotify, apple music, amazon music, pandora and iheartradio, among others, gets about 25% of the listening.
now, let me translate that into advertising potential. it's important to remember that there are two sectors of audio. one is comprised of music services like apple music, amazon music, spotify and even pandora. it's where listeners go for their personal music collection, replacing cds, lps and music downloads. consumers go to their music collection when they want to shut out the world. it has no weather or traffic, no talker information, no personalities and any ads that run there are perceived as interruptions of this pure music experience.
radio on the other hand is the opposite. it's social. it's where people go and they want to know what's going on in the world, where they go for companionship, music, news, gossip, information, humor, who's hot and who's not. in this environment, information is key and even commercials are part of that experience. commercials are native content on radio, but they are interruptions to the music collection. and these differences in product appeal are why music collection services can't run anywhere near the same amount of advertising inventory as broadcast radio. that, combined with the listening differential, means broadcast radio has a significant revenue potential advantage over streaming music collections.
in the past, radio revenue has been limited by its lack of data and from not being of the modern advertising ecosystem that the digital giants pioneered. but that's changing. and you've seen the progress we've made with both smartaudio and our ad tech platform led by triton. the music collection services, on the other hand, are limited by audience reach, time spent and probably more importantly, advertising load possibilities in their music-only environment. when i analyze the advertising revenue potential of both sectors, i definitely prefer our hand by a lot.
now, let me give you a few more facts about the power of broadcast radio. when it comes to competing with other media formats, it might surprise you to know that consumers spend about 50% more time with broadcast radio every day than they do social media and broadcast radio has actually grown its number of listeners in the past 15 years. digital listening has also grown, but the key here is that the overall listing pie is getting bigger as new listening platforms are added. this growth of the pie is driven by the strength of broadcast radio and the music collection services converting cd and music download listeners into music streamers. we know that ad revenue inevitably follows consumer usage, and we're seeing this happen in real time with the decline of linear tv.
a warc study released in september shows that media spending is still out of whack. tv consumption has dropped to 24% of total media time, while audio consumption has grown to 31% of total usage. however, only 9% of advertising spend goes to audio indicating that some advertisers have been slow to react to this new reality. and additionally, with 40% of tv viewers classified as light tv viewers, as an advertising medium, tv now faces a significant reach gap. broadcast radio is uniquely capable of filling this gap for tv advertisers, reaching 90% of light tv viewers compared to only 50% for ott options. our ability to address both the reach and light tv viewer gaps gives us access to the $58 billion tv tam, which is further support for our confidence in the growth potential of our multiplatform group revenues.
now, let me move to our events business; also included in our multiplatform group where the consumer demand for our live events is strong. our q3 2021 sponsorship and events revenue were up 48% compared to prior year. and this quarter includes the impact of the return to live marquee iheartradio music festival, which was virtual last year. ticket sales exceeded 2019 levels and the event generated over 15 billion social impressions, which was 20x larger than lollapalooza. the high consumer demand for live events can also be seen in the recent success of the iheartradio fiesta latina and this past weekend's live iheart country festival. live events are back and coming up as our 11-day live and in-person iheartradio jingle ball tour in december.
i'd like to take a minute now to address a couple of relevant topics. covid, of course, continues to affect the country. while its human and social toll is real, the advertising revenue impact appears to be behind us. supply chain issues are also making headlines, but they have not had a material impact on our business. and finally, i also want to touch on apple's recent change to their data and privacy policy. some digital companies have said they are feeling a negative impact to their ad revenue as a result of apple's new policy. we aren't and there are several reasons why.
first, we have our own platforms with our own first-party data. second, we built for the future using smart audio digital-like broadcast inventory around cohorts, which are defined target audiences like auto buyers or new parents, not one-to-one using cookies and mobile ids. even with our purely digital inventory, we've stressed cohorts instead of focusing on one-to-one. third, our audio ad tech platform makes us the only audio company that can seamlessly target and serve to the same cohorts across all platforms from podcast to digital to broadcast.
big picture, we believe that cohorts are replacing one-to-one marketing, and we think we are well positioned for the shift toward data-infused ad buy. due to the changes in privacy restrictions and other factors, we see the world moving past one-to-one targeting, past cookies, past mobile ids and toward premium platforms that are brand-safe, measurable and that have real scale, like ours. in this new world of advertising, iheart is uniquely positioned to deliver targetable cohorts in audio comprised of highly engaged audiences with scale that is unparalleled in the u.s.
before i turn it over to rich, i want to touch upon the important announcement that we made yesterday about our multiyear strategic partnership with draftkings. this partnership is in one of the fastest-growing advertising categories and will enable draftkings to use the assets of the number one audio company in sports, iheart. this partnership builds on iheart's industry-leading audio sports assets, including the largest sports podcast network in the industry, which includes partnerships with the nfl, the nba and sports podcast led by marquee talent like colin cowherd and dan patrick as well as the iheart sports network, which reaches 75 million americans according to nielsen, our sports talk and sports betting stations and also our ongoing live coverage of professional teams on select iheart stations across the country. we expect sports and sports betting to be a significant growth engine for us going forward, and this partnership with draftkings is further evidence of that potential.
rich and i and the rest of the iheart management team are excited about the tangible results iheart's unique audio assets are delivering, driven by our unparalleled consumer reach across broadcast radio, digital radio and podcasting, and supported by our unmatched ad tech platform and suite of data analytic capabilities. we believe the revenue potential of our assets is superior to anything else in the audio sector and we're excited about using these assets to continue to drive growth into 2022 and beyond.
and with that, i'd like to turn it over to rich.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
thanks, bob, and good afternoon, everyone. as bob laid out, we delivered strong results in the third quarter, which reflect continued success of our operating strategies and the power of our unique audio assets as well as improving trends in the macroeconomic environment.
turning to slide 12 of our investor deck; our consolidated revenues were up 25% year-over-year exceeding our guidance for the quarter of up 20% year-over-year. when excluding political revenues, q3 increased 31% year-over-year. we are also extremely pleased with our continued sequential improvement against 2019. our revenue in q3 2021 was down only 2% from q3 2019, improving from being down 6% in q2 2021 compared to 2019 and improving from being down 11% in q1 2021 compared to 2019. direct operating expenses increased 20%, driven primarily by the significant increase in revenue, which drives higher content and profit-sharing expenses, third-party digital costs and expenses related to the return of local and national live events like the iheartradio music festival. these increases were partially offset by lower employee compensation and other reductions resulting from our significant modernization and cost reduction initiatives.
sg&a expenses increased 17%, driven by increased employee compensation expenses, resulting primarily from higher variable bonus expense based on financial performance and higher sales commissions due to higher revenue. as a reminder, last year, the vast majority of our employees did not get paid a bonus. and as a result, you'll see our corporate expenses increase year-over-year. in addition, increased headcount from the investments in our fast-growing digital business contributed to the increases in sg&a. these increases were partially offset by the impact of our significant modernization and cost reduction initiatives and lower bad debt expense. our third quarter gaap operating income was $80.1 million compared to an operating income of $39.4 million in the prior year quarter, and our third quarter adjusted ebitda was $230.2 million compared to $162.1 million in the prior quarter.
if you turn back to slide 4, i'll provide additional color on the performance of our operating segments. and as a note, there are additional slides in the investor presentation on our segment revenue performance. digital audio group revenues were up 77% year-over-year and adjusted ebitda was up 91% year-over-year. within the digital audio group is our podcasting business, whose revenues grew 184% year-over-year, and our non-podcasting digital revenues, which grew 51% year-over-year, also continuing their strong performance. and importantly, we expanded our third quarter digital audio group margins to 33%, a 230 basis point improvement year-over-year and a sequential improvement of 520 basis points from q2 2021, which as we mentioned last quarter, were negatively impacted by a few onetime expenses.
multiplatform group revenues were up 19% in q3 and continued our sequential improvement compared to 2019. q3 revenues were down only 17% compared to 2019, a 390 basis point improvement from q2 2021, which was down 21% versus q2 2019. and a significant improvement compared to q1 2021, which was down 26% versus q1 2019. q3 adjusted ebitda margins were 32%, a significant improvement from 25% adjusted ebitda margins in q3 2020 and on a sequential basis, margins improved 170 basis points from q2 2021. that margin improvement was achieved even though the quarter included the return to live and the associated expenses for the iheartradio music festival, which, while profitable, does not have the same margin profile as the rest of our multiplatform group businesses.
looking at the revenue streams within the multiplatform group. our broadcast revenues grew 20% year-over-year. within the broadcast line is smartaudio, our data-infused programmatic platform. smartaudio was up 43% year-over-year in the third quarter. as a reminder, it uses the same inventory as the rest of broadcast radio, highlighting the value of data and ad tech. and as we continue to add new technologies and data capabilities, we expect that our smartaudio product will generate revenue from the digital and tv tams, especially considering the changes to the advertising landscape that bob discussed earlier.
our networks revenues were up 8% compared to prior year, which includes our premier networks, which were up 2% compared to prior year as well as ttwn, the total traffic and weather network, which was up 14% compared to the prior year. and as a reminder, our premier business was less impacted by covid in 2020, which affects the comparison. our q3 2021 sponsorship and events revenues were up 48% compared to prior year. as bob mentioned, this reflects the strength of the iheart brand, the high demand for live music and advertisers' desire to interact with this engaged and enthusiastic customer base. the audio & media services group revenue was down 12% on a reported basis. excluding the impact of political, revenues in this segment were up 13% year-over-year.
on slide 18, there is a summary of our debt. at quarter end, we had approximately $5.4 billion of net debt outstanding, which includes a cash balance of $369 million, and these figures include the previously announced voluntary prepayment of $250 million of our term loan. we will also benefit from the concurrent repricing of the term loan, which will have a positive impact on our interest expense on a go-forward basis. at the end of october, we repurchased the full balance of our $60 million preferred stock prior to its call date of may 1, 2022, which is not included in these figures. in doing so, we realized interest savings, but more importantly, we exited the most expensive and restrictive instruments on the iheart balance sheet, reinforcing iheart's commitment to improving our capital structure and demonstrating our confidence in our business moving forward.
as a reminder, the terms of our debt structure include no material maintenance covenants and there are no material debt maturities prior to 2026. we continue to actively monitor market conditions and will opportunistically optimize our capital structure. we ended q3 2021 net debt-to-ebitda leverage of 6.9x. we remain committed to achieving our previously announced leverage target of approximately 4x, and we expect to continue our progress toward that goal.
in the third quarter, we generated $45 million of free cash flow. as we mentioned last quarter, the accelerated consolidation of our real estate footprint, which is part of our previously announced modernization and cost savings initiatives has enabled us to sell certain redundant assets, which has partially offset the real estate initiatives, gross capital expenditures. free cash flow, including net proceeds from these real estate asset sales would be $54 million for q3. as a reminder, our capital expenditures are elevated this year as a result of onetime spend related to our real estate consolidation. we continue to successfully execute against our previously announced savings initiatives. as a reminder, our pre-covid modernization initiatives achieved a $100 million run rate target by mid-2021, and we remain on target to replicate the majority of the previously announced $200 million post-covid savings in 2021. we believe these actions, coupled with our continuing revenue growth, leaves us well positioned for margin expansion as evidenced in q3.
consolidated margins were 25%, up from 21% in q2 2021, 14% in q1 2021 and up 300 basis points from 22% in q3 2020. multiplatform group margins were 32%, up from 30% in q2 2021, 21% in q1 2021 and up 660 basis points from 25% in q3 2020. digital audio group margins were 33%, up from 27% in q2 2021, 25% in q1 2021 and up 230 basis points from 30% in q3 2020.
as we look forward to q4, i want to provide you with the following. our october consolidated revenues were up approximately 1% compared to 2019 and approximately flat year-over-year. it is important to note that october 2020 was our biggest month for political revenue. excluding the impact of political, october's year-over-year growth would have been approximately 22%. for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be up approximately 10% year-over-year or 22%, excluding the impact of political, implying our q4 revenue will be slightly higher compared to 2019. and consistent with our previous guidance, we reaffirm that we expect to return to 2019 adjusted ebitda levels by the end of 2021. no matter what valuation method you use, utilizing a valuation of the sum of the parts of potential future revenue and earnings growth, free cash flow per share, et cetera, we think iheart is undervalued using any metric. we hope the information we have provided today gives you confidence in the value of this company.
bob and i and the rest of the management team are excited by these results, and the audience, revenue and earnings momentum in our business. and as a reminder, we'll give specific 2022 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. i'd like to close on the same note that bob began on. we thank our employees, without whom this journey would not be possible, the communities we serve and our business partners. we appreciate everyone joining our third quarter earnings call.
and now we will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. thank you.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of jessica ehrlich from bofa securities.
jessica ehrlich -- bank of america securities -- analyst
i have two questions or two topics. one is on draftkings. can you give us a little bit more color on the economics, timing of impact? and is it exclusive, meaning can you do other sports betting deals? and can they do other radio deals? and then just one on podcasting. with more players coming into the market, there's just some -- so much money kind of chasing content. how is it impacting your costs? or how do you expect it will impact your costs? and on the other side of that, maybe how is it impacting industry growth? is it driving growth higher than expected?
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
let me start with the second one, and i'll let rich hit the first one on draftkings. i think on podcasting, i think you saw, jessica, in the numbers here that if you look at podtrac, we're actually increasing our lead over the other podcast publishers. and if you look at the revenue, i think it's on slide 8. if you look at the magna estimates, with an industry, including us, it's up 60%, we're up 184%, again, clear evidence that we continue to gain share. and i think that is really the flywheel effect that we have. and no matter how much money people bring to the party to play in the podcast game, the reality is it's about having a hit show. and every creator who comes to podcasting has a dream of having a hit show. the best way to get a hit show is to start with the biggest podcaster publisher which is us. so, we journey on sort of that flywheel is because we tend to get first look as a result of being the biggest. in terms of costs, not only do we do deals with shonda rhimes, with the nba, the nfl, but we also produce podcast ourselves internally with no profit participation. and we have hits there as well. so we have sort of a marvelous diversity here, which gives us a lot of control over it. and by being number one and probably getting more looks at product than anyone else, we're able to be pickier. and given our kind of economic position, we're able to say no to something that doesn't make sense. and really carefully watch the economics and not fall into the trap some people do of chasing profitless prosperity. you're not going to see that from us.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
jess, it's rich. let me -- i just want to add one thing to what bob commented on podcasting and then go specifically to your question on draftkings. just to remind everybody, we, as bob articulated, now get 184% of revenue in this quarter. but if you go back, i think the numbers already up 142% in q1 on revenues. we were up 152% in q2 on revenues. and obviously, we're starting to lap bigger and bigger numbers in terms of the overall growth. so i think that really proves out and you've been hearing from us about podcasting for some period of time. this strategy that we're on, the ad-supported strategy as opposed to going behind a paywall and the way to bob's point in terms of the flywheel effect, the benefit we get, not just on the top line on the numbers, but obviously also on the bottom line, as we said, because it's accretive to our overall margin. so i just wanted to remind everybody that with respect to podcasting because there is a lot of noise in the marketplace out there. when it comes to draftkings, we really can't disclose any more financial details. what i would say is, as we're all well aware, this is one of the fastest-growing advertising categories and then to partner with draftkings and the number one company in audio is pretty exciting, i think, for all of us. and i think also the larger point because there's a lot of people making a lot of claims out there, but we've got the leading audio sports assets and bob articulated this during the release. but just as a reminder, we're with the largest sports podcast network in the industry, we have our deal with the nfl. we have our deal with the nba. we've got the iheart sports network, which reaches 75 million people. so yes, this deal is significant. and what i think -- and by the way, it is not exclusive. and what i think you should think about is it's a deal that touches all of our platforms. and as everybody starts to think about modeling out the future and we continue the momentum into 2022 into the fourth quarter this year and into 2022. looking at this, should give everybody a lot of confidence in terms of projecting out our future growth.
operator
your next question comes from the line of steve cahall from wells fargo.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
maybe first just to talk about what you're seeing in the ad market, bob, i think you're the first advertising company this quarter to say that what's going on in supply chain isn't really impacting the business. and i know you had audiocon in las vegas recently. so maybe you can just talk about what you think is going on there? i mean, is it that folks are moving share into audio? or how can you maybe kind of put some context around maybe the difference in what you're seeing in ad trends versus a lot of your peers.
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
sure. well, look, i think certainly, there are some people that are being affected by it, but there are some people that are doing better at the same time, so it's sort of give and takes. but i think we also see is anytime somebody -- and what we're hearing is anytime somebody's got a temporary supply problem, but they've got demand, they -- i think most people we talk to realize they're going to get their supply sooner or later. and what is important is to hold that demand. during a period like this, we probably have -- and it's hard to prove this, but probably have a slight advantage because we're more efficient. if you look at tv, for example, most people think tv and radio deliver about the same impact at the same weight level, yet tv is about 3x to 4x the cpm of radio. so if you want to keep your demand, one of the most efficient/cheapest ways to keep your demand is to substitute radio into some of the slots for some of the more expensive media. so in a sort of a strange perverse way, people who want to hold on to the demand, but don't yet have a supply to fulfill it, probably are looking for efficiencies in marketing. and if they're really thoughtful about it, we probably are a good solution to that. so look, i think that's sort of the major issue. and again, as we talk to people, i don't think we've talked to any advertisers that think this is sort of a permanent supply problem or they're going to have to sell diminished quantities. so they think they'll catch up. and i think every one of them is focused on, wait a minute, i don't want to have to restart my demand because they realize if they step away from having that desire for the product, they are giving up a huge advantage they have in something they've built.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
steve, the only thing i just -- again, just to reinforce one of a few things we mentioned early in support of what bob just said, there is the general trend, obviously, in terms of audio being hot. second thing is, i think, again, brings to light a multiplatform because whether you've got broadcast or network or ttwn or everything we're talking about podcasting or digital or digital ex podcasting, a lot of events that bob touched upon, you can work with us in so many different ways in terms of coming into our company. and then i also think we've got the technology solution and the ability to meet the needs of advertisers and play in the big digital tam and capabilities, and you've heard us say this before that we didn't really have a year ago or even 6 months ago, that full and integrated acquisition of triton. and then finally, we benefit from the diversity of our advertising base. we have no one category that's more than 5%. we have no individual advertisers that's more than 2%. and that really touches upon bob's comment is, sure, we have some categories that are down but we've also benefited greatly from some categories that are up also. so it's a total mixture.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes. and then maybe expanding on that, could you talk about what smartaudio is running as a percentage of multiplatform sales and maybe where you see that going over the next year or 2?
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, we haven't given out the number, but obviously, we think that is going to continue to increase. we've built out the whole smartaudio platform so that our broadcast radio can be bought and sold like digital can be built around the cohorts. and with the triton marketplace, which we announced, which we're going to launch in january of next year, we're talking about the first truly integrated audio marketplace in which you will be able to buy one set of audiences cohorts on an integrated basis across podcasting, digital radio, into broadcast radio using smartaudio. and i think that gives us -- not only us, but i think the audio industry, a great new tool to bring money broadly into this business. and when you look at the kind of reach radio has, every advertiser today has got a problem. they need reach. digital doesn't reach the numbers that radio does. tv is declining, and certainly doesn't reach what radio does. and people at least have to be able to see or hear your commercial for it to have an impact. so radio winds up, i think, in this pretty good position of being this reach enhancer for everyone. well, by using smartaudio, we're able to put it into a language and a technology that they're comfortable with and looking for us to do. so i think as an overall percentage of our advertising on broadcast radio, we look for smartaudio to be continuing to climb.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
and by the way, steve, and if you think about it, if you look at the significant progress we continue to make on the multiplatform line and what bob just touched upon, which includes smartaudio, and we've talked about as people growing past but getting back to '19 levels, and we've talked about as a total company, and we commonly get the question, do you want to get back there on the multiplatform line and your confidence in getting back on the multiplatform line. remember what bob just articulated, our capabilities of smartaudio in the multiplatform line, that too enables us to tap into the digital tam, the $160 billion plus $170 billion digital tam. it's not just our digital line that could tap into it, but it's also our multiplatform line.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
and maybe last one, kind of a housekeeping one. as we think about next year, any major changes on either cash interest, cash tax or capex we should be mindful of?
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
well, we're going to see capital expenditures go down. i think we said this quarter, we spent approximately $50 million of capital expenditures, an increase from the mid-30s last year, and the major increase in that is due to our real estate, in terms of our downsizing of our real estate, just getting more efficient in that. and again, those operating savings are already in the expense saving numbers that we've talked about on the modernization efforts and on the $200 million that we said would be -- a substantial piece would be permitted for this year. and also on interest expense, i think, as you all know, one is we just had the preferred that we retired. that we retired early from may of last year, which is going to bring some interest expense savings coupled with the fact that reinforces our confidence in the business. and i think everybody should take our payment of the $60 million on both accounts. and then finally, as a reminder, we do have the refinancing on [indecipherable] coming up, which is about one-third of our interest expense. and we're heavily looking at our options, but rest assured that we expect that interest expense to go down and be another lever for value creation for us.

our last question comes from the line of dan day from b. riley securities.
daniel day -- b. riley securities -- analyst
just first one, we've talked about this 4x leverage target for a while, and you look to be getting there in the next quarter or two as long as -- at least on a forward-looking basis. i guess once you're there, talk about the priorities for free cash flow between paying a dividend, buying back shares, how you weigh that against m&a opportunities, whether this is a business that you see given how cyclical it is, can even support a dividend there might be a debate out there on that. so, curious your thoughts on that.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
well, i'm not -- this won't surprise you and really appreciate the question, but i'm not going to comment on anything specifically including your comment on when we're going to get to -- including your comment on when we're going to get to 4x. again, all we've said is our target is to get to 4x leverage, and i think everybody could see the significant progress we've made toward doing that. and when we get in around 4x leverage, bob and myself working with our board and working with mike and the team will look at our options and what's the best way to get money back to our shareholders, which i would suggest that just paying down debt right now in our capital structure is just another form of returning capital to our shareholders because just from a numerical basis, what it goes to the equity value out there. and we'll always continue to look at any potential assets that can help the total iheart base. but i think if you look at our history since bob and i have been with the company, whether it's jelli or stuffworks or any of the assets -- acquisitions that we made, they've always been -- none of them, i would suggest, individually have been significant to overall iheart, quite frankly, even in total, that make significantly iheart capital structure, but each and every one of them have made the rest of the iheart base more valuable. and so i don't see any change to that pattern.
daniel day -- b. riley securities -- analyst
got you. i want to turn to another topic. just the draftkings deal here that you announced. obviously, sports betting being such a big opportunity here for radio advertisers. i mean do you see either at the local or national level, maybe the calculation changing for how aggressive do you get in terms of going after the live sports radio rights? is that something you see as changing and getting more aggressive there?
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
we're actually pretty aggressive. and actually, we have quite a number of major teams carried on our radio stations play-by-play. we have a number of big sports talk radio stations. we have a -- even have some specific sports betting stations, the gambler is the name of them, where we run them. and then we are doing the iheart sports network, which is sports information, even on our music stations, reaches about 75 million people according to nielsen, and i think probably is the largest sports network. so we cover the gamut. and when you go to podcasting, we've got the biggest sports podcasting network as well, not only the leagues that rich talked about earlier, but also colin cowherd, dan patrick. we've got a lot of big names there with a lot of success. so we continue to invest heavily in it, and i think it's a great investment for us.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
and by the way, one thing i'd say, maybe relative to all of these comments and the questions we're just talking about is our focus here is really to drive the value of this company -- drive the equity value of this company. so everything you hear, bob and i talking about, whether it's from an operating standpoint or a balance sheet standpoint, is put through that filter with the two of us and our board of directors. well, first of all, there's no other questions. i want to thank everybody for taking the time to hear the iheart story. thank everybody for the support. and bob, myself and mike are available any time for follow-up in your questions.

operator
good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to the iheartmedia third quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr. mike mcguinness, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
michael mcguinness -- executive vice president, deputy chief financial officer & head of investor relations
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. joining me for today's discussion are bob pittman, our chairman and ceo; and rich bressler, our president, coo and cfo. at the conclusion of our prepared remarks, management will take your questions. please note that in addition to our press release, we have an investor presentation that you can use to follow along with our remarks.
before we begin, let me quickly cover the safe harbor statements on slide 2. during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including the current and expected impact of covid-19 on the company's liquidity, financial position and results of operations. these estimates are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could materially differ from these expectations and assumptions, and these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the sec. during this call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures can be found in our earnings release or in the investor presentation available on our website.
and now, i'll turn the call over to bob.
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
thanks, mike, and good afternoon, everybody. thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. we feel great about being able to deliver a quarter like this. we think it's further evidence of the success of our company's continuing transformation, data-led digital and podcast focus, along with the unparalleled audience reach of our broadcast radio assets, supported by the largest sales force and the only unified ad tech stack in audio advertising, all with the strong flywheel effect of our scale and leadership position.
rich and i want to again acknowledge our employees. it's their ongoing commitment to innovation and creativity that's behind our momentum and the strong results we're announcing today, and it will set the stage for a full recovery to 2019 adjusted ebitda levels by the end of this year. rich will take you through our detailed financials, sharing the performance of our individual business segments and highlighting both the strong growth and potential of our digital business, including podcasting and the strong recovery and growth potential of our radio business. we hope this gives you the information you need to accurately evaluate each of our business segments and our business as a whole.
our business continues its strong revenue and profit growth in the third quarter. our third quarter consolidated revenue grew 25% compared to prior year. you'll recall that our guidance was an increase of 20% versus prior year. when excluding political, q3 revenue increased 31% versus prior year. we generated adjusted ebitda of $230 million, which grew by 42% versus prior year, while generating $45 million of free cash flow. our revenue in q3 2021 is now 98% of our revenue in q3 2019, continuing our trend of sequential quarterly improvement compared to 2019. the multiplatform group grew q3 revenue by 19% versus prior year and adjusted ebitda by 50%. and the digital audio group grew q3 revenue by 77% versus prior year and adjusted ebitda by 91%. podcast revenue was up 184% versus the prior year, and digital ex-podcast revenue was up 51% versus the prior year. additionally, our adjusted ebitda margin significantly expanded in the quarter, reflecting the revenue growth, the success of our previously announced savings initiatives and our continued focus on expense management. we have a high operating leverage business. in q3 2021, the multiplatform group margins were 32% and the digital audio group margins were 33%, both of which represent year-over-year and sequential quarterly margin expansion.
turning now to the results of our two largest segments; our iheartmedia digital audio group, which includes our high-growth podcasting business and the iheartradio digital service, the industry's number one digital radio service with a 5x lead in digital usage over the next largest commercial broadcast company as measured by triton. it also includes our websites and newsletters with their monthly audience of over 135 million unique users in the united states according to omniture, our digital services and programs for both national and local partners and our digital ad tech companies. our iheartradio service also has a social footprint that includes 241 million fans and followers, which is approximately 7x larger than the next largest audio player.
the digital audio group continues to increase its importance relative to the company's consolidated results and it delivered another strong performance in the third quarter with revenues up 77% year-over-year and adjusted ebitda up 91% year-over-year, making it one of the best digital performers in the marketplace today. digital revenues are now about one-third the size of our multiplatform group revenues and have more than doubled over the last five quarters. even with the expected growth of our multiplatform group, we believe digital will ultimately grow to multiplatform group revenue levels and beyond due to the high-growth assets of the digital audio group and the size and expected expansion of the digital advertising tam.
included in the digital revenues are our podcasting revenues, which were up 184% year-over-year. it's important to note that our podcast business is not only profitable but has margins that are actually accretive to our overall company margin. our podcast business continues to reach new levels for revenue, profitability, listenership and downloads. according to podtrac, the industry standard for third-party podcast measurement, we are the number one podcast publisher with 30 million u.s. unique monthly listeners and 282 million global monthly downloads and streams, an all-time high. not only do we generate an audience 1.5x larger than the second largest publisher in the space, it was 3x larger than the next largest commercial podcaster. also consider the scale of our podcast offerings, iheart has 2.5x as many ranked shows and top 10 shows across podtrac's 19 content categories than the next largest podcast network. we also have the most shows with over one million downloads. these stats highlight the breadth and depth of our leadership position and the power of the flywheel effect that comes with it. and remember, the economics in podcasting are with the publisher, not the distributor. it is the publisher that generates the ad revenue and profit, and we are the number one podcast publisher by a substantial margin.
our non-podcast digital business also continued its strong performance, growing 51% in q3. these revenues, which include our digital audio streaming product, display advertising and digital services outperformed the digital ex-podcasting industry growth of 34% as reported by magna for q3 2021. this strong outperformance is driven in part by the fact that we have the largest audio sales force in the united states, executing our strategy of any seller anywhere can sell anything, supported by our unique technology. although our podcasting success understandably gets a lot of attention, we want to make sure that we also highlight the strength of our non-podcasting digital businesses.
now, let's move to the iheartmedia multiplatform group which includes the largest broadcast radio group in america by all metrics, reach, audience size, revenue, earnings and even number of stations. it also includes our national sales organization, our live and virtual events business, our networks business and our bin, black information network business. the multiplatform group audience is twice the size of the next largest broadcast radio company and also has twice the audience of the largest digital music streaming service and almost 5x their ad-enabled audience. we are the only audio player in broadcast or digital that has broad national reach in addition to an unparalleled local footprint.
the iheartmedia multiplatform group also reaches more people every month with its broadcast radio assets alone than any other media company in america, and that includes both google and facebook. multiplatform group revenues were up 19% year-over-year in q3 and were down only 17% compared to 2019, continuing our sequential quarterly improvement compared to 2019. these year-over-year and sequential results are evidence that our multiplatform group revenues are well on their way to recovering to 2019 levels and that they will continue to grow beyond that. our share of the broadcast radio sector revenues continues to expand, outperforming the broadcast sector as a whole, as reported by miller kaplan, which measures the revenue performance of select broadcast markets. i'd like to give you a couple of data points about why we're so confident in the growth potential of the multiplatform group and the future of broadcast radio as an advertising medium.
let's start with a quick overview of the entire audio listening landscape and the revenue potential for each segment. using nielsen and comscore, which are the industry standards for audience measurement, when looking at the split of listening between broadcast radio and streaming digital audio, broadcast gets about 75% of all listening and streaming digital audio, which includes spotify, apple music, amazon music, pandora and iheartradio, among others, gets about 25% of the listening.
now, let me translate that into advertising potential. it's important to remember that there are two sectors of audio. one is comprised of music services like apple music, amazon music, spotify and even pandora. it's where listeners go for their personal music collection, replacing cds, lps and music downloads. consumers go to their music collection when they want to shut out the world. it has no weather or traffic, no talker information, no personalities and any ads that run there are perceived as interruptions of this pure music experience.
radio on the other hand is the opposite. it's social. it's where people go and they want to know what's going on in the world, where they go for companionship, music, news, gossip, information, humor, who's hot and who's not. in this environment, information is key and even commercials are part of that experience. commercials are native content on radio, but they are interruptions to the music collection. and these differences in product appeal are why music collection services can't run anywhere near the same amount of advertising inventory as broadcast radio. that, combined with the listening differential, means broadcast radio has a significant revenue potential advantage over streaming music collections.
in the past, radio revenue has been limited by its lack of data and from not being of the modern advertising ecosystem that the digital giants pioneered. but that's changing. and you've seen the progress we've made with both smartaudio and our ad tech platform led by triton. the music collection services, on the other hand, are limited by audience reach, time spent and probably more importantly, advertising load possibilities in their music-only environment. when i analyze the advertising revenue potential of both sectors, i definitely prefer our hand by a lot.
now, let me give you a few more facts about the power of broadcast radio. when it comes to competing with other media formats, it might surprise you to know that consumers spend about 50% more time with broadcast radio every day than they do social media and broadcast radio has actually grown its number of listeners in the past 15 years. digital listening has also grown, but the key here is that the overall listing pie is getting bigger as new listening platforms are added. this growth of the pie is driven by the strength of broadcast radio and the music collection services converting cd and music download listeners into music streamers. we know that ad revenue inevitably follows consumer usage, and we're seeing this happen in real time with the decline of linear tv.
a warc study released in september shows that media spending is still out of whack. tv consumption has dropped to 24% of total media time, while audio consumption has grown to 31% of total usage. however, only 9% of advertising spend goes to audio indicating that some advertisers have been slow to react to this new reality. and additionally, with 40% of tv viewers classified as light tv viewers, as an advertising medium, tv now faces a significant reach gap. broadcast radio is uniquely capable of filling this gap for tv advertisers, reaching 90% of light tv viewers compared to only 50% for ott options. our ability to address both the reach and light tv viewer gaps gives us access to the $58 billion tv tam, which is further support for our confidence in the growth potential of our multiplatform group revenues.
now, let me move to our events business; also included in our multiplatform group where the consumer demand for our live events is strong. our q3 2021 sponsorship and events revenue were up 48% compared to prior year. and this quarter includes the impact of the return to live marquee iheartradio music festival, which was virtual last year. ticket sales exceeded 2019 levels and the event generated over 15 billion social impressions, which was 20x larger than lollapalooza. the high consumer demand for live events can also be seen in the recent success of the iheartradio fiesta latina and this past weekend's live iheart country festival. live events are back and coming up as our 11-day live and in-person iheartradio jingle ball tour in december.
i'd like to take a minute now to address a couple of relevant topics. covid, of course, continues to affect the country. while its human and social toll is real, the advertising revenue impact appears to be behind us. supply chain issues are also making headlines, but they have not had a material impact on our business. and finally, i also want to touch on apple's recent change to their data and privacy policy. some digital companies have said they are feeling a negative impact to their ad revenue as a result of apple's new policy. we aren't and there are several reasons why.
first, we have our own platforms with our own first-party data. second, we built for the future using smart audio digital-like broadcast inventory around cohorts, which are defined target audiences like auto buyers or new parents, not one-to-one using cookies and mobile ids. even with our purely digital inventory, we've stressed cohorts instead of focusing on one-to-one. third, our audio ad tech platform makes us the only audio company that can seamlessly target and serve to the same cohorts across all platforms from podcast to digital to broadcast.
big picture, we believe that cohorts are replacing one-to-one marketing, and we think we are well positioned for the shift toward data-infused ad buy. due to the changes in privacy restrictions and other factors, we see the world moving past one-to-one targeting, past cookies, past mobile ids and toward premium platforms that are brand-safe, measurable and that have real scale, like ours. in this new world of advertising, iheart is uniquely positioned to deliver targetable cohorts in audio comprised of highly engaged audiences with scale that is unparalleled in the u.s.
before i turn it over to rich, i want to touch upon the important announcement that we made yesterday about our multiyear strategic partnership with draftkings. this partnership is in one of the fastest-growing advertising categories and will enable draftkings to use the assets of the number one audio company in sports, iheart. this partnership builds on iheart's industry-leading audio sports assets, including the largest sports podcast network in the industry, which includes partnerships with the nfl, the nba and sports podcast led by marquee talent like colin cowherd and dan patrick as well as the iheart sports network, which reaches 75 million americans according to nielsen, our sports talk and sports betting stations and also our ongoing live coverage of professional teams on select iheart stations across the country. we expect sports and sports betting to be a significant growth engine for us going forward, and this partnership with draftkings is further evidence of that potential.
rich and i and the rest of the iheart management team are excited about the tangible results iheart's unique audio assets are delivering, driven by our unparalleled consumer reach across broadcast radio, digital radio and podcasting, and supported by our unmatched ad tech platform and suite of data analytic capabilities. we believe the revenue potential of our assets is superior to anything else in the audio sector and we're excited about using these assets to continue to drive growth into 2022 and beyond.
and with that, i'd like to turn it over to rich.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
thanks, bob, and good afternoon, everyone. as bob laid out, we delivered strong results in the third quarter, which reflect continued success of our operating strategies and the power of our unique audio assets as well as improving trends in the macroeconomic environment.
turning to slide 12 of our investor deck; our consolidated revenues were up 25% year-over-year exceeding our guidance for the quarter of up 20% year-over-year. when excluding political revenues, q3 increased 31% year-over-year. we are also extremely pleased with our continued sequential improvement against 2019. our revenue in q3 2021 was down only 2% from q3 2019, improving from being down 6% in q2 2021 compared to 2019 and improving from being down 11% in q1 2021 compared to 2019. direct operating expenses increased 20%, driven primarily by the significant increase in revenue, which drives higher content and profit-sharing expenses, third-party digital costs and expenses related to the return of local and national live events like the iheartradio music festival. these increases were partially offset by lower employee compensation and other reductions resulting from our significant modernization and cost reduction initiatives.
sg&a expenses increased 17%, driven by increased employee compensation expenses, resulting primarily from higher variable bonus expense based on financial performance and higher sales commissions due to higher revenue. as a reminder, last year, the vast majority of our employees did not get paid a bonus. and as a result, you'll see our corporate expenses increase year-over-year. in addition, increased headcount from the investments in our fast-growing digital business contributed to the increases in sg&a. these increases were partially offset by the impact of our significant modernization and cost reduction initiatives and lower bad debt expense. our third quarter gaap operating income was $80.1 million compared to an operating income of $39.4 million in the prior year quarter, and our third quarter adjusted ebitda was $230.2 million compared to $162.1 million in the prior quarter.
if you turn back to slide 4, i'll provide additional color on the performance of our operating segments. and as a note, there are additional slides in the investor presentation on our segment revenue performance. digital audio group revenues were up 77% year-over-year and adjusted ebitda was up 91% year-over-year. within the digital audio group is our podcasting business, whose revenues grew 184% year-over-year, and our non-podcasting digital revenues, which grew 51% year-over-year, also continuing their strong performance. and importantly, we expanded our third quarter digital audio group margins to 33%, a 230 basis point improvement year-over-year and a sequential improvement of 520 basis points from q2 2021, which as we mentioned last quarter, were negatively impacted by a few onetime expenses.
multiplatform group revenues were up 19% in q3 and continued our sequential improvement compared to 2019. q3 revenues were down only 17% compared to 2019, a 390 basis point improvement from q2 2021, which was down 21% versus q2 2019. and a significant improvement compared to q1 2021, which was down 26% versus q1 2019. q3 adjusted ebitda margins were 32%, a significant improvement from 25% adjusted ebitda margins in q3 2020 and on a sequential basis, margins improved 170 basis points from q2 2021. that margin improvement was achieved even though the quarter included the return to live and the associated expenses for the iheartradio music festival, which, while profitable, does not have the same margin profile as the rest of our multiplatform group businesses.
looking at the revenue streams within the multiplatform group. our broadcast revenues grew 20% year-over-year. within the broadcast line is smartaudio, our data-infused programmatic platform. smartaudio was up 43% year-over-year in the third quarter. as a reminder, it uses the same inventory as the rest of broadcast radio, highlighting the value of data and ad tech. and as we continue to add new technologies and data capabilities, we expect that our smartaudio product will generate revenue from the digital and tv tams, especially considering the changes to the advertising landscape that bob discussed earlier.
our networks revenues were up 8% compared to prior year, which includes our premier networks, which were up 2% compared to prior year as well as ttwn, the total traffic and weather network, which was up 14% compared to the prior year. and as a reminder, our premier business was less impacted by covid in 2020, which affects the comparison. our q3 2021 sponsorship and events revenues were up 48% compared to prior year. as bob mentioned, this reflects the strength of the iheart brand, the high demand for live music and advertisers' desire to interact with this engaged and enthusiastic customer base. the audio & media services group revenue was down 12% on a reported basis. excluding the impact of political, revenues in this segment were up 13% year-over-year.
on slide 18, there is a summary of our debt. at quarter end, we had approximately $5.4 billion of net debt outstanding, which includes a cash balance of $369 million, and these figures include the previously announced voluntary prepayment of $250 million of our term loan. we will also benefit from the concurrent repricing of the term loan, which will have a positive impact on our interest expense on a go-forward basis. at the end of october, we repurchased the full balance of our $60 million preferred stock prior to its call date of may 1, 2022, which is not included in these figures. in doing so, we realized interest savings, but more importantly, we exited the most expensive and restrictive instruments on the iheart balance sheet, reinforcing iheart's commitment to improving our capital structure and demonstrating our confidence in our business moving forward.
as a reminder, the terms of our debt structure include no material maintenance covenants and there are no material debt maturities prior to 2026. we continue to actively monitor market conditions and will opportunistically optimize our capital structure. we ended q3 2021 net debt-to-ebitda leverage of 6.9x. we remain committed to achieving our previously announced leverage target of approximately 4x, and we expect to continue our progress toward that goal.
in the third quarter, we generated $45 million of free cash flow. as we mentioned last quarter, the accelerated consolidation of our real estate footprint, which is part of our previously announced modernization and cost savings initiatives has enabled us to sell certain redundant assets, which has partially offset the real estate initiatives, gross capital expenditures. free cash flow, including net proceeds from these real estate asset sales would be $54 million for q3. as a reminder, our capital expenditures are elevated this year as a result of onetime spend related to our real estate consolidation. we continue to successfully execute against our previously announced savings initiatives. as a reminder, our pre-covid modernization initiatives achieved a $100 million run rate target by mid-2021, and we remain on target to replicate the majority of the previously announced $200 million post-covid savings in 2021. we believe these actions, coupled with our continuing revenue growth, leaves us well positioned for margin expansion as evidenced in q3.
consolidated margins were 25%, up from 21% in q2 2021, 14% in q1 2021 and up 300 basis points from 22% in q3 2020. multiplatform group margins were 32%, up from 30% in q2 2021, 21% in q1 2021 and up 660 basis points from 25% in q3 2020. digital audio group margins were 33%, up from 27% in q2 2021, 25% in q1 2021 and up 230 basis points from 30% in q3 2020.
as we look forward to q4, i want to provide you with the following. our october consolidated revenues were up approximately 1% compared to 2019 and approximately flat year-over-year. it is important to note that october 2020 was our biggest month for political revenue. excluding the impact of political, october's year-over-year growth would have been approximately 22%. for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be up approximately 10% year-over-year or 22%, excluding the impact of political, implying our q4 revenue will be slightly higher compared to 2019. and consistent with our previous guidance, we reaffirm that we expect to return to 2019 adjusted ebitda levels by the end of 2021. no matter what valuation method you use, utilizing a valuation of the sum of the parts of potential future revenue and earnings growth, free cash flow per share, et cetera, we think iheart is undervalued using any metric. we hope the information we have provided today gives you confidence in the value of this company.
bob and i and the rest of the management team are excited by these results, and the audience, revenue and earnings momentum in our business. and as a reminder, we'll give specific 2022 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. i'd like to close on the same note that bob began on. we thank our employees, without whom this journey would not be possible, the communities we serve and our business partners. we appreciate everyone joining our third quarter earnings call.
and now we will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. thank you.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of jessica ehrlich from bofa securities.
jessica ehrlich -- bank of america securities -- analyst
i have two questions or two topics. one is on draftkings. can you give us a little bit more color on the economics, timing of impact? and is it exclusive, meaning can you do other sports betting deals? and can they do other radio deals? and then just one on podcasting. with more players coming into the market, there's just some -- so much money kind of chasing content. how is it impacting your costs? or how do you expect it will impact your costs? and on the other side of that, maybe how is it impacting industry growth? is it driving growth higher than expected?
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
let me start with the second one, and i'll let rich hit the first one on draftkings. i think on podcasting, i think you saw, jessica, in the numbers here that if you look at podtrac, we're actually increasing our lead over the other podcast publishers. and if you look at the revenue, i think it's on slide 8. if you look at the magna estimates, with an industry, including us, it's up 60%, we're up 184%, again, clear evidence that we continue to gain share. and i think that is really the flywheel effect that we have. and no matter how much money people bring to the party to play in the podcast game, the reality is it's about having a hit show. and every creator who comes to podcasting has a dream of having a hit show. the best way to get a hit show is to start with the biggest podcaster publisher which is us. so, we journey on sort of that flywheel is because we tend to get first look as a result of being the biggest. in terms of costs, not only do we do deals with shonda rhimes, with the nba, the nfl, but we also produce podcast ourselves internally with no profit participation. and we have hits there as well. so we have sort of a marvelous diversity here, which gives us a lot of control over it. and by being number one and probably getting more looks at product than anyone else, we're able to be pickier. and given our kind of economic position, we're able to say no to something that doesn't make sense. and really carefully watch the economics and not fall into the trap some people do of chasing profitless prosperity. you're not going to see that from us.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
jess, it's rich. let me -- i just want to add one thing to what bob commented on podcasting and then go specifically to your question on draftkings. just to remind everybody, we, as bob articulated, now get 184% of revenue in this quarter. but if you go back, i think the numbers already up 142% in q1 on revenues. we were up 152% in q2 on revenues. and obviously, we're starting to lap bigger and bigger numbers in terms of the overall growth. so i think that really proves out and you've been hearing from us about podcasting for some period of time. this strategy that we're on, the ad-supported strategy as opposed to going behind a paywall and the way to bob's point in terms of the flywheel effect, the benefit we get, not just on the top line on the numbers, but obviously also on the bottom line, as we said, because it's accretive to our overall margin. so i just wanted to remind everybody that with respect to podcasting because there is a lot of noise in the marketplace out there. when it comes to draftkings, we really can't disclose any more financial details. what i would say is, as we're all well aware, this is one of the fastest-growing advertising categories and then to partner with draftkings and the number one company in audio is pretty exciting, i think, for all of us. and i think also the larger point because there's a lot of people making a lot of claims out there, but we've got the leading audio sports assets and bob articulated this during the release. but just as a reminder, we're with the largest sports podcast network in the industry, we have our deal with the nfl. we have our deal with the nba. we've got the iheart sports network, which reaches 75 million people. so yes, this deal is significant. and what i think -- and by the way, it is not exclusive. and what i think you should think about is it's a deal that touches all of our platforms. and as everybody starts to think about modeling out the future and we continue the momentum into 2022 into the fourth quarter this year and into 2022. looking at this, should give everybody a lot of confidence in terms of projecting out our future growth.

your next question comes from the line of steve cahall from wells fargo.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
maybe first just to talk about what you're seeing in the ad market, bob, i think you're the first advertising company this quarter to say that what's going on in supply chain isn't really impacting the business. and i know you had audiocon in las vegas recently. so maybe you can just talk about what you think is going on there? i mean, is it that folks are moving share into audio? or how can you maybe kind of put some context around maybe the difference in what you're seeing in ad trends versus a lot of your peers.
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
sure. well, look, i think certainly, there are some people that are being affected by it, but there are some people that are doing better at the same time, so it's sort of give and takes. but i think we also see is anytime somebody -- and what we're hearing is anytime somebody's got a temporary supply problem, but they've got demand, they -- i think most people we talk to realize they're going to get their supply sooner or later. and what is important is to hold that demand. during a period like this, we probably have -- and it's hard to prove this, but probably have a slight advantage because we're more efficient. if you look at tv, for example, most people think tv and radio deliver about the same impact at the same weight level, yet tv is about 3x to 4x the cpm of radio. so if you want to keep your demand, one of the most efficient/cheapest ways to keep your demand is to substitute radio into some of the slots for some of the more expensive media. so in a sort of a strange perverse way, people who want to hold on to the demand, but don't yet have a supply to fulfill it, probably are looking for efficiencies in marketing. and if they're really thoughtful about it, we probably are a good solution to that. so look, i think that's sort of the major issue. and again, as we talk to people, i don't think we've talked to any advertisers that think this is sort of a permanent supply problem or they're going to have to sell diminished quantities. so they think they'll catch up. and i think every one of them is focused on, wait a minute, i don't want to have to restart my demand because they realize if they step away from having that desire for the product, they are giving up a huge advantage they have in something they've built.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
steve, the only thing i just -- again, just to reinforce one of a few things we mentioned early in support of what bob just said, there is the general trend, obviously, in terms of audio being hot. second thing is, i think, again, brings to light a multiplatform because whether you've got broadcast or network or ttwn or everything we're talking about podcasting or digital or digital ex podcasting, a lot of events that bob touched upon, you can work with us in so many different ways in terms of coming into our company. and then i also think we've got the technology solution and the ability to meet the needs of advertisers and play in the big digital tam and capabilities, and you've heard us say this before that we didn't really have a year ago or even 6 months ago, that full and integrated acquisition of triton. and then finally, we benefit from the diversity of our advertising base. we have no one category that's more than 5%. we have no individual advertisers that's more than 2%. and that really touches upon bob's comment is, sure, we have some categories that are down but we've also benefited greatly from some categories that are up also. so it's a total mixture.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes. and then maybe expanding on that, could you talk about what smartaudio is running as a percentage of multiplatform sales and maybe where you see that going over the next year or 2?
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, we haven't given out the number, but obviously, we think that is going to continue to increase. we've built out the whole smartaudio platform so that our broadcast radio can be bought and sold like digital can be built around the cohorts. and with the triton marketplace, which we announced, which we're going to launch in january of next year, we're talking about the first truly integrated audio marketplace in which you will be able to buy one set of audiences cohorts on an integrated basis across podcasting, digital radio, into broadcast radio using smartaudio. and i think that gives us -- not only us, but i think the audio industry, a great new tool to bring money broadly into this business. and when you look at the kind of reach radio has, every advertiser today has got a problem. they need reach. digital doesn't reach the numbers that radio does. tv is declining, and certainly doesn't reach what radio does. and people at least have to be able to see or hear your commercial for it to have an impact. so radio winds up, i think, in this pretty good position of being this reach enhancer for everyone. well, by using smartaudio, we're able to put it into a language and a technology that they're comfortable with and looking for us to do. so i think as an overall percentage of our advertising on broadcast radio, we look for smartaudio to be continuing to climb.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
and by the way, steve, and if you think about it, if you look at the significant progress we continue to make on the multiplatform line and what bob just touched upon, which includes smartaudio, and we've talked about as people growing past but getting back to '19 levels, and we've talked about as a total company, and we commonly get the question, do you want to get back there on the multiplatform line and your confidence in getting back on the multiplatform line. remember what bob just articulated, our capabilities of smartaudio in the multiplatform line, that too enables us to tap into the digital tam, the $160 billion plus $170 billion digital tam. it's not just our digital line that could tap into it, but it's also our multiplatform line.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
and maybe last one, kind of a housekeeping one. as we think about next year, any major changes on either cash interest, cash tax or capex we should be mindful of?
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
well, we're going to see capital expenditures go down. i think we said this quarter, we spent approximately $50 million of capital expenditures, an increase from the mid-30s last year, and the major increase in that is due to our real estate, in terms of our downsizing of our real estate, just getting more efficient in that. and again, those operating savings are already in the expense saving numbers that we've talked about on the modernization efforts and on the $200 million that we said would be -- a substantial piece would be permitted for this year. and also on interest expense, i think, as you all know, one is we just had the preferred that we retired. that we retired early from may of last year, which is going to bring some interest expense savings coupled with the fact that reinforces our confidence in the business. and i think everybody should take our payment of the $60 million on both accounts. and then finally, as a reminder, we do have the refinancing on [indecipherable] coming up, which is about one-third of our interest expense. and we're heavily looking at our options, but rest assured that we expect that interest expense to go down and be another lever for value creation for us.
operator
our last question comes from the line of dan day from b. riley securities.
daniel day -- b. riley securities -- analyst
just first one, we've talked about this 4x leverage target for a while, and you look to be getting there in the next quarter or two as long as -- at least on a forward-looking basis. i guess once you're there, talk about the priorities for free cash flow between paying a dividend, buying back shares, how you weigh that against m&a opportunities, whether this is a business that you see given how cyclical it is, can even support a dividend there might be a debate out there on that. so, curious your thoughts on that.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
well, i'm not -- this won't surprise you and really appreciate the question, but i'm not going to comment on anything specifically including your comment on when we're going to get to -- including your comment on when we're going to get to 4x. again, all we've said is our target is to get to 4x leverage, and i think everybody could see the significant progress we've made toward doing that. and when we get in around 4x leverage, bob and myself working with our board and working with mike and the team will look at our options and what's the best way to get money back to our shareholders, which i would suggest that just paying down debt right now in our capital structure is just another form of returning capital to our shareholders because just from a numerical basis, what it goes to the equity value out there. and we'll always continue to look at any potential assets that can help the total iheart base. but i think if you look at our history since bob and i have been with the company, whether it's jelli or stuffworks or any of the assets -- acquisitions that we made, they've always been -- none of them, i would suggest, individually have been significant to overall iheart, quite frankly, even in total, that make significantly iheart capital structure, but each and every one of them have made the rest of the iheart base more valuable. and so i don't see any change to that pattern.
daniel day -- b. riley securities -- analyst
got you. i want to turn to another topic. just the draftkings deal here that you announced. obviously, sports betting being such a big opportunity here for radio advertisers. i mean do you see either at the local or national level, maybe the calculation changing for how aggressive do you get in terms of going after the live sports radio rights? is that something you see as changing and getting more aggressive there?
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
we're actually pretty aggressive. and actually, we have quite a number of major teams carried on our radio stations play-by-play. we have a number of big sports talk radio stations. we have a -- even have some specific sports betting stations, the gambler is the name of them, where we run them. and then we are doing the iheart sports network, which is sports information, even on our music stations, reaches about 75 million people according to nielsen, and i think probably is the largest sports network. so we cover the gamut. and when you go to podcasting, we've got the biggest sports podcasting network as well, not only the leagues that rich talked about earlier, but also colin cowherd, dan patrick. we've got a lot of big names there with a lot of success. so we continue to invest heavily in it, and i think it's a great investment for us.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
and by the way, one thing i'd say, maybe relative to all of these comments and the questions we're just talking about is our focus here is really to drive the value of this company -- drive the equity value of this company. so everything you hear, bob and i talking about, whether it's from an operating standpoint or a balance sheet standpoint, is put through that filter with the two of us and our board of directors. well, first of all, there's no other questions. i want to thank everybody for taking the time to hear the iheart story. thank everybody for the support. and bob, myself and mike are available any time for follow-up in your questions.

operator
good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to the iheartmedia third quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr. mike mcguinness, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
michael mcguinness -- executive vice president, deputy chief financial officer & head of investor relations
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. joining me for today's discussion are bob pittman, our chairman and ceo; and rich bressler, our president, coo and cfo. at the conclusion of our prepared remarks, management will take your questions. please note that in addition to our press release, we have an investor presentation that you can use to follow along with our remarks.
before we begin, let me quickly cover the safe harbor statements on slide 2. during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including the current and expected impact of covid-19 on the company's liquidity, financial position and results of operations. these estimates are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could materially differ from these expectations and assumptions, and these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the sec. during this call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures can be found in our earnings release or in the investor presentation available on our website.
and now, i'll turn the call over to bob.
robert pittman -- chairman & chief executive officer
thanks, mike, and good afternoon, everybody. thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. we feel great about being able to deliver a quarter like this. we think it's further evidence of the success of our company's continuing transformation, data-led digital and podcast focus, along with the unparalleled audience reach of our broadcast radio assets, supported by the largest sales force and the only unified ad tech stack in audio advertising, all with the strong flywheel effect of our scale and leadership position.
rich and i want to again acknowledge our employees. it's their ongoing commitment to innovation and creativity that's behind our momentum and the strong results we're announcing today, and it will set the stage for a full recovery to 2019 adjusted ebitda levels by the end of this year. rich will take you through our detailed financials, sharing the performance of our individual business segments and highlighting both the strong growth and potential of our digital business, including podcasting and the strong recovery and growth potential of our radio business. we hope this gives you the information you need to accurately evaluate each of our business segments and our business as a whole.
our business continues its strong revenue and profit growth in the third quarter. our third quarter consolidated revenue grew 25% compared to prior year. you'll recall that our guidance was an increase of 20% versus prior year. when excluding political, q3 revenue increased 31% versus prior year. we generated adjusted ebitda of $230 million, which grew by 42% versus prior year, while generating $45 million of free cash flow. our revenue in q3 2021 is now 98% of our revenue in q3 2019, continuing our trend of sequential quarterly improvement compared to 2019. the multiplatform group grew q3 revenue by 19% versus prior year and adjusted ebitda by 50%. and the digital audio group grew q3 revenue by 77% versus prior year and adjusted ebitda by 91%. podcast revenue was up 184% versus the prior year, and digital ex-podcast revenue was up 51% versus the prior year. additionally, our adjusted ebitda margin significantly expanded in the quarter, reflecting the revenue growth, the success of our previously announced savings initiatives and our continued focus on expense management. we have a high operating leverage business. in q3 2021, the multiplatform group margins were 32% and the digital audio group margins were 33%, both of which represent year-over-year and sequential quarterly margin expansion.
turning now to the results of our two largest segments; our iheartmedia digital audio group, which includes our high-growth podcasting business and the iheartradio digital service, the industry's number one digital radio service with a 5x lead in digital usage over the next largest commercial broadcast company as measured by triton. it also includes our websites and newsletters with their monthly audience of over 135 million unique users in the united states according to omniture, our digital services and programs for both national and local partners and our digital ad tech companies. our iheartradio service also has a social footprint that includes 241 million fans and followers, which is approximately 7x larger than the next largest audio player.
the digital audio group continues to increase its importance relative to the company's consolidated results and it delivered another strong performance in the third quarter with revenues up 77% year-over-year and adjusted ebitda up 91% year-over-year, making it one of the best digital performers in the marketplace today. digital revenues are now about one-third the size of our multiplatform group revenues and have more than doubled over the last five quarters. even with the expected growth of our multiplatform group, we believe digital will ultimately grow to multiplatform group revenue levels and beyond due to the high-growth assets of the digital audio group and the size and expected expansion of the digital advertising tam.
included in the digital revenues are our podcasting revenues, which were up 184% year-over-year. it's important to note that our podcast business is not only profitable but has margins that are actually accretive to our overall company margin. our podcast business continues to reach new levels for revenue, profitability, listenership and downloads. according to podtrac, the industry standard for third-party podcast measurement, we are the number one podcast publisher with 30 million u.s. unique monthly listeners and 282 million global monthly downloads and streams, an all-time high. not only do we generate an audience 1.5x larger than the second largest publisher in the space, it was 3x larger than the next largest commercial podcaster. also consider the scale of our podcast offerings, iheart has 2.5x as many ranked shows and top 10 shows across podtrac's 19 content categories than the next largest podcast network. we also have the most shows with over one million downloads. these stats highlight the breadth and depth of our leadership position and the power of the flywheel effect that comes with it. and remember, the economics in podcasting are with the publisher, not the distributor. it is the publisher that generates the ad revenue and profit, and we are the number one podcast publisher by a substantial margin.
our non-podcast digital business also continued its strong performance, growing 51% in q3. these revenues, which include our digital audio streaming product, display advertising and digital services outperformed the digital ex-podcasting industry growth of 34% as reported by magna for q3 2021. this strong outperformance is driven in part by the fact that we have the largest audio sales force in the united states, executing our strategy of any seller anywhere can sell anything, supported by our unique technology. although our podcasting success understandably gets a lot of attention, we want to make sure that we also highlight the strength of our non-podcasting digital businesses.
now, let's move to the iheartmedia multiplatform group which includes the largest broadcast radio group in america by all metrics, reach, audience size, revenue, earnings and even number of stations. it also includes our national sales organization, our live and virtual events business, our networks business and our bin, black information network business. the multiplatform group audience is twice the size of the next largest broadcast radio company and also has twice the audience of the largest digital music streaming service and almost 5x their ad-enabled audience. we are the only audio player in broadcast or digital that has broad national reach in addition to an unparalleled local footprint.
the iheartmedia multiplatform group also reaches more people every month with its broadcast radio assets alone than any other media company in america, and that includes both google and facebook. multiplatform group revenues were up 19% year-over-year in q3 and were down only 17% compared to 2019, continuing our sequential quarterly improvement compared to 2019. these year-over-year and sequential results are evidence that our multiplatform group revenues are well on their way to recovering to 2019 levels and that they will continue to grow beyond that. our share of the broadcast radio sector revenues continues to expand, outperforming the broadcast sector as a whole, as reported by miller kaplan, which measures the revenue performance of select broadcast markets. i'd like to give you a couple of data points about why we're so confident in the growth potential of the multiplatform group and the future of broadcast radio as an advertising medium.
let's start with a quick overview of the entire audio listening landscape and the revenue potential for each segment. using nielsen and comscore, which are the industry standards for audience measurement, when looking at the split of listening between broadcast radio and streaming digital audio, broadcast gets about 75% of all listening and streaming digital audio, which includes spotify, apple music, amazon music, pandora and iheartradio, among others, gets about 25% of the listening.
now, let me translate that into advertising potential. it's important to remember that there are two sectors of audio. one is comprised of music services like apple music, amazon music, spotify and even pandora. it's where listeners go for their personal music collection, replacing cds, lps and music downloads. consumers go to their music collection when they want to shut out the world. it has no weather or traffic, no talker information, no personalities and any ads that run there are perceived as interruptions of this pure music experience.
radio on the other hand is the opposite. it's social. it's where people go and they want to know what's going on in the world, where they go for companionship, music, news, gossip, information, humor, who's hot and who's not. in this environment, information is key and even commercials are part of that experience. commercials are native content on radio, but they are interruptions to the music collection. and these differences in product appeal are why music collection services can't run anywhere near the same amount of advertising inventory as broadcast radio. that, combined with the listening differential, means broadcast radio has a significant revenue potential advantage over streaming music collections.
in the past, radio revenue has been limited by its lack of data and from not being of the modern advertising ecosystem that the digital giants pioneered. but that's changing. and you've seen the progress we've made with both smartaudio and our ad tech platform led by triton. the music collection services, on the other hand, are limited by audience reach, time spent and probably more importantly, advertising load possibilities in their music-only environment. when i analyze the advertising revenue potential of both sectors, i definitely prefer our hand by a lot.
now, let me give you a few more facts about the power of broadcast radio. when it comes to competing with other media formats, it might surprise you to know that consumers spend about 50% more time with broadcast radio every day than they do social media and broadcast radio has actually grown its number of listeners in the past 15 years. digital listening has also grown, but the key here is that the overall listing pie is getting bigger as new listening platforms are added. this growth of the pie is driven by the strength of broadcast radio and the music collection services converting cd and music download listeners into music streamers. we know that ad revenue inevitably follows consumer usage, and we're seeing this happen in real time with the decline of linear tv.
a warc study released in september shows that media spending is still out of whack. tv consumption has dropped to 24% of total media time, while audio consumption has grown to 31% of total usage. however, only 9% of advertising spend goes to audio indicating that some advertisers have been slow to react to this new reality. and additionally, with 40% of tv viewers classified as light tv viewers, as an advertising medium, tv now faces a significant reach gap. broadcast radio is uniquely capable of filling this gap for tv advertisers, reaching 90% of light tv viewers compared to only 50% for ott options. our ability to address both the reach and light tv viewer gaps gives us access to the $58 billion tv tam, which is further support for our confidence in the growth potential of our multiplatform group revenues.
now, let me move to our events business; also included in our multiplatform group where the consumer demand for our live events is strong. our q3 2021 sponsorship and events revenue were up 48% compared to prior year. and this quarter includes the impact of the return to live marquee iheartradio music festival, which was virtual last year. ticket sales exceeded 2019 levels and the event generated over 15 billion social impressions, which was 20x larger than lollapalooza. the high consumer demand for live events can also be seen in the recent success of the iheartradio fiesta latina and this past weekend's live iheart country festival. live events are back and coming up as our 11-day live and in-person iheartradio jingle ball tour in december.
i'd like to take a minute now to address a couple of relevant topics. covid, of course, continues to affect the country. while its human and social toll is real, the advertising revenue impact appears to be behind us. supply chain issues are also making headlines, but they have not had a material impact on our business. and finally, i also want to touch on apple's recent change to their data and privacy policy. some digital companies have said they are feeling a negative impact to their ad revenue as a result of apple's new policy. we aren't and there are several reasons why.
first, we have our own platforms with our own first-party data. second, we built for the future using smart audio digital-like broadcast inventory around cohorts, which are defined target audiences like auto buyers or new parents, not one-to-one using cookies and mobile ids. even with our purely digital inventory, we've stressed cohorts instead of focusing on one-to-one. third, our audio ad tech platform makes us the only audio company that can seamlessly target and serve to the same cohorts across all platforms from podcast to digital to broadcast.
big picture, we believe that cohorts are replacing one-to-one marketing, and we think we are well positioned for the shift toward data-infused ad buy. due to the changes in privacy restrictions and other factors, we see the world moving past one-to-one targeting, past cookies, past mobile ids and toward premium platforms that are brand-safe, measurable and that have real scale, like ours. in this new world of advertising, iheart is uniquely positioned to deliver targetable cohorts in audio comprised of highly engaged audiences with scale that is unparalleled in the u.s.
before i turn it over to rich, i want to touch upon the important announcement that we made yesterday about our multiyear strategic partnership with draftkings. this partnership is in one of the fastest-growing advertising categories and will enable draftkings to use the assets of the number one audio company in sports, iheart. this partnership builds on iheart's industry-leading audio sports assets, including the largest sports podcast network in the industry, which includes partnerships with the nfl, the nba and sports podcast led by marquee talent like colin cowherd and dan patrick as well as the iheart sports network, which reaches 75 million americans according to nielsen, our sports talk and sports betting stations and also our ongoing live coverage of professional teams on select iheart stations across the country. we expect sports and sports betting to be a significant growth engine for us going forward, and this partnership with draftkings is further evidence of that potential.
rich and i and the rest of the iheart management team are excited about the tangible results iheart's unique audio assets are delivering, driven by our unparalleled consumer reach across broadcast radio, digital radio and podcasting, and supported by our unmatched ad tech platform and suite of data analytic capabilities. we believe the revenue potential of our assets is superior to anything else in the audio sector and we're excited about using these assets to continue to drive growth into 2022 and beyond.
and with that, i'd like to turn it over to rich.
richard bressler -- president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer & director
thanks, bob, and good afternoon, everyone. as bob laid out, we delivered strong results in the third quarter, which reflect continued success of our operating strategies and the power of our unique audio assets as well as improving trends in the macroeconomic environment.
turning to slide 12 of our investor deck; our consolidated revenues were up 25% year-over-year exceeding our guidance for the quarter of up 20% year-over-year. when excluding political revenues, q3 increased 31% year-over-year. we are also extremely pleased with our continued sequential improvement against 2019. our revenue in q3 2021 was down only 2% from q3 2019, improving from being down 6% in q2 2021 compared to 2019 and improving from being down 11% in q1 2021 compared to 2019. direct operating expenses increased 20%, driven primarily by the significant increase in revenue, which drives higher content and profit-sharing expenses, third-party digital costs and expenses related to the return of local and national live events like the iheartradio music festival. these increases were partially offset by lower employee compensation and other reductions resulting from our significant modernization and cost reduction initiatives.
sg&a expenses increased 17%, driven by increased employee compensation expenses, resulting primarily from higher variable bonus expense based on financial performance and higher sales commissions due to higher revenue. as a reminder, last year, the vast majority of our employees did not get paid a bonus. and as a result, you'll see our corporate expenses increase year-over-year. in addition, increased headcount from the investments in our fast-growing digital business contributed to the increases in sg&a. these increases were partially offset by the impact of our significant modernization and cost reduction initiatives and lower bad debt expense. our third quarter gaap operating income was $80.1 million compared to an operating income of $39.4 million in the prior year quarter, and our third quarter adjusted ebitda was $230.2 million compared to $162.1 million in the prior quarter.
if you turn back to slide 4, i'll provide additional color on the performance of our operating segments. and as a note, there are additional slides in the investor presentation on our segment revenue performance. digital audio group revenues were up 77% year-over-year and adjusted ebitda was up 91% year-over-year. within the digital audio group is our podcasting business, whose revenues grew 184% year-over-year, and our non-podcasting digital revenues, which grew 51% year-over-year, also continuing their strong performance. and importantly, we expanded our third quarter digital audio group margins to 33%, a 230 basis point improvement year-over-year and a sequential improvement of 520 basis points from q2 2021, which as we mentioned last quarter, were negatively impacted by a few onetime expenses.
multiplatform group revenues were up 19% in q3 and continued our sequential improvement compared to 2019. q3 revenues were down only 17% compared to 2019, a 390 basis point improvement from q2 2021, which was down 21% versus q2 2019. and a significant improvement compared to q1 2021, which was down 26% versus q1 2019. q3 adjusted ebitda margins were 32%, a significant improvement from 25% adjusted ebitda margins in q3 2020 and on a sequential basis, margins improved 170 basis points from q2 2021. that margin improvement was achieved even though the quarter included the return to live and the associated expenses for the iheartradio music festival, which, while profitable, does not have the same margin profile as the rest of our multiplatform group businesses.
looking at the revenue streams within the multiplatform group. our broadcast revenues grew 20% year-over-year. within the broadcast line is smartaudio, our data-infused programmatic platform. smartaudio was up 43% year-over-year in the third quarter. as a reminder, it uses the same inventory as the rest of broadcast radio, highlighting the value of data and ad tech. and as we continue to add new technologies and data capabilities, we expect that our smartaudio product will generate revenue from the digital and tv tams, especially considering the changes to the advertising landscape that bob discussed earlier.
our networks revenues were up 8% compared to prior year, which includes our premier networks, which were up 2% compared to prior year as well as ttwn, the total traffic and weather network, which was up 14% compared to the prior year. and as a reminder, our premier business was less impacted by covid in 2020, which affects the comparison. our q3 2021 sponsorship and events revenues were up 48% compared to prior year. as bob mentioned, this reflects the strength of the iheart brand, the high demand for live music and advertisers' desire to interact with this engaged and enthusiastic customer base. the audio & media services group revenue was down 12% on a reported basis. excluding the impact of political, revenues in this segment were up 13% year-over-year.
on slide 18, there is a summary of our debt. at quarter end, we had approximately $5.4 billion of net debt outstanding, which includes a cash balance of $369 million, and these figures include the previously announced voluntary prepayment of $250 million of our term loan. we will also benefit from the concurrent repricing of the term loan, which will have a positive impact on our interest expense on a go-forward basis. at the end of october, we repurchased the full balance of our $60 million preferred stock prior to its call date of may 1, 2022, which is not included in these figures. in doing so, we realized interest savings, but more importantly, we exited the most expensive and restrictive instruments on the iheart balance sheet, reinforcing iheart's commitment to improving our capital structure and demonstrating our confidence in our business moving forward.
as a reminder, the terms of our debt structure include no material maintenance covenants and there are no material debt maturities prior to 2026. we continue to actively monitor market conditions and will opportunistically optimize our capital structure. we ended q3 2021 net debt-to-ebitda leverage of 6.9x. we remain committed to achieving our previously announced leverage target of approximately 4x, and we expect to continue our progress toward that goal.
in the third quarter, we generated $45 million of free cash flow. as we mentioned last quarter, the accelerated consolidation of our real estate footprint, which is part of our previously announced modernization and cost savings initiatives has enabled us to sell certain redundant assets, which has partially offset the real estate initiatives, gross capital expenditures. free cash flow, including net proceeds from these real estate asset sales would be $54 million for q3. as a reminder, our capital expenditures are elevated this year as a result of onetime spend related to our real estate consolidation. we continue to successfully execute against our previously announced savings initiatives. as a reminder, our pre-covid modernization initiatives achieved a $100 million run rate target by mid-2021, and we remain on target to replicate the majority of the previously announced $200 million post-covid savings in 2021. we believe these actions, coupled with our continuing revenue growth, leaves us well positioned for margin expansion as evidenced in q3.
consolidated margins were 25%, up from 21% in q2 2021, 14% in q1 2021 and up 300 basis points from 22% in q3 2020. multiplatform group margins were 32%, up from 30% in q2 2021, 21% in q1 2021 and up 660 basis points from 25% in q3 2020. digital audio group margins were 33%, up from 27% in q2 2021, 25% in q1 2021 and up 230 basis points from 30% in q3 2020.
as we look forward to q4, i want to provide you with the following. our october consolidated revenues were up approximately 1% compared to 2019 and approximately flat year-over-year. it is important to note that october 2020 was our biggest month for political revenue. excluding the impact of political, october's year-over-year growth would have been approximately 22%. for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be up approximately 10% year-over-year or 22%, excluding the impact of political, implying our q4 revenue will be slightly higher compared to 2019. and consistent with our previous guidance, we reaffirm that we expect to return to 2019 adjusted ebitda levels by the end of 2021. no matter what valuation method you use, utilizing a valuation of the sum of the parts of potential future revenue and earnings growth, free cash flow per share, et cetera, we think iheart is undervalued using any metric. we hope the information we have provided today gives you confidence in the value of this company.
bob and i and the rest of the management team are excited by these results, and the audience, revenue and earnings momentum in our business. and as a reminder, we'll give specific 2022 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. i'd like to close on the same note that bob began on. we thank our employees, without whom this journey would not be possible, the communities we serve and our business partners. we appreciate everyone joining our third quarter earnings call.
and now we will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. thank you.
