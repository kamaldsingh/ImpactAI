[operator instructions] thank you. our first question comes from ravi misra with berenberg capital markets. please proceed with your question.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
hi, ravi.
ravi misra -- berenberg capital markets, llc -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question. hi. how are you?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
good.
ravi misra -- berenberg capital markets, llc -- analyst
happy new year. so i just wanted to maybe start on -- i'll let the others maybe talk about the quarterly trends, but one of the things that kind of stood out to me was you're driving extremely strong volume growth amid what's kind of a stable to slightly declining pricing environment. just curious, first, when do you think you'll be able to go back to the kind of prior model where you're able to take pricing? is that still in the cards? and then secondly, i think the teen market is an area that we've kind of always been looking at as the next leg of growth, the kind of huge market that's out there. and you're talking about some of the conversion and the lead generations. can you help us understand kind of the conversion rates around the leads that you generate in terms of timing and how long this takes to get the roi that is put into the advertisements that you're putting out there?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
hey, ravi, first of all, i guess, your first question is on average selling prices. we try to communicate this as strongly as we can is to keep your eyes on gross margin, because we have huge mix, whether it's international mix or it's product mix, you see a lot of progress in igo and products like moderate and invisalign first in those products. the carry actually lower average selling prices, but higher margins, and so you can often mix up on those things. so i'd say as we keep emphasizing is don't be overly concerned about asps or focused on asps. like john said, we didn't increase asps this year because we're interested in supporting our customers and making sure that this is difficult -- a really difficult transition for many practices right now and instituting a price increase just wouldn't have been responsible in that sense. but at the same time, we drove incredible productivity across the business and we're able to show those kind of gross margins. so i hope you and the rest of the analysts community out there can actually see that. we've been talking about this for a few years, but actually taking place.
on the teen side and the conversions from an advertising standpoint, i mean, we come out just from a lot of different ways and a lot of different areas. and we -- if we are going to start teen season, you really have to start in february in the united states and you have to really work through a lot of different aspects of social media. you advertise differently for moms and you do teens and different things like that. so i can't give you a correlation coefficient in the sense of here we invest and how much we get back, but we understand as well as a business, we've been doing it for years. we understand the timing of it. and more and more we become more specific on the social advertising pieces and how to implement that properly. and john, do you have anything you want to add?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
no. as you said, i mean, it's -- there's others that are in the equation. you have to reach the teen, as joe described, and we talked about social influencers and so on. you have to reach the parents and we try that. and then also have the right formula with the doctors. so getting those three to think about going into treatment is really the key.
ravi misra -- berenberg capital markets, llc -- analyst
okay. then maybe one last one if i can ask one more, just on the reopening and vaccination progress and kind of volumes. how are you guys kind of thinking about the consumer spending environment as the options that the patient is going to have start increasing. i mean is that going to require more investment here in the near term or do you think kind of where we're at a baseline where you've kind of gotten the ramp where things are starting to really click here with the advertising that you're doing as is? thank you.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
yeah, ravi, it's a good question. i mean, look, we're always looking to maximize our return on investment. we talk about that to grow in this vastly underpenetrated market. in some countries like in the u.s., it's just a matter of refining how we spend. we talked about the influencers, talked about nfl and other things. and in other countries, we've really started spending some of that consumer advertising and we see a great response and we see a strong return. and those are areas that, as we see that response, we see it turn into volume, those are areas that will continue. so we're always looking at return on investment and we'll find ways to be able to grow our volume that way.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer

thank you. our next question comes from jon block with stifel. please proceed with your question.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
hey, jon.
jonathan d. block -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
hey, joe. good afternoon. joe, you mentioned 2021 is off to a great start. from 2015 to 2019, so i'm sort of isolating pre-covid management guidance for 1q cases, the guidance for 1q cases were up pretty consistently, just low single-digits off of what you did in the fourth quarter. and i guess where i'm going with this is at a high level, what's the expectation for case growth sequentially? and i'm just trying to level set as the back part of 2020 likely benefited from some pent-up demand. so just how we should think about the trend line, if you would, into the early part of 2021?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
hey, jon, i'll let john have the specifics. i would just tell you that january was a really strong orders quarter, so that momentum really continues.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
and look, jon, i think as we've said it, we're controlling what we can control, making investments that help drive this business. we look at -- as joe said, we felt really good about how we exited q4. we saw that in january as well, and we don't want to guide. we basically haven't because there is things that are outside of our control. and we'll leave that as it is. what we're trying to give you is kind of the latest information without projecting forward.
jonathan d. block -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
okay, fair enough. and i'll ask a quick two-part for the second one. emea was just gangbusters, i mean, it was up 48% of a 32% comp, shout out to markus, but anything to call out there? i mean, the number was huge. and then the second part is teen up almost 40%, joe. what do you think the underlying ortho market was growing? where i'm going with this is just your conviction of sort of maybe a type of inflection point, if you would, with teen's share of share. thanks, guys.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
hey, jon, i appreciate you bringing up emea, i mean, that was just an amazing performance when you see that. i've been doing business in europe since i was 30 years and you see growth like that by countries, it's amazing. and i think that, to me, that was really a story on the fourth quarter too was the breadth of that growth. it wasn't just north america. it wasn't just asia. it was deep across segments, across gps, across orthos. so jon, i'm not ready to talk about an inflection point. all i can say is when you think about, we had 77,000 doctors that ordered that i talked about in my script. and then 7,200 to 7,300 more doctors, that's 10% more doctors, that's a record for us too. so we see invisalign, this digital treatment really catching on in a big way and it's meaningful. look, we're gearing up for it. we're obviously advertising to drive that demand and will stay focused on just executing, jon, right now.
jonathan d. block -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
thanks, guys.

thank you. our next question comes from steve beuchaw with wolfe research. please proceed with your question.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
hi, steve.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi. thanks for the time here, guys. i wanted to try to understand a little bit better the relationship between some of the things that you flagged, john, in your prepared remarks as it relates to deferrals and asp. i certainly agree with the view that gross margins are really the critical metric, but i'm sure we're going to get a lot of questions about asp tonight and over the next couple of days. so i wonder if you could help us understand a little bit more deeply, one, why we'd be seeing more deferred revenue here both on aligners and scanners? and what's the relationship to asp and do we see that reverse?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
yeah, steve, the basic way to think about this as we look at our revenue, we've got revenue on a new case that we ship out. and there is a certain amount that you recognize on that shipment based on our rev rec. and then there is a certain amount for future aligners or future modifications that are needed. that will be deferred revenue. and then you also get into your revenue so that those deferrals that you've made for maybe previous quarters or even previous year that as they -- that doctor needs to use that additional lines, you're going to get revenue for that.
when you have a mix like we have, where there is much more, there is this demand for future volume for new cases, you get a mix where we just have a lot more as a percentage of new cases and that's what impacts asps. when we look at that from a margin standpoint, it's margin accretive. we're getting as new cases. many of the cases that we get back from a deferred revenue standpoint where there's refinements we just don't make as much margin on that. you get the deferred revenue, but you don't get as much of the margin. so there is those dynamics that we have. we saw just when you have a significant volume increase like we saw in our third and fourth quarter.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. thank you, john. and then i wanted to follow-up about the gp channel. gp has been just gangbusters here lately. i wonder if i could try to understand that a little bit more deeply. one is do you think it continues to grow at the sort of clip relative to the ortho channel? maybe two, do you think exocad has been a driver of incremental growth in that channel at this point? and then lastly, should we think about the shift to dsos being a variable one way or another. and i apologize for my kids screaming in the background.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
that's the life we live now, steve. we understand. it happens on and off like every call. from a gp channel standpoint, i mean, three years ago when we first started segmenting in europe and now we are doing in the states and we do it all over the world. and then we introduced products like igo that were specific to it. and just a salesforce that can communicate with gps because it's a different conversation than with orthos. yes, i can't tell you where it's going, but when we talk about that 500 million patients like i did in my script, that's where they are, and that's where you touch them. i mean, it's a different. it's not a big teen market. it's a lot of adults. but it has to have a workflow that's specific to a gp. and that's why we drive their products, that's why itero is so important from a front-end standpoint.
your question on exocad is we think that's going to be a big gp driver for us. it is a big legitimate piece for us, but i don't think it's adding to volume right now. we're just rolling out these new products. we're just starting to integrate that kind of software code into itero and into our programs and that's certainly will drive increased penetration in the future.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. thank you so much for all the perspective here.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
yeah, thanks, steve.
shirley stacy -- vice president-finance, corporate and investor communications
next question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeff johnson with robert w. baird & co. please proceed with your question.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
hi, jeff.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
thank you. good evening, guys. hey, joe. i wanted to start with -- i know it's tough and maybe there is not even a way to do it, but any way to think about especially over the last two quarters, how much of this patient volume has been backlog versus the zoom effect versus true kind of accelerating penetration of clear aligners versus brackets and wires. just is there any way to bucket or any metrics you're looking at that tells you this is truly kind of that secular uptick we've all been waiting for versus backlog and some of the zoom effect?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
i think as we get further and further from the second quarter obviously the backlog question becomes less and less as part of the noise of the structure, right. i feel a lot of analysts, jeff, they wonder, hey, we had a great third quarter obviously and it was, well, how much of that was really the second quarter that's rolled into the third. we really don't know what that was. we don't. and our doctors don't know it either as we talk to them. the fourth obviously had less of that.
and we really felt good about our orders in january too. so i think we're really moving away from that question here soon. the number of docs like i just quoted with over 7,000 new docs ordering from us, 77,000 in total shows you the breadth of what's going on. and what's really struck me in this entire thing too, jeff, is really this is not just united states, this is all over the world. it's latin america, it's apac. it's tremendous growth in japan and anz and traditional markets, in china, in europe. so there is breadth to this and then the segments we talked about, both gps and orthos. so look, there have been backlog in the third quarter. there has to be some backlog in the fourth quarter or whatever. but we don't think that's the overriding story here.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
yeah, that's fair. and then one other kind of maybe more a conceptual question. just as i think about -- i think about it through your advantages program, but are you seeing doctors that are the high volume guys, the platinum guys moving up to diamond and double diamond? is it the lower bronze or gold guys moving up to platinum? does it matter to you which it is? but more importantly conceptually, is it getting those low volume guys to really go all in here or the high volume guys to convert completely to invisalign? and i'm sure you're going to tell me it's a mix of both of that, but just kind of what you're seeing would be helpful there on your own customer base.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
yeah. you helped me answer that question, jeff, it is a mix. but it is really broad. i mean, we see in the bronze accounts and golds and all the way to diamond and diamond plus. and we see growth in all those segments. and i think it's kind of logical, right. the people that know how to do digital are going to expand on it, because digital really allows them to function in this covid environment in a way that allows them fewer customer touches and they can actually carry on their practices in a normal way. other doctors actually see the advantages of that. they have patients asking for them. and they start to move toward a digital kind of a platform. and overall, again, it's a breadth discussion. it's not just one area, it's not just one country, it's not one segment of the advantage program. we just weren't seeing adoption across the board. and john, anything to add on that?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
i'd echo this, the breadth. i mean, you have new doctors, like joe said, 7,000 new doctors that come in with and want to do cases that come into our ecosystem and start cases. you see doctors who have done just a few cases really start to accelerate and then at the top of the pyramid, you have people that are doing a lot of cases and they do even more cases. so that's part of when we talk about the breadth of this growth and what makes it excited. and it's like joe said, not just a u.s. phenomena, it's pretty much everywhere.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
and jeff, i think the last thing you said is do you care which i thought was kind of interesting is like we really don't care. we just want to serve the doctors who want to work with us. we see this market -- we talk about how large this market is and and how under-penetrated it is. and we just want to see wherever that growth is, that's great. it's on the low end, that's terrific. it's on the high end, that's terrific. we set this company up to be able to service either side to work well with them.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from elizabeth anderson with evercore. please proceed with your question.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
hi, elizabeth.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks so much for the question. hey, joe. i always thought -- obviously the -- one of the many nice parts of the quarter was the scanner and cad/cam revenue. can you talk a little bit about what you sort of see as market growth there? like where are you taking share? is it in the gp, more on the ortho channel? is it orthodontists adding their third scanner? is it people finally saying, yes, i'll go digital? obviously, the total number of cases submitted digitally was very high. any other color you could provide there would be really helpful.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
elizabeth, you could work for us, ok. you kind of described exactly how that demand is, it's coming from all these different places. and a lot of it when you say where you're taking share, a lot of is just analog share. there is so much in dentistry is still just completely analog. they're still doing impression and different pieces. and so it's the growth has been tremendous in that sense.
your question about orthodontists that start to move up into a significant part of their practice being invisalign, you'll see -- you see a scanner at every chair. and they use these things are constantly. it's part of what they do. what we see on the gp segment is the communication tool ends up being the scanner in the front of the scanner. because you know in the past, they'd hold up a mirror and say, can you see that, that second molar back there and you'd say, yeah, but you really couldn't, right. now, you throw it on a screen. it's live, you can see exactly what's going on. it becomes an incredible patient-communication tool in a sense of where is your dentist and what needs to be done and helps to convince patients of what the doctor wants to do and the validity of that kind of treatment. so this is where dentistry is going. and when you look at itero, it is arguably the highest performing scanner in the world, the speed of it, the exactness of it, color rendering, and also with niri technology to be able to see caries or cavities is a real benefit, even to orthodontists who want to make sure that before you start the treatment that dentition is in good enough shape to able to except that kind of movement. so that's just -- this is the time for digitization inside of dentistry and itero plays a big role in that and it front-ends our digital platform.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
especially in a covid environment, given the fact that you don't want to have as much time for impressions and so on and you want to be able to have something that's fast and really be part of that digital workflow, this itero lends itself well.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
yeah.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, that's super helpful. and joe, sort of like to just follow up more a housekeeping question. one, obviously you announced the new products today and i imagine that that's something you'll be talking about in sort of the virtual chicago midwinter and what you would have discussed a lot of it ids. is there anything we should keep in mind in terms of the ramp of sort of new products or impacts from ids moving to the back half of the year? and then on the other side, obviously we saw your announcement about the move to arizona. sounds exciting. i just didn't know if that had any impact in terms of something we should model in on taxes or anything else just to touch on that as well.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
yeah, i think i can answer the tax piece of it. no, really not a tax impact. it really came down to when we look at the campus that we have in san jose and the expansion that we have from a technology center, we become space constraint. and so we want to keep that technology center, that innovation center in san jose and expand that out and add more to help with that innovation. and then moving to here in tempe for kind of that head office just made sense to us.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, thanks.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
yeah, it is upon the new product pieces. keep in mind we talked about we spend $500 million a year on advertising and also new product development, you'll see a lot of new products. we don't pace ourselves on those introductions based on ids. and that's why we obviously announced the new itero scanner. we talked about the new 6.0 software that we have. a lot of changes to fipos, it's our final positioning aspect to dentition. we had the plus product from igo, the in-face visualization. this is a digital business that requires constant iterations in products. and obviously midwinter and those things are great places to highlight it. but our innovation, we looked at it agile, not waterfall anymore. in the sense, waterfall used to be invent during the year, release one period of the year. more and more, you'll see us just monthly just rolling out new products as we adapt to a more kind of an agile philosophy of development than a waterfall type of -- if that's what you're asking, elizabeth.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
makes total sense. thank you so much.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
yeah. you're welcome.

thank you. our next question comes from richard newitter with svb leerink. please proceed with your question.
richard newitter -- leerink partners -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking the questions. just maybe to start off the switch program, which has fairly been extremely successful for you. i'm curious to know how much more runway there is associated program, and maybe if you could just comment on kind of how you're at least thinking about that from your internal modeling?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
yeah, look, i think it has a huge amount of breadth to it. i mean, it's not just u.s. we started this in japan actually years ago and introduced in the united states. and you think about -- it's just a great winner, detaching those wires and brackets from people's teeth using invisalign, understanding, like we said, in our script, is how much more simple it is and better for people and comfortable for people to go with our product line. so we think it's -- we have a lot of room to grow and we're going to keep supporting it.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
yeah. and rich, it's john. i mean, we are always looking at those types of promotions for an roi. and in these cases, many cases looking at it from an incremental standpoint, nothing could be more incremental than it was glued onto someone's teeth and now they come off and they go to invisalign. so we like those dynamics there. it sends a great message. and those people who had wires and brackets on their teeth can talk about their experience with invisalign. so there is a lot of positives to it, as joe said, it started in japan. and we've seen great success in the u.s. and we look to other places as well.
richard newitter -- leerink partners -- analyst
got it. helpful. and joe, you said a few times how encouraging the trends have been in january. i'm just curious, understanding it's only one month, but how well is the growth, if the trend that you're seeing now were to whole kind of for a good portion of the year, where in your long-term kind of long-range plan of 20% to 30% do you think you'd be falling toward the mid to upper end? i'm just trying to get a sense for kind of what do you think in there?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
nice try, richard. look, we're very committed to our long-term growth model 20% to 30%. that's really all i can say right now. rich, we're in a really uncertain environment. we're happy about january. it is why we're not giving guidance. it's -- we're all living with volatility right now and we'll just continue to execute and keep our heads down, but we're committed to that 20% to 30% growth model that we've been talking about for several years.

thank you. our next question comes from john kreger with william blair. please proceed with your question.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
hey, john.
john c. kreger -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey, joe. just sticking with that answer, you were obviously above that in terms of volumes in the fourth quarter. how do you feel about your ability to deliver on that if the order flow were sustained? in terms of fabrication and fulfillment, how are those metrics holding up at this point?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
our supply chains, we try to keep ahead in that sense. so, i feel we have adequate plans and capacity right now to be able to handle the surge in demand.
john c. kreger -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. okay. and then, john, i think you've talked about in the past a reasonable assumption is kind of a flattish asp, and realized there's a lot of puts and takes. but is that still a reasonable kind of planning thing for us? or are you guys thinking less on the pricing front, and, therefore, maybe more of a downward trend over the coming year?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
it's tough because it really becomes kind of the end result, because if you have more primary cases as i spoke compared to secondaries, you can get some of these impacts in asps. i think, in general, there is not a significant change that we would expect in some of the mix or some of that some of that pricing. so that being said, you wouldn't expect too much fluctuations in asps. but like i said, it depends on that demand that comes forward from our doctors.
john c. kreger -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it, ok. and then one more, joe, sorry, in a typical year, we'd assume kind of teens would be big in q3 and adults would be bigger in q4. is that same sort of seasonal pattern likely do you think in '21 given what we know now, or would you expect kind of teen order flow to be more kind of spread evenly throughout the year.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
hey, john, we don't know. but i'd say it became muted this year. obviously, we saw as much stronger fourth quarter united states in teens than we saw -- that you normally see from a seasonal standpoint, it got continued. so i think all of us are expecting summer and fall months as covid to start to retreat a little bit, that might take us back to the patterns that we had before. but i don't think it's going to be binary. i really don't, i think this could have changed the pattern. we're just going to have to -- we're going to have to just ride the curve here and see how it goes. but we'll continue to advertise through this to execute on a place that we talked about in our scripts and we've really feel confident we can continue to drive significant teen demand.
john c. kreger -- william blair & company -- analyst
great, thank you.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer

operator, we'll take one or two more questions please.
operator
okay. our next question comes from jason bednar with piper sandler. please proceed with your question. hey, good afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking my questions here. congrats on another really strong quarter. i appreciate all the details you discussed. maybe building off some of the real-time commentary you shared at the end of your prepared remarks there, joe, just curious if you can expand on what you're seeing in january for maybe a utilization perspective, maybe in the context of where we were october through december, any notable call-outs in january from a good geographic perspective or teens or adults?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
i think the call-out, jason, really is just the breadth of it really. there wasn't any geography in particular that dominated or it was just in segment to gp and ortho continued to be strong. so when you exit a year and you're at our new year, you're obviously glued to that month to see, especially in a business like this, what the momentum is and we just see a continuation of the strong momentum that we had in the fourth quarter. that's -- john, anything to add on that.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
i think the breadth of it is my note on this that we have across geographies between gp and orthos. and what we described is a lot of doctors that are higher-up in the tier, they're continuing to do a lot of volume, and then a lot of new doctors that come in that come in with cases in hand. and we can get them to start the invisalign system into our digital ecosystem. so, that continued from q4 into q1.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. that's helpful, guys. and then just focusing on china here just for a quick moment. there wasn't a great deal of discussion probably less in this call than maybe any other call in recent memory on china in particular. but impression, the seasonality that happens here in the fourth quarter, but maybe just wondering if you can expand on what you're seeing with your business and the clear aligner market in china specifically and maybe compare that against some of your other apac markets.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
yeah, we felt good about our growth in china 26% for the quarter overall. china, we see shutdowns periodically, issues in shanghai or different places and chinese are pretty draconian, i'd use the move is when they covid, they move pretty quickly. the public hospitals have been throttled to certain extent unlike the procedures. but we feel good about the quarter and we feel, honestly, our investments in china, we really feel good about those. the manufacturing piece helps legitimizes us our it systems from a data protection standpoint have to be geared toward china. we're in good shape with that. we're assembling itero there now. we feel great about our training centers, great about our treatment planning capabilities. so overall, we remain bullish on china and we think that china will start to, with the rest of the world, will start to recover in the second half of next year too and we expect to be a big part of that.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thanks, guys.
shirley stacy -- vice president-finance, corporate and investor communications
operator, we'll take one more question, please. i know we went over.
operator
okay. our last question comes from nathan rich with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs group, inc -- analyst
hi, nathan.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, joe. good afternoon. thanks for squeezing me in. obviously, results over the past couple of quarters have been really strong. i guess, when we look out to 2021, it's tough to know what happens with covid, but hopefully we'll start to get back to normal life later this year or 2022. i think as we look at where consensus is modeled i think on a high-teens revenue growth. it seems like you still feel comfortable with the 20% to 30% target. so do you feel like we should be expecting that type of growth in line with the long-term range off of this new higher level of volumes that you're starting to see in the back half of this year.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
nathan, that's -- we try to emphasize as much as we can, we feel very confident about those 20% to 30% ranges of growth. and continue to target 25, 30% operating profit to in order to do that. so you'll see us in investor rates that john talked about we're putting in place to drive that demand. so we make -- we remain committed to that model growth.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
and it starts with the vastly under-penetrated market and the investment opportunities we talk about. we tried to give you a kind of the breadth of all the different levers that we have to pull to be able to drive that return. and we continue to make that. it changes over time in terms of how we invest and where and so on, but that, that belief is still there. and when we make those forward investments, we're invested into that under-penetrated market that we think we can grow 22% in and do it at a 25%-plus op margin rate.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
yeah.

joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
thanks, shirley. good afternoon and thanks for joining us. on our call today, i'll provide some highlights from the fourth quarter and full year, then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments clear aligners and systems and services. john will provide more detail on our financial results and share additional color on business trends. following that, i'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.
our fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year with record revenues and volumes from both invisalign aligners and itero scanners, as well as increased gross margins, operating margins, eps and cash flow. our fourth quarter performance is driven by strong year-over-year growth across customer channels and regions and continued momentum sequentially. during the quarter, we achieved a major milestone in emea with the shipment to our 2 millionth invisalign patient that will be amplified with the emeawide campaign that will launch next month. this milestone from reflects strong acceleration in invisalign adoption and growth.
for q4, total revenues were $834.5 million, up 13.7% sequentially and up 28.4% year-over-year. q4 '20 clear aligner revenues of $700.7 million million were up 12.9% sequentially and increased 28.9% year-over-year. in q4, we shipped a record 568,000 invisalign cases, an increase of 14.5% sequentially and 37.3% year-over-year.
q4 reflects increased invisalign adoption from both adults and teenagers, which were up 36.7% and 38.7% year-over-year respectively. our teen and mom-focused consumer campaign generated 77% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website and 76% increase in leads generation.
in addition, invisalign social media influencers like charli d' amelio, marsai martin, christina milian, tisha campbell-martin, rachel zoe, tiffany ma, and tahj mowry continued to deliver exciting new content and increased engagement for the invisalign brand with consumers and among their millions of followers.
our digital platform continues to gain traction as doctors uses of itero scanners increase. our consumer and patient app was rolled out to more than 50 markets, resulting in more than a 2.5 times increase in apps download and monthly active users in 2020 versus a year ago. our patient feature usage continues to increase, for example, invisalign virtual appointment was used 68,000 times. our insurance verification feature was used 26,000 times and more than 30,000 patients enrolled in invisalign virtual care in 2020.
our new consumer website was rolled out to more than 40 markets around the world and is driving increased effectiveness in lead generation. we also launched an improved new doctor recruitment website in the u.s. and canada to support our digital conversion journey. this will be expanded to other markets in the next few months.
from a product perspective, growth was strong across invisalign portfolio, especially for non-comprehensive cases including invisalign go and invisalign moderate. there are also more doctors engaging with us through the align digital and practice transformation or adapt program, as more practices are moving toward digital practice optimization. as you'll recall, adapt was piloted over two years ago and is being commercialized as a stand-alone service providing the relevant workforce, clinical and marketing support to enable doctors to digitally transform their practices.
in q4, we shipped a record 77,000 invisalign doctors worldwide of which a record 7,300 were first time customers. we also trained over 6,400 new docs in q4, including over 3,900 international doctors.
q4 '20 system and services revenues of $133.8 million were up 18% sequentially driven by momentum in the americas and emea, and up 26% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth in emea and asia pacific. our results reflect continued strong uptake of the itero element 5d, the only intraoral scanner with caries detection which is scaling rapidly across each region and represented approximately a third of itero volumes in q4.
innovation remains a cornerstone of our business. today, we announced the availability of the itero element plus series, which expands our portfolio of itero element scanners in imaging systems to include new solutions that serve a broader range of the dental marketplace. the new itero element plus series of scanners in imaging systems builds on the success of the award winning itero element family and offers all of the existing orthodontic and restorative digital capabilities doctors have come to rely on, plus faster processing time and advanced visualization capabilities for seamless scanning experience in a new sleek ergonomically designed package.
we announced the launch of our next-gen clincheck pro 6.0 proprietary treatment planning software with in-face visualization and our invisalign g8 improved predictability in our last earnings call we announced. their availability is being expanded across all regions. further, we launched several enhancements to our treatment planning, including improved final teeth position and auto segmentation. we also added several new features to our virtual care tool.
for the full year 2020, total net revenues were a record $2.5 billion, up 2.7% year-over-year. clear aligner revenues of $2.1 billion were up 3.7% reflecting a record $1.6 million invisalign shipments and growth of 7.9%. during the year, 30.3% of total invisalign cases or nearly 500,000 teens or younger started invisalign treatment. this is up 11.5% from 2019. system and services revenues were down slightly compared to 2019.
2020 was a year unlike any other that we've experienced. the covid-19 pandemic and its impact have been life-changing, marked by loss and separation, recovery and renewal, record highs and lows, and significant milestones and accomplishments. even in a time of huge disruption, we all had to adapt, evaluate priorities and develop new ways of doing things both personally and professionally. through it all, align's priority has been the health and well-being of our employees and their families and our doctor, customers and their staff. and that remains a constant.
despite the swift onset of the pandemic and the uncertainty through 2020, we didn't hold our plans or change our strategy for continued growth. we completed the acquisition of exocad, accelerated our investments in marketing to create invisalign brand awareness and drive consumer demand for our doctors' offices. accelerated new technology to market with virtual tools that enable our doctors to stay connected with their patients, provided ppe to those in need and supported doctors and their teams with online education and digital forums that went beyond products to help them navigate the uncertainties of the pandemic. as a result of our continued strategic focus and investments, we exited the year stronger than we started and 2021 is off to a great start.
now let's turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter starting with the americas. with the americas region, q4 invisalign case volume was up 12.7% sequentially and up 34.1% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization of invisalign treatment for both orthodontic and gp channels. our continued investments in digital marketing and sales programs and focus on market segmentation are helping drive strong growth of invisalign clear aligners and itero products. during the quarter, we continued offering sales initiatives to our doctor partners to help drive adoption of invisalign and itero products.
the bracket buy back-switch program, which we launched in north america in q2 '20 continues to drive conversion from wires and brackets to invisalign clear aligners. during q4, this program resulting -- has resulted in about 10,000 new cases similar to q3. we believe this is also causing a halo effect with patients switching from wires and brackets to invisalign clear aligners with increased awareness of the benefits of invisalign treatment and how it is less disruptive to their lives with the outcome of a beautiful smile through an invisalign trained doctor.
the teen awesomeness centers programs direct patients to invisalign doctors who are experts at treating teens and are seen as the go-to docs for treatment. we continue to see growth with invisalign first for treatment in younger kids driving increased comprehensive treatments within north america ortho channel.
latin american volume was also up year-over-year, led by strong growth in brazil and mexico. we believe the market for orthodontic treatment is huge in latin america as we continue to grow our presence across the region.
we saw increased utilization in the gp channel with invisalign go and the continued adoption of moderate. the gp accelerator program designed exclusively for general practitioner dentist provides an all-encompassing support plan based on practice needs that is centered around maximizing itero integration, clinical support needs, and implementing new marketing strategies. we also see increased utilization with gp dentists that have enrolled in the ipro program as well as with doctors that have installed the itero scanner. dso utilization also increased and continues to be a strong growth driver led by heartland and smile docs. for the full year, americas invisalign volume was up 3.6%
for our international business, q4 invisalign case volume was up sequentially 6.7% [phonetic], led by a strong growth in emea as doctors returned from summer holiday season, offset somewhat by seasonally slower period in china. on a year-over-year basis, international shipments were up 41.1%, reflecting increases throughout both emea and apac. for the full year, international invisalign volume was up 13.3%.
for emea, q4 volumes were up sequentially 47.9% and 48.3% on a year-over-year basis across all markets, with strong performance across both ortho and gp channels. within the gp channel specifically, we saw acceleration in both utilization and shipments with invisalign go. we also saw acceleration in both core and expansion markets, with growth in our core markets, led by iberia, uk and france, along with continued growth in our expansion markets, led by central and eastern europe and the benelux.
we introduced the ortho recovery 360 program in emea last quarter to support our orthodontists as they started reopening their businesses. as of q4, 3,200 orthodontists have enrolled in the program. during the quarter, we launched the recovery ii program with a refreshed website featuring all digital tools, growth programs and education events for emea doctors to support their relief efforts during covid-19.
we also held our digital innovation forum at the beginning of december where approximately 900 doctors, both ortho and gp, attended the two-day forum event with keynotes on the digitization of dental practices. we also continued our digital excellence series of webinars launched by the itero team.
throughout the quarter, the following digital innovations were also launched across emea, invisalign g8, clincheck pro 6.0 and invisalign go plus, to help drive invisalign clear aligner utilization. to support our gp doctors, we launched our gp recovery 360 program last quarter, with over 2,700 gps enrolled so far. we continued to offer online and on-demand education events, which reached over 15,000 gps cumulatively. for the full year, emea invisalign volume was up 12.6%.
for apac, q4 volumes were down sequentially 14.7%. notwithstanding typical q4 seasonality in china, following a strong q3, we had strong growth in japan and anz and southeast asia. on a year-over-year basis, apac was up 30% compared to the prior year, reflecting continued strong growth across the region. we were pleased to see growth in the adult segment with non-comprehensive cases with the invisalign moderate product in the gp channel. in the teen segment, we also saw an increase in utilization among invisalign doctors and we saw continued acceleration from japan and anz. for the full year, apac invisalign volume was up 14.3.%.
last year, we launched a new and improved digital learning environment for our doctors offering a comprehensive learning platform with role-specific content for orthos, gps and their teams. the improved functionality enables more online learning opportunities with spotlight features for what's trending now, recommended learning path based on doctors' experiences, and expanded categories including digital treatment planning, comprehensive dentistry, and team education.
for the year, over 127,000 doctors have accessed recorded lectures, completed self-paced learning modules, and watched how-to videos, with new certified doctors viewing more than 1.4 million pages of content. among the ortho channel, over 47,000 unique users have engaged with the digital learning site with an additional 80,000 unique users from the gp channel.
as we've mentioned, we are seeing good adoption of the adapt program, which is an expert and independent fee-based business consulting service offered by align to optimize clinics' operational workflow and processes to enhance patient experience and customer and staff satisfaction, which will in turn translate into higher growth and greater efficiencies for orthodontic practices. as a result, the adapt service participating practices in q4 improved profitability significantly after implementation.
our consumer marketing is focused on capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles, educating consumers about the invisalign system and driving that demand to our invisalign doctor offices. in q4, we saw strong digital engagement globally with more than 77% increase in unique visitors, 108% increase in doc locator searches and 76% increase in leads created, driven by our global adult and mom-focused campaigns and teen-focused influencer content.
our us mom/teen multi-touch multimillion dollar campaign with influencer-led youtube videos, a mom-focused tv spot, a custom twitch activation, and mega teen sensation charli d'amelio continued to perform very well and garnered 2.7 billion impressions in q4. the statistics i shared previously speak to the successful reach of this marketing campaign is having to not only drive demand with consumers, but also in educating them on the benefits of invisalign treatment through a doctor's office.
in q4, we also launched media tests in the emea region in the uk, germany and france and in the apac region in australia and japan. these have worked very well and resulted in a more than six-times increase in leads in emea and a 3-times increase in leads in apac. several key metrics that show increased activity and engagement with the invisalign brand are included in our q4 quarterly presentation slides available on our website.
align is always looking for new opportunities to reach consumers and be relevant to potential patients wherever they work, live, and play, which is why we announced that the invisalign brand is the official clear aligner sponsor of the national football league, the nfl, and 11 nfl teams, including the tampa bay buccaneers and the kansas city chiefs. the nfl league partnership, designed to expand our reach with consumers, generated over 150 million impressions in 2020, helping to drive awareness of invisalign clear aligner treatment at a national level, while the team agreements are designed to help us engage within key markets and connect consumers with doctors in those markets.
for our systems and services business, q4 revenues were up 18% sequentially due to higher shipments and services revenues. we continued to see momentum with the itero element 5d imaging system, gaining traction in all regions with significant element flex sales in emea. on a year-over-year basis, systems and services revenues were up 26% due to higher shipments and services. for the year, our systems and services total revenues were down 2.8% year-over-year. cumulatively, over 31.4 million orthodontic scans and 6.7 million restorative scans have been performed with itero scanners.
for q4, total invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the americas increased to 84% from 79.5% in q4 last year. international scans increased to 73.7%, up from 64.7% in the same quarter last year.
we're pleased to see that within the americas 94.8% of cases submitted by north american orthodontists were submitted digitally. we're also proud to share that itero element intraoral scanners are the winners of the 2020 dentaltown townie choice award for digital impressioning category.
also, during the quarter, the national association of dental laboratories judging panel selected the itero element 5d as the winner of the 2020 journal of dental technology wow! award. the award represents the recognition of our commitment to enhancing patient engagement and communications that support efficient laboratory production.
for exocad, during the quarter we launched two of the largest software releases in history, dentalcad and exoplan. dentalcad3.0 galway includes over 90 new features and over 80 enhanced functionalities with significant improvements to reduce design time, such as instant anatomic morphing. exoplan 3.0 galway includes over 40 new features and over 60 enhanced functionalities that support planning of edentulous cases, including the design of surgical guides. during the quarter, exocad also added two new large implant manufacturers as oems for exoplan in brazil.
with that, i'll now turn it over to john.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
thanks, joe. now for our q4 financial results. total revenues for the fourth quarter were $834.5 million, up 13.7% from the prior quarter and up 28.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. for clear aligners, q4 revenues of $700.7 million were up 12.9% sequentially and up 28.9% year-over-year reflecting invisalign volume growth in all regions, partially offset by lower asps.
clear aligner revenues growth was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $5 million or approximately 0.8 points sequentially and on a year-over-year basis by approximately $10.3 million or approximately 1.9 points.
q4 invisalign asps were down sequentially $15 primarily due to increased revenue deferrals related to a higher mix of new cases versus additional aligners, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange, and lower promotional discounts. as we mentioned last quarter, we did not implement a price increase in 2020 given our continued commitment to helping our customers in their recovery efforts during the pandemic. on a year-over-year basis, q4 invisalign asps decreased approximately $75 primarily due to our decision not to raise prices last summer, increased revenue deferrals for new cases versus additional aligners, and higher promotional discounts, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. as a result, clear aligner deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $83 million sequentially and $195 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. total q4 clear aligner shipments of 568,000 cases were up 14.5% sequentially and up 37.3% year-over-year.
our system and services revenues for the fourth quarter was $133.8 million, up 18% sequentially due to an increase in scanner sales and increased services revenues from our larger installed base and higher asps. year-over-year system and services revenue was up 26% due to higher scanner sales, services revenue, and the inclusion of exocad's cad/cam services, partially offset by lower scanner asps.
imaging systems and cad/cam services deferred revenue was up 30% sequentially and up 69% year-over-year primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period.
moving on to gross margin. fourth quarter overall gross margin was 73.2%, up 0.4 points sequentially and up 0.5 points year-over-year. on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to exocad, overall gross margin was 73.6% for the fourth quarter, up 0.3 points sequentially and up 0.7 points year-over-year.
clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74.9%, up 0.1 point sequentially due to lower additional aligner volume, partially offset by higher warranty, other manufacturing costs and lower asps. clear aligner gross margin was up 0.7 points year-over-year primarily due to favorable product mix from increased itero scanner absorption as a result of increased manufacturing volumes partially offset by lower asps, higher warranty costs and other manufacturing costs.
systems and services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.2%, up 2.2 points sequentially primarily due to higher asps and increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher productions volumes. systems and services gross margin was down 0.7 points year-over-year due to lower asps, higher freight and other manufacturing costs partially offset by higher services revenue.
q4 operating expenses were $397.3 million, up sequentially 11.3% and up 23.8% year-over-year. the sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased marketing and media spend and spending commensurate with business growth. year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $76.5 million, reflecting our continued investment in sales and marketing, r&d activities, and manufacturing operations.
on a non-gaap basis, operating expenses were $372.3 million, up sequentially 12.1% and up 23.4% year-over-year due to the reasons as described earlier. our fourth quarter operating income of $213.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.5%, up 1.4 points sequentially and up 2.3 points year-over-year. the sequential and year-over-year increases in operating income and the operating margin are primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage. on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to exocad, and acquisition-related costs, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 28.9%, up 0.9 points sequentially, and up 2.5 points year-over-year.
interest and other income and expense, net for the fourth quarter, was a benefit of $1.4 million, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange.
with regards to the fourth quarter tax provision, our gaap tax rate was 25.9% which includes tax benefits of approximately $11 million related to adjustments in prior years' unrecognized tax positions. the fourth quarter tax rate on a non-gaap basis was 14.5% compared to 16.6% in prior quarter and 20.9% in the same quarter a year ago. the fourth quarter non-gaap tax rate was lower than the third quarter's rate primarily due to the reason previously stated.
fourth quarter net income per diluted share was $2.00, up $0.24 sequentially and up $0.47 compared to the prior year. on a non-gaap basis, net income per diluted share was $2.61 for the fourth quarter, up $0.37 sequentially and up $0.85 year-over-year.
moving on to the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $960.8 million, an increase of approximately $345.3 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations. of our $960.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $548.3 million was held in the u.s. and $412.5 million was held by our international entities.
q4 accounts receivable balance was $657.7 million, up approximately 5% sequentially. our overall days sales outstanding was 71 days, down approximately 6 days sequentially and down approximately 5 days as compared to q4 last year due to strong cash collections.
cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $381.4 million. capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $53.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $328.3 million. under our may 2018 repurchase program, we have $100 million still available for repurchase of our common stock.
before we move to the outlook, i would like to make a few comments on the full year 2020 results. in 2020, we shipped a record 1.6 million invisalign cases, up 7.9% year-over-year. this reflects 13.3% volume growth from our international doctors and 3.6% volume growth from our americas doctors.
system and services volumes were down 12% compared to 2019, reflecting the impact of covid-19 pandemic on equipment sales.
total revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 2.7% year-over-year, with clear aligner revenues a record $2.1 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year.
2020 systems and services revenues were $370.5 million, including exocad revenues from april 1, 2020 forward compared to $381 million in 2019. full year 2020 operating income of $387.2 million, down 28.6% versus 2019 and operating margin at 15.7% versus 22.5% in 2019.
2019 operating income included a litigation benefit of $51 million and invisalign store closures of $23 million for a net benefit on operating margin of 1.1%. with regards to a full year tax provision, our gaap tax rate was negative 368.6%, which includes a one-time tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion, net of current year amortization, associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to an intra-entity sale of certain intellectual property rights resulting from our corporate structure reorganization completed in the first quarter of 2020. excluding the tax benefit related to our corporate structure reorganization and the related tax effects of stock-based compensation and other non-gaap adjustments, the full year tax rate on a non-gaap basis was 17.6% compared to 22% for 2019.
2020 diluted eps was $22.41. on a non-gaap basis, 2020 diluted eps was $5.25. free cash flow was $507.3 million for 2020, down $90.3 million versus 2019.
now let me turn to our outlook. overall, we are very pleased with our q4 performance and the strong momentum in our business, which has continued through january for both clear aligners and systems and services. as we discussed at our investor day in november, we are committed to making significant investments to drive growth and we are seeing good return on these investments across all regions and customer channels. these strong returns give us confidence to continue investing in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to accelerate adoption in a huge, underpenetrated market. these investments coupled with typically higher seasonal operating expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to result in a sequentially lower operating margin percent in q1 as we have historically seen.
while the global environment surrounding the pandemic remains uncertain, we will continue to focus on what we can control and we are confident in our ability to continue to execute. our responsibility is to continue driving innovation and delivering on the needs of our customer doctors and their patients. over the past 24 years, align has invested billions in technology, innovation, consumer marketing and demand creation to connect millions of consumers with our doctor customers. we will continue to invest in this business to drive demand and to drive adoption of the align digital platform, including manufacturing and operational expansion. we will always be responsible. just like we've done in the past, we make investments to drive growth and maximize roi. we remain committed to our long-term target model of 20% to 30% revenue growth for clear aligners and systems and services, and operating margin of 25% to 30%.
with that, i'll turn it back over to joe for final comments. joe?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. the choices we made in 2020, to protect employees, support customers, and press forward on our strategy for growth, were possible because of the strength of our balance sheet and the confidence we have in our business model. our actions reflect our conviction in the enormous opportunity we have to transform smiles and change lives. with 15 million orthodontic cases starts annually and more than 500 million consumers who can benefit from a better smile, the market for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry is massive and has been unleashed by the need for digital.
in a macro sense, covid-19 has accentuated the benefits and pervasiveness of the digital economy. from an align standpoint, practices across every region are embracing digital treatment in new ways and more purposefully than ever before. invisalign providers are using our virtual tools to minimize in-office appointments and deliver doctor-directed, personalized treatment that meets the needs of the moment and that will reshape the future of treatment. digital acceleration is not just around invisalign treatment. it includes digital workflows around itero scanners and general dentistry. doctors tell us that the itero scanner is central to their practice and their practice workflows, and it is key to driving digital treatment. we've always known this, itero and now exocad are core components of the align digital platform, our integrated suite of unique, proprietary technologies and services delivered as a seamless, end-to-end solution for patients and consumers, orthodontists and gp dentists, and lab partners. and particularly, we now have all the building blocks to create digital workflows, leveraging the combined power of invisalign treatment, itero scanners, and exocad software to become more relevant to the gp market, which is critical to accessing the 500 million consumer opportunity. align is a growth business with huge opportunities, but the environment remains uncertain due to covid-19. our plan is still to counter uncertainty by staying focused on our long-term strategy, living our values, supporting our employees and customers, and keeping in mind the demand drivers we've identified over the past year, the redirection of disposable income for many consumers, channel focus that allows us to reach and support a wider range of customers within each channel. and most importantly, the digital mindset that's taking hold with more and more of our customers and that we are supporting through innovative products and programs that can help support their digital transformation.
we are not ignoring the reality of covid-19 and how long it may be part of our lives, but we're also not going to stop driving the business forward for the good of customers and their patients, our employees, and our stakeholders. in closing, i want to leave you with a few thoughts as we begin the new year. while there is considerable amount of turmoil in the world, our focus is on what we can control as a company. we have strong momentum. we'll stay focused on our strategic priorities, international expansion, patient demand and conversion, orthodontist utilization, and gp dentist treatment.
in summary, we are very pleased with the fourth quarter and full year results of 2020, during a remarkable year with events beyond our control as a result of covid-19. it is during times such as this when having a solid strategy combined with focused execution can lead to outcomes that support growth, not only for align's business but also practice growth for align's customers which also leads to more and more invisalign smiles.
with that, turn it over to the operator and we'll take calls.

[operator instructions] the first question is from nathan rich from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good afternoon, and thanks so much for the questions. maybe starting with the guidance for the year and your expectations over the balance of the year, i appreciate the detail that you gave. i guess, should we think about the revenue cadence as being similar to a normal year? and joe, i mean, it certainly seems like the shift in market share that you've been highlighting has accelerated during the pandemic, i guess, i'd be curious to know if you have any way of kind of quantifying the magnitude of this shift as we think about the ability of you to kind of sustain this momentum going forward and the gains that obviously clear aligners have had during the pandemic?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
nathan, we're obviously optimistic, i mean, given the guidance we had today and the strong first quarter results, we really feel good about where we are. the great thing about this growth is, it's been broad indeed. okay. it is across every region we see it, whether it's in apac or whether it's emea, whether it's in the americas overall, and then across the gp spectrum, across the ortho spectrum too, it's been terrific, and it's also up and down, that's why we're giving you comprehensive, non-comprehensive now all different kinds of cases. so we just feel, we feel great about the demand patterns, the depth and breadth of this rebound and that's why we have some clarity now, we decided to give guidance and we're excited about this year and going forward.
john, any thoughts around?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
and to add to your question nathan, the seasonality and things that we've seen in the past will continue, we would expect those to continue as we go through this year. so it's hard to compare year-over-year, especially in the first half, but going forward, it makes sense to look at it quarter-over-quarter.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. and if i could just ask a quick follow-up on the -- it seems like there is going to be more discussion around comprehensive versus non-comprehensive instead of the regional breakout going forward. so i was wondering if you could just level set us on the current mix of business between comprehensive and non-comprehensive cases and how you're thinking about the growth of those two categories going forward? thanks a lot.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
yeah, when you look at it, nathan. it's about 75% comprehensive and 25% non-comprehensive. it can vary by quarter based on teen season and so on, but that's roughly this but therein we're investing in both areas to be able to grow, whether it's on the ortho side or the gp side for those categories.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
yeah, nathan, i think you know the margin on those products also, so there is not -- this is not like margins split, i mean, you still have higher margins on the less than comprehensive product line too. so it's a good mix.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
yeah, ok nathan.

the next question is from jason bednar from piper sandler. please go ahead.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey guys, good afternoon. hey, congrats. congrats on a really nice quarter here. i actually wanted to start on guidance as well. if i focus on the second half of the year, maybe on comps tend to normalize a bit and use the midpoint of that 20% to 30% long-term guide you've got out there. are you able to talk on how this comes together from a regional or channel perspective? is it safe to assume that teens international still grows above that mid 20s level and then is it right to think about imaging and cad/cam grown at that mid 20s level as well?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
yeah jason, this is john. we would look at invisalign and our systems and services to grow at that mid point in the second half. so around that 25% year-over-year across the business and we're making investments and continued investments as we've talked about to really establish and continue our growth.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and john just sorry, anything from a regional or channel perspective international or teens or just how that all comes together?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
i think we're not forecasting by each of the regions and so on from that, i think you can from our business, we're trying to grow teen. it's a great indicator for the penetration there on the ortho side and we'll continue to grow that, but not giving specifics by region.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, understood. and then just one other follow-up, i mean the clear aligner gross margin was extremely strong this quarter. clear aligner revenue that grew $50 million sequentially but cogs that fell by $10 million. john, i know you step through some of the factors just incorporated there, but is this a sustainable level that we should be thinking about for clear aligner gross margin going forward, kind of in this upper 70s level or maybe there were there some other factors that helped push that gross margin higher here just in the first quarter?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
well, we did see some fx benefit as we called out, but it's a reflection of investing in this business, adding capacity, adding in places where we see the growth, and this was leveraging some of those investments. so it's a reflection of the work that we have, the productivity that we can drive across the business, utilizing some of the facilities that we have and then benefit a bit from fx on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
understood.

the next question is from elizabeth anderson from evercore. please go ahead.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
hi elizabeth.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore -- analyst
hi guys. hey, thanks so much for the question and congrats on a nice quarter. can you talk about any changes in your dso strategy, i know obviously you highlighted the renewal in the quarter, but i just didn't know if there as we come out of covid anything to think about there in terms of how you're working with that group of customers?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
no, elizabeth actually, we do we can we bring the entire align digital platform together with itero, the different, some dsos, one approaches think from a comprehensive standpoint, someone non-comprehensive. so we just basically gear our digital platform and our product line based on what a dso wants to do and what they want to accomplish and not just in the u.s., really all over the world.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then in terms of the new facility in poland. should we think about the potential impact on the gross margin line to be similar to when you open the ziyang facility or is there a different way that you that this one is different?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
i think when we look at that we will leverage to ramp up that facility as fast as possible. it's a lot of volume can come through from emea. so i won't look at that as a model for us. remember, what we did in china was a temporary facility to move to a greenfield, and this is a greenfield new facility to start with.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore -- analyst
got it. okay, thanks.

the next question is from jon block from stifel. please go ahead.
jonathan block -- stifel -- analyst
thanks guys.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
hi, jon.
jonathan block -- stifel -- analyst
hey, joe, nice quarter. two relatively quick ones, i guess to start. joe, you called out emea. north america as primary case volume, call it upside drivers not apac. and just maybe if you could talk to apac a little bit more. it was sort of first in covid, where i think everyone was thinking, first in, first-out, but it seems like emea has been stronger. i mean, it wasn't a 2-year stack basis despite all the headline stop that we hear in emea, any details on apac, obviously you've got a pretty big competitor in china, anymore granularity there would be very helpful. and then i've got a little bit of a tighter follow up. thanks.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
yeah, first. i mean emea, it was amazing in that way. but i wouldn't let it eclipse apac right, like we feel really good about apac across the board. china, obviously being a big area of the sequential growth of china, when you look at fourth quarter versus first quarters, right, net 7%, 7.5% range, like the entire businesses, and then obviously apac is extremely diverse, but from japan, anz those key areas that we have in apac, it's really strong growth. so i really feel great about apac. it's just there somewhat of an eclipse right now because emea was extremely strong. but you shouldn't that -- yourself think in any way that that means apac was weak in some way. we feel good about apac as we go into the first quarter and the whole year.
jonathan block -- stifel -- analyst
okay. yeah, i guess, good problem to have. second one is sort of a derivative of nathan's question. but the biggest question i get from investors is this pull forward of demand. in other words, is the 1q '21 volume call it success, is that at the expense of future quarters and it seems like your guidance suggest you're not too worried about that joe. but can you give us more details here like why aren't you worried about any pull-forward? what are you hearing from sales reps, what are docs saying about sustaining the momentum throughout the year? thanks.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
yeah, john. john, first of all, it's the breadth of this growth. it's not like it's a singular region like we just talked about with emea, and apac and how strong the americas is. we're seeing great uptake in the gp side. we see terrific growth there, the orthodontics side, you saw our teen numbers are good and respectable, we're moving in the teen season. so what we feel good about is just the breadth and depth of this business. it's not just leaning on one or two legs from a strategy standpoint, it really is well-positioned going forward. we hear the same thing about demand pull-forward, whatever, doctors aren't talking like that. remember the questions back in the third quarter and fourth quarter was backlog, right, how much of this is backlog that wasn't consummated. and second quarter or early third quarter, when we got way past that. obviously we got into the fourth quarter, whatever. so i think we're just seeing a realization in the adult and the teen market of what digital orthodontics can do and our company is very well-positioned to take advantage of that when you look throughout the world. john, anything to add? jon, thanks.
jonathan block -- stifel -- analyst
thanks guys.
operator
the next question is from kevin caliendo from ubs. please go ahead.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. thanks for taking my call. let me talk a little bit about how to think about seasonality with regards to teens. you typically you gear up the summer is a big teen season historically. do you expect that again next year as sort of back to school might be a little more normal, and what, how should we think about you gearing up for another incremental teen season, what might be different? any expectations around incremental share for teens? i'd just love to hear the strategy.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
well, i think we have a strategy really based on every region, because a teen season is different by region, from a calendar standpoint and doctors apply our technology in different ways with teens, but let us just take the u.s. and canada for a second, obviously in the second quarter, beginning of third quarter, those are the really strong areas, where you'll see our advertising program really kick in in a big way. we talked about the teen awesomeness centers that we put in place, that's with making sure that we have doctors that are really well equipped to handle teens and we directly leads to that teens with confidence that they can be serviced properly. overseas, we understand what those timing are for the teens also and we put those programs together too. honestly, kevin we have a great portfolio, right, and we can, we can go across teens in a lot of different ways, all the way from 6 year olds, to really older teens when you get to 16 to 19 years old and the tooth movements associated with those two. so it's just having those doctors ready, is having the communications with the teens and their moms to make sure they're aware of digital orthodontic option and they really ask for that as they go into the doctor's and that's the strategy we apply just in different ways, in different seasons around the world, but it's specifically applies to teens.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
that's helpful. i mean, just one follow-up on margins, the gross margin number was, you covered that already, should we think about any of that flowing down to the operating margin or any sort of target for operating margins over the next couple of years? you've historically always look to spend to grow and it's always, you've always been rewarded for it, there is no reason to change, but just thinking sort of where you are now, maybe, if you do have a little bit of an uptick in the gross margin that you can let more of it flow through to the operating. so how do you think about that?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
i think when you look at it. kevin, this is john. i mean, we're looking to balance our growth opportunities with our margin and in certain countries you might be in different parts of that equation. but on balance, we're pleased with the gross margin. we've talked a lot about the investments, the productivity and other things that we see and that continues and it gives us a lot of flexibility to be able to invest. but in a vastly under-penetrated market that we're in, making these investments to grow volume make a lot of sense, but we're always mindful of that balance between volume and margin.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
thanks so much.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
yeah, thanks, kevin.

the next question is from ravi misra from berenberg capital markets. please go ahead.
ravi misra -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thanks for taking the question.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
good afternoon.
ravi misra -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
so just, i wanted to press a little bit more on kind of just some of the marketing opportunities that you're highlighting. and just curious, you have the ski team now, you're talking about the golden state warriors, i'm sure teams on green are not very happy about that, but just can you help us understand, like what do you go after when you look at the marketing opportunity like in terms of the return that you're searching for the particular brands that you're aligning with? and then i will follow-up after that. thanks.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
we do a lot of work on this ravi, figuring out what channels, what kind of return we get by channel, how much you put in social media sports team, how much do you put in television, but overall, john and i expect a certain return and we know what those returns are by region. we invest $1 here, we know what we get back. i don't necessarily want to convey exactly what those returns are, we make sure the profits are positive and you've seen us increase our advertising pretty dramatically outside united states. the response for that's been really good and obviously, we use a lot of what we learned here in north america to apply that around the world, so invisalign is an incredibly well-known brand, not just in north america, but all around the world and being a leverage that and having that as kind of a common name around the world is very helpful for us, in the sense of driving volumes, giving doctors confidence and patients confidence too. so we really feel good about our investments and we obviously balance that well with increased salespeople, with technology investments, all the things you have to do when you run a business like this, but it is something that obviously gains a lot of attention and a lot of analysis from us.
ravi misra -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
great. and then maybe just one on the press release something caught my eye around your ortho summit case shoot-out, where the highest number was around kind of class ii/class iii invisalign case presentation. now historically that's been something i think maybe that unless you're a bleeding edge kol or doctor that you weren't doing, the fact that that's kind of winning the kind of peer award now, does that suggest that you're getting deeper into these more complicated cases? and just more specifically, do you feel that you have an edge versus your competitors in the space that allow you to do this or is this kind of a class effect that you think has to do with comfort and ease of use of the technology at all? thanks.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
yeah, ravi it's a good question. look i, remember we have, we've done what we said, 10.2 million cases and through those 10.2 million cases we've learned a lot and we learn more every day. and we run ai, machine learning across those cases and that's how we just launched ga, as we understood and deep bite cases, we have some issues with posterior opened by in different clinical kind of issues that will bore you to death, but we understand based on millions of cases we've done, which are the best way to move those teeth to ensure that they end up in the right positions with the right smile at -- obviously, you want to do this as quickly as you possibly can because patients don't want to be in treatment for 5 years.
so, i feel we have an incredible advantage, you look at smarttrack, you look at how we initiate that with over 4 million lines of code that we have in clincheck you look at the accuracy of itero in the sense of transferring information through over to our manufacturing facility in order to make this. it's so, i feel very confident about a 24-year first mover advantage and what we've done. now obviously there is competitors out there and competitors are coming up, but a lot of them have to crawl through the friction of what we did in order to learn this and a lot of the ip that we have put down that makes us unique in a sense of how we positioned ourselves in the marketplace.
so, back to you what you started with, when you do the shoot-outs and all, it's really great to sit in the audience and look at the before and after photos. i mean, it's amazing; when i first joined this business. i just said. it's hard to believe that you can do this. what's happening today is it's just becoming more common. i mean, you go all around the world, it's not one or two doctors doing this. there's hundreds if not thousands, they're doing incredible kinds of cases. and so, which i think did more and more, it just lends credibility to this product line and you can do what we say now 90% of all the cases that are out there, that's not just because it's plastic, right? it is the whole system, from how we 3d print, what plastic we use, the algorithms we use, how we constantly tweak it by the information that we have, driving a brand like this, have any kind of training, we talked about 200,000 doctors we've trained who had gone through these things, this takes time to do, it takes expertise and doctors need that confidence and understanding and we feel we can give it to them better than anyone.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
and that technology is brought about by investments and we will invest over $250 million this year alone in r&d to improve our systems and invisalign for our customers. and it's an advantage, it's advantage like joe said over a period of time, but we're continuing to invest to make things better and better for our customers.

the next question is from richard newitter from svb leerink. please go ahead.
jaime morgan -- svb leerink
hi, this is jaime on for, rich. just one question from me, appreciating that you guys are obviously focused on driving higher ortho utilization, overall gp adoption at the same time. i'm just curious in your view, which of the two is likely to be the bigger make or break driver of growth over the near to intermediate term?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
it just sounds like a terrible answer to you, but they're both really -- you talk, we talk about 500 million patients out there that could use invisalign treatment. we know that other 15 million orthodontic cases roughly 75% to 80% are the teens, i mean, all those, they're both and they are both huge opportunities and there is not a difference from a technology standpoint or how you apply that technology to either of those. it would make one easier to do or more beneficial than another. so honestly both of those are great reservoirs of growth for us.
jaime morgan -- svb leerink
thanks. got it. okay. and then just...
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
go ahead, jamie.
jaime morgan -- svb leerink
one last one for me, just on the dso, kind of the business model and strategy that you guys have for entrenching itero systems in dsos across all practices, kind of, how do you approach that? and when you do see dsos where the large majority of their practices have adopt the itero theater, what's the sort of pick up that you guys see in terms of utilization? thanks so much.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
we use itero scanners, we train the doctors properly. you have the right product in the gp channel like igo and different products like that. we get terrific uptake. i mean you can't measure the way you do, share for an orthodontic office, but we get -- our dso business is significant now, it's meaningful in that way and it's one where that digital platform strategy you kind of outlined in your question is what we employ, but again, we employ in different ways depending on how a dso really wants to engage with us.
shirley stacy -- vice president finance, corporate and investor communications

jeff johnson -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
the next question is from jeff johnson from baird. please go ahead.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
hey jeff.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
hey guys, good evening. hey, john, i want to go back, you mentioned the $250 million in r&d and i think the number we've discussed over the last, i don't know, probably somewhere in the last 6 or 9 months or so was like $500 million total of what you guys spend, not only on r&d but channel support, advertising, social media, all that stuff. and on our mind, that's one of your bigger barriers to entry even probably more so than some of the ip and what have you, but it sounds like with some of the stuff you're taking up emea, you're taking up apac advertising, more and more sports teams and things like that, is that $500 million number a dated number at this point, is that barrier to entry and that spend even go and well above that number in the near to intermediate term?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
you will see that, it's a good question, jeff. we talked about that at our last investor day about the $500 million combined kind of the marketing and go-to-market plus the r&d and what you'll see is as in success and we've talked about a lot with as you know, where we see returns, where we see volume, where we see profitability we're going to continue to make those investments. so as we go through this year that number will most likely go up as we find success in these investments and find that right return.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
yeah, fair enough. and joe, i'd be interested. i mean, we saw covid case counts and restrictions, even in the 1q in some of the markets you called out in emea as being so strong uk, france, i'm sure some others you called out other areas obviously india that we're all watching closely, but a lot of other markets as well that are still dealing with covid case counts and heightened risks there. does that even matter to case shipments to invisalign at this point? i guess what i'm trying to figure out is, is that stuff holding back some volumes that could come through next year, are we all just with covid fatigue still comfortable going in and getting clear aligner cases even in those markets, so is covid a risk factor, i guess, that you've had to build in some caution and the guidance for in some of those markets or cases just a strong in those markets as they are in markets where maybe covid is a little more under control? thanks.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
yeah, jeff, it's a good question. it's just what we've seen is one definitive if offices are shut down and patients aren't allowed to go to offices. we saw that, that happened in the second quarter, happened all around the world, and then the term lockdown is used very loosely all around the world. what's a lockdown and what isn't, the situations like in india right now are a disaster, obviously and people are very cautious, but the rest away around the world what we see is, it looks like communities and people have been able to manage this, ok. is there any kind of a backlog of patients not going into dental offices because of that, i think in certain countries around the world there is, but we can't really quantify that right now. and again, the breadth and depth of our demand pattern gives us confidence that we think we can predict around it.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
yeah, thanks.

the next question is from erin wright from credit suisse. please go ahead.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks. can you speak a little bit about what you're doing differently in terms of promotion? there are other initiatives around itero and that's really meeting with customers maybe differently now and and where at the traction mostly tied to on the ortho or gp channel, and do you anticipate any lumpiness quarter-to-quarter across that business? thanks.
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
yeah, itero has been great for us, right. we have good services business there. we announced a plus series itero which is, it's a breakthrough. i mean it sounds like it's a derivative as far as an incremental. but it is really a strong platform, we talk about the artificial intelligence we've been able to embed in that machine. we could see doctors, both on the gp side, in orthodontics side really excited about it. this is not a promotional discussion in the sense when you ask your question about how to promote it. there is nothing tricky there. what we do is we have a broad number of products. you have the niri product plus, which is the very high-end product line, then you have the flex system, which i mentioned in my opening, which is basically a wand itself. and it's used with a normal kind of a computer that's adapted to that and it helps to get flexibility in the sense of what a customer wants to use or doctor wants to use on both ends. so i feel like how we take this to market, the different products that we have in a different way that we segment that is -- and then, obviously, if you want to do invisalign, this is the front end, the key end of our digital platform and that's very attractive to both gps and orthos that really want to do invisalign, they know that itero is critical for that.

the next question is from brandon couillard from jefferies. please go ahead.
brandon couillard -- jeffereries -- senior vice president
thanks for squeezing me in. john, maybe just a 2 part question around guidance. the operating margin outlook would suggest your margins kind of moderate a bit over the balance of the year from 1q levels, can you sort of elaborate on your expectations for gross margins for the balance of the year? and then what should we -- how should we think about the trend of asps over the next few quarters? i'll just leave it there.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
yeah. brandon we look at, we're pleased with our gross margin and margins that we had in the first quarter, a lot of things came together on that. when we look at the investments in the growth opportunities we have, we're not giving specific guidance around our own gross margin, but you could see as it translates to op margins a reflection of the growth opportunities we have, the investment opportunities that we have to be able to invest and grow in this business and we can update as we go forward based on what we see.
your other part of the question regarding kind of asps and so on, when you look at -- we have a breakout and we show that on a regular basis between comprehensive and non-comprehensive. we don't expect any major fluctuation across our asps. the only thing that comes up and we saw in this quarter a bit was with currency changes. but in terms of the promotions and how we go about the business and how we're trying to drive growth, there is nothing out of the ordinary that would impact asps.

hey, joe, i just wanted to follow-up on jeff's question a bit. so if you move beyond office closures, as you look at certain regions of the world becoming hot spots and then that fading does that impact demand levels that you're seeing?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
it's not a great answer for john, it's yes and no. okay. depending on the severity and where it is, i can say, yes. for the most part, we say no and that's after the second quarter when, again a definitive piece, if you shut offices down you won't let patients in there, we're going to have an issue, but actually after the second quarter, or early third quarter, we've been dealing with lockdowns that are basically lockdowns of time frame, lockdowns of where people can travel, but not specific lockdown to doctor offices. if the market stays away from that, we feel we're pretty good.

thanks for squeezing me in. hey, guys. i'll just ask a quick one sort of want to expand a little bit on the asp question that was just asked, i'm just wondering you cited a little bit in your prepared remarks in terms of promotional and things like that, discounts, are you referring specifically to the advantage program? and if you could talk about how some of the orthos and gps are falling in with those tiers, have you seen any movement over the last couple of quarters where people are falling more into the platinum and the diamond grouping there kind of also backing into sort of the numbers on utilization between ortho have seen some really nice numbers, the last couple of quarters, is that indicative of that a higher portion of orthos and gps hone at those higher tiers and therefore walking in those, the high promotional discounts?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
yes, certainly that is impact. what you have as doctors growth through the tiers they become more proficient, they had to take on more cases whether they're on the ortho side or the gp side. we see them work their way through tiers, they do more cases that we get that volume benefit and and then they'll see those discounts there. we've had those programs in place, that those programs really have drive utilization and really talked to the utilization growth that you noted there. so those are programs that we've had. they are there to drive utilization and it's something that we've used in our business and expect to continue to use.

joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
thanks shirley. good afternoon and thanks for joining us. on our call today, i'll provide some highlights on the first quarter then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and systems and services. john will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the full year. following that, i'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.
i'm pleased to report another strong quarter with record revenues and volumes reflecting strong growth for both invisalign clear aligners and itero systems and services across products and customer channels worldwide. q1 sequential invisalign clear aligner growth was driven by strength in both adult and teen market segments across products, customer channels, especially in north america and the emea region. the year is off to a great start, and q1 reflects increasing momentum and the benefit from continued investments in our strategic initiatives focusing on expanding our operations globally in existing and emerging international markets, increasing ortho adoption and utilization of invisalign treatment especially with teens, training and education gp dentist and increasing conversion to clear aligners and building invisalign brand preference with millions of consumers through advertising, pr, digital social media and influencer marketing to drive demand and conversion to invisalign-trained doctors.
for q1, total revenues were $894.8 million, up 7.2% sequentially and 62.4% year-over-year. q1 system and services were $141.5 million, up 5.8% sequentially and up 104% year-over-year. q1 '21 clear aligner revenues of $753.3 million were up 7.5% sequentially and increased 56.4% year-over-year. in q1, we shipped a record 595.8000 invisalign cases, an increase of 4.9% sequentially and 65.8% year-over-year. in addition, we shipped to a record 78.6000 invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 6.6000 were first-time customers.
during the quarter we reached a significant milestone with our 10 millionth invisalign patient gabriela silva, who recently began her treatment with dr. dr. eunice blind, an invisalign trained orthodontists in sao paulo, brazil, one of our fastest growing country markets. it's remarkable to think about the pace of growth and adoption that we are experiencing worldwide. especially, we're considering it took 10 years to achieve our 1-millionth invisalign patient milestone and now we're adding 1 million new invisalign patients in less than 6 months. we are grateful to our doctor partners and their patients and to our 20,000 employees around the world that helped us reach this milestone.
in recognition of our 10-millionth invisalign milestone, we've donated $10 million to the align foundation, donor-advised fund and are kicking off a campaign called #10minvisalignsmiles, 10 million thanks, centered around the transformative power of invisalign treatment through the eyes of invisalign patients. from a product perspective, q1 clear aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the invisalign portfolio for both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products. q1 comp volume increased 4.9% sequentially and 62.3% year-over-year.
in q1, non-comp or non-comprehensive volume increased 5% sequentially and 74.4% year-over-year. invisalign clear aligners address a wide range of case complexity and can treat approximately 90% of case starts for adults and teens in phase 1 treatment for kids as young as 6 years old. q1 adult patients, increased 5.8% sequentially and 68.5% year-over-year. q1 teens or younger patients increased 2.7% sequentially, 58.9% year-over-year. teenage cases made up nearly 75% of the 15 million ortho starts each year and despite our rapid growth in adoption, invisalign treatment is still only single-digits worldwide. so, we continue to see significant runway here.
our strong q1 results also reflect our multi-million dollar consumer marketing investment across key media channels with broad reach to drive consumers to invisalign doctor practices. our teen and mom-focused consumer campaign generated 138% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website and 35% increase in leads generated. in addition, invisalign social media influencers like charli d'amelio, avani gregg, antoine franz, and many others content creators influencers enabled a delivery of 4.2 billion impressions in q1 '21 delivering exciting new content and increased engagement for the invisalign brand among their millions of followers.
the consumer insights and data we receive from our programs suggest adults are also continuing to invest more in themselves for their overall health and well-being and have more disposable income to do so. they are seeking invisalign clear aligner treatment from our invisalign doctors and sharing their positive experiences with their friends, family and social networks becoming influencers themselves.
now let's turn to the specifics around our first quarter results, starting with the americas. for the americas region, q1 was another strong quarter with invisalign case volume up 8.4% sequentially and 53.8% year-over-year, reflecting increased invisalign submitters and utilization growth for both orthodontic and gp channels. q1 results also reflect continued investment in digital marketing, sales programs, our channel focus around gps, orthos and dsos and other initiatives to help drive utilization. in the gp channel, invisalign moderate and invisalign go continue to gain traction. this was especially true for gp dentists that enrolled in the ipro program, as well as doctors that have installed itero scanners. the gp accelerator program designed exclusively for gps provides an all encompassing support plan based on practice needs that is centered around maximizing itero integration, clinical support needs and implementing new marketing strategies. dso utilization also increased and continues to be a strong growth driver and outpaced non-dso practices.
today, we announced that we have extended our relationship with deca dental group and have signed a new multi-year agreement for the invisalign system through early 2025. in addition, deca dental group is extending utilization of itero element 5d imaging system across its affiliate practices in united states. this provides deca dental doctors and clinical support team members with access to align's customized clinical education for the invisalign system and the itero element 5d imaging system to support practices in adopting new workflows for restorative dentistry and for digital orthodontics.
in the ortho-channel, the team also in these centers program directs patients to invisalign doctors who are expert at treating teens and are seen as the go-to doctors in their markets helping to drive increase comprehensive treatments within the north american ortho-channel. tomorrow, registration opens for the 2021 teen forum virtual edition to be held on june 10 and 11 which combines 2 days of all new dynamic sessions focused on the invisalign teen patient journey. sessions will focus on building clinical confidence, efficient workflows, teen and parent conversion and the overall digital treatment experience that teens expect. the timing of the forum is designed as a strong lead to the busy teen season and attendees will have the option after post-forum mentoring by invisalign teen experts to help orthos and their staff apply the tools from the teen forum to their practices and get additional support through their busy summer.
for international business, q1 invisalign case volume was up sequentially 0.9%, on a year-over-year basis, international shipments were up 83.2%. in emea, q1 volumes were sequentially 3.7% up 74.9% year-over-year with strong broad-based growth across all markets, led by the uk, france and italy, along with the continued growth in our expansion markets led by turkey, russia, cis and benelux. we also saw strong performance from both ortho and gp channels with momentum in the gp channels with adults reflected in strong utilization and shipments from invisalign go. emea growth programs are customized by market and customers type to encourage invisalign utilization such as professional 360 ortho and advanced 360 ortho programs with over 2,000 orthodontists enrolled.
we also had gp move 360, a program designed to be able to help move doctors along their developmental journey, with an increase in gp cohorts of over 117% compared to a prior year. we're also continue to offer online and on-demand education events, which have reached over 15,000 gps cumulatively. in the region, we hosted several successful summits and forums for invisalign doctors this quarter, in all-virtual formats the uk gp forum and ortho summit, french ortho summit and the itero element plus launch media event. in addition, we just held the italian and dach or german ortho summit last week.
international expansion remains one of our key strategic pillars. last week we announced plans to open a new manufacturing facility in poland, which will be our first aligner plant in the emea region and our third plant worldwide joining juarez, mexico and ziyang, china. the new facility is expected to be supplying customers in the emea region in early 2022, helping address the large and relatively untapped market of more than 5 million annual orthodontic case starts and more than 150 million emea customers who could benefit from treatment. the investment is part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to our customers and reflects our commitment to invisalign trained doctors and their patients in the emea region and extends our local operations in the region. the state-of-the-art emea plant and work law is expected to add more than 2,500 jobs by the end of 2025, making it the company's largest investment in emea to-date and the largest 3d printing operation in the region.
for apac, q1 volumes were down sequentially 3.9% as expected, reflecting seasonality. on a year-over-year basis, apac was up 101.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting continued strong growth across the region led by china, japan and anz. invisalign volume growth drivers or young adults with young kids ramping faster than any other age group. in the teen segment invisalign volumes accelerated during the quarter and were driven by increased invisalign utilization in case submissions from invisalign doctors.
we also continue to see good adoption of the invisalign moderate product for non-comprehensive treatment in the gp channel. during the quarter, we continued to offer online and on-demand education events which reached over 14,000 gps cumulatively. invisalign volumes in china were flat sequentially and up over 200% year-over-year. in q1, china volumes gained momentum throughout the quarter. the align clinical education site is to go-to digital hub for invisalign doctors and team education and training. the digital learning environment was relaunched in february 2020 for invisalign doctors offering a comprehensive learning platform with role specific content for orthos, gps and their teams. the site enables more online learning opportunities with spotlight features for what's trending now, recommended learning paths based on doctors' experiences and expanded categories including digital treatment planning, comprehensive dentistry and team education.
during the quarter, over 102,000 unique users having assessed and the records lecture, completed self-paced learning modules and watched how to videos doing more than 3 million pages of learnt content. in the ortho-channel, over 38,000 unique users have engaged with the digital learning site and additional 63,000 unique users from the gp channel. we also continue to see good adoption of the adapt program, which is an expert and independent fee-based business consulting service offered by align to optimize clinics operational workflow and processes to enhance patient experience, customer and staff satisfaction. as a result of the adapt service, practices experienced higher growth and greater efficiencies for orthodontic practices as well as improved profitability after implementation. to-date, we've seen a 50% increase in invisalign cases among doctors, cohorts within 6 months of participation in the adapt program. in addition, while still early in the program, we're also seeing a strong correlation or halo effect on teen utilization among adapt doctor cohorts.
our consumer marketing is focuses on educating consumers about the invisalign system and driving that demand to our invisalign doctor offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. in q1, we continue to see strong digital engagement globally with more than 138% increase in unique visitors, 95% increase in doctor locator searches and 35% increase in leads created on a year-over-year basis, driven by our global adult and mom-focused campaigns and teen focused influencer content. our u.s. mom-teen multi-touch, multi-million dollar campaign with influencer led youtube videos, among focused tv spot, a custom twitch activation and mega teen sensation such as charli d'amelio and avani gregg continue to perform well and garnered 4.2 billion impressions in q1.
the statistics i shared previously speak to the continued success this marketing campaign is having, to not only drive demand with consumers, but also educate them on the benefits of invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. the align digital platform continues to gain traction globally. our consumer and patient app my invisalign is now available in 58 markets, resulting in a more than 4 times increase in app downloads and 3 times increase in patients actively using our app in q1 '21 versus the same period a year ago.
our consumer and patients feature usage continues to increase. for example, invisalign virtual appointment tool was used 86,000 times and our insurance verification feature was used 27,000 times in q1. further, we received more than 575,000 patient photos in our virtual care feature to take globally, providing us rich data to leverage our ai capabilities to improve our services for doctors and patients. lastly, our new consumer website has been rolled out to more than 50 markets and continues to drive increased effectiveness in recreation.
in the emea region, we've built on the tremendous success we saw with the consumer marketing pilot in q4 in the uk and expanded our media investments across the uk, germany and france to drive in great engagements resulting in more than 335% increase in unique visitors and 95% increase in leads. we also expanded our consumer advertising in the apac region in australia, japan and china and saw more than 2,000% increase in consumer engagement and a 298% percent increase in leads. several key metrics that show increased activity engagement with the invisalign brand are included in our q1 quarterly presentation slides available on our website.
our nfl partnership continues to do well, generating over 23.5 million impressions during the quarter. it continues to be another major integral channel to reach adults considering clear aligner treatment through an invisalign trained doctor. during the quarter we expanded our sports partnership marketing strategy with the invisalign brand named the official smile partner of the golden state warriors. as part of the agreement with the 6 times nba, champion golden state warriors the invisalign brand also the official smile partner of the santa cruz warriors, the golden state's g league affiliate and the golden guardians its e-sport affiliate. the sponsorship includes omnichannel activation across tv, digital media, social, a jersey partnership with the golden guardians and the santa cruz warriors.
finally, on the consumer marketing front, we also launched our first ever social purpose initiative in q1 called invisalign changemakers, an award program we developed a partnership with the national 4-h council. this is a celebrating highlight teens in making impact in their communities. we were blown away by the number of recommendations and stories we received about teens, from redistributing excess food to combat hunger in their communities, to donating weighted blankets to those in the autism spectrum. overall, it's been heartwarming to learn about each of these amazing teenagers who bring a unique approach to positively impacting their communities and following their passions to create change. in total, we received nearly 800 changemaker applications, on june 28, we will announce a 100 winners, each of whom will receive $5,000 to help them continue their goodwill efforts. we'll also celebrate these young forces of change with a virtual ceremony currently slated for mid-july. we are continuing to invest in creating consumer demand for invisalign aligners in markets around the world. our global campaigns include a multi-channel media strategy, using digital video, social media, influencer marketing and tv.
for our systems and services business, q1 revenues were up 5.8% sequentially reflecting slightly lower scanner volume following a record fourth quarter. this is primarily due to the seasonality of capital equipment sales at year-end and higher services revenue. on a year-over-year basis, systems and services' revenues were up 104%, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services. the itero element 5d imaging system continues to gain traction across all regions. element 5d is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3d intraoral optical impressions 2d color images in near-infrared technology or niri technology. forged scans can be completed in as little as 60 seconds, and niri technology scans a structure of the tooth in real-time without harmful radiation, acting as digital aid for detection of inapproximal caries or cavities above the gingival line.
in apac the element flex is doing well with its wand-only configuration that provides needed mobility so doctors can see patients anywhere they choose, and also will perform full-arch scans in even the smallest office. during the quarter, we announced availability of the itero element plus series, which expands the itero portfolio to serve a broad range of the dental market. the new element plus series offers faster processing time, advanced visualization capabilities for seamless scanning experience in a new sleek ergonomically designed package. it's also engineered with the latest computing power, a dedicated ai chip and new ai-based features as well as an easy upgrade path for future innovation.
in terms of digital scans used for invisalign case submissions in q1 total digital scans increased to 80.9% from 75.8% in q1 last year. international scans increased to 75.1%, up from 68.7% in the same quarter last year. for the americas, 85.5% of the cases submitted digitally compared to 80.5% a year ago. cumulatively, over 35.4 million orthodontic scans and 7.5 million restorative scans have been performed with itero scanners.
turning to exocad, a year ago in april, we welcomed exocad into the align family. i want to thank the entire team for their continued progress on integration and roadmap development. together we are working to extend exocad's position as a key technology provider for the dental cad/cam industry and to drive continuous innovation with the open and integrated approach that is the foundation of exocad. during q1, the new release of exocad's dentalcad3d galway was successfully rolled out globally with very positive customer feedback. a record number of over 70,000 verified prosthetic components were created in dentalcad galway, one of the largest prosthetic libraries in the industry; exocad also reached a new milestone for the exoplan database, which now supports nearly 10,000 implants from over 90 manufacturers. the new release also includes a unique and highly innovative dentalcad feature, instant anatomic morphing that reduces design time by up to 30% compared to previous version. it also includes new ai technology for exocad smile creator, which enables time saving, automatic detection of facial features.
in addition, the new my itero connector was launched directly to exocad labs. the my itero connector creates an easy and integrated way to receive intraoral scan cases from thousands of itero doctors worldwide. new cases are downloaded automatically and will show up directly in the dental db case list; exocad also co-hosted a joint dentistry event in the uk to showcase full workflow chairside titled digital dentistry hands on, a virtual roadshow, and the general dentist showcases a full digital workflow for the clinical environment with chairsidecad, exocad's complete open architecture cad software platform for single-visit dentistry, hosted by dr. gulshan murgai, the participants of the roadshow series learned how to use the software for single-visit restorations and implant planning in the dental practice along the entire digital dentistry workflow, these are just a few milestones and we're excited about the opportunities ahead to shape the dental industry with technology and expertise that benefits all customers, labs, partners and users. we look forward to sharing more about ongoing exocad developments.
with that, i'll now turn it over to john.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, global finance
thanks, joe. now for our q1 financial results.
total revenues for the first quarter were $894.8 million, up 7.2% from the prior quarter and up 62.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. for clear aligners, q1 revenues of $753.3 million were up 7.5% sequentially and up 56.4% year-over-year, reflecting invisalign volume growth in most geographies. clear aligner revenues growth was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $14.4 million, or approximately 2.1 points sequentially and on a year-over-year basis by approximately $22.3 million or approximately 4.6 points.
for q1, invisalign comprehensive and non-comprehensive asps were both up sequentially. on a year-over-year basis. q1 invisalign comprehensive and non-comprehensive asps decreased. overall, on a sequential and year-over-year basis, asps were favorably impacted by foreign exchange. on a year-over-year basis, asps were impacted by higher net revenue deferrals in all regions and higher promotional discounts. clear aligner deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $79 million sequentially and $256 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional liners are shipped. total q1 clear aligner shipments of 595.8000 cases were up 4.9% sequentially and up 65.8% year-over-year.
our systems and services revenues for the first quarter was a record $141.5 million, up 5.8% sequentially due to product mix and increased services revenues from our larger installed base and exocad's cad/cam services. year-over-year systems and services revenues was up 104% due to higher scanner shipments and services and the inclusion of exocad's cad/cam services from the april 2020 acquisition and increased services from our larger installed base. our systems and services deferred revenue was up 17% sequentially and up 102% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period.
moving on to gross margin. first quarter overall gross margin was 75.7% up 2.5 points sequentially and up 4.1 points year-over-year. on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 76.1% for the first quarter and up 2.5 points sequentially and up 4.2 points year-over-year. overall, gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points sequentially and 0.7 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange.
clear aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 77.6%, up 2.7 points sequentially due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, higher asps and lower freight, partially offset by higher additional aligner volume. clear aligner gross margin was up 4.6 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes and lower freight, partially offset by lower asps.
systems and services gross margin for the first quarter was a record 65.4% up 1.2 points sequentially primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes and higher asps, partially offset by increased freight. systems and services gross margin was up 3.6 points year-over-year due to manufacturing efficiencies from increased volume, higher asps and services revenues. q1 operating expenses were $451.7 million, up sequentially 13.7% and up 39.2% year-over-year. this sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased compensation, primarily from additional headcount and incentive compensation, consumer marketing spend and other general and administrative costs. year-over-year operating expenses has increased by $127.2 million, reflecting our continued investment in sales and r&d activities and investments commensurate with business growth.
on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition and acquisition costs related to our exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $424.8 million, up sequentially 14.1% and up 40.9% year-over-year. our first quarter operating income of $225.4 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.2%, down 0.3 point sequentially and up 12.5 points year-over-year. the sequential decrease in operating margin is attributed to operational investments. the year-over-year increase in operating margin are primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage.
on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, the acquisition costs related to our exocad acquisition, operating margin for the first quarter was 28.6%, down 0.4 points sequentially and up 11.5 points year-over-year. our operating margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.8 points sequentially and 1.5 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. interest and other income and expense net for the first quarter was a gain of $36.2 million, primarily driven by the sdc arbitration award gain. excluding the sdc arbitration award gain, interest and other income and expense net was a $7.2 million expense on a non-gaap basis.
with regards to the first quarter tax provision, our gaap tax rate was 23.4%, which includes tax expense of approximately $11 million related to u.s. taxes on the sdc arbitration award received an approximately $14 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. our gaap tax rate this quarter was lower than the prior quarter rate of 25.9% primarily due to the higher excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by foreign income taxes at different rates.
our gaap tax rate was higher than the same quarter last year, which was negative 2,745% primarily due to a one-time tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion dollars associated with our corporate structure reorganization completed during the first quarter of 2020. the first quarter tax rate on a non-gaap basis was 20.2% compared to 14.5% in prior quarter and 33.2% in the prior year. the first quarter non-gaap tax rate was higher than the prior quarter rate, primarily due to lower tax benefits from foreign income tax at different rates. in comparison to prior year, the non-gaap tax rate for the first quarter was lower, primarily due to higher tax benefits from foreign income tax at different rates.
first quarter net income per diluted share was $2.51, up $0.51 sequentially and down $16.70 compared to prior year. on a non-gaap basis, net income per diluted share was $2.49 for the first quarter, down $0.12 sequentially and up $1.76 year-over-year.
moving on to the balance sheet. as of march 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion, an increase of approximately $170.9 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to cash flow from operations. of our $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $684.4 million was held in the u.s. and $447.3 million was held by our international entities. q1 accounts receivable balance was $719 million, up approximately 9.3% sequentially. our overall days sales outstanding was 72 days, up approximately 1 day sequentially and down approximately 15 days as compared to q1 last year.
cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $227.2 million. capital expenditures for the first quarter were $43.4 million primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity in facilities. free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $183.8 million. we also have $300 million available under our revolving line of credit. under our may 2018 repurchase program, we have $100 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock.
now let me turn to our outlook. overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and our continued strong momentum across regions and customer channels. it has been over a year since the pandemic began, and i want to briefly recap the actions we took to support our employees by protecting employee jobs and salaries and by supporting our customers with ppe, extended payment terms, training and many other areas of assistance. instead of going quiet, we accelerated our investments in marketing to drive consumer demand to our doctors' offices and stay top of mind with consumers. we accelerated our digital technology investments so that we could provide virtual tools to our doctors enabling them to stay connected with their patients and keep the treatment moving forward.
we continue to grow the business, increased our investments in r&d and product innovation and developing our plans for manufacturing expansion in emea. we did all these things for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders, because we believe in the industry and the size of the market opportunity. our results are the outcome of our conviction in our business model, focus and ability to execute. while there continues to be uncertainty around the pandemic and global environment, the strength in our business reflects the purposeful decisions we made through the pandemic and fuels our confidence and continue to invest into growth to drive demand and conversion globally.
q2 is off to a great start and momentum has continued through april, consumer demand trends in patient traffic across the dental industry are favorable and continue to improve. given these factors and the positive trends we continue to see across the business, we believe it is important to share our current outlook and provide guidance for the full year. note that the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to any supply constraints.
with that, let's turn to our full-year 2021 outlook and the factors that inform our view. we have growing confidence in our digital platform and how it is driving growth across all region and market segments. we expect 2021 revenues of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion dollars, up 50% to 58% year-over-year. consistent with past years, we expect second half revenues to make up more than half of the full-year revenue and our second half revenue to grow year-over-year around the mid point of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%.
as discussed during our last earnings call, we are increasing our investments in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to continue to drive our growth programs and accelerate adoption and invest in the under-penetrated market. on a gaap basis, we anticipate 2021 operating margin to be between 23.5% and 24.5%. on a non-gaap basis, we expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our gaap operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization.
in addition, during q2 '21, we expect to repurchase $100 million of our common stock through either open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement we intend to enter into on or prior to may 3, 2021. the repurchase is intended to complete the $600 million stock repurchase authorization announced on may 23, 2018.
for 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. capital expenditures primarily relate to building, construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. this includes our planned investment in a new manufacturing facility in wroclaw, poland, our first one in the emea region. we intend to fund these needs with cash generated from operations.
with that i will turn it back over to joe for final comments. joe?
joseph m. hogan -- director, president, chief executive officer
thanks, john. in summary, we're very pleased with the first quarter results of 2021. our strong growth and continued momentum reflect our strategic initiatives and investments, including support for doctors to ensure treatment and business continuity, ramping availability of virtual tools to keep doctors and patients connected throughout treatment and increased consumer marketing and concierge programs.
the benefits of digital treatment and digital tools and the limitations of outdated old analog approaches, continue to drive adoption of invisalign clear aligners and itero scanners and services. over the past year, where doctors have experienced aligns digital platform, which made it possible for thousands of invisalign practices and patients to continue treatment through our global disruption. thanks to invisalign aligners, digital treatment planning, virtual monitoring and care as well as itero scanners.
but the shift from traditional analog wires and brackets to a fully end-to-end digital platform is not easy. it cannot be done without very complex technology, and this technology is prevalent touching every aspect of what we do from manufacturing excellence where we currently manufacture over 700,000 unique aligners per day to expanding our geographic footprint to over 100 markets, to building a network of over 200,000 trained invisalign doctors and providing the technology to our doctors in a complete digital system, the align digital platform.
as a market leader and the clear aligner space, we've been building this industry over 24 years to get to where it is today, and yet the majority of the market opportunity remains largely untapped. with over 500 million potential case starts globally align is in a rare position to address this market with the align digital platform. powered by two decades of clinical data, based on more than 10.2 million patients with ai machine learning and digital tools to help our doctors efficiently communicate with their patients, show and explain any issues and visualize this potential treatment outcomes and together with doctors, we're going to leverage the power of digital dentistry and orthodontics more than ever.
we remain focused on our strategic execution, agility, customer service excellence and continuing to make investments to grow our business to drive utilization of the invisalign system, all the more returning value to our shareholders. this is a multi-variable equation that we talk about and there is no other company in the market today that has all these capabilities combined.
finally, throughout the pandemic, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and their families and our doctor, customers and their staff and that has not changed, we remain dedicated to their well-being. and i want to reiterate, our commitment to all invisalign practices and our employees around the world, especially those in areas recently affected by a surge in covid-19, india, brazil, france, poland, ukraine, mexico, thailand and japan. we continue to monitor the situation and are providing support and resources to those impacted employees.
thanks for your time today. i look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds. now i'll turn the call back over to the operator.

thank you. at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from nathan rich with goldman sachs. please state your question.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for the questions. joe, i wanted to start with the increased guidance and the expectations around the back half of the year being at the high end of the long-term range. i guess several of the factors that you highlighted on the call, the growth in new customers, the strong itero placements, those have all historically been good leading indicators of growth in invisalign. it also sounds like you're seeing better uptake from the dso channels. that's obviously an opportunity that you guys have been going after for a long time. but i guess at this point, does that change how you're thinking about what the right target is for top line growth kind of next year, within the long-term range that you have?
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
hi, nathan. look, i think you said it really well what we're seeing right now, what we're experiencing overall, and we are calling strong growth for the second half of this year. but, look, our revenue guidance for the long term for the business is 20% to 30%. and we continue to work within those boundaries. so we're not prepared to change that at the moment. john, any thoughts on --?
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
no, that's exactly -- we feel good about what we're seeing in the marketplace and our guide reflects that.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i appreciate that. and then, john, maybe a follow up for you. can you maybe go into a little bit more detail around your comments on the more pronounced summer seasonality, just how that impacts your expectations for the sequential growth we're likely to see in 3q and 4q of this year, maybe versus what you would expect in a normal year?
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
well, as we know, there's a summer period where people take vacations, holidays and so on in emea and other places, and we expect and i think what we see in our own lives is you take longer weekends or maybe more pronounced vacations, people doing things in advance of shutdowns or lockdowns that might happen. and i think we're just being reflective of that. but really looking at all the variables that we normally see and talking to what we expect for the second half, which is to the upper side of our midpoint on a year-over-year basis.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thanks for the questions.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, nathan.

our next question comes from jon block with stifel. please go ahead.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
hi, jon.
jonathan block -- stifel -- analyst
hi, joe. good afternoon, guys. i think, joe, i'll start with you with the first one. i think it was 5.3 north american gpu utilization number was huge and i think we all waited for a while to get that to get to 4. now it's toward the 5. just talk to us on what that is? i'm assuming what? it's more scanners. is it also just increased utilization with even those that have had the scanner for some time? would love some color and maybe just more importantly, is that 5 handle on the north american gpu utilization, do you view that as sustainable going forward? and then i've got a follow up.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
jon, i consider everything we do has more than a single variable to it and that's the platform that we work with that you know as well as anybody. but i'd say yes. scanners serve that very well. our increased advertising helps to drive that too. it brings more patients to the gps. and thirdly, new product like [indecipherable] and different derivatives of that product line that are very efficient for gps to use. and it gives them a huge amount of confidence in our product line when they use it, jon. so it's a combination of our brand, it's a combination of our digital platform with itero. it's a combination of product piece. and then we don't talk about it a lot, but we split our sales force years ago. and we have a specific focused sales force on gps. and gps speak a different language, jon. it's different than orthodontists altogether, and that team has been incredibly effective being able to work with doctors, how they can integrate invisalign into the workflow. and from a restorative standpoint, how you use this proactively. so i'm confident that's a great market for us. we know that 500 million patients we talk about globally sits broadly in that segment, but you need a different kind of a product approach, a different sales approach, and a strong platform geared to those guys to keep that going. and we feel good about that.
jonathan block -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and actually you brought up an interesting point. i think the sales force is i believe bifurcating international more recently in north america. so i guess we're starting to see that come through. second question, john, just let me try to be as detailed as possible. so you've got solid 2q '21 sales upside that you just reported. then you raised the back part of the year from roughly 25% year-over-year revenue midpoint growth to closer to 27%. yet you call out some more pronounced summer seasonality, and those seem at odds with one another. so can you just reconcile those two data points? in other words, you're alluding to more seasonality, yet you just took up the forecast in the back part of the year even in the face of that. so any color would be great.
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
i think it really reflects just the timing between quarters and not kind of as you said looking at the second half in a way, not knowing how vacations and holidays and lockdowns potential might play out but by looking at it in totality and kind of looking at from a second half standpoint.
jonathan block -- stifel -- analyst
thanks, guys.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, jon.

our next question comes from jason bednar with piper sandler. please state your question.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi, everyone. good afternoon. congrats on the strong quarter here. joe, i want to follow up on nathan's question there going back to the first one. maybe if you can unpack a bit further what you're seeing here as we look ahead in the next couple quarters, especially now that we've lapped the easiest of your comps, your guide here with suggest momentum strong across the business. but the key question i keep getting from investors is really how that adult consumer in the second half of the year and then into '22, how they're going to respond? so the question i guess for you is just how you're seeing the adult consumer respond in your various geographies as economies have opened back up and as we start staring down some tougher paths on the adult side? then i've got a follow up.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
well, i think, jason, in what we see with adults, and we see this really all over the globe, is we obviously had a big uptake from an adult standpoint, but you can see our team numbers up pretty substantially too at the same time. so there's a good balance. the previous question that jon asked too with gps, it comes into broadly an adult segment and that segment also. and my explanation in the sense of why we've been effective in that segment, we think we can continue to be helps to contribute to that. now when we talk about third quarter and seasonality that jon's talking about whatever, a lot of that is around adult patients and vacations and different things too and it affects different parts of the organization, and how we go to market. but in general, we just feel good about the direction of the business, the signal and words that we're getting from our doctors and what they're explaining they're seeing out there. and that's all incorporated into what we've been forecasting for you. and the one thing to never forget about too, jason, is the size of this marketplace. we talk about 500 million patients and i know you hear from a lot of other companies in different industries about oversize, sims and whatever. this is true. if anything should have shown, like i mentioned in my closing comments, that this market is as big as we talk about being is what you've seen from this business over the last year in the adult segment of that part too, which is a big part of that 500 million patients that we talk about.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's helpful, joe. and then just looking at least relative to our model in the quarter, it looks like -- most of the outperformance or disproportion amount came from the americas. i'm sure that's u.s., but also maybe brazil. and you made some pretty strong comments in the past on what brazil could do for your business in a pretty short window of time. so just wondering if you could update us here on where you're at with expansion in brazil, maybe how much that market in particular is contributing to sequential case growth?
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
yes, no statistics for it. brazil continues to be strong. i think you know it's a big aesthetic market, one of the biggest aesthetic markets in the world. it parallels iberia in a lot of ways as we -- how we have to go in there and move. we're primarily in the orthodontic segment there and not in the gp segment right now on how we have done it. it's a different market that way because ortho play in a much more broader sense in that country than we do here. but we have a very experienced team there. we funded it well. i feel good about our position from a product standpoint and itero scanners. and it's a big market for us. and don't just think about brazil too. latin america in general, it's been a big expanding market for us. so brazil leads because of the size, population and essentially talked about. but overall, our latam market is extremely strong and we're well positioned there. john, any thoughts on that?
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
i think you covered it.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. thanks, guys.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
all right, jason. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from erin wright with credit suisse. please go ahead.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. sticking with that international topic, can you speak to the growth in the quarter in asia pac and what you're seeing across that market? are you still seeing some covid related lingering headwinds there? and can you speak to some of the competitive landscape dynamics as well? and then also your efforts in terms of expanding the consumer advertising effort across that geography as well? thanks.
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
hi, erin. this is john. i can address the start of that. look, apac is an important region for us, a huge market opportunity. we've invested, as we've talked about, with manufacturing and treatment planning and other places. we recently have added some additional advertising in apac, and we see great results where there's a lot of interest, a lot of awareness that it drives, people come to our website and look for doctors and so on. and we think that translates very well. we're very happy with the quarter for q2. you do have pockets of areas where there's covid, more of a covid impact; southeast asia, parts of china, other areas that we're always mindful of. but when we look at the investments we're making, the return that we're getting from those investments, we feel really good about apac.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. and then how should we be thinking about the quarterly progression of the gross margin from here and the run rate going forward? is there anything to call out in terms of mix or asps? are some of those seasonal dynamics you were talking about that we should be thinking about as we think about the third and the fourth quarter gross margin trends? thanks.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
nothing of major note, erin. we've seen that -- as we drive utilization, have more coming through our factories, it's very productive for us. we're very mindful of the trade-offs that affect our margin, and you're seeing that come through. so as we look at some of the investments that we're making and how we're going to market products that we have, how we view things, there's nothing that should be too different than what we've seen from a gross margin standpoint.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, erin.

our next question comes from jeff johnson with robert w. baird & co. please go ahead.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
hi, jeff.
jeffrey johnson -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
good afternoon. hi, joe. how are you? a couple of questions here i guess. one, on the seasonality, again, i hate to keep harping on that. but typically by this point, late july, you guys now know july numbers, you probably know pretty much what's lined up for august given cases that are in treatment planning phase right now. so are the seasonality comments driven by something you're seeing so far in the numbers? is it something that you're just expecting could come in late in the quarter? is it focused on the adult side, just kind of any more color there would be helpful as well?
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
jeff, it's based on our experience with the season. i think you know. you've been following our business long enough. third quarter is a real transition quarter from a vacation standpoint, teams coming in here. european vacations, which are really big. and our comments are just reflecting what we're hearing from our customer base, our doctor base not just in the united states, but all over the world. and we're just trying to share that with you. but at the same time, the guide that we've taken up, you have to remember we're at the upper end of our growth model for the second half. and when you think about it, we have two real strong quarters last year, jeff, third and fourth quarters. so it's just a lot of confidence in what we see and what we feel.
jeffrey johnson -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
yes, understood. and then on asps, john, maybe for you. it sounds like some of the rebaiting or some of the promotional activity, i guess i should say, maybe has stepped down just a little bit. obviously, you're running some bigger trading programs in that late last year and the early part of this year. is that an opportunity then for asps to float a little bit higher into the back half of next year, or do other promotions pop up and just think about asps kind of straight lining from here? thanks.
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
yes, i would say the latter. look, there's always promotions that we're running to drive that right utilization, and you try to find that right mix. and what we talk about and i think everybody gets is, it has to translate to gross margin, and we feel good about the gross margin that it's ultimately driving and our op margins that it brings to our bottom line. so there will be some trade-offs, but i don't expect too much of a change in asp. and the way we've looked at it, and just because some grow faster than others, look at it from a comprehensive standpoint versus a non-comprehensive standpoint to be relatively stable.
jeffrey johnson -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
yes, understood. thanks, guys.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, jeff.
operator
our next question comes from john kreger with william blair. please go ahead.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
hi, john.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks so much. maybe just one more follow up. i would assume the seasonality comment is mainly sort of one about adults. but curious if you've got any thoughts on how the teen season might differ this year? is it shaping up to be sort of a normal year as we assume schools are open again, or maybe more spread evenly across the second half?
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
i think you look at it, john, just from the standpoint that there are unknowns around covid and vacations and other things. covid is one of them. some places we hear some of the countries and regions, school is going to open up earlier; some are saying that it's later. so we're just trying to be mindful that there's going to be changes that happen to this and try to give as much information about that as possible.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
great. thanks, john. and then maybe one follow up on asp. it seemed like the year-over-year trend was different in comprehensive versus non-comprehensive. can you just explain that again? why would the comprehensive change have been greater than a non-comprehensive? and when you think about that metric longer term, do you assume the trajectory is similar across those two buckets or not?
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
yes, the biggest change from last year to this year is really around the additional treatment that doctors were provided. so remember, last year, they didn't have as many new patients coming in, but they were still keeping existing patients along in treatment. it doesn't count as a new case. it really just counts as additional revenue. and therefore asps are higher as a result of that. conversely, as now they've focused more on primary cases and new patients coming in, we see that shift -- we saw that shift. it really started in the third quarter of last year. it's kind of progressed relatively steady from third quarter on. and that's kind of how we think of it. there's not a -- it's not a promotional change or there's nothing of that nature. it's just really more just on how we're recognizing revenue between a primary shipment and then an additional treatment that a doctor provides.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
okay, makes sense. thank you.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, john.
operator
our next question comes from elizabeth anderson with evercore. please go ahead.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks so much for the question. so my question is in terms of the second quarter, could you talk about how you saw volumes progressing maybe in the u.s. across the three months?
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
i think when we look at -- hi, elizabeth. it's john. we saw strength across our business. we're not going to get into kind of month-by-month, but i think what we saw and you saw in the print for second quarter, very strong across geographies, products and so on. and what we're seeing is a reflection of that with our guidance.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, that makes sense. and then turning to the cash flow, i appreciate the capex increase this year is largely a function of the new facility in poland. is that something that should continue on at that kind of pace going forward, or do you see kind of all of that wrapped up in this year's expense? and then we should go back to sort of more normalized levels afterwards.
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
yes, i think what you'll see with kind of the convergence of what we have now, we have a lot of capacity that we're adding to meet the demand in the markets that we have. and we have that unique event with poland kind of going on from a land, purchase, building and equipment that goes in. so this year will be a little bit heavy from that standpoint. and then going forward, it should just be more of the expansion and growth that way, but not as much as this year with the building as well.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
elizabeth, this is joe. and thinking about -- we're talking about 200% growth rates, right. and we're talking about growth rates on the upper end of what our revenue models have been given to you guys. so it requires actually that kind of investment. and it's a good question. but like john said, we'll hit it hard this year, build some more capacity and this will lay in over time.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
yes, that certainly makes sense, especially as you have to build it ahead of the growth. thank you.

our next question comes from liza garcia with wolfe research. please go ahead.
liza garcia -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi, guys. can you hear me all right?
shirley stacy -- vice president of corporate communications & investor relations
yes, we hear you fine.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
yes. hi, liza.
liza garcia -- wolfe research -- analyst
so i guess just digging into kind of how you're thinking about the exocad expansion with the [indecipherable] kind of how you see the opportunity building there. you've mentioned a couple of things. and also should we view this kind of as like a first move for exocad and going forward strategy into more cad/cam?
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
yes, liza, that's a good question. when you think about -- we talk about the gp segment, we talk about ortho-restorative and i think most people, if you study this, you know the exocad is one of the few companies out there that actually offers a digital type of restorative platform for dentists all around the world. our vision for our business, as we become a big part of restorative and saving enamel and moving teeth, before you actually do implants, you need to do different things. and that's what -- like that's we think is the revolution of orthodontics, because that wasn't a tool that was really used before. and so exocad and itero plug in really well behind that. never forget that our strategy is always about selling more invisalign. that's what exocad is about. that's what itero is about too. but they also have to have credibility as units in those segments. and that's when we talk about what we're doing with exocad and itero, we're expanding our technology but always with a thought of how we can be more effective in ortho-restorative. john actually runs the business. i'll let him talk about it.
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
no, i think you summarized it well. this is a -- it's been just over a year. we're very pleased with how the business stands, as it stands alone, and then the technical and commercial integration that's been going on. and we see more and more synergies and feel good about the digital platform that this helps us move forward. so more to come on this. but after a year, we're very pleased.
liza garcia -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. awesome. and then i was just wondering if you're hearing any indications from your customers about staffing as a potential issue, that's kind of limiting their availability anywhere? it doesn't -- obviously, the report doesn't certainly seem that way. but channel checks have kind of indicated some more limited staffing.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
yes. liza, it's joe again. i wouldn't call it a hindrance right now. they have to pay more to find these people. there is concern out there in the sense of how much people have to pay to bring them in. but we haven't had that as an excuse of doctor saying, i can't do more cases because i can't find staff. it's just harder to spend more time doing.
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
the one thing that you do hear and it's just the reality when we talk about some of that seasonality, people take vacations or doctors on vacation as well as staff and patients. so they might fall into that bucket as well to limit some of that staff at their offices.
liza garcia -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
operator
our next question comes from richard newitter with svb leerink. please go ahead.
jamie morgan -- svb leerink -- analyst
hi, guys. it's jamie on for rich. a quick question for me on teens. obviously, our checks, specifically within the ortho channel have been very bullish over the last couple of months. and now with it representing greater than a third of total case shifts, is it fair to say now that teen adoption is finally hitting that inflection point in the u.s.? and if not, kind of what are some of the things that you think still need to happen to really start to take on this sort of viewpoint?
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
it's joe. look, this is not a tipping point as you referred to it. it's been a ground war actually. and that ground war is basically started with product liability. and obviously, with invisalign first and mandibular advancement and some of our other innovations that we've had, we've really opened up that segment and made it available to us too. now the work is primarily with orthodontists to make them confident that they can service these teens, not just clinically but from a business standpoint also. that's why our programs like adapt and different things we put into place. and remember the war here is not against other clear aligner companies, it's about braces and fixed appliances. and that's what we really have to break through and get done. and honestly, orthodontists just have to be comfortable, not clinically but also from a business standpoint. and i feel like we're making progress in educating teens and educating mom, but on the other end, educating orthodontists to how they can properly do this clinically and also be efficient in their practices in doing it, and that's the ground war part. i feel we're well positioned. and obviously our numbers say we're making progress, but we're not declaring victory here at all.
jamie morgan -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. and then just one follow up back to kind of some of the more pronounced summer seasonality. if i look back kind of through 2017 through 2019, it seems like you guys have seen anywhere from flat to maybe mid-single digit sequential improvement. consensus is currently standing at something that would imply a decline. so is there any reason to be thinking that it shouldn't at least fall within the bounds of zero, a flat, mid-single digit improvement versus what consensus is currently implying, which would be a decline, just trying to get better calibration there.
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
yes, jamie, this is john. look, we're trying to give you color to the second half because it's implied in our total year, and you can kind of defer or kind of infer what that means from third quarter and fourth quarter, but just trying to give you as much color without giving quarterly guidance is all that has been.
jamie morgan -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay. thanks.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer

our next question comes from michael ryskin with bank of america. please go ahead.
michael ryskin -- - bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, guys. how are you doing? congrats on the quarter of the guide raise. i want to ask first on the -- i guess for john on the operating margin, especially on the non-gaap side, had another really good quarter there. you bumped the guide a little bit, but you're still sort of -- your outlook for the second half still implies a pretty decent step down in operating margin. so i'm just wondering what's going on there? is there any incremental spend that you're budgeting? and just in general, sort of expand on that? can you talk a little bit about consumer marketing spend? how are those costs trending? how's the return on that going?
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
yes, good question. look, we're very pleased with our margins that we've seen through the first half, as you noted, very strong performance, a good reflection of a lot of the investments that we made, and we continue to make to help grow our business. and we look at the second half as continuing these investments to expand from a sales and marketing standpoint. there's some operating costs that we have to be able to grow our business, like we have. it reflects those investments and we're trying to continue to position ourselves so that we would continue momentum and be able to start next year with that momentum. so it's really more of a reflection of that. and obviously, as we go through the second half, we'll update on what that means for margin.
michael ryskin -- - bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then on the gross margin line, again, just on the -- you got the manufacturing facility in china. you're talking about the plant in poland up in 2022. could you give us an update or reminder of sort of how we should think about progression there in terms of shifting some of the manufacturing there, and how they should work its way through the gross margin lines? and when do to those plants reach more or less full capacity and sort of you work through the ramp up there?
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
yes, you're right. when we go live, there is -- until you get that capacity up, and we're really -- we know how to do that manufacturing, we've learned as we've gone through some of the china facility ramp up, that will get applied to how we ramp up in poland. we'll move doctors over kind of country by country and ramp things up. that will happen in the first half next year. but very mindful of what it means from a margin standpoint and do everything we can to minimize that inefficiency that you have when you first start up, and be able to get those facilities up and running at near 100% capacity.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
yes. and one of the things that john knows better than me on this one, michael, is when we ramped up china, remember we started with a rental temporary facility that was not even close to scale, and it just pounded our cost. but we just wanted to get in place, get the workflow done. we built a building next to the where that area was, then transitioned into it. so that was a pretty big bump that we took there. we're not anticipating, john, the same.
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
right. and that would happen, michael, when we kind of quietly went live in q2 of last year with that new greenfield facility. and it's all about running that factory with a high utilization. they have an efficient labor and productivity there that we know how to drive. but there is some ramp up period, but we'll look to that in kind of the first half, and then see improvement as we go into the second half.

our next question comes from ravi misra with berenberg capital markets. please go ahead.
ravi misra -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hi, team. how are you doing? can you hear me?
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
hi, ravi.
shirley stacy -- vice president of corporate communications & investor relations
hi, ravi.
ravi misra -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hi. so i guess i have two questions. one is more on the r&d side and one on china. so just on the r&d, one of your competitors announced a new polymer. and i think one of the things that's actually turned up in our checks with orthos at least is that smarttrack gives you an edge. just curious on your view and whether that's kind of starting to have any sort of impact, or is it too early? and then how you plan to maybe position yourself to kind of keep ahead of the peers? and then secondly, just around china, i guess it's another kind of competition question with i guess your largest facility, a relatively small competitor going public? how are you kind of viewing that market now with kind of another i guess well-funded competitor out there in terms of the ability to grow the market or kind of go after potential segment of that market, whether it's the more luxury focus patient or how are you kind of segmenting the population there? thanks.
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
on your first question on a new polymer, we do multi-layer material. so it's various polymers that you put together and we were balancing the equation between elasticity and overall rigidity or retention strength. and it's like our other competitors are starting to figure that piece out and see pieces of it. we have strong patents around smarttrack and obviously improving over time is a real important part about not just having the right materials, but having the right kind of system in place. and that's the treatment planning part that we talked about, 25 years of understanding how to really activate those aligners and make that plastic actually work through those algorithms. and we don't use a displacement methodology, which is basically built on aligner that kind of leads things. it actually engages with these things in a different way. so i expect more companies to come out and work different polymers or whatever. we have a huge amount of experience of that, but don't forget about the entire system, the algorithms, how it works together and how it works the attachments, the exactness of the attachments, where you put those attachments, how they're shaped, so a lot going on there. we feel good about our position, and we'll continue to innovate in that space across all those spectrums. but there's nothing in the competitive marketplace that we are concerned with that would change the trajectory of where we're investing right now. from a china competitive standpoint, obviously angel align ipo, we watched that closely and get some clarity to everybody in that marketplace as they ipo'ed and what's going on. and i think you see they're strong in tier 3 cities, they're strong with public hospitals in different areas. but look, i feel good about our position in china. our manufacturing is strong. our training centers there are strong. our treatment planning is strong. it's close to accounts. we had good growth in the quarter overall, good sequential growth, good year-on-year growth. you might want to [indecipherable]. john?
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
yes, just to add in china, we've been competing in china with various companies since we've been there. so it is nothing new really with the ipo. it's really more of a reflection of this under penetrated market in china. china is a huge opportunity for the clear aligner business. and so we feel very good about our positioning there. primarily cases are done with wires and brackets. and so this is less about share shifting among clear aligner and more about growth in the category.
ravi misra -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
thanks.
shirley stacy -- vice president of corporate communications & investor relations
thanks, ravi. well, listen, thank you everyone for joining us today. we really appreciate your time. look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings, including the international dental show in cologne, germany, september 22 through 25, where we'll be showcasing align, exocad innovations and a hybrid and multimedia exhibition space through physical and virtual experiences. we'll also be hosting an investor meeting in conjunction with our gp summit in october in las vegas in nevada. we'll have that october 29 and 30. so look for more information. and if you have any additional questions, please follow up with our investor relations department. thanks and have a great day.

joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, shirley. good afternoon and thanks for joining us. on our call today, i'll provide some highlights from the second quarter, then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, systems and services and clear aligners. john will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook. following that, i'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.
i'm pleased to report our first $1 billion revenue quarter with record volumes reflecting continued momentum from both clear aligners and systems and services. for q2, systems and services revenues reflect strong growth across all regions and the strategic value of the itero business with continued adoption of the itero element 5d plus series of next-generation scanners and imaging systems which launched in february.
increasingly, doctors are seeing the strategic impact and value of itero scanners in their practices. in addition to its role in invisalign case submissions, it is a true workhorse and digital enabler in every type of practice and across every type of orthodontic and restorative workflow.
q2 sequential clear aligner volumes were primarily driven by strength in both adult and teen market segments and across customer channels and regions, especially from the americas and emea regions, reflecting the expanding opportunity for invisalign treatment among adults globally, as well as the underlying orthodontic market as we continue to build awareness of the invisalign brand and drive utilization among teens and younger patients.
for q2 '21, invisalign clear aligner volumes for teens were up 9.5% sequentially and 156% year-over-year to 181,000 teens, representing one-third of total cases shipped, with strong growth from north america and emea orthodontists. during the quarter, we hosted several team-focused, peer-to-peer events designed to build clinical competence in teen treatment and highlight the teen digital treatment journey with invisalign treatment.
the recent apac virtual symposium featured leading providers focusing on clinical excellence with teen treatment, and north america hosted the invisalign teen forum; virtual edition for invisalign doctors bringing together clinical speakers, digital industry experts and teen patient panelists to share their insights.
in may, align focused on the align digital platform at the 2021 aao annual session, featuring a dynamic virtual line-up of invisalign doctors describing how they have grown their practices through adoption of digital technology.
our q2 results also reflect the positive impact of our investments in consumer marketing, generating billions of impressions and 33% year-over-year increase in leads for invisalign doctors. during the quarter, we launched the next phase of our mom/teen multi-touch campaign, as well as the new ""invis is a powerful thing"" campaign designed to engage teens and young adults.
we also deepened our partnership with influencers like charli d'amelio with the first limited-edition aligner case as part of our new e-commerce initiative featuring custom cases, cleaning and oral care products, as well as accessories like invisalign stickables, all of which are available on invisalign.com.
these and other consumer initiatives are important in supporting doctors' practices especially through the busy summer teen season and beyond. they also build on our investments in digital technology and innovation that are the foundation of the align digital platform, including integrated digital workflows and virtual tools designed to improve clinical confidence, treatment efficiency, and patient outcomes.
a year ago, we released invisalign virtual appointment and invisalign virtual care tools within our my invisalign app, in response to the global pandemic to enable invisalign doctors to provide continuity of care for their patients. today, invisalign virtual care is available globally in 60 markets and the my invisalign app has been downloaded 1 million times with invisalign patients worldwide.
it was recently recognized as the ""best virtual care platform"" by the medtech breakthrough awards program and as ""digital innovation of the year"" by healthcare asia medtech awards. as part of invisalign virtual care, patients use my invisalign app to stay engaged with their treatment and convey progress photos to their doctor, fostering two-way communication with their doctor throughout their invisalign treatment journey.
now let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results, starting with the americas. for the americas region, q2 was another strong quarter with invisalign case volumes up 11% sequentially and 261% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region especially in the united states and canada, from both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, and increased invisalign utilization from orthodontic and gp channels. dso utilization continues to be a strong growth driver as well, led by heartland and smile docs.
for our international business, q2 invisalign case volume was up sequentially 12.7% on a year-over-year basis. international shipments were up 149%. for emea, q2 volumes were up sequentially 17% and 265% year-over-year with broad-based growth across all markets, led by iberia, uk, and italy along with continued growth in our expansion markets.
in q2, growth from both channels was strong, with orthodontic channel growth reflecting increased invisalign utilization, and gp channel growth driven by increased invisalign submitters. for q2, emea growth also reflects adoption of the invisalign first product, designed to treat a broad range of teeth straightening issues in growing children, from simple to complex, including crowding, spacing, and narrow dental arches.
aiding in treatment engagement for those younger patients, invisalign stickables are innovative accessories designed exclusively for use with the patented smarttrack material in invisalign clear systems. available in an array of designs, colors, shapes, and themes, invisalign stickables are a fun way for patients to show their personal style during invisalign treatment. during the quarter, we also hosted a successful virtual edition of gp growth summit attended by over 1,200 doctors from the emea region.
for apac, q2 volumes were up sequentially 4.8% and 50% on a year year-over-year basis, reflecting growth across the region, led by japan, china and anz, despite new and extended covid restrictions in several apac markets. apac performance reflects strength in gp channel with increased invisalign submitters, especially in japan which continues to deliver strong growth.
during the quarter, we hosted our china forum, attended by over 1,500 doctors from private clinics, our apac virtual symposium, attended by 1,400 doctors as well as the china public hospital forum in june.
our consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the invisalign system and driving that demand to invisalign doctors' offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. we have provided many of our key metrics that show increased activity and engagement with the invisalign brand in our q2 quarterly presentation slides available on aligntech.com.
in q2, we launched the next generation of ""invis is"" multi-touch campaign driving reach and awareness with adult, mom and teen consumers yielding more than 200% growth in visitors globally to our websites and more than 82% increase in searches for an invisalign trained doctor.
leading with the invis is not your parents braces campaign, we connected with teens, utilizing digital media such as youtube, twitch, and social media. we also continued with our invisalign changemakers program that celebrated and recognized teens driving change in their communities which was covered by multiple media outlets such as elite daily, refinery29, yahoo! unwind, hollywood life, sheknows, j-14, yahoo finance, parents.com, glamour and newbeauty and generated more than 600 million impressions.
in the emea region, our new marketing campaign to drive engagement, ""invis is a powerful thing,"" went live in the uk, germany, and france during the quarter resulting in more than 170% year-over-year increase in unique visitors and 136% year-over-year increase in doctor locater searches. we will continue to roll out the campaign to additional markets in the region during the third quarter.
we continued to expand our consumer advertising in the apac region in australia, japan, and china and saw more than an 800% increase in consumer engagement and a 55% year-over-year increase in leads.
lastly, we continue to build strong relationships with global search and social media giants like google, snapchat, and tiktok in order to further leverage our best-in-class consumer demand programs more effective globally. these partners recognize the power of the invisalign brand and are helping us amplify and gain efficiencies from our investments.
for our systems and services business, q2 revenues were up 20% sequentially and up 214% year-over-year reflecting strong scanner shipments and services. this represents the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth.
the itero element 5d plus imaging system continues to gain traction across all regions with strong adoption with new customers in the apac and emea regions and with existing customers in the americas region.
in apac, the itero element 2 intraoral scanner did well during the quarter, helping to transform digital workflows and chairside consults for doctors. during the quarter, we announced a new itero workflow 2.0 software and previewed auto-upload functionality in the itero element 5d imaging system.
the itero workflow 2.0 software advanced features, including faster scanning, improved visualization, and enhanced patient communication tools, were rolled out regionally in all markets where the itero element plus imaging systems were sold.
the itero element 5d imaging system auto-upload feature will eliminate steps and streamline invisalign case submissions with intraoral color scan images that can be used in place of traditional intraoral photos. the auto-upload functionality is scheduled for release during the third quarter of 2021.
there is great symmetry between systems and services business with clear aligner business reflected in the positive correlation between the deployment of scanners and the increased utilization of invisalign clear aligners.
in terms of digital scans used for invisalign case submissions, total digital scans in q2 increased to 82.2% from 78.5% in q2 last year. international scans increased to 76.2%, up from 72% in the same quarter last year. for the americas, 86.6% of cases were submitted digitally compared to 86% a year ago.
cumulatively, over 40.1 million orthodontic scans and 8.4 million restorative scans have been performed with itero scanners. i'm also pleased to share that align received regulatory approval for the itero 5d plus series in japan on july 1, with a formal launch event planned for august.
turning to exocad. during the quarter, exocad launched the creator center, the new exocad one-stop-shop for online and in-person educational events with a database consisting of 35 educational webinars showcasing the highlights and add-on features of exocad's software solutions, dentalcad galway 3.0 and exoplan 3.0 galway. more than 2,500 users and distributors have been trained on the new software releases worldwide.
exocad also expanded their market coverage with a new global oem partner, ivoclar vivadent, or we call iv, one of the largest manufacturers in the dental industry. this strategic collaboration will give exocad access to thousands of new iv users worldwide and will also provide exocad users with access to production processes with removable prosthetics in the future.
earlier this month, exocad has released partialcad3.0 galway, its module for removable partial denture frameworks, which has new and advanced features for the design of high quality partial dentures. this new release enhances digital cad/cam possibilities for exocad users and dental technicians by providing simpler design solutions for complex cases. partialcad3.0 galway provides both experts and new users with smooth, improved integration with dentalcad, exocad's leading software for dental laboratories.
bringing the itero and exocad businesses together makes us more viable within the gp segment and more relevant in day-to-day comprehensive dentistry for our customers. the combination of invisalign clear aligners and itero scanners have long provided a seamless workflow for orthodontic treatment.
the integration of exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry and implantology, guided surgery and smile design takes the align technology portfolio beyond our established footprint in orthodontics to ortho-restorative and restorative treatment, and paves the way for new, cross-disciplinary workflows that span from visualization and treatment planning to lab production to chairside. exocad also broadens align's platform reach in digital dentistry with over 200 partners and more than 40,000 licenses installed worldwide.
with that, i'll now turn the call over to john.
john morici -- chief financial officer & senior vice president of global finance
thanks, joe. let me begin by reminding everyone that for align and many companies, q2 2020 was significantly impacted by covid-19 business disruptions, and comparisons of our results for q2 2021 should be considered accordingly. now for our q2 financial results.
total revenues for the second quarter were $1 billion, up 13% from the prior quarter and up 186.9% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. for clear aligners, q2 revenues of $841 million were up 11.6% sequentially and up 181.9% year-over-year reflecting invisalign volume growth in most geographies.
in q2, we shipped a record 665.6 thousand invisalign cases, an increase of 11.7% sequentially and 200% year-over-year. in addition, we shipped a record 83.5 thousand invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 7.2 thousand were first-time customers.
q2 clear aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the invisalign portfolio for both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products. q2 comprehensive volume increased 11.4% sequentially and 181.9% year-over-year. and q2 non-comprehensive volume increased 12.3% sequentially driven by strength in invisalign moderate and invisalign go and up 251.7% year-over-year.
q2 adult patients increased 12.6% sequentially and 220.4% year-over-year. in q2, teens or younger patients increased 9.5% sequentially and 156.3% year-over-year. clear aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.4 million or approximately 0.5 points sequentially. on a year-over-year basis, clear aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $36.7 million or approximately 12.3 points.
for q2, invisalign comprehensive asps decreased sequentially and year-over-year. on a sequential basis, invisalign comprehensive asps reflect higher discounts, credits, and foreign exchange, partially offset by regional mix. on a year-over-year basis, comprehensive asps reflect the increase in net revenue deferrals for new invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments partially offset by foreign exchange.
recall q2 2020 asps increased as a result of more additional aligner shipments as doctors were focused on maintaining treatment progress for existing invisalign patients. this trend reversed itself after practices reopened in q3 and demand for new cases ramped up significantly.
q2 invisalign non-comprehensive asps increased sequentially and were flat year-over-year. on a sequential basis, invisalign non-comprehensive asps reflect lower discounts partially offset by foreign exchange.
on a year-over-year basis, invisalign non-comprehensive asps were favorably impacted by foreign exchange offset by higher mix of new invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments. clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $101 million sequentially and $337 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.
our system and services revenues for the second quarter were a record $169.8 million, up 20% sequentially and up 214.7% year-over-year. the increase sequentially and year-over-year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, higher asp and increased services revenues from our larger installed base.
our systems and services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up 22% sequentially and up 135% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period.
moving on to gross margin. second quarter gross margin was 75%, down 0.6 points sequentially and up 11.4 points year-over-year. on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 75.4% for the second quarter, down 0.7 points sequentially and up 11 points year-over-year. overall gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 1.1 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange and relatively unchanged sequentially.
clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 76.9%, down 0.7 points sequentially due to higher freight costs and slightly lower asps. clear aligner gross margin was 12.4 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by lower asps.
systems and services gross margin for the second quarter was a record 65.9%, up 0.5 points sequentially primarily due to higher asps, partially offset by manufacturing variances and higher freight costs.
systems and services gross margin was up 6.6 points year-over-year due to higher asps and services revenues, in addition to improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by higher freight costs.
q2 operating expenses were $489.6 million, up sequentially 8.4% and up 64.7% year-over-year. the sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased consumer marketing spend, increased compensation related to additional headcount and higher commissions, and other general and administrative costs.
year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $192.3 million, reflecting our continued investment in marketing and sales and r&d activities and investments commensurate with business growth.
on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $461.2 million, up sequentially 8.6% and up 73.6% year-over-year due to the reasons described above.
our second quarter operating income of $268.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 26.6%, up 1.4 points versus prior quarter and up 47.3 points year-over-year. the sequential increase in operating margin was attributable primarily to operational leverage.
the year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily attributable to higher gross margin and operating leverage as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximate 1.8 points.
on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, operating margin for the second quarter was 29.8%, up 1.2 points sequentially, and up 40.8 points year-over-year.
interest and other income and expense, net for the second quarter was a loss of 0.1 million, down sequentially by $36.3 million primarily due to the sdc arbitration award gain recorded in the first quarter.
with regards to the second quarter tax provision, our gaap tax rate was 25.7%, which was higher than the prior quarter rate of 23.4% primarily due to lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. our gaap tax rate was lower than the same quarter last year, which was 44.8%, primarily due to foreign income taxed at lower rates.
the second quarter tax rate on a non-gaap basis was 19.5% compared to 20.2% in the prior quarter and 27.8% in the prior year. the second quarter non-gaap tax rate was lower than the prior quarter and the second quarter of the prior year rates due to foreign income taxed at lower rates.
second quarter net income per diluted share was $2.51, flat sequentially and up $3.03 compared to the prior year. on a non-gaap basis, net income per diluted share was $3.04 for the second quarter, up $0.55 sequentially and up $3.39 year-over-year.
moving on to the balance sheet. as of june 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion, flat sequentially. of our $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $551 million was held in the u.s. and $535.3 million was held by our international entities.
q2 accounts receivable balance was $808.1 million, up approximately 12.4% sequentially. our overall days sales outstanding was 72 days, flat sequentially and down approximately 49.1 days as compared to q2 last year.
cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $317.5 million. capital expenditures for the second quarter were $124.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities.
free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $193.3 million. we also have $300 million available under our revolving line of credit. under our $1 billion repurchase program announced in may 2021, we have $900 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock.
now let me turn to our outlook and the factors that inform our view for the remainder of the year. overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter results and our continued strong performance across regions, customer channels and products.
while there continues to be uncertainty around the pandemic and increasing restrictions related to covid-19 in certain geographies, we are continuing to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, including sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity, to drive demand and conversion globally and are confident in our competitive position and ability to execute.
at the same time, we are also anticipating more pronounced summer seasonality across all regions than we have experienced in recent years, as doctors, their staff and patients take long overdue vacations.
notwithstanding seasonality, given our strong performance and continued confidence in the huge market opportunity, our industry leadership and our ability to execute, we are increasing our 2021 revenue guidance provided in april on the q1 '21 earnings call to a range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion.
additionally, we now expect our second half year-over-year revenue growth rate to be above the midpoint of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%. on a gaap basis, we now anticipate our 2021 operation margin to be better than our prior guidance, in the range of 24% to 25%.
on a non-gaap basis, we expect the 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our gaap operating margin, after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization.
in addition, during q3 '21, we expect to repurchase up to $75 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement.
for 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. this includes our planned investment in a new manufacturing facility in poland, our first one in the emea region.
with that, i'll turn it back over to joe for final comments. joe?
joseph hogan -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, john. q2 was a terrific quarter and we're very pleased with the improvements we're seeing in recovery in doctor's practices. we truly value their increasing adoption of digital treatment approaches, their confidence in the unique align digital platform that spans from itero to the world's most sophisticated treatment planning, the world's largest 3d printing business on the globe to a patient app with over 1 million consumers along with the world's most recognized orthodontic brand has driven strong performance across the business.
our performance over the last year confirms the incredible size of our target market and demonstrates that our strategy and investments in recent years have helped further solidify our competitive position. we have numerous growth drivers in a vastly underpenetrated market. and while we continue to see some lasting impact and continued uncertainty due to covid, we remain confident in both the enormous opportunity we have to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry with our doctor customers, and in our ability to execute our strategy to increase adoption of invisalign treatment globally.
we're also confident in and excited about the benefits of digital treatment that more and more doctors are experiencing by transforming their practices with invisalign digital orthodontics and itero scanners for chairside treatment planning and visualization. in fact, invisalign treatment requires on an average 30% fewer doctor visits than fixed appliances, creating efficiency gains for the doctors and a better patient experience. and 85% of orthodontists surveyed agree that adopting the align digital platform has made a huge difference in their practices. it provides ways to improve their efficiency and productivity.
i look forward to updating you at the gp summit and investor day in october in las vegas and sharing more examples of how align is helping doctors transform their practices and their approach to treatment.
now i'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from nathan rich with goldman sachs.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. joe and john, you highlighted the seasonal softness in september and that extended into october. i wonder if you could maybe just provide a little bit more detail on what you've seen in october so far and maybe how that compared to september? and then as we've seen the latest covid case spikes subside in recent weeks, have you seen the patient traffic flow that you mentioned, has that started to pick up as covid cases have ticked down?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
nate, this is john. as we said, the extended seasonality continued into september and october. and then some of the covid uncertainty still remains, in some places, more back to normal than others. and -- but that uncertainty remains. taking all that together, our forecast reflects that. so the total year -- the remaining for the total year reflects everything that we've seen to this date.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. that's fair. i guess, joe, maybe a follow-up. i mean you've continued to have confidence in that 20% to 30% long-term range. maybe we'll hear more on friday at the analyst day. but do you have an initial view on growth for next year? and do you feel like once this period of more pronounced seasonality is behind you, we get back to like a more normalized kind of trajectory for the business as we head into next year?
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean, nathan, just -- yes, we're growing at a pretty good pace right now, right? so it's actually above our long-term growth model, which is 20% to 30%. and as we move into 2022, we'll retain that 20% revenue growth target, and we're happy to discuss it more in detail on friday. thanks nate. next question please.
operator
our next question is from jon block with stifel.
jon block -- stifel -- analyst
thanks guys. good afternoon. john, this might follow nathan's sort of path, but let me take a different approach. the new rev range that you gave for this year, you clearly brought it up a little bit. it seems to imply a bit over $1 billion for the fourth quarter. if i assume the scanner up sequentially from the $178 million and $55 million-ish, give or take, in non-case revenue, it looks like case volume is expected to be flat to maybe even down low to mid-single digits sequentially. so a couple of things there. is that the right way to think about things specific to case volumes? and if so -- i know you touched on this a little bit, but why sort of the different trend line versus prior to covid, if you would, where that was more up mid-single-digit plus?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
yes, jon, i think when you look at prior years, with covid not in the mix, things were maybe more seasonal. and you could see some of that -- the standard patterns from like, let's say, a q3 to q4, given covid and given some of the uncertainties that you have in certain economies and how they are responding and opening up, things don't always apply to mainly what's happened in the past. so that guidance that we gave is just a reflection of what we've seen.
jon block -- stifel -- analyst
okay. got it. and joe, just a follow-up. we keep on hearing about the ios change from apple on privacy, and you guys have such a broad reach in terms of marketing. but i am curious if you're seeing any impact. is it impacting leads, yes or no? and if so, could that actually continue into 2022? i would love your feedback there.
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
i mean yes, jon, it's a good question. i mean we've seen an impact on it. the thing is, there's a lot of other media you can pivot to in order to find those patients. so have we seen it and have we had to do a certain amount of pivot to do that? yes. but as far as our marketing efforts, i wouldn't discount them in any way in the sense of that change being material in some sense in the near future.
operator
our next question comes from john kreger with william blair.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
hi guys. thanks. i'm curious, now that you've exited another kind of typical teen season, what sort of penetration do you think invisalign has of total teen starts at this point?
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean, globally -- hey, john, it's joe. globally, it's less at 5%. i mean, you look at -- and we'll show you on friday exactly what we think that is. in the united states, i think our current number is mid-teens? yes. john, i think you know that too, we have so far to go, right? this is a superior treatment, like i said in our script. we can do 90% of the orthodontic cases are out there. it's just us continuing to work really closely with orthodontists and advertise to consumers to explain the benefits of digital orthodontics and move this forward. but like i said, this is inevitable. digital is better. we know it's better. we've made it better. it's more comprehensive than it was before. it's faster, less invasive. i could go on all day. and that's what drives this company. that's our purpose. we know we'll hit it. it's just -- there's just a lot of work to get from here to there.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
and that was -- joe, that was my follow-up. as you talked to your kind of power users or maybe people that are just getting started, you've made the product better, you made the software better. what do you think is the key point of friction at this point to sort of get that adoption rate up, where i think most of us on this call sort of assume it can get to longer term?
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
john, i think it's the classic early adopter syndrome. the doctors who use our product almost exclusively 100% can't imagine not using our product line, right? but they're early adopters in the classical sense. there's two things. there's one, there's a clinical confidence people that are out there that we have to convince. and it's much easier than it is today than it was five years ago, given products like -- first, given products like mandibular advancement, those kind of things that extend it. and then the predictability of our products. secondly, it's the business equation inside the orthodontic practices that they're convinced they can actually keep up the margins and the growth capability they have for their practices. we understand that. and that's why we have programs like adapt that we've put together, john, that orthodontists do want to engage with us, we can show them how to really operate in a digital environment and actually exceed from a margin standpoint and a growth standpoint.
operator
next question comes from jason bednar with piper sandler.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. congrats on the record quarter here. a couple of questions from our side. yes. one big picture. first for you, joe. one of the key drivers of growth the past year has been really the adult category outpacing the teens. really seemed like heading into this quarter could be the proof point quarter and whether that growth would flip back to teens. but adult was again stronger than teens here. so it seems like some good staying power. so i guess, joe, how do you think about how these two segments play out from here, both obviously have a ton of growth potential. but has the business for align shifted to where we should be thinking about adult growth outpacing that of teens as we look forward to the coming quarters and years?
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes, jason, it's a good question. but i think it's -- and you'll hear a lot about this friday, is the demand equation on this business is incredible, right? the 500 million patients we talk about could primarily be serviced through the general dentistry area and then the over 20 million that's on -- in the orthodontic side. i mean that's -- you look at that, you just -- it's a wide open marketplace. so adults have done well, teens will do well. i just think you have to have them both go up. and remember, they're dealing from different bases in the sense of, traditionally, 75% of our cases have been adults and 25% teens. so there is kind of a law of large number on the adult side, but the growth potential is amazing, and we're just going to go after both ends of that equation as aggressively as we can.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. okay. that's helpful. look forward to more on friday then. and then maybe just more of a real-time look and also following up on nate's question there to start out, but asking also a different way. maybe wondering if you could talk about how utilization trends have gone here month-to-month on a regional basis, september, october. and then maybe based on the treatment plans, submissions, other measures of your funnel, what does the utilization look like as we shift from october to november?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
jason, this is john. we've seen some improvements in utilization. and it's a reflection of kind of coming out of that seasonality piece of what we've talked about. and kind of navigating through covid, but we've been happy with the utilization that we've seen as of late.
operator
our next question comes from elizabeth anderson with evercore.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for taking my questions. i had a question on the gross margin line. i think you guys talked about how you're seeing maybe slightly higher manufacturing costs in clear aligners and then lower freight and higher freight in itero so there's other -- higher freight cost there. so i was just wondering, as we think about some of the global supply chain issues that we've been reading about and hearing about from other companies, if you could just elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in both of those areas.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
elizabeth, this is john. i can take that. i think when you look at our overall gross margin, broadly impacted as we talked about additional aligners as we now have ramped up, and we've seen those cases from the last several quarters as doctors make refinements and get patients in to make refinements to the care. we see an improvement there in asp, but there's some offset in gross margin. but broadly when we look at some of the inflationary pressures and so on, we have long-term contracts. we have got a supply chain where we're driving a lot of productivity and efficiencies through. so we feel we're pretty well balanced as we see some of these inflationary headwinds. not that it's not a challenge -- it's not that it's not a challenge out there for everybody, but we feel that between the contracts we have and the efficiencies we can drive, we balance it.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore -- analyst
that's really helpful. and maybe i saw that in your outlook, you're obviously talking about around $100 million in share repurchases in the fourth quarter. but your cash balance is moving up nicely. and i was wondering if you could comment on what you see sort of as the -- your sort of preferred level of cash balance and if there's any potential for acceleration on the share repurchase line or things that we should consider in sort of thinking that, that should be a little bit higher than where it's been traditionally?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
yes. i think when you look at on balance, elizabeth, we're very pleased with the cash generation, almost $900 million of cfoa three quarters of the year. phenomenal cash, a lot going back into the business to grow our business, make investments in some of the operating expenditures to grow our business, continue to make investments in capacity and adding capacity, getting closer to our customers. and then as we've said with our cash, we'll get back to shareholders to repurchase. so we're very happy with how things have progressed. we don't have a magical number in terms of how much cash we should have, but all things in balance, we feel like we're executing to our strategy.
operator
our next question comes from jeff johnson with baird.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon guys. joe, i wanted to start maybe on system and services or maybe john, this for you. but where are we at as what portion of that revenue is kind of the recurring services side as opposed to the system sales? and in 4q, we're still hearing about a decent amount of ppp money floating around. obviously, you've got the incremental launch coming in china and that of 5d. should we think of 4q being a better system quarter sequentially? again, just with seasonality there?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
yes, jeff, this is john. i mean we've been very pleased with our sequential improvements that we've seen in the systems and services and scanner and services business. when we look at five quarters in a row of kind of really helping us lead the recovery out of covid and a lot of investments that doctors are making -- our doctors are making in the digital platform, this is an excellent reflection of that. we have a lot of new doctors that started invisalign this quarter with us, and many of them start with getting an itero and being able to utilize that within their practice. so we feel very good about the scanner and services business. about 1/3 of that business is services. so that's recurring. and as we improve and have more of an installed base, that just grows that business. so you've got a very big and growing installed base, coupled with great products that are really driving that adoption. and especially among newer doctors coming in, they're coming in with that scanner to really incorporate that digital technology into their practice.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
yes. understood. and then, joe, maybe bigger picture question, just on kind of the return in the chair and what docs are seeing for clear aligners and invisalign especially relative to braces. but we've talked to more and more docs just even over the last maybe few months who seem to be really spacing those follow-up visits in invisalign out to three or even four months. it's cutting the chair time even in half relative to pre-covid levels and well below braces. so are you seeing the same thing? i know virtual is helping that a little bit. i think some docs even doing it without virtual just given their confidence in outcomes. but how much is that kind of driving the argument in that kind of secular push into clear aligners, especially with staffing issues that maybe you guys are hearing about at some of the offices, things like that?
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. jeff, that's one of the key ingredients is the productivity of a doctor's time and the productivity of the real estate within that office. in a digital kind of situation, you can remote monitor it like you do on virtual care, some other products that are out there and doctors are taking advantage of that. but also, there's a lot of confidence doctors have, too, if their patients are using the aligners and they will bring them back every so often and take a look. so that's a big part of it. secondly, jeff, is it -- you can actually work with less labor content and less doctor content and people in the office and also size of the office, too. and you see a lot of orthodontists understanding that and really embracing it.
there's also a referral aspect of invisalign is once a patient has an experience with invisalign, they're often ready to refer another patient to that doctor much more so than wires and brackets. and they benefit from that because they see an increase in their sales too. and we see that constantly and adapt and we focus on that and can actually predict it to a certain extent of time. so i hope i'm answering your question, jeff, but that is the whole idea of digital and then we keep talking about our align digital capability and being able to service a doctor through itero, being having virtual care on both ends and having the kind of capability and horsepower that we can provide with our algorithms and the extent of our clinical capability is just -- it gives us a huge amount of breadth and capability at orthodontists.
operator
our next question comes from brandon couillard with jefferies.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. i actually want to switch gears. you talked quite a bit about the non-case business and the retainer business. can you just help us understand why your share has historically lagged there? maybe a sense of what your capture rate is today in terms of the cases that also have a follow-on retainer? and how would you sort of frame the revenue opportunity from these new initiatives?
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
brandon, it's a good -- it's why we highlighted it. and it's obviously why we've put money into this thing and a focus on over the last years. there are certain things in this business that we all know, but there are so many things to do and focus on that sometimes something that's so obvious like that lacks the attention that you want to give to it. and we've been talking about this over time. so beginning of this year, put a team together to really go after those things. it's hard to say the reason why. it's just we haven't been as focused on retention as we need to be. and many orthodontists like they make their own retainers.
they do it because we just haven't been competitive in the sense of how we can deliver, how fast we can deliver, how easy we make it for them. but i guarantee you, if you go out, brandon, and you query even orthodontists that seldom use our retainers, they'll tell you we make the best retainers in the world. and we should, when you make 750,000 unique parts a day, right? we know what we're doing, the fits are exquisite when you have an itero scanner to be able to do that. and we set this thing up as a play for doctors that they can feel confident that we'll get these retainers to them in a quick amount of time. they're going to be terrific retainers, something they're proud to really get to their patients. and we've had great feedback on this so far. so i can't apologize for the past or give you the whole history why we haven't done it, but i feel really good about the progress we've made so far.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
that's great. and then just a question on the scanner business. i mean pretty remarkable strength for a while now. can you just help us understand like where kind of the sources of this momentum? and is the niri study the type of data set that can move the needle with gps? you all often talk about clinical studies, especially with intraoral scanners, but just trying to get a sense of how significant being able to go and have this data that might be for a gp that doesn't use digital impressioning today or might be on the fence.
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think niri really helps. i really do. it's one of those -- in electronics, we all know there's killer apps, right, killer applications? when you can see caries, cavities, right, we use the clinical term. but when you can see cavities without ionizing radiation, and brandon, what's amazing when you see this, too, what happens is the enamel almost becomes invisible. it's almost translucent. you can see through the enamel right to where the caries is. and there's a certain amount of training that has to be done in order to do it. and look, i grew up in an ionizing radiation business. i know what it is in ct and x-ray and it's -- that radiation component is better today than it used to be, but it still exists and patients are still concerned with it over time.
and to be able to do this in a sense in a safe way and in a quick way like we do it. you know what it is to put bitewings in a chair, and it's terrible in a test chair, right? bite down, turn your head sideways, i could go through it all day. and this is a quick scan, one minute scan, 1.5 minute scan. it pops up on the screen. you can have a conversation with the patient and say, ""there it is and what it deals with."" so yes, i think it's a killer application. will it convince all gps to buy itero? no. but then you have to look at exocad, that critical workflow between labs and gps really sets us up nicely for restorative pieces. soon to announce smile architect, which really allows doctors to use restorative orthodontics as a standard of care. we'll talk about that more friday. so -- and look, i'm biased. i've been in the -- i'd say, the medical imaging equipment business for 15 years of my life, counting itero, this is the best scanner in the marketplace. and then we're just out to show it and to prove it.
operator
our next question is from chris cooley with stephens.
chris cooley -- stephens -- analyst
good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. congratulations on the record quarter. just for me, as we all start looking forward to the upcoming event here this friday and saturday, maybe a bigger picture question. as we think about the business, you've made significant investments in technology not only in pioneering the category, but expanding its indications for use. you subsequently invested in chairside, really facilitating the diagnostic aspect. and as the business is now kind of inflecting here two straight quarters of $1 billion plus, do we think about the next stage of investment really kind of going back to a prior question being tools that enable or enhance the productivity of the clinician or patient flow? is it more to marketing at the consumer and clinical level? i'm just kind of thinking about how the business now pivots for that next stage of continued growth at this greater scale. and i have just one quick follow-up after that, if i may.
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
chris, it's a really good question because obviously, as we're going through our aop for next year and putting those things together. but when you say pivot, i wouldn't use the word pivot, i'd say that we extend what we're doing. and then we place bets accordingly and where we think we'll get the best return. we -- i've got to continue advertising. we have a peer system. we have a wonderful brand. we have to leverage that piece. but specifically, and this goes to the last questions we had, too, doctor productivity is a big deal. and when you look at our align digital platform, inherently, that's what it's about.
t's how do you make doctors more productive to make sure that we don't go back and forth with a clinchecks? or how do we make sure that from our standpoint that we can respond quickly to customer issues. and we're investing heavily in all those things and making good progress. it's expensive. a lot of things that you have to do when you're really grounded in software and making those changes. we have really great talent here that knows how to do that. we've been actually working the productivity of clincheck and those things for three to four years and it's just starting to bring technology to the marketplace. so you're right. we're not pivoting toward that. we've been investing in it. but you'll see the combination of that more and more as we enter next year in the second half of next year too. john, anything to add?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
no. i think that's the investments that we continue to make. it's about productivity. it's about growing in this digital orthodontics and our doctors expect it. and our tools will provide that.
chris cooley -- stephens -- analyst
that's great. and if i could just squeeze in a quick follow-on. i just want to make sure it doesn't look out of proportion, but i just want to make sure we didn't miss something there on the deferred piece in the quarter, i think it was approximately $84 million. anything just covid-related that we should be mindful of there? or is that just normal course of business when we look at the deferred revenue component for the 3q?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
thanks, chris. it's completely normal course of business, nothing covid-related within there. just deferred revenue that we'll recognize in future periods.
operator
our next question comes from mike ryskin with bank of america.
mike ryskin -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks for taking the question guys. a couple of quick ones for me, but i'll try to tie them together into one, on the scanners and service revenue. i noted that your digitally submitted cases continues to grind higher pretty close to hitting 90% maybe in a year or 2. i'm just wondering, as you continue to place iteros into the field, how often are you sort of placing a second or third unit versus getting a new one out there versus a competitor placement where you're displacing someone else potentially? and then as a follow-on to that, sort of building off of, i think elizabeth's question earlier on the supply chain. anything specific to semis that we should be thinking about? it's just a question that's come up a lot, some of our other names, i want to make sure we tie that off as far as it relates to scanners.
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
mike, from a scanner standpoint is obviously, we have a great scanner. and i think your question asked more about saturation more than anything. our feeling is you got two million dentists out there or orthodontists, right. and each of them actually, if you're going to run a digital practice, you need more than one scanner. you need a scanner per chair. so you think, let's just say, the average doc has three chairs and there's two million doctors out there. we're just touching this thing. we've got a 50,000 unit installed base. and obviously, this is a growth equation. it's not one where we're looking to plan out in some time. and obviously, it's a portfolio of churns over time because the technology moves fast too. so it creates some of its own demand through obsolescence, too. john, on the supply?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
and from a supply standpoint, obviously, we're mindful of concerns and things that go on from a global supply chain, but we feel comfortable that between the inventory we have and some of the things that we've been able to do that we can manage through any supply chain concerns that are out there. our next question is from devin misra with berenberg.
devin misra -- berenberg -- analyst
hi, dev here for ravi from berenberg. i want to kind of revisit the marketing side. i think you guys have been ramping up marketing spend and the long list of things with very large percentage increases noted earlier. where are you seeing higher roi in regards to marketing? are there any specific regions? and then also just going back to a question on growth of teens versus adults. if we kind of look at the marketing spend on things that you've noted, it seems like a focus is on the teen side, which is kind of indicative that, that's where you'll see more growth and stronger returns. so any color around that? and then i have a quick follow-up.
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. first of all, from a marketing spend standpoint, i mean, we really do understand, by region, our kind of return on investment and what we get. i'm not going to share that over the phone, but we're very aware of that and what it is. we also -- when you asked about the teen advertisements, there's a seasonality for teens around the world, too. so you'll see like in the quarter we just came out of in the second quarter, we were going into the teen season. it's big in china, big in the states. and so you'll see a larger part of our advertising budget go toward that in order to capture that demand. but yes, this is part of how we go to market. we have a great brand. that brand needs to be enhanced with patients, and we want those patients going to doctors asking for invisalign. and we have some very good capability here from a marketing standpoint to exercise that. john, anything?
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
and what we've learned over time is we're -- it's not one size fits all across all the markets. you're trying to maximize return on investment. and in certain markets, you're doing things that are different than others, maybe more established markets, you try something different. maybe other markets that we have, where we can advertise, we try different things. but i think the key is we understand what levers to pull. we've learned a lot over the last several years. we're very excited about these opportunities. and as joe said, we have the best brand, the best global brand out there, and we want to be able to reach those potential patients in the way that they are living their lives. and that's the philosophy that we have. and we talk a lot about that front end, the top of the funnel metrics, and we're very excited about what we're seeing as we've gone through the last several quarters.
devin misra -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. great. and then kind of following up on that direct-to-consumer focus question earlier on. there was a launch of that teeth whitening solution. and a couple of years ago, there was a align shops that, via litigation with sec, was kind of a focus point there. so as we envision kind of where the direct-to-consumer side of align business goes, how does that teeth whitening solution and how does that fit in? i'm trying to see it seems like there's a big push toward direct consumer with the -- with that side coming up. so any color on that would be helpful.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
i mean if your question implies a direct-to-consumer kind of a moat, that's not us. it's not what we do. it's about what -- but we always have an e-commerce site. we have a great brand called invisalign. patients ask us all the time for whitening cleansers, chewies, things associated with it. and we're just exercising that capability. it's one with the whitening standpoint, we probably should have been more aggressive on before. but again, it's one of those things that we decided to focus on recently. and we're getting great feedback from the doctors in doing that. and so it only makes sense. it's classic brand extension, and we're going to leverage that invisalign brand as well as we can.

operator
greetings, and welcome to align technologies' third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, shirley stacy, vice president of corporate communications.
thank you. you may begin.
shirley stacy -- vice president of corporate communication
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. joining me today for our conference call is joe hogan, president and ceo; and john morici, cfo. we issued third quarter 2021 financial results today via globenewswire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately one month. a telephone replay will be available today by approximately 5:30 p.m. eastern time through 5:30 p.m. eastern time on november 10. to access the telephone replay, domestic callers should dial (877) 660-6853 with conference number 13723267, followed by #. international callers should dial (201) 612-7415 with the same conference number.
as a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about align's future events and product outlook. these forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission, available on our website and at sec.gov. actual results may vary significantly, and align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. we have posted historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations on our gaap -- of our gaap and non-gaap reconciliation, if applicable, and our third quarter 2021 conference call slides on our website under quarterly results. please refer to these files for more detailed information. and with that, i'd like to turn the call over to align technology's president and ceo, joe hogan. joe?
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, shirley. good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. on our call today, i'll provide some highlights in the third quarter, then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, systems services and clear aligners. john will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook. following that, i'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. i'm pleased to report strong third quarter results with revenue growth of 38.4% year-over-year on top of a record third quarter last year, driven by the strength across all regions, customer channels and products. for q3, we shipped to a record 85,500 doctors in the quarter and reached 11.6 million invisalign patients cumulatively. on a sequential basis, q3 results reflect continued adoption of itero scanners and increased utilization of invisalign clear aligners in the americas and apac regions as well as the growth in teen segment, especially in the north american orthodontics channel.
our third quarter revenues reflect a growing confidence of doctors and patients with invisalign treatment, itero scanners and exocad software as more doctors discover the benefits of digital treatment and transform their practices with the align digital platform. for q3, systems and services revenues were up 57.3% year-over-year with strong revenue growth across all regions and up 5% sequentially primarily in north america. q3 results reflect the continued adoption of itero element 5d plus series, our next-generation scanners and imaging system, which launched earlier this year and feature innovative technology like near-infrared technology, we call niri, which aids and detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities above the gingiva without harmful radiation. for q3, clear aligner revenues were up 34.9% year-over-year with strong revenue growth across all regions and across the portfolio, including comprehensive and non-comprehensive products as well as invisalign moderate and invisalign go.
on a sequential basis, q3 clear aligner revenues were down very slightly from record q2, reflecting more pronounced summer seasonality than last year, especially in emea where practices and patients appear to have taken extended holidays and where offices were impacted due to resurgence of covid-19 cases and restrictions, especially in some markets in asia pacific. in the teen segment, q3 '21 invisalign clear aligner volumes for teens were strong, up 13.8% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year to a record 206,000 teens, representing approximately 1/3 of total cases shipped, with strong shipment growth from north american orthodontists and a record quarter for teen in apac. our third quarter revenues also include non-case revenue for clinical training and education and doctor-prescribed retainer products. retention is a critical part of creating and maintaining a beautiful new smile. retainers prevent teeth from gradually shifting back to their initial positions after treatment ends. studies show that without retention, even perfectly aligned teeth can gradually revert to their pre-treatment state and that dentition continues to change as patients age, often requiring limited treatment, also known as touch-up treatment if not properly retained. our retention products are designed to maintain teeth that have been aligned by invisalign aligners, braces or other aligners.
these retainer products can accommodate lingual bars, wires, also known as a permanent retainer, missing teeth that require an artificial tooth and bite ramps, also known as turbos or blocks. while our retainer business continues to deliver solid revenue growth, our share of retention market is significantly underpenetrated, even more so than in our share of the orthodontic case starts. we have been developing a robust retainer strategy, including a separate marketing team focused solely on driving adoption and increasing market share in the united states. our objective is to build brand awareness for vivera retainers and drive engagement with doctors through clinical education and sales initiatives, while connecting consumers to doctors through demand creation programs and our concierge service. we've also recently implemented social media campaigns featuring the benefits of vivera from the makers of invisalign clear aligners.
we believe that incremental investments will provide increased value for invisalign practices and drive growth consistent with our long-term financial model target. in addition, we successfully rolled out a limited pilot program to participating invisalign providers in the united states and canada that offers a monthly targeted subscription program to address the unmet patient demand for retention or touch-up cases. our goal is to encourage experienced high volume in invisalign practices who regularly treat patients with our comprehensive products to offer premium retention or entry-level products for the long-term health of their patients and to grow their businesses. practices in this pilot program can purchase a monthly subscription at a fixed price based on their monthly needs for retention or limited treatment. the program allows doctors the flexibility to order both touch-up or retention aligners with their tiered subscription. the program is designed for a segment of experienced invisalign doctors who are not regularly using our retainers or low-stage aligners. the positive feedback from our doctors have been encouraging.
for instance, the doctors at bray and tarby told us the program is very straightforward and easy to understand, and they've been hoping align will do something like this. dr. jonathan nicozisis at princeton orthodontics called the program a home run. we went -- he went on to predict it should replace the idea that doctors invest in 3d printing and the additional complications and expenses it requires, including the need for a full-time employee and additional overhead costs, particularly because he believes his treatment outcomes are always better with align. q3 non-case revenues also included accessories and consumables such as aligner cases called clam shells, cleaning crystals and other oral health products that are available on our e-commerce channels in the u.s. only, including the invisalign accessory store, walmart and amazon.
in q3, we announced an exclusive supply distribution agreement with ultradent products inc., a leading developer and manufacturer of high-tech dental materials, devices and instruments worldwide. the invisalign professional whitening program powered by opalescence is optimized for invisalign aligners and vivera retainers and is available only through invisalign-trained doctors. also in q3, we launched the invisalign whitening pen through an e-commerce channels in the u.s. only. the whitening pen is an over-the-counter retail product for consumers seeking quick tooth whitening at a lower price and is not intended to be used with aligners. the whitening pen complements the other accessory products that align already markets to consumers through its existing e-commerce channels and is a key addition to our consumable product portfolio. now let's turn to the specifics around our third quarter results, starting with the americas. for the americas, q3 results reflected strong performance, including record revenues for latin america as well as summer seasonality for adult case starts in north america that primarily impacted gp practices, strong ortho performance, especially in the teen market that included increased utilization from the orthodontic channel.
invisalign case volume was up 0.7% sequentially and up 36.4% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region, especially in latam. dso utilization continued to be a strong growth driver as well, led by heartland and smile docs. for our international business, q3 invisalign case volume was up 27% year-over-year on top of record growth in the same quarter last year. on a sequential basis, international shipments were down sequentially 4.3%, primarily as a result of greater seasonality and covid-related shutdowns in apac markets. for emea, q3 invisalign case volumes were up 49.6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across all markets led by the u.k. and iberia, along with continued growth in our expansion markets in central and eastern europe and the benelux. for q3, year-over-year invisalign volume in emea was driven by increased submitters from both orthodontists and gps and increased utilization primarily from orthos. on a sequential basis, emea was down sequentially 16.5% following a record q2, primarily as a result of the extended seasonality we had anticipated primarily from summer holidays and vacations across the region.
for apac, q3 volumes were up 4.2% compared to a record q3 last year in apac. on a year-over-year basis, growth was uneven. the market as apac, the first region to emerge from the depths of the covid lockdown in 2020. additionally, we saw covid resurgences and lockdowns sporadically impact various apac countries in q3. on a sequential basis, q3 invisalign volumes were up 21.2% reflecting growth across the region, led by a record quarter in china, especially from teen cases as well as strong growth in japan and anz. and q3, growth from both channels was strong, with ortho growth driven by increased invisalign utilization and gp growth -- channel growth driven by increased invisalign submitters. apac teen shipments reached an all-time high in q3. at the recent 10th china finance summit awards, align was recognized as the 2021 most innovative enterprise for its advancements and outstanding contributions in the field of digital orthodontics. this award builds on our prior recognition of align's leadership in the digital orthodontics industry and its efforts to promote the modernization of orthodontics. our consumer marketing focuses on educating consumers about the invisalign system to drive demand to invisalign doctor's offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles.
in q3, we expanded the next generation of the ""invis is"" media campaign across emea, apac and brazil to increase awareness with adult, mom and teen consumers. globally, we delivered 6.45 billion impressions, growing 42% year-over-year, resulting in a 70% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our websites. in the u.s., we connected with teens on snapchat, youtube and twitch with our ""invis is not your parents braces"" campaign. these campaigns continue to feature some of the largest teen influencers from our invisalign smile squad, like charli d'amelio, marsai martin, michael lynn collins and devon key. these influencers share their personal experience with invisalign treatment, including why they chose invisalign treatment to shape their smiles. as part of our focus on teens, with our invisalign changemakers program, we held a recognition event hosted by marsai martin, with teens across the country to celebrate and recognize 100 teens across the country who drove positive change within their communities.
to continue growing for our young adult businesses, we expanded the ""invis is a powerful thing"" campaign, which highlights how powerful the smile transformation with invisalign treatment can be for their self-confidence. in the u.s., we expanded our invisalign smile squad to include young adult influencers such as cody rigsby, lana condor and emily hampshire, will help to deliver over 405 million impressions. additionally, our influencer partnerships with tiktok creators helped increase traffic to our sites with a 127% increase in click-through rates. in brazil, we launched the ""invis is a powerful thing"" campaign and teamed up with mega-influencer, [indecipherable] to increase website traffic by 30%. in the emea region, we expanded into new media channels such as tiktok and snapchat across the u.k., germany and france to drive engagement. these efforts led to more than 153% increase in unique visitors. we also started consumer advertising in russia, which resulted in more of a 1,000 increase in unique visitors to our website. in q3, we continue to expand our consumer advertising across the apac region, experienced a 132% increase in unique visitors to our websites.
in australia, we expanded our media mix to include partners such as tiktok and snapchat, which resulted in a 250% growth year-over-year in unique visitors to our website. in japan, we continue to see a strong response from consumers to our ""invis is"" campaign, resulting to more than an 800% increase year-over-year in unique visitors to our website. adoption of our consumer and patient app, my invisalign, continued to increase in q3 with 1.2 million downloads to date. usage of our four digital tools also continue to increase. for example, our invisalign virtual appointment tool was used over 15,000 times and our insurance verification feature was used 14,000 times in q3. furthermore, we received more than 1.5 million patient photos in our virtual care feature to date globally, which continues to provide us with rich data to leverage our ai capabilities and improve our services for doctors that is used to enhance their patient's care. for our systems and services business, q3 revenues grew 57.3% year-over-year reflecting strong scanner shipments and services and was up 5% sequentially. this is the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth for our systems and services business.
the itero element 5d plus imaging system continued gaining traction across all regions, with the most recent launch in japan in q3. the itero element 5d plus imaging system will be available in china in q4 of this year. additionally, the itero element plus series was launched in korea in q3. the series expands the portfolio of itero element scanners and imaging systems to include new solutions that serve the needs of a broader range of doctors and patients in the dental market. moreover, i'm proud to say that in a recent clinical study, the itero element 5d intraoral scanner was found to be more sensitive than bitewing radiology in detecting early enamel lesions, providing further evidence of the benefits of itero 5d scanner in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities above the gingiva without exposing patients to harmful ionizing radiation. this is great news for our itero business as the study further supports the diagnostic validity of near-infrared imaging technology offered by the itero 5d scanner for early proximal caries detection.
the findings also underscore the valuable role that niri technology can have in dental health assessment and early detection of cavities, which is important to the overall oral healthcare treatment options and a comfortable safe experience for a broad population of patients. a strong indicator of the digital acceleration with dental offices is a number of intraoral digital scans used for invisalign case submissions. total worldwide intraoral digital scans used to start in invisalign case in q3 increased 84.2% from 78.3% in q3 last year. international intraoral digital scans for invisalign case submissions increased 79.3%, up from 72.1% in the same last year. for the americas, 88% of cases were submitted using an intraoral digital scan compared to 83.2% a year ago. cumulatively, over 44.9 million orthodontic scans and 9.3 million restorative scans have been performed with itero scanners. our q3 systems and services revenues also includes exocad, cad/cam products and services. exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design, extends our digital dental solutions and broadens align's digital platform toward fully integrated interdisciplinary and workflows.
we remain excited about our continued integration progress and product plans with exocad. during the quarter, exocad launched chairsidecad3.0 galway, the next generation of exocad's easy-to-use cad software for single-visit dentistry. the software has improved automation for fast crown design and enables users to integrate open hardware and materials of choice. exocad's chairsidecad received 2021 cellerant's best of class technology award for the third consecutive year. also during the quarter, exocad had its largest ever presence at ids, the international dental show, where they showcased their seamless digital workflows and the simplicity of the use of exocad's galway software release. exocad was the only company at ids to showcase live patient treatment with a smile creator experience station, featuring itero's scans, instant smile makeovers and production of clip-on smiles. with that, i'll now turn it over to john.
john f. morici -- chief financial officer and senior vice president
thanks, joe. now for our q3 financial results. total revenues for the third quarter were $1.016 billion, up 0.5% from the prior quarter and up 38.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. for clear aligners, q3 revenues of $837.6 million were down 0.4% sequentially and up 34.9% year-over-year, reflecting invisalign volume growth across all geographies. in q3, we shipped 655,100 invisalign cases, a decrease of 1.6% sequentially with an increase of 32.1% year-over-year. in addition, we shipped to a record 85,500 invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 7,200 were first-time customers. q3 clear aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the invisalign portfolio, led by comprehensive products. q3 comprehensive volume increased 1.3% sequentially and 30.3% year-over-year. and q3 non-comprehensive volume decreased 8.1% sequentially and increased 36.8% year-over-year. q3 adult patients decreased 7.3% sequentially and increased 34.7% year-over-year. in q3, teens or younger patients increased 13.8% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year.
clear aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.5 million or approximately 0.2 points sequentially. on a year-over-year basis, clear aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $16.1 million or approximately 2.6 points. for q3, invisalign comprehensive asps increased sequentially and year-over-year. on a sequential basis, invisalign comprehensive asps reflect higher additional aligners. on a year-over-year basis, comprehensive asps reflect favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by the increase in net revenue deferrals for new invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments. q3 invisalign non-comprehensive asps increased sequentially and year-over-year. on a sequential basis, invisalign non-comprehensive asps reflect higher additional aligners, partially offset by higher discounts. on a year-over-year basis, invisalign non-comprehensive asps were favorably impacted by foreign exchange, higher additional aligners and lower discounts. clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $84 million or 9.3% sequentially and $347.3 million or 53.9% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. our systems and services revenues for the third quarter were a record $178.3 million, up 5% sequentially and up 57.3% year-over-year.
this marks the fifth quarter in a row of sequential revenue increase. the increase sequentially can be attributed to increased scanner shipments and increased services revenues from our larger installed base. the increase year-over-year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, increased service revenues from our larger installed base as well as higher asps from a favorable mix shift toward higher-priced itero 5d scanners and imaging systems. our systems and services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up $27.2 million or 17% sequentially and up $100.1 million or 115.2% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and deferral of services revenue, which we recognize ratably over the service period. moving on to gross margin. third quarter overall gross margin was 74.3%, down 0.7 points sequentially and up 1.6 points year-over-year. on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our 2020 exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 74.7% for the third quarter, down 0.7 points sequentially and up 1.4 points year-over-year.
overall gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange and relatively unchanged sequentially. clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 76.2%, down 0.7 points sequentially due to higher manufacturing costs and higher additional aligners, partially offset by higher asps and lower freight. clear aligner gross margin was up 1.5 points year-over-year due to improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volume, partially offset by higher asps. systems and services gross margin for the third quarter was 65.6%, down 0.3 points sequentially primarily due to lower asps and higher manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher service revenue. systems and services gross margin was up 3.6 points year-over-year due to higher asps from product mix shift to itero 5d and 5d plus series and service revenues, partially offset by higher freight cost. q3 operating expenses were $494 million, up sequentially 0.9% and up 38.4% year-over-year. on a sequential basis, operating expenses were up slightly by $4.4 million.
year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $137 million, reflecting increased headcount and our continued investment in marketing, sales and r&d activities and investments commensurate with business growth. on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles and acquisition costs related to our 2020 exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $466.1 million, up sequentially 1% and up 40.3% year-over-year due to the reasons described earlier. our third quarter operating income of $261.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.7%, down 0.9 points from the prior quarter and up 1.6 points year-over-year. the sequential decrease in operating margin was attributable primarily to lower gross margin. the year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 0.7 points, partially offset by continued investments as mentioned earlier.
on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related costs, the operating margin for the third quarter was 28.8%, down 0.9 points sequentially and up 0.8 points year-over-year. interest and other income and expense net for the third quarter was a gain of $0.8 million, up sequentially by $0.9 million and down year-over-year by $6.6 million. on a year-over-year basis, interest and other income and expense decreased primarily due to net foreign exchange losses in the three months ended september 30, 2021, as compared to net foreign exchange gains in the same period in 2020, which was partially offset by an unrealized gain on an investment held in a private company recognized in the three months ended september 30, 2021. the gaap effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30.9% compared to 25.7% in the second quarter and 24.5% in the third quarter of the prior year. on a non-gaap -- our non-gaap effective tax rate was 22.2% in the third quarter compared to 19.5% in the second quarter and 16.6% in the third quarter of the prior year.
he third quarter gaap and non-gaap effective tax rates were higher than the second quarter primarily due to our foreign income being taxed at different rates and tax true-ups. our gaap and non-gaap third quarter effective tax rates were higher than the third quarter of the prior year primarily due to lower tax benefits from foreign income tax at lower rates and a tax benefit recognized last year resulting from an income tax audit settlement. third quarter net income per diluted share was $2.28, down sequentially $0.23 and up $0.52 compared to the prior year. on a non-gaap basis, net income per diluted share was $2.87 for the third quarter, down $0.17 sequentially and up $0.62 year-over-year. moving on to the balance sheet. as of september 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion, up sequentially $151.5 million and up $622.3 million year-over-year. of our $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $607.5 million was held in the u.s. and $630.3 million was held by our international entities.
q3 accounts receivable balance was $855 million, up approximately 5.8% sequentially. our overall days sales outstanding was 75 days, up approximately three days sequentially and down approximately two days as compared to q3 last year. cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $355 million. capital expenditures for the third quarter were $124.3 million as we continued to invest in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $230.7 million. we also have $300 million available under our untapped revolving line of credit. under our $1 billion repurchase program announced in may of 2021, we have $825 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock. now let me turn to our outlook and the factors that inform our view for the remainder of the year. we are very pleased with our q3 results and strong year-over-year growth, which reflects continued customer adoption of the itero scanners and increased invisalign utilization across customer channels, including teens, adults and young patients. over the last 18 months, our investment decisions have helped drive and capture demand across all regions and customer channels.
we continued spending in many areas and have seen good return on our investments and strong revenue growth. consumer interest in improving smiles is high and doctor acceptance in the align digital platform is helping drive growth across all regions and market segments. as anticipated in our q3 outlook, we experienced more pronounced summer seasonality, more noticeably in september and continued into october as practices took more extended vacations and patient traffic flow was sporadically interrupted by regional covid resurgence, restrictions and other lockdowns. we anticipate these covid challenges and the general macroeconomic uncertainties to continue into q4. taking this all into account, as we look at the remainder of 2021, we expect revenues for the year to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion, at the high end of our original guidance range. we also expect our outlook and revenue growth for the second half of 2021 to be in the high end of our long-term operating model of 20% to 30%.
on a gaap basis, we anticipate our 2021 operating margin to be around 25%. on a non-gaap basis, we expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately three points higher than our gaap operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization from our 2020 exocad acquisition. we remain confident in the huge market opportunities for our business, our industry leadership and our ability to execute. we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to drive our growth and accelerate adoption in a huge underpenetrated market. in addition, during q4 2021, we expect to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock through either a combination of open-market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. for 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to be above $400 million. capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. this includes our planned investment in our new facility in wroclaw, poland, the first in the emea region. with that, i'll turn it back over to joe for final comments. joe?
joseph m. hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. in summary, q3 was a strong quarter, and we're pleased with our performance across the business. align is uniquely positioned. we have the clinical capability and product portfolio supported by doctor and patient workflows, only accessible through the proprietary align digital platform to address the broadest range of orthodontic cases with the invisalign system through a network of trained invisalign doctors who have the expertise to reach more than the 500 million potential global patients. as we develop our annual plan for 2022 over the next few months, it's important that we continue to expand our commercial, manufacturing, r&d, clinical, treatment planning and manufacturing operations. and continue to leverage our global quality and regulatory muscles in existing and emerging markets. reach millions of consumers who want to transform their smile with the most advanced clear aligner systems in the world.
through advertising, pr, digital, social media and influencer marketing to drive demand and conversion through invisalign-trained doctors. increased ortho adoption and teen utilization of invisalign treatment and train and educate gp dentists on how the itero element family of intraoral scanners and imaging systems propel today's dental practice into the future by enhancing patient experience and elevating clinical precision, and in the benefits of digital dentistry with the invisalign system, trusted by more than 11 million people worldwide to improve their smiles. we remain focused on strategic execution, accountability, agility, customer service excellence and continuing to make investments to grow our business. this is a multivariable equation that we continue to talk about and that, in combination, we remain uniquely able to offer. as we continue to stay the course with our strategic initiatives, we also continue to navigate the covid-19 environment and the challenges and uncertainty that go with it.
throughout the pandemic, our top priority has been consistent, the health and safety of our employees and their families, doctors and their staff and that has not changed. the situation with covid remains very fluid. and with the rise of the delta variant, many cities, states and countries have issued or plan to issue new guidance including mask requirements, regular testing capacity limits and vaccination mandates. operating in this evolving environment is challenging for everyone, and we are staying as close as we can to the situation. the shift from traditional analog wires and brackets to a fully end-to-end digital platform is not easy. it cannot be done without very complex and industry-leading technology and talented, passionate people. but the digital transformation in orthodontics is inevitable.
our technology is prevalent, touching every aspect of what we do for manufacturing excellence, where we currently produce over 750,000 unique aligners a day, to expanding our geographic footprint to over 100 markets, to building a network of over 210,000 trained invisalign doctors and providing the technology to our doctors in a complete digital system, the align digital platform. as the inventor of the leading clear aligner system, we've been investing in this therapy for over 24 years to get it to where it is today. and yet the majority of the market opportunity remains largely untapped, with over 500 million potential cases starts globally, align is in a rare position to address this market with the align digital platform powered by two decades of research and development, manufacturing excellence, clinical data based on more than 11 million patients with ai machine learning and digital tools to help our doctors efficiently communicate with their patients, show and explain any issues and visualize potential treatment options. and together with doctors, we're going to unleash the power of digital for dentistry in orthodontics more than ever. thank you for your time today. i look forward to speaking with you on friday at our investor day. we will share more details on the align digital platform and our vision and strategy to make clear aligner treatment available to everyone through doctors. now i'll turn the call over to our operator for your questions. operator?

thank you. and at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] one moment, please, while we poll for questions. our first question comes from the line of nathan rich with goldman sachs.
please proceed with your question.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks and good afternoon. and joe, thanks for all the details on the outlook. you called out the 300-basis-point headwind from covid in the quarter with the impact, i think, concentrated in december. so maybe a bit higher as we think about what the headwind was exiting the year.
could you maybe talk about how the impact in january as compared to what you experienced in december? and can you maybe elaborate on what you've seen in recent weeks? i'm just looking for a sense of maybe where january is trending and kind of what you're assuming for the balance of the quarter to get you to the guidance that you gave for 1q?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hi, nathan. hey, look, you know, we saw what we talked about december, you know, we had a rapid decrease through covid. but what we've seen as we've gone into january is just progressive improvement. and we feel good about that.
we feel it's moving in the right way. and it's in direct correlation. we track it around the country with, you know, what's going on with omicron in certain states and certain regions. and remember, this isn't just united states.
we've seen this all over the world. we see it in apac, and we see it in europe, too, when we track it. 
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and maybe just building on that at a high level, joe, do you feel like the slowdown, i guess, is primarily a supply issue, just given the practice closures and lockdowns and staffing issues that you cited versus a demand issue? because i think in your prepared remarks, you also mentioned some impacts from inflation and less stimulus. so i'd just be curious to kind of get your thoughts there. 
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
no, you know, we don't see this as a demand issue. i mean we look at the market as we always have. that's why we reasserted our 20%, 30% growth rate for this year. so this is not a demand equation issue.
you'd call it a supply, but i'd call it demand from a patient standpoint. we just see it's patients and doctors in the sense of cancellations, availability, and all those things that covid has impacted around. so we remain very confident. that's why you see us to continue to make investments, the things we announced today.
we feel really good about the business. we just have to get through this first quarter and what we talked about, and we'll move on. we feel really good about it.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good. thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of matt miksic with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
matt miksic -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, thanks so much for taking the question. just maybe a follow-up on that, the question on planning assumptions around your q1 comments and 2022 guidance. maybe, joe, if you could just give a sense as to how -- you mentioned improvements in early january. is this kind of sluggish recovery, you know, wrapping up by the end of the quarter? is q2 the inflection to help you get to that 20% to 30% growth that you mentioned? and then just if i could also on a similar topic.
just the idea that somehow there is -- you've -- i think many of the folks on the call have heard this idea that somehow there was outsized growth during the pandemic, and we're sort of digesting that somehow now, which i know is sort of one of the ways that folks look at align and at aligners and so on. if you could maybe just talk about your confidence that once we get through the staffing that the demand that's in front of you, the growth drivers that you're laying in on top of your core markets, that we're not looking to digest some sort of outsized growth during the pandemic here in '22, but we're getting back to a growth market that's still highly under-penetrated? sorry for the lengthy two-part question, but i would appreciate it.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
we understand the basis of your question, matt. i mean that's not a problem in that sense. look, as i mentioned before, we're really confident in demand equation in the sense of clear aligners and invisalign. you know, what we're experiencing right now is obviously somewhat of a slowdown in our order demand pattern based on what we see through the virus that's going on around the world.
as soon as that clears and we see it clearing around the world, and as i mentioned, we see january improving over december, we're very confident in demand models that we've expressed for this business over the last several years.

hi, guys. thanks so much for the question. i guess on the first side, i think you obviously talked about some of the increased investments that you're making on marketing and also in sales capacity, etc. how do we think about the conversion efforts of those initiatives versus sort of prior, and sort of where do you sort of see that hitting in terms of as we're thinking about the pacing of the year?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. elizabeth, i mean the pacing of the year -- i mean we continue to invest, as we mentioned, john mentioned, i mentioned, too, in marketing. where we invest? we understand the returns that we get, no matter what the country is or what kind of media we use in order to go after consumers. so we've been very consistent in the sense of that investment.
and we move money around based on where we see the most opportunity. john, anything to add?
john morici -- chief financial officer
and we -- as we mentioned, we added some sales resources in q4 to get ahead of, you know, sales territories and changes and so on. we saw that show up in q4, but it really gives us the opportunity then to be able to grow as we get into this year. so it's continued investments to drive the biggest return, and that's what we're continuing to do.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. so it sounds like maybe no change in sort of the pacing that we've been seeing before. maybe as a follow-up, i know you obviously highlighted that the total growth of the company would be in your 20% to 30% range. do you also see that the case growth on a year-over-year basis would be above 20% as you look out at this point?
john morici -- chief financial officer
well, we'd expect them to be similar. when we talk about 20% to 30%, we're talking about revenue for the entire company. but they would be similar from an outlook standpoint.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok, thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, elizabeth.

and our next question comes from the line of jon block with stifel. please proceed with your question.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, guys, great. hey, joe. hey, john. good afternoon.
maybe just the first one. the op margin compression year over year, the 24.7-ish gap that is to the 24%, maybe you could talk to that. john, i was thinking you were just going to say it's a gross margin thing with scanners likely to grow much faster than case. but to elizabeth's question, it seems like you expect both to be within the guardrails of 20% to 30%.
so is it more a function of you guys just sort of, call it, running a little bit harder on the opex line to drive that case volume? and why we would see that year-over-year om compression. again, i'm just sort of referring gap to gap for apples to apples?
john morici -- chief financial officer
i think, jon, it's continued investments like we have with the story to continue to invest that we have and being able to be able to grow into this market. so i think when we look at it overall, we're kind of pegging the gaap rate to be at 24% for 2022, and we'll evaluate and update as we go forward. but it's continuing to invest. we've got, as you know, our poland facility going live in 2022.
and we have some of those moving parts that will impact our gross margin slightly as a result of that. but -- and that translates to op margin. but those are the initiatives that we have, but nothing out of the ordinary that we've done in the past. 
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. heads up, this next one is going to be long, probably two parts. but maybe can you just get people comfortable with the fact that if you look at your 2q, 3q, 4q '21 case files and the implied guidance for 1q, to get to 20% to 30% case volumes for the year, you're going to have to rip sequentially in 2q, 3q, 4q of '22. maybe if you could talk to that? and then the other sort of third question, if you would, admittedly is i'm confused on the 3 points.
so if 4q was impacted by 3 points of growth, why don't we capture, i don't know, 2 or 3 points of that in 1q '22? where are those cases going if they're not showing up in the next possible quarter? thanks, guys. 
john morici -- chief financial officer
i think i'll maybe start with the last part of your question, jon. when you think of what's happened in the world with omicron and the effects of that, it's affecting parts of the world at different phases. you see it even within the u.s. northeast maybe gets hit with it first.
it starts to open up later. after that, maybe other parts of the country get impacted. so it's not like it just happens and you immediately get it back. it comes down to when people are able to go to work, in this case, at doctors' offices, to be able to provide care and then it comes down to when patients feel comfortable to be able to go back in.
and so it's not an immediate effect in how we look at it. so think of -- and what we've learned from kind of covid 1.0, the first time we saw this, we know that there's an impact, and then there's a recovery period. and that's our best view of that recovery period.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
john, on your other part about -- you have to writ the rest of the year, we understand that. i mean we've modeled it out. remember, our comparisons are a little better second half than they were first half when you look at what we did, you know, in 2021 in the first half of the year. so, you know, look, we wouldn't make that prediction if we didn't think it was feasible based on what we've seen and what we've modeled.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
fair enough. thanks, guys.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.

our next question comes from the line of jeff johnson with robert w. baird. please proceed with your question.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hi, jeff.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird -- analyst
thanks, good evening. hey, guys, how are you? just a couple of questions here from me. i guess one, you know, john, in 2021, you guys were talking about being within your lrp, but at the upper end of that. do you want to put any qualifiers on kind of the lrp for 2022? it feels like kind of low end, given where 1q is starting.
but one, do you want to put any qualifiers around where within that lrp you'd expect to be? and two, just to go back to the last two questions again. i feel like i'm talking to my 10-year-old kid here, so apologies. but i'm going to give you one more chance. do you feel like case shipments can still grow within that lrp this year, too, not just revenue? because you've got some of the new products you're selling, plus you've got faster itero growth in that, but case shipments also can be within that 20% to 30% lrp.
i just want to make sure i'm hearing that correctly.
john morici -- chief financial officer
i can answer both of those, jeff, in terms of the 20% to 30%. we're not going to call kind of high/low on that. we're reaffirming our 20% to 30%, similar to what we talked about at investor day despite some of the things that we've talked about here with omicron and some of those covid cases and so on. but when we look at invisalign case volume, we would expect to be in and above that range.
so nothing out of the ordinary from what we expect. we don't see -- our asps were very similar to what they were in the prior quarter. provided that there's no fx or other things that we're not projecting now and if there's no change there, we would expect to be in that range as well.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird -- analyst
fair enough. and then, joe, maybe kind of just update us on kind of the competitive landscape. we've seen a couple of dso contracts get announced here from others in the last few months and, you know, maybe some talk over in china about some growing competition or slowing end markets in that. but, you know, where do you see your end markets across the globe from a competitive standpoint? would just love to hear your update there.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
you know, jeff, i think from a competitive standpoint, nothing has really changed. as we look out there, you can see the tech we just announced this. we move on in the sense of our capabilities, what we can do. my position has always been that competition isn't really affecting us from a price standpoint.
i think you see that and what we're doing. but, you know, they do serve to help to broaden the market and increase the market and make -- and increase the awareness. so we feel we are -- in this kind of competitive environment, we're doing well, and we lead in this sense. and there's nothing as we go into 2022 that i won't reflect on that's changed competitively than what i've seen over the last three years.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird -- analyst
understood. thanks, guys.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer

and our next question comes from the line of john kreger with william blair. please proceed with your question.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
hey, thanks very much, john. john, two quick ones for you. i think you said that the receivable dsos were up about seven days year over year. can you just expand on that? was that -- were you providing some extra inducements to practices or anything to be concerned about there?
john morici -- chief financial officer
nothing to be concerned. you know, we're in a fortunate cash position as a company to be able to generate a lot of cfoa and free cash flow. and in working with doctors to be able to give them more flexibility, sometimes we'll extend payments. but we've actually seen historically low amount of past dues as we've gone through this time period in 2021.
so we feel very comfortable with that. it's just working with doctors to kind of meet their cash flow needs, but nothing out of the ordinary.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
ok. great. thanks. and then one other one to clarify.
i think you said that you expect the ebit margin to be under 20% in the first quarter. was that gaap or non-gaap?
john morici -- chief financial officer
that's gaap.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
thank you.
john morici -- chief financial officer

our next question comes from the line of jason bednar with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions today. hey, there. you know, joe, just real quick, and i asked whether you can confirm, you said january improved over december.
i thought i heard you say that earlier in the call. or is it just that the january trend line showed improvement as the month unfolded? sorry for just clarifying that something nuance like that here.
john morici -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think to clarify, jason, you know, the month end showed improvement versus december. it was -- you know, it's how covid spreads across, whether it's, you know, one country or parts of countries and so on and how it affects the staff and how it affects the patients in. but as we exited, we're in a better trend line than we started the month with.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. understood. thanks for that. and then maybe as a follow-up to an earlier question, really for joe or john.
i know you often talk about the internal investments you keep making in the business. you talked about running a similar growth algorithm here in '22 as you have in the past. but we also have two different case examples here of the market. with pre-covid, a lot of those resources were helping funding faster growth in your team business.
and then the last 18 months during the pandemic, adult demand has really taken off and growing faster than teens. so i guess my question here is, as you went through your year-end planning and you're obviously resourcing this business in another significant way here in '22, how do you approach it for this year? is it from a sales force add, marketing plan, and whatnot? is it -- are you -- really with respect to how you're thinking about the adult and teen mix that you're expecting for this year?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
i mean we're -- it's joe, jason. i mean there's no big change in the sense of what we think the critical drivers are that we have to invest in to drive growth. where we invest and how we invest is really important. when you look at technology, when you look at consumer pieces, however parts of those demand inflations you want to go to.
but remember, there are certain ratios that we always hold to in this business is that what we invest in. and we hold ourselves accountable for those ratios and that performance from a profitability standpoint. but i can't overstate the importance of having a strong sales force. we talked about additional salespeople we're putting in place.
our consumer brand means a lot in the sense of our growth. and that's becoming more and more sophisticated in the sense of where we spend those dollars and how we spend those dollars. but leading in technology, you have to have technology in this business. and that's why we're excited to really announce what we did today.
we've been working on these programs for three years or more. and these are game breakers in the sense of how you interface with a doctor and how a doctor interfaces with patients.
john morici -- chief financial officer
and i would just add to that, jason. we're investing with that return on investment in mind. that's how we look at our long-term growth model. and when we make investments, we have that in mind.
in some countries, you're going deeper, you're adding more salespeople to get closer to doctors and really trying to drive that utilization. in other areas where you don't have a direct sales force, you're just adding and just trying to get the breadth in there. and then we've been talking about a lot of the marketing activities and other things that we do to drive that awareness in some of those markets and coupled with the research and development investments. some of it, operations, again, to get closer to our customers like in poland.
so it's a multitude of investments, but we look at it with how do we generate the best return, and there's multiple different ways that we do it across these functions.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. very helpful. thanks much.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
thanks, jason. operator, we'll take one more call, please.
operator
sure. the last question we have is from the line of brandon couillard with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks for squeezing me in. john, you've talked about freight costs for a few quarters now. any chance, you know, you're planning a list price increase this year to help offset some of that? it's been a few years since you've taken less pricing?
john morici -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's a good question. and we are seeing freight -- you know, it looks like many companies have. we have a lot of plans in place to drive productivity. the operating team is very aware of our cost inputs and where we can drive productivity, getting closer to our customers, like we talk in poland.
once we get there, that will be a freight saving. and once we're operational there, and that will help. but we haven't really finalized any plans on a price increase. we'll evaluate as we go through.
and the first people that we talk to would be our customers. but you're right, we understand the price is important, but we're also very sensitive to our customers and what they've had to go through as we've been on this covid journey. so nothing in the works now.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and then joe, on itero, i appreciate the detail as far as more than 50% of placements being new buyers. i would actually expect that to be normally the case. so what's the relevancy of that metric? is that up a lot compared to historical levels? and what percent of those placements are being used for invisalign case submissions?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
you know, over the years, you know, brandon, we've obviously seen that correlation, and we've communicated it to you in the sense if you sell more itero scanners, you sell more invisalign. and that's, you know, obviously the front end of our digital system, and it works, you know, for us really well. we just set aside the 50% because, one, you saw we had a very strong fourth quarter for itero. and we always have strong fourth quarters.
so this was exceptional in that sense. and it was a good signal from the practices that we're dealing with that this had to do with, you know, the day-to-day flow that you see from an invisalign patient standpoint. it had nothing to do with, you know, their enthusiasm in the sense of embracing the digital environment that we're talking about. so to see the number of sales that we had really in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, it was just a good signal for us.
and we wanted to share that with you is that this market is embracing digital even when it's under pressure. and we're performing really well in that area. as far as 50%, whatever and how -- i don't know exactly what the historical percentages are in that way. but we're -- obviously, what we're excited about is once those scanners are in place, it gives us a good foundation to sell invisalign.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks.

shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
thank you. good afternoon and thank you for joining us. i'm shirley stacy, vice president of corporate communications and investor relations. joining me for today's call is joe hogan, president and ceo; and john morici, cfo.
we issued fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results today via globenewswire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately one month. the telephone replay will be available today by approximately 5:30 p.m. eastern time through 5:30 p.m.

and with that, i'll turn the call over to align technology's president and ceo, joe hogan. joe? 
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, shirley. good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. on our call today, i'll provide some highlights from the fourth quarter, then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, services systems and clear aligners. john will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook.
following that, i'll come back, summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. overall, i'm very pleased to report fourth quarter results and another record year -- full year for align. net revenues of $4 billion and operating margin of 24.7% were both at the high end of our guidance for fiscal 2021. for systems and services, full year revenues increased 90.4% over the prior year to a record $705.5 million.
for clear aligners, full year revenues increased 54.5% over the prior year to a record $3.2 billion. during 2021, we achieved several major installed base milestones, including our 12 millionth invisalign patient, 68,000 itero scanners sold and 47,000 exocad software license install. together, these elements are the foundation of the align digital platform, proprietary combination of software, systems and services designed to provide a seamless experience and workflow that integrates and connects all users, doctors, labs, patients, and consumers. for q4, revenues reflect continued strong growth and momentum from itero scanner services revenues, particularly in north america, offset by lower-than-expected invisalign clear aligner revenues.
through most of the fourth quarter, our clear aligner volumes were trending in line with our q4 seasonality. however, the environment quickly changed in december with the rise of covid-19 omicron variant. we believe our q4 clear aligner volumes were impacted by an increase in covid-19 omicron cases that caused customer lab shortages from a staff standpoint, practice closures or reduced hours and less patient traffic in december, and that continued into q1. this compounded an already slower seasonal period for many practices in which offices took time off in between the holidays.
we estimate that our q4 was negatively impacted by roughly three points of year-over-year revenue growth as a result of these factors. while there are some similarities to what we experienced two years ago when covid-19 first appeared, especially in china, which currently has a zero-tolerance covid policy, the environment today is different. there aren't broad government-mandated shutdowns, stay-at-home orders, or extended quarantines, but there is more consumer caution, self-imposed quarantines, higher inflation, less economic stimulus, and supply chain shortages, which makes it more difficult to predict when recovery may occur. nonetheless, invisalign doctor submitters and case submissions are improving.
we're working closely with our customers to support their needs and protect the health and safety of our employees. for q4, systems and services revenues were up 61.3% year over year and up 21% sequentially, with strong revenue growth across all regions. q4 results reflect the continued adoption of the itero element 5d plus imaging system, which we launched last year and that features innovative technology like near-infrared technology which aids in the detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities above the gingiva without harmful radiation. the itero element 5d plus imaging system represents 75% of itero volumes in q4.
in addition, over 50% of itero scanner sales in q4 were sold to first-time scanner buyers who are just beginning their align digital platform journey. we also continue to see growth in our itero scanner installed base with strong service revenues, which historically have been a leading indicator of increased digital adoption among doctors. for q4, clear aligner revenues were up 16.3% year over year with strong revenue growth across all regions and across the portfolio, including comprehensive and noncomprehensive products, as well as invisalign first, invisalign moderate, and invisalign go products. our fourth quarter revenues also include noncase revenue for clinical training and education, doctor prescribed retainer products, and other dental consumables.
during the quarter, we saw good performance from our retainer business overall, delivering strong revenue growth, along with increased enthusiasm for the doctor subscription program pilot in north america. as we mentioned last quarter, our share of the retention market is significantly under-penetrated, even more so than our share of the orthodontic case starts. we have been developing a robust retainer strategy, including a separate marketing team focused solely on driving adoption and increasing market share in the u.s. our objective is to build brand awareness for vivera retainers and drive engagement with doctors through clinical education and sales initiatives while connecting consumers to doctors through demand creation programs and our concierge service.
we've also recently implemented social media campaigns featuring the benefit of vivera from the makers of invisalign clear aligners. we believe that incremental investments will increase value for invisalign practices and contribute to growth consistent with our long-term financial model target. q4 noncase revenues also include accessories and consumables such as aligner cases, clamshells, cleaning crystals, invisalign whitening pen, and other oral health products that are available on our e-commerce channel, including the invisalign accessory store, walmart.com and amazon.com. we view these ancillary products as a natural brand extension, enabling patient and doctor behavior with the power of the invisalign brand.
our full year results reflect continued adoption and demand for both the invisalign system and itero systems and services and exocad cad/cam software as more doctors transform their practices to digital and more consumers seek to transform their smiles through doctor-directed invisalign treatment. now let's turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter results, starting with the americas. for the americas region, full year 2021 invisalign case volumes were up 57.6%. for q4, invisalign case volumes were up 11.5% year over year, reflecting growth across the region, especially in latam.
on a sequential basis, americas shipments were down 7.9%, primarily reflecting the impact of omicron previously described, as well as a seasonally slower teen season from q3 to q4. we also saw higher gp and adult case volume and continued momentum from our doctor subscription plan pilot. in q4, we pledged a $1 million donation to the american association of orthodontists foundation, the charitable arm of the american association of orthodontists in support of the science of orthodontics. we're also investing in education grants, programs to provide universities with greater access to all align products for education and training purposes.
through these programs, our partnership with the aligner intensive fellowship and the other in-person educational programs, we are investing in the orthodontic profession through the people who care for and treat patients directly. for systems and services, q4 was a strong quarter for americas, driven by continued adoption of itero 5d plus imaging system across customer channels, including our dso partners. services revenues continue to grow nicely, reflecting the growth of the itero scanner installed base in north america. for the full year, international invisalign case volume was up 51.6%.
for our international business, q4 invisalign case volumes were up 10.7% year over year on tough comps compared to 2020. on a sequential basis, international shipments were up 1.7%. notwithstanding the impact of omicron in december, we still saw strong growth in emea, offset somewhat by a seasonally slower period primarily in china. for the full year, emea invisalign volume was up 69.5%.
for emea, q4 invisalign case volumes were up 14.9% year over year, with broad-based growth across all markets, led by italy and iberia, along with continued growth in our expansion markets in turkey, russia, cis, and benelux. for q4, year-over-year invisalign case volume in emea was driven by increased submissions primarily from the orthodontist channel. on a sequential basis, despite the impact of omicron, emea invisalign case volume was up 13.6%, primarily as a result of strong ortho channel performance, especially in the teen market. during q4, we began commercial operation in africa, with our initial focus on north africa and then plan to enter sub-sahara africa and south africa this year, further broadening our expansion markets in emea.
it's exciting opportunity for align in this untapped and expanding totally addressable market. we're also making great progress on building our europe and manufacturing facility in wroclaw, poland, which will be our third global aligner manufacturing operation. the europe manufacturing facility is on track to go live during the first half of 2022, further increasing our ability to efficiently provide the invisalign system to our valued doctor customers within the european region. for q4, we saw strong scanner shipments during the quarter as more doctors in the emea region continue to digitize their practices.
through a full year apac, invisalign case volume was up 27.1%. for q4, apac invisalign case volumes led by japan, korea, and india were up 3.4% year over year on tough comps despite continued covid resurgences and lockdown sporadically impacting various apac countries, including china. we also saw strength in the gp dentist channel with increased invisalign submitters and in the teen market with increased submissions from the orthodontic channel. on a sequential basis, apac was down 15.4%, notwithstanding the impact of omicron in december and q4 seasonality in china.
we had strong growth in thailand, southeast asia, taiwan. overall, it was encouraging to see record numbers of shipments to those markets in apac that were not as impacted by the most severe lockdowns. in q4, systems and services in apac saw the highest percentage of itero scanners sold to new doctors. today, we announced new invisalign systems innovations for the align digital platform, a proprietary combination of software, systems and services designed to provide a seamless experience and workflow that integrates and connects all users, doctors, labs, patients, and consumers.
these new innovations include clincheck live update for 3d controls; the invisalign practice app; invisalign personalized plan, or ipp; and the invisalign smile architect. we believe they will revolutionize digital treatment planning for orthodontics and restorative dentistry by providing doctors with greater flexibility, consistency of treatment preferences, and real-time treatment planning access and modification capabilities. each of these innovations is designed to enhance invisalign treatment planning quality, efficiency and scale and contribute to better doctor-patient engagement and treatment outcomes. clincheck live update for 3d controls enables real-time clincheck treatment plan modifications that improve practice productivity significantly while also improving quality of treatment plans.
invisalign practice app provides mobile integration with the invisalign doctor site or ids. it enables doctors to manage their practices at their fingertips. invisalign's personal plan, or ipp, automatically applies a doctor's specific treatment preferences for comprehensive cases, enhancing efficiency and step-changing treatment planning consistency. invisalign smile architect software is designed for gp dentists to create and visualize orthodontic restorative treatment plans for their patients using itero digital scans and wide smile photos on the invisalign go platform.
the technical design assessment go-to-market is scheduled for q4 '22. we know that every invisalign-trained doctor has distinct preferences. every patient is unique, and every treatment plan can vary depending on a variety of factors such as the type of malocclusion, patient age, and desired outcome. because of that, doctors spend time planning, reviewing, and modifying their clincheck plans, and it multiplies with practice growth.
ipp and clincheck live update for 3d controls are game-changing innovations that represent a step-change in digital treatment planning to help doctors achieve more personalized clincheck treatment plans. by using 3d controls, doctors can see greater efficiency with changes reflected in real time. invisalign smile architect combines basically driven in ortho restorative treatment planning within the power of clincheck software, providing flexibility across treatment planning to address a variety of patient needs, whether it may be orthodontic, restorative, or ortho restorative combined. it allows doctors to share their vision with patients and use digital technology and tools to achieve the best quality clinical outcomes for their patients.
it's through the convergence of advancements in digital technology, align's unique capabilities and know-how and data from millions of invisalign patients that we're able to bring these new invisalign innovations to our customers this year. the journey to deliver a clincheck live update in invisalign personal plan has taken thousands of combined person years of development, testing, and learning. it is only possible through the experience, data, and insights we have gained from over 12 million invisalign cases. across our innovations, we're also using a combination of ai and automation to reimagine what the treatment planning experience looks like for our doctors, doctor customers and augmenting their expertise and experience to help them create and personalize and modify invisalign treatment plans more efficiently and more consistently than ever before.
what used to take several days can now be accomplished in just a few minutes. and it's a huge productivity win for doctors and their patients. our consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the invisalign system and driving that demand to invisalign doctors' offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. consumer interest in the invisalign brand remains high, and we are continuing to invest in building the brand in key markets and customer segments.
this includes investments in social media as an effective channel to increase awareness and interest for invisalign treatment. we're continuing to work closely with our media partners to reach consumers with the right creative and compelling campaigns, optimize our buys and test new approaches. in q4, we continued to build on our successful ""invis is"" multimedia campaign across the americas, emea, and apac and drove awareness and interest in invisalign treatment with adult, teen, and parent consumer segments. globally, we delivered record impression volume with over 8 billion impressions, representing 84% year-over-year growth; and 21.7 million unique visitors to our website, a 127% increase year over year.
in the u.s., we amplified our campaigns across the top social media platforms such as tiktok, snapchat, instagram, and youtube to increase awareness with teens about invisalign treatment. our campaigns continue to feature some of the largest teen influencers from our invisalign smile squad, such as collins and devan key, charli d'amelio, and michael le, each of whom share their personal experiences with invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smiles with invisalign aligners. our consumer marketing programs also include connecting with teams within gaming, specifically on twitch, with a customized integration that was awarded the gold medal in the annual internationalist awards for innovation in digital marketing solutions. to continue growing our young adult business across the americas, emea, and apac, we built upon our successful ""invis is a powerful thing"" campaign, which highlights the power of invisalign treatment transformation for every young adult's self-confidence.
our integrated media plans across youtube, snapchat, instagram, facebook, and tiktok connected with young adults in the media channels they consume the most. in brazil, we continue to amplify our ""invis is a powerful thing"" campaign, featuring mega influencer, taã­s araujo, driving a 400% year-over-year increase in web traffic. in the emea region, we successfully expanded into new markets such as italy and the netherlands. to complement our integrated media plan with google and youtube, we also leveraged newer media channels such as tiktok and snapchat to drive engagement with consumers, resulting in more than 170% year-over-year increase in unique visitors.
we continue to expand our investment in consumer advertising across the apac region, resulting in a 192% year-over-year increase in unique visitors and a 235% year-over-year increase in impressions. we continue to strengthen our investments in australia, leveraging leading influencers featured in premium placements in tiktok and also youtube. in japan, we continue to see strong response from consumers, as evidenced by 117% year-over-year increase in unique visitors. lastly, we expanded our advertising investments in india and taiwan, which generated a strong consumer response.
we saw 1,200% and 628% increase in impressions and a 470% and 116% increase in unique visitors to our website in india and taiwan, respectively. adoption of our consumer and patient app, my invisalign, continues to increase with 1.4 million downloads to date. usage of our four digital tools continues to increase. for example, in addition to my invisalign just mentioned, the invisalign virtual appointment tool was used over 14,000 times, and our insurance verification feature was used 24,000 times in q4.
further, globally, we received more than 45,000 patient photos in our virtual care feature globally, which continues to provide us with rich data to leverage our ai capabilities and improve our services for doctors and patients. our systems and services business, q4 revenues grew 61.3% year over year, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services up 21% sequentially. this is the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth for our systems and services business. and as i mentioned earlier, over 50% of scanner sales in q4 went to first-time itero scanner buyers.
we're pleased to see doctors continue to go digital and invest in the align digital platform. the itero element 5d plus imaging system continued to gain traction across all regions, with the most recent launch in china during q4. the series expands the portfolio of itero element scanners and imaging systems to include new solutions that more broadly serve the needs of doctors and patients in the dental market. a strong indicator of digital acceleration within the dental offices is the number of intraoral digital scans used for invisalign case submissions.
total worldwide intraoral digital scans submitted to start an invisalign case in q4 increased to 85.4% from 79.3% in q4 last year. international intraoral digital scans for invisalign case submissions increased 80.8%, up from 73.7% in the same quarter last year. for the americas, 89.1% of the invisalign cases were submitted using an intraoral digital scan compared to 84% in the same quarter last year. cumulatively, over 50 million orthodontic scans and 10.3 million restorative scans have been performed with itero scanners.
with the continued growth of the itero scanner at 68,000 scanners sold worldwide as of q4, approximately 30% is services revenue, which includes reoccurring revenue subscriptions, cad/cam software, and ancillary products. and we continue to make improvements in our scanner and imaging systems, making itero systems and service an integral part of orthodontic and gp dentist workflow. for example, we streamlined the invisalign case submission process with the itero element 5d imaging systems auto-upload functionality. turning to exocad.
for q4 systems and services, revenues also include exocad cad/cam products and services. exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery, and smile design extends our digital dental solutions and broadens align digital platform toward a fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows. cumulatively, as of q4, exocad now has over 47,000 software licenses worldwide. during the quarter, exocad announced the release of chairsidecad 3.0 galway.
it's a next generation of easy-to-use cad software for single-visit dentistry. with this new release, exocad offers dentists design tools for a vast range of indications with a wide choice of integrated devices. also during the quarter, exocad announced the availability of chairsidecad 3.0 galway software in the u.s. and canada, where the software is now available in north america, eu, and other selected markets.
exocad's chairsidecad is groundbreaking open-architecture cad software for single-visit dentistry. it received the 2021 cellerant best of class technology award from cellerant consulting group during the quarter as well. this is the third consecutive year that chairsidecad has been recognized for this award. with that, i'll now turn this over to john.
john morici -- chief financial officer
thanks, joe. now for our q4 financial results. total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.031 billion, up 1.5% from the prior quarter and up 23.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. for clear aligners, q4 revenues of $815.3 million were down 2.7% sequentially due to lower invisalign volumes, partially offset by slightly higher asps; and up 16.3% year over year, reflecting invisalign volume growth across all geographies and higher asps.
in q4, we shipped 631,100 invisalign cases, a decrease of 3.7% sequentially, an increase of 11.1% year over year. in addition, we shipped to 83,500 invisalign doctors worldwide, of which over 6,400 were to first-time customers. q4 comprehensive volume increased 13.1% year over year and decreased 4.5% sequentially. and q4 noncomprehensive volume increased 6.6% year over year and decreased 1.7% sequentially.
q4 adult patients increased 10.4% year over year and increased 0.1% sequentially. in q4, teens or younger patients increased 13% year over year and decreased 11.8% sequentially. clear aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $11.4 million or approximately 1.4 points sequentially. on a year-over-year basis, clear aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.5 million or approximately 0.2 points.
for q4, invisalign comprehensive asps increased sequentially and year over year. on a sequential basis, invisalign comprehensive asps reflect higher additional liners, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts. on a year-over-year basis, comprehensive asps reflect higher additional aligners, partially offset by higher discounts. q4 invisalign noncomprehensive asps decreased sequentially and increased year over year.
on a sequential basis, invisalign noncomprehensive asps were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional aligners. on a year-over-year basis, invisalign noncomprehensive asps reflect higher additional aligners and product mix, partially offset by higher discounts. clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $68.5 million or 6.9% sequentially and $332.9 million or 45.8% year over year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. our systems and services revenues for the fourth quarter were a record $215.8 million, up 21% sequentially and up 61.3% year over year.
this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. the increase sequentially can be attributed to increased scanner shipments and increased service revenues from our larger installed base. the increase year over year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, increased service revenues from our larger installed base, as well as higher asps from the favorable mix shift toward higher-priced itero 5d scanners and imaging systems. our systems and services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up $42.6 million or 22.8% sequentially and up $116.2 million or 102.6% year over year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of services revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period.
moving on to gross margin. fourth quarter overall gross margin was 72.2%, down 2.1 points sequentially and down 0.9 points year over year. on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, overall gross margin was 72.6% for the fourth quarter, down 2.1 points sequentially and down 0.9 points year over year. overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.1 points on a year-over-year basis and by approximately 0.4 points sequentially due to foreign exchange.
clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74.2%, down 2 points sequentially due to higher freight costs and additional aligners, along with lower primary shipments, partially offset by higher asps. clear aligner gross margin was down 0.6 points year over year due to higher additional aligners and higher freight costs, partially offset by higher asps and improved manufacturing absorption due to higher volumes. systems and services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.7%, down 0.9 points sequentially, primarily due to higher freight costs and increased component costs, partially offset by higher asp from 5d plus mix and higher service revenues. systems and services gross margin was up 0.4 points year over year due to higher asp from higher mix of itero 5d plus and higher service revenues, partially offset by higher freight costs and increased component costs.
we are actively engaged in activities to mitigate supply disruptions by expanding supplier communications, modifying our purchase order coverage, and increasing inventory levels for key components. q4 operating expenses were $523.7 million, up sequentially 6% and up 31.8% year over year. on a sequential basis, operating expenses were up by $29.7 million. year-over-year operating expenses increased by $126.4 million, reflecting increased headcount and our continued investment in marketing, sales, in r&d activities, and other investments commensurate with business growth.
on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $494.4 million, up sequentially 6.1% and up 32.8% year over year due to the reasons described earlier. our fourth quarter operating income of $220.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 21.4%, down 4.3 points sequentially and down 4.1 points year over year. the sequential and year-over-year decreases in operating margin are primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology, as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 24.7%, down 4.1 points sequentially and down 4.3 points year over year.
interest and other income and expense net for the fourth quarter was a loss of $0.9 million, down sequentially by $1.7 million and down year over year by $2.2 million. the gaap tax rate for the fourth quarter was 13.2%, compared to 30.9% in the third quarter and 25.9% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. our non-gaap effective tax rate was 11.5% in the fourth quarter, compared to 22.2% in the third quarter and 14.5% in the fourth quarter of the prior fourth quarter. the fourth quarter gaap and non-gaap effective tax rates reflected an out-of-period adjustment, which reduced our tax rates by 7.3% and 6.3%, respectively.
fourth quarter net income per diluted share was $2.40, up sequentially $0.12 and up $0.40 compared to the prior year. on a non-gaap basis, net income per diluted share was $2.83 for the fourth quarter, down $0.04 sequentially and up $0.22 year over year. for the full year, net income per diluted share was $9.69, down $12.72 year over year due to the one-time tax benefit in 2020 of approximately $1.5 billion associated with our corporate structure reorganization completed during the first quarter of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, net income per diluted share was $11.22 for the full year, up $5.97 year over year.
moving on to the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1.3 billion, up sequentially $58.8 million, and up $335.8 million year over year. of our $1.3 billion balance, $582.9 million was held in the u.s. and $713.8 million was held by our international entities.
q4 accounts receivable balance was $897.2 million, up approximately 4.9% sequentially. our overall days sales outstanding was 78 days, up approximately three days sequentially and up approximately seven days as compared to q4 last year. cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $272.8 million. capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $109.1 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities.
free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $163.8 million. in november 2021, we purchased $100 million of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase, which was approximately 0.2 million shares at an average price of $666.53 per share. we have approximately $725 million remaining available for repurchase under our may 13, 2021, $1 billion repurchase program. before i move to our outlook, i would like to make a few comments on our full year 2021 results.
in 2021, we shipped a record 2.5 million invisalign cases, up 54.8% year over year. this reflects 51.6% volume growth from our international doctors and 57.6% volume growth from our americas doctors. total revenues were a record $4 billion, up 59.9% year over year, with clear aligner revenues a record $3.2 billion, up 54.5% year over year. 2021 systems and services revenue were a record $705.5 million, compared to $370.5 million in 2020, up 90.4% year over year.
full year 2021 gaap operating income of $976.4 million was up 152.2% versus 2020, and operating margin at 24.7% versus 15.7% in 2020. on a non-gaap basis, 2021 operating margin was 27.9% versus 20.3% in 2020. 2021 interest income and other income and expense net of $36 million included the smiledirectclub arbitration award gain of $43.4 million. excluding the smiledirectclub arbitration award gain, interest and other income and expense was $7.4 million expense on a non-gaap basis.
with regards to full year tax provision, our gaap tax rate was 23.7%. the full year tax rate on a non-gaap basis was 18.5%, compared to 17.6% for 2020. 2021 diluted eps was $9.69. on a non-gaap basis, 2021 diluted eps was $11.22.
free cash flow was $771.4 million for 2021, up $264.2 million versus 2020. overall, we are pleased with our q4 results and another record year for align. we delivered strong growth and profitability, in line with our guidance despite disruptions late in the quarter from omicron and other factors. our q4 revenue year-over-year growth was within our long-term model despite disruptions impacting roughly 3 points of growth.
we continue to see strong momentum and demand for our systems and services throughout q4, with the majority of scanners being sold to first-time buyers. we believe this is a good leading indicator of future invisalign growth as our customers continue to invest in digital technology even during covid. let me turn to our outlook. we would normally expect sequentially higher invisalign revenues and lower systems and services revenue, consistent with the typical q1 seasonality.
however, due to the continued impact of omicron into q1, we now expect our total q1 revenue to be slightly down sequentially. we remain confident in our strategy, our huge under-penetrated market opportunity, our industry leadership, and our ability to execute. these factors have guided our approach throughout the pandemic, where we continued to invest in new technology, commercial expansion, and manufacturing capabilities to drive our growth. we plan to continue these investments in q1 and therefore expect our q1 operating margin to be less than 20%.
in addition, during q1 2022, we expect to repurchase up to $75 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. turning to full year 2022. despite omicron headwinds, we expect 2022 revenue growth to be in line with our long-term model range of 20% to 30%. our 2022 guidance assumes no significant new covid surges after the current wave, no meaningful practice disruptions, no material supply chain issues throughout the year.
on a gaap basis, we anticipate our 2022 operating margin to be around 24%. on a non-gaap basis, we expect 2022 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our gaap operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization from certain acquisitions. for 2022, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $350 million. capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements, as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion.
this includes our planned investment in a clear aligner manufacturing facility in wroclaw, poland, which is expected to begin serving doctors in 2022 as part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to customers. with that, i'll turn it back over to joe for final comments. joe? 
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. overall, despite the disruption from the omicron in december, we delivered a record year with strong revenue growth and operating margin, in line with our guidance for the full year on top of a record q4 and 2020 a year ago. as we look back, i wanted to take a moment to recognize our accomplishments and thank our employees and our customers for another remarkable year. in the face of ongoing challenges related to covid-19 and economic uncertainty, we remain steadfast in our commitment to our employees, customers, and the focused execution of our strategic initiatives.
and our customers remain confident in our ability to support them. operating in this environment has not been easy, but after two years of navigating uncharted waters, the align team is more agile and resilient than ever. in 2021, we met our goals and achieved numerous milestones. globally, we delivered across each of our strategic priorities, which are highlighted in our q4 '21 webcast slides.
our performance over the last year reaffirms the incredible size of our target market and demonstrates that our strategy and investment in recent years are validated by the trust and faith our customers place in us. in 2022, we must continue to extend our leadership in digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry through relentless execution of our strategic initiatives, focusing on expanding our commercial, manufacturing, r&d, clinical, treatment planning, and manufacturing operations and building our quality and regulatory muscle globally in existing and emerging markets, reaching millions of consumers who want to transform their smiles using the most advanced clear aligner systems in the world through the right investments in advertising, pr, digital, social media and influencer marketing to drive demand and conversion through invisalign trained doctors. invisalign ortho adoption and teen utilization of invisalign treatment and training and educating gp dentists on how the itero element family of intraoral scanners and imaging systems can propel today's dental practice into the future by enhancing patient experience and elevating clinical precision and on the benefits of digital dentistry with the invisalign system trusted by more than 12 million people worldwide to transform smiles. we remain mindful of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding covid-19 and the challenges that go with it.
while there is still uncertainty, it has become increasingly clear over the last year, with the first spread of the delta variant and now omicron, that covid-19 may never fully go away and may be a virus that persists in one variant form or another for the foreseeable future. and like other viruses, new or different vaccines will be needed and new therapies will be developed to minimize the impact and treat covid-19 more effectively in our most vulnerable populations. the reality of living with covid is one of the government's businesses and communities all over the world are beginning to acknowledge and move toward. at align, we will do the same.
in closing, i'm going to share some thoughts that i expressed to our employees recently. what we learn in life, both in business and our personal lives, is that we're not fully in control of our environment and destiny. this is a fact of life that we face every day. but not being in control does not mean that we can't make good choices regardless of the situation or challenges we all face.
we must look forward focused on the opportunities. align has numerous growth drivers in a vastly under-penetrated market. and while we continue to see some lasting impact and continued uncertainty due to covid-19, we remain confident in both the enormous opportunity to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry. we never forget that digital orthodontics presents the fastest growing and largest market in the world of medical devices.
we have the greatest clear aligner system, scanners, gp lab software in the world, and the broadest and deepest digital dental platform. we have the most recognized consumer brand in the largest direct sales force in the dental space with over 4,000 salespeople supporting over 212,000 doctors and labs and their staff who have incredible skills and dedication to their patients. we have an amazing team of employees committed to our purpose. it's a unique opportunity unlike anything i've ever seen in my career to both continue to grow align and be part of the positively changing millions of lives by transforming their smiles.
thank you for your time today. we look forward to speaking to you again as the year progresses. now i'll turn the call over to the operator. operator?

excuse me. joe hogan, are you there?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. i'll run by this again. ok. that was my fault.
overall, our first quarter results reflect a more challenging environment than expected. we know that covid lockdowns, weaker consumer confidence, inflationary pressures, and the russia-ukraine conflict have created headwinds. but we remain excited and committed to realizing the enormous opportunity in front of us to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry. with less than 10% share of the 21 million orthodontic case starts each year with over 500 million people globally who can benefit from a healthy, beautiful smile, our market is as large as ever.
no other company is as well-positioned as us to take advantage of that potential as the environment improves and growth trends return. we will continue to focus on the execution of our strategic growth drivers while managing investments in the near term to account for the headwinds and uncertainty, and we remain confident in our long-term revenue growth model of 20% to 30%. before we open the call to questions, i want to address the military conflict in the ukraine and our operations in russia. it's a human tragedy for all people involved, and our thoughts go out to everyone impacted and especially to those with personal connections who are undoubtedly concerned with their families and loved ones.
our primary concern remains the safety and security of our employees and their families, our doctors, their staff, and patients. we have nothing to do with this conflict. as a global medical device provider of doctor-prescribed products, continuity of care is critical to the doctors and their patients in orthodontic treatment. we discontinued commercial activities in russia that are not essential to providing continuity of care to patients.
our focus on only essential activities is consistent with our values and ethical responsibility to patients in treatment. in the process, we're also adhering to the international sanctions that have been imposed. our it infrastructure, including code and intellectual property, is hosted outside of russia. prior to the conflict, we had begun expanding our r&d teams in darmstadt, germany; madrid, spain; toronto, canada, and austin, texas.
and we're prudently working with the team on the ground in russia on work visas. a number of our russian employees have already transitioned and are in various stages of transitioning their families to armenia, where we've set up an r&d center in yerevan to support those who choose to relocate. at the same time, it's humbling to see the tremendous outpouring of kindness and support throughout the company as our employees respond to the humanitarian needs of the crisis. our polish team members has set up donation centers at our facilities where employees are contributing food, clothing, supplies, and human care.
many are also taking ukrainian refugees into their homes. and we're proud of the tremendous initiative by our colleagues and are grateful for their actions. in addition to our employees' efforts, align is donating $300,000 to support humanitarian relief efforts through organizations providing shelter, food, medicines, and vital supplies. we can only hope that the conflict in ukraine will end soon, that the ongoing impact of the pandemic will lessen for good, and that economic factors facing many customers and consumers will abate.
but these things are beyond our control, so we will continue to prioritize the health and safety of employees, customers, and patients and will stay focused on strategic initiatives. in closing, april 3 marked the 25th anniversary of the founding of align technology and, shortly thereafter, the launch of the invisalign system. over the past 25 years, we've transformed the orthodontic industry with a passion for innovation as we've evolved from leading the evolution from digital appliances to digital platform. we've created an incredible company unlike any other.
invisalign is a unique mass customization business operating in real time with no inventory or distribution at the front end of our market. consequently, fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment are felt faster at align than i've ever experienced anywhere in my career. and we monitor these trends to make adjustments in our business when needed. our success is a result of our vision and purpose and resolve.
thanks to our employees and our doctor customers around the world who took a chance on a silicon valley start-up and risked everything. today, align is the largest 3d printing operation in the world, producing 1 million customized aligners each day based on the learnings gained from nearly 13 million invisalign patients and 60 million itero digital scans. our global team of over 25,000 employees support more than 250,000 doctors and labs in more than 150 countries. there are more than 500 million people in the world that can benefit from orthodontic procedures.
it's huge. and you can only address opportunities of that size with digital orthodontics. it could never happen using old analog methods. as we have digitized that capability, it has opened up a market broadly for orthodontic treatment to the masses.
it's hard to believe that after 25 years, we're still in the early phases of transforming the orthodontic market. we look forward to sharing more milestones over the next 25 years as we continue to lead the digital evolution of orthodontics and dentistry, deliver great treatment outcomes and treatment experiences to doctors and patients around the world. thank you for your time today. i'll now turn it over to the operator for questions.
operator?
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the first question is from the line of jason bednar with piper sandler. you may proceed.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hey, jason.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking the questions. so joe, i guess, just to start with you, i mean, you and john called out the consumer confidence items and the inflationary pressures impacting the business. the wind shifting pretty abruptly on you.
i guess, are there tools you have at your disposal to manage through these pressures? or is this a matter of just keeping your head down, waiting for the macro environment to settle down? i guess really just trying to get a sense of how we should be moderating expectations from what's typical sequential growth we would see from the business?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes, jason, good question. i'd say being a global business, we talked about having 50% of our revenues outside, it just gives us good scope in the sense to take advantage where opportunities are. and so i feel really good about the company in that sense. and we've made great development over the last three years from an international standpoint.
we also have a great portfolio. we have itero scanners. we talked about some reluctance in the sense that we saw at the end of the first quarter of some doctors to really commit to it. but i mean that demand is still out there.
when you look at itero scanners are so under-penetrated still when you look at digital dentistry and what the future really brings. and so pushing that and pushing it in the right places, and also, you see the expansion of our invisalign technology and what we're doing in different areas, too. so i feel like we have a lot of levers that we can pull, but we are constrained by these headwinds that we've seen. and obviously, we'll respect those and make the kind of adjustments needed to make sure this business stays on track.
but look, i love our portfolio. i love our position. i see a great future. we'll manage our way through this, jason.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. all right. that's helpful. and then maybe shifting over to the margin side.
you're not stepping off the gas with spending. i wouldn't expect you to, given the opportunity that you're talking about here today and you've talked about for quite some time. but i guess, are you still comfortable with that long-term model of 25% plus operating margins? i know we've seen that for some select periods for the business. but is that the right margin level to think about for the business when you're driving toward that 20% top-line growth? just can you truly balance that? or do you have to sacrifice one for the other, again, thinking longer term here?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
i think, jason, honestly, i think we've managed that well over the years. i mean you can see how well we did last year in the sense of that operating profit has been squarely on top of that piece. and i think we've managed it within that bandwidth very well, and that's -- this current situation is not going to change that.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. thanks, guys.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thank you, jason.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of jeff johnson with baird. you may proceed.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hi, jeff.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
thank you. hi, guys. how are you? so, joe, let me just pick up on that last point. i mean you said you've managed opex well over the years in that.
i guess, let me just be direct on it. i mean if end markets are cyclically slowing, that's kind of out of your control, do you put the gas pedal down to the accelerator? do you say, ""look, there's not a whole lot that that's going to accomplish? so i kind of protect margins here in the short run."" just what's your opex outlook kind of in the near term -- near to intermediate term, i guess, given some of this macro uncertainty?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hey, jeff, it's more the latter of your question. it's just you take off the accelerator. and we know -- john and i know where to adjust that won't hurt the business. we continue to invest in innovation in different areas, too.
but there are several areas of short-term investments that aren't going to help us in this current crisis that we'll obviously lean into and make sure that we preserve margins as much as we can.
john morici -- chief financial officer
but with those investments, yes, it will be -- when we talked about the 20-plus percent on a gaap basis, that's the trade-off that we'll have. we'll invest where we can see a return and based on the volume that we expect, but deliver 20-plus percent op margin.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
yeah, got it. thanks, john. and then a follow-up question, i guess, just on the gaidge data, you talked about down 7% case starts ortho year to date. i'm hearing that through april, not just through march.
but i don't get the whole gaidge data set, but what i've seen is that the adult data is worse than the teen data, which would make sense to me. everybody sitting at home, all the adults sitting home last year with the zoom effect going on at this point and stimulus checks sitting in pockets and all that. so that all makes sense. but just what's the tenor in north america or in those markets that aren't impacted by china and russia, ukraine in that, what's the tenor of the teen business? and is the core, that part of the business, still doing better than you've just got real tough comps because all those adults were coming in last year as they were sitting at home and had nothing better to do than go get clear aligners?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hey, jeff, it's joe. look, the teen market, you're good to focus on that. i mean that's -- we look at that as a fairly secure market. obviously, it can move up and down, but it won't have the volatility that you've seen in the adult market.
and you comparing it against last year is a good way to look at it, given the zoom effect and things we talked about before. so -- i mean, jeff, that's why you see us launching these teen products right now and getting ready from a summertime standpoint. we want to take advantage of that demand as much as we possibly can, especially in times like this. we know the adult market is going to be pressured.
and i'm talking about the u.s. right now, but let's leave china out, because china is in a unique position in the sense of a lockdown that they're going through. but we're -- you're going to see us take the same tact in europe also. and you saw our teen volume in europe was actually pretty good in the first quarter.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
what about that teen volume in the u.s., joe?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
we expect that teen volume to be good. summer seasonality is there. and it's funny, there's a window for teens to really have their teeth treated. and we've known that here for years, and that's why we've prepared for teen season.
and this year, honestly, jeff, i feel better about our positioning for teens in united states and also in europe than i have any time since i've been here, with these teen packs that we just talked about and how we'll go about it. i think we're well-positioned to make further penetration in the teen market versus wires and brackets.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
got it. thanks. guys.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
the next question is from the line of jonathan block with stifel. you may proceed.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hey, jon.
jonathan block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks. a good segue, i'll start with the teen case packs. we picked up on that program right after april.
quite honestly, unfortunately, i'm old enough to remember your teens pack programs internationally from like a decade ago. and if i remember those correctly, joe, it is just hard to collect, if you would, if someone did below their threshold. and hopefully, i'm making some sense. so maybe just talk to us -- here you are going after it and you're going after teens, not overall.
you're launching it. what's going to be different this go-round? when someone commits to a 50-case pack or a 100-case pack, let's go with 100, they do 88 and you've got to go out there and say, ""hey, look, it's a use it or lose it. we've got to collect for you."" and then also just keep the tenor of the relationship or the goodwill of the relationship intact, because now, arguably, they even have more options to go somewhere else versus what they were staring down a decade ago. so maybe if you could talk to that and just the timing behind kicking off the program, that would be a great place to start.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
so you're like an align historian, that's a good question, right? because i can tell you, i wasn't here when that happened in europe, but it's legendary here. but if you go back in time, i think our business in europe was less than $10 million back then, ok? now it's over $1 billion. and i think the whole world is much more acquainted with clear aligners than when it was back then. we were really pioneers at that point in time.
if you look at our dsp program, it's basically the same thing. they make commitments of how many aligners they're going to buy over a certain period of time. we haven't had any issues in dsp with having customers regress or not making those benchmarks. so we feel pretty good about where we are.
i mean will we run into a few situations, i think we will. i think they'll be outliers, and we'll deal with them in time.
jonathan block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. fair enough. and i just might go back to sort of where jason started a little bit. there's going to be a lot of questions on 2022 and pulling the top-line guidance.
so let me just throw out a couple of things, and we could sort of work through it. if i look back to the past five to six years, the first quarter was about 22% of total revenue. and if you run that exercise for this year, you get about 11% or 12% year-over-year revenue growth and you've got an incremental fx headwind. so should we throw a dart at 10%? and what's wrong with that thought process in getting to, call it, low double-digit 10%, 12% top-line growth for '22? thanks, guys.
john morici -- chief financial officer
i think -- hey, jon, this is john. as we talked about that last earnings, there was a lot of changes that have happened in the marketplace and in the world. and as a result of that, we pulled the top-line guidance until we get further clarity as to how things are going to shake out. what we have committed to is being able to grow in a profitable way, in a way that you would expect us to be responsible being at 20-plus percent.
but we pulled that guidance because of the uncertainty.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
you know, jon, just to add to john's comments, too, is that as we look at april versus march, we haven't seen any momentum from an april standpoint, too. and we start from that standpoint also.
jonathan block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. that's helpful color. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of erin wright with morgan stanley. you may proceed.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hi, erin.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good to hear from you. in the americas -- good to hear from you. so in the americas, can you parse out a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of macro headwinds compared to maybe some of the lingering covid impact? and does it seem like some -- i mean it doesn't seem like some of these cases are coming back from maybe omicron delays.
but what are you seeing in terms of the dynamics there? just trying to kind of parse out. last quarter, you did break out kind of a covid impact, but could you do that this quarter?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
it's hard to be very discrete in the sense of what that impact is, erin. but i'd say we obviously faced staffing shortages and things at different doctors in the first part of the first quarter that affected us. i'd say that drifted through to basically late february, early march. after that, you can -- if you watch the consumer confidence statistics in the united states, they've gone down pretty dramatically.
and we started getting a lot of reports from our doctors that a patient is not saying no, but the patient is not as quick to say, yes, that they want a treatment. and we hear that both in the gp segment and the orthodontic segment. so you can call that what you want to, ok? but we see some reticence in the marketplace to move forward with treatment. and again, it's not binary.
it's not everybody is saying no, like in the heart of a deep recession or something we saw back in '07 or '08. it's just more cautiousness from people about their personal finances.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok, great. thanks. and then on asps for the balance of the year, i guess, how should we be thinking about that and the levers, i guess, you can pull on that front? thanks.
john morici -- chief financial officer
hey, erin, this is john. from an overall asp standpoint, we don't have anything unusual from a promotion standpoint or anything else that would affect us. obviously, notwithstanding fx, we've seen unfavorable fx as we've gone through this year so far. but notwithstanding fx, we wouldn't expect anything dramatically different from an asp standpoint.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, erin.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of kevin caliendo with ubs. you may proceed.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my call.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hi, kevin.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
so i guess the question i have is -- the first one is really why have the doc starts been so sluggish? is it demand-driven? is it competitive positioning? is it -- i would just love to hear sort of why, in the u.s. especially, the sort of doc adds have been flattish for the last couple of quarters? if there's anything, if it's macro or micro or competitive?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think i read your question. i think you're asking if it's competitive, because i mean, we're pretty clear on what we've been seeing around the globe and the united states from a macro standpoint, kevin. so i just -- look, from a competition standpoint, we don't see any major issue with competition in the sense of being a factor in this demand cycle that we're talking about.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
and when we try to think about the impacts here that are driving all of this, how much do you -- have you guys been able to ascertain how much of this is economic-driven? you're talking about decisions taking longer and people being more hesitant and volumes being down. how much of that is economic versus covid versus other? like have you been able to just parse out what's really driving it as a percentage? is it mostly simply, listen, we're in an inflationary environment, people don't have as much to spend, consumers aren't spending as much broadly versus just an overall demand for your products and/or covid, like those three things, if you were to group them?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
kevin, our announcement and the way we communicate to the marketplace, we talk about this huge market, right? we're totally under-penetrated in the orthodontic segment, less than 10% of 21 million case starts a year, talk about what we see through the 500 million patients. so there's not a lack of demand out there and the lack of opportunity. there's not a competitive issue that we think is affecting our growth or our earnings. and so obviously, covid is part of this thing.
part of what we see in europe was the ukraine conflict that's going on today. and i think a significant amount of it is, too, is what we're seeing in the marketplace, too, from a consumer standpoint. i can't put any weighted averages on these things to give you an example. and i think -- if i compare to -- when we last talked to you at the first couple of days of february, the way things have changed, those variables in that equation, i think, have changed pretty dramatically.
so it's really hard to say going forward what that might be.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
are there any goals that you have -- one last one from me. are there any goals that you have for this year in terms of quantifiable goals in terms of whether it be doc adds or utilization uptick or -- i mean i know those are the things you were focused on when you talked about increasing your spend. like what are you targeting at this point? is there anything that we can sort of put a stick in the ground and say, ""ok, here is something that the company is hoping to achieve in 2022 in terms of a quantifiable number.""
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
kevin, this is a growth company, and it never leaves our thought process. so what are we trying to do? we're trying to run the play we always do. we're running these plays in a much more difficult market with more headwinds. that's all.
and so we'll move these plays around. we'll look at them by country. we'll see what makes the most sense. we still keep a good strong focus on how we can grow and where we can grow, and we'll find those ways.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
appreciate it. thanks, guys.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, kevin.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of michael ryskin of bank of america. you may proceed.
michael ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions, guys. i've got two i want to touch on. can you hear me?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
michael ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. one is just sort of talking through some of the dynamics we're talking to -- you talked for the quarter. i think we can all kind of see that a lot of it is macro-driven, a lot of it's global-driven and each of these events that we're following, whether it's the china lockdowns or the conflict in europe or even things like fx are going to be more temporary than others. i know your long-term outlook is still there for the 20% to 30% volume growth and revenue growth.
but what about sort of catch-up spend on these things? is there an expectation somewhere -- and you kind of touched on this when you talked about your spend and your expectations on investment this year. as we go through the next couple of months, next couple of quarters as some of these things start to fade, are you expecting another bolus of catch-up as these cases come back like we saw in 2020 and 2021? anything you can sort of comment on that? and then i've got a follow-up.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
i think a bolus you talked about -- i mean, that was interesting is what we saw after the last downturn, it was first like covid. i mean i look at that, mike, overall, is it just shows you the demand out there for our kind of procedures. so it's there. and so john and i aren't sitting here, predicting another bolus or a wave or whatever, but i think it just shows you the demand that exists in this business, and it can be pent up at times.
we'll just have to see how the headwinds that we see filter through the marketplace and how it affects consumers and doctors.
michael ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok, appreciate that. and then the follow-up, you touched on this in an answer earlier when you sort of referenced the 2007, 2008 downturn. obviously, hopefully, we're not going to something quite like that in the coming year, too. but there's still a lot of talk about recession and sort of what the impact of prolong inflation is going to be on the consumer.
could you talk us through your plans if things do continue to deteriorate on that front? i mean we're not there yet, but six months from now, a year from now, things are still heading in that direction, sort of what are your internal plans for adjusting both on operations side? how will you sort of position yourself for growth in that kind of environment? because if you look back at 2007, '08, '09, there was a protracted period of essentially flat growth. so could you compare and contrast that?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's joe again. i just -- we have a really strong balance sheet to start with. it's great to have a strong balance sheet and really no net debt from a company standpoint. so look, i'm not an economist, but i'm not predicting a meltdown of our financial system like we saw in 2007, 2008.
depending on what federal reserve does or whatever, how we're going to see this adjustment as they try to attack inflation. so look, we -- this business is incredibly healthy. it generates a lot of cash. it's extremely international now.
and we have a lot of levers to pull and a lot of things to do to keep this business going. so -- but if something dire did happen, i feel we've got a balance sheet to be able to cover it, too, and we'll manage the business responsibly that way. so i'd just tell you, don't give up on us, ok? we love this business. we love the position that it's in.
we're confident about the future. we're just going to see how these headwinds hit and how they subside, and we'll be ready on either end of that to be able to position this company to do well.
john morici -- chief financial officer
and i might add, just we are a different business than we were back in 2007, 2008. we didn't have itero. we have itero, much more of a global business, better products, much further along in the teen market, more consumer awareness. all the things that we've done over this time period now being 25 years, we've evolved over time and created a business where we're very mindful of what is happening from a demand standpoint, and we can do a lot of things from a leverage standpoint in order to drive that right amount of profitability.
michael ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of nathan rich with goldman sachs. you may proceed.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thanks for the questions. i wanted to follow up on your commentary on april and not seeing momentum return. i was just wondering if there's any parameters you could put around that relative to maybe what you've seen in the first quarter? i guess like would that sort of mean volumes more flattish, anything that you could do to kind of help us think about how the business kind of exited the first quarter and where the current run rate is would be helpful.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. nate, i'll give you a quick rundown, and john can give you specifics, too. look, we -- this is flattish to use your term. when you look at between march and april is more flattish than anything.
but just remember, we have -- china is still our second biggest country in the world. it's locked down. shanghai -- beijing is going into lockdown. and that's not the first lockdown we've seen in china.
remember, there are several provinces that were locked down before that, too. so that part of our business has really been impacted in a big way, and that's part of that flattishness that we're talking about, too. so we're seeing impact in every region of the world, but in different ways. and on the apac side, particularly with china, it's dramatic.
john morici -- chief financial officer
i don't have much -- anything to add to it. it's just -- a lot has changed, as we've seen, over the last couple of months, and we're responding to that change.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
makes sense. and i guess, i'd be curious just to get your thoughts on sort of the consumer environment. i know it's been touched on in other questions. but invisalign treatment is a higher ticket purchase, and we've kind of always thought of it as catering to a more affluent consumer.
i guess is there anything that you've seen kind of between higher-end consumer versus lower-end consumer? and they're going back to, i think, the way you framed it, kind of the reticence to start treatment. any difference that you've seen among maybe the different segments of the population that could be considering treatment?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
i commented back to the other question, was asked about teens, right? the teen aspect in the orthodontic segment is pretty resilient, and that is a certain demographic that's always existed in the sense of the parents that they can afford that kind of treatment for young children. the adult segment, it's all over the place depending on -- sometimes, it's just teeth straightening. some of the times, it's a broad orthodontic correction of what's going on. we don't have any data in that adult segment to say that a certain score of certain -- by the score of certain much -- a certain amount would be fewer people taking treatment or whatever.
i don't have that data. i don't know if john has seen it either. but you'd have to guess that the more your finances are impacted, the less you're going to sign up for a $3,500 to $7,000 treatment depending on what you want or how you're in a contract for it. so it's logical that certain demographics would be less willing at this point in time.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
thanks, nate. operator, we'll take one more question, please.
operator
absolutely. the next question is from the line of elizabeth anderson with evercore isi. you may proceed.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for much for the question. so maybe one question on the itero scanner growth. obviously, we saw a deceleration quarter over quarter, but still year-over-year growth there.
when you sort of talk about how providers are looking at demand -- and i realize that not all of that is like pure like itero sales. how do we think about sort of what's driving the purchases in the first quarter? obviously, there is some seasonality. but if you like, overall visits, maybe ex clear aligners are not -- has -- maybe haven't been quite as impacted. are we seeing sort of a reticence to spend? is it sort of interest rates going up and people worried about sort of equipment financing? could you walk us through some of the puts and takes of the demand drivers there?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
elizabeth, it's joe. i'd start with, still the market is broadly unpenetrated from a scanner standpoint. gp side, the ortho side. in ortho, that does a lot of invisalign.
they can have four, five, six scanners overall. so look, i've been with the ge healthcare for years, abb. i understand the capital equipment cycle. there is a true cycle in capital equipment.
when people get concerned, they'll delay those kinds of purchases. and i think, obviously, we have, what i would talk about, 250,000 doctors that we service today. some of them are going to be worried about what their cash flow is going to look like. they're going to be reticent in the sense of saying they want to sign up for a scanner that can cost anywhere between $15,000 to $35,000 right now and what we sell.
so i can't tell you by country or by region or whatever, but we didn't see things shut off. we just saw things, as the quarter got through, we just didn't have as strong as demand for itero than we anticipated. so we'll have to -- obviously, we get into this quarter. we'll continue to watch it and see which way it goes.
but there's going to be some more scrutiny, i think, around capital investment if doctors are seeing less traffic through their practices.
john morici -- chief financial officer
yeah. it's just the delays that they put to not close unnecessarily within the quarter. it's not going away, but it's just a delay. and we have to work to try to get them to say yes.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and you're not having any supply chain issues on that side in terms of being able to manufacture the equipment?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
we didn't have any in the first quarter. we won't have any in the second quarter either, elizabeth.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. and one more quick follow-up. in terms of the gross margin impact of the new poland facility, can you remind us about the cadence of the gross margin pressure when you open a new facility as it scales? i'm just trying to be able to parse that out versus maybe some of the deleveraging impact of some of the volume shifts versus that. thanks.
john morici -- chief financial officer
yeah, elizabeth. what we'll see is we'll go live in the second quarter here, and that does have a gross margin impact. it really comes down to trying to get as much utilization through the plant as possible, moving those countries and doctors through the plant. and then once that utilization increases, then you start to see some of that productivity.
so it hits about a quarter, maybe a little bit more than a quarter, and then it subsides and then it gets more on a regular operating basis.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations

you may begin.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
thank you. good afternoon. thank you for joining us. i'm shirley stacy, vice president of corporate communications and investor relations.
joining me for today's call is joe hogan, president and ceo; and john morici, cfo. we issued first quarter 2022 financial results today via globenewswire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately one month. a telephone replay will be available today by approximately 5:30 p.m.

please refer to these files for more detailed information. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to align technology's president and ceo, joe hogan. joe? 
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, shirley. good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. on our call today, i'll provide an overview of our q1 results and discuss the performance of our two operating segments: systems and services and clear aligners. john will provide more detail on our financial performance and our view for the remainder of the year.
following that, i'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. overall, the first quarter proved to be a tougher-than-expected operating environment globally. and we believe our results primarily reflect three key factors: the continued impact of covid-19 waves in every region and especially in china, with its restrictions and lockdowns under their zero-covid policy; a weaker economic environment and waning consumer confidence driven by increasing inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions; and the military conflict in the ukraine and fallout across europe. in addition, with approximately half our business occurring outside the united states, unfavorable foreign exchange rates negatively impacting our revenues, margins, and eps.
notwithstanding these headwinds, q1 '22 total revenues of $973.2 million were up 8.8% year over year, compared to q1 '21 revenues of $894 million with a growth rate of 62% year over year. our q1 '22 operating income was $198 million, and operating margin was 20.4%. in q1, systems and services revenues were up 15.6% year over year, but down 24% sequentially, coming off our sixth consecutive quarter of sequential growth and record scanner and services revenue. sequential results primarily reflect lower volumes from our aforementioned headwinds and from seasonality as q4 is historically a stronger capital equipment sales quarter.
for q1, clear aligner revenues were up 7.5% year over year, reflecting revenue growth across regions and products, and were down slightly sequentially from q4 at minus 0.7%. in the teen segment, 175,000 teens started treatment with invisalign aligners, up 6% year over year. invisalign first for kids as young as six years old grew sequentially year over year and was strong across all regions. q1 non-case revenues, which include doctor-prescribed retention products, clinical training and education, and other dental consumables, performed well and grew both year over year and sequentially.
our doctor subscription plan, or dsp, pilot was launched last year in the united states and canada, and it continues to ramp nicely, driving strong revenue growth. dsp is a monthly subscription program designed for a segment of experienced invisalign doctors who are not regularly using our retainers or low-stage aligners. we're very excited about the feedback and uptake we're seeing, and we'll expand the program into other markets this year. here are just a few things some doctors are saying about dsp.
dr. drew ferris in santa barbara, california, ""we have shifted our retention model and workflow. we really like the material, the fit and the precision of the product and having everything in align systems versus printing in-house and having to maintain it ourselves."" dr. sandra tai in vancouver, canada, ""this program fits my business model very well.
i'm able to pass savings to patients."" now let's turn to the specifics around the first quarter results, starting with the americas. for q1, invisalign case volumes were down 1.5% year over year. on a sequential basis, americas case volumes were down 4.3%, primarily reflecting the impact from the covid-19 waves, first experienced in north america beginning in q4 '21 and continuing to q1 and later in latin america, causing consumers customer staffing shortages and practice closures, as well as decreased patient traffic and increased appointment cancellations. the latest data from the gaidge practice analysis tool that collect and consolidates data from about 700 ortho practices, covering more than 1,000 orthodontists across 1,600 locations in the united states and canada, showed weakening underlying patient demand trends in the first quarter for both adult and teens and across wires and brackets and clear aligner products.
new patient visits were down 7.6% year over year, and ortho starts were down 7.2% year over year. in the dso channel, in q1 '22, dso practices grew faster than non-dso practices, with utilization led by heartland and smile doctors. earlier this month, we announced a new dso partnership with dentalcorp, canada's largest and fastest-growing network of dental practices. dentalcorp plans to extend its offering of invisalign brand clear aligner treatment to canadians nationwide through its ortho acceleration program.
this strategic collaboration also provides dentalcorp's network of doctors across nearly 460 practices with access to enhanced benefits, dedicated learning opportunities, and treatment planning support for the invisalign system. also this month, we launched a new invisalign teen subscription program in the united states and canada to help unlock the massive opportunity from teen orthodontics, which makes up approximately 75% of the 5 million annual case starts in north america. the teen subscription program enables orthodontists to buy clear aligners in case packs in advance, much like the way they buy wires and brackets today, offering simple and more predictable billing for doctors. it also includes exclusive practice development benefits with the invisalign brand and requires an incremental volume commitment from doctors.
the timing of the new teen program coincides with the beginning of the summer teen season, and we're excited to continue partnering with doctors to grow their practice with invisalign treatment. with less than 10% share of teen case starts, the teen subscription program has the potential to help accelerate invisalign adoption in the largest segment of the orthodontic market, teens. for our international business, q1 invisalign case volumes were up 3% year over year. on a sequential basis, international case volumes were down 6.1%, primarily reflecting the headwinds described earlier, especially the impact of covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns in china and the fallout across europe from the military conflict in ukraine.
for emea, q1 invisalign case volumes were up 2.1% year over year with core -- growth in our core markets led by italy and germany and dach, along with the growth expansion markets led by turkey and mea. the q1 year-over-year invisalign case volume in emea was driven by increased submissions, primarily from the orthodontist channel, especially in the teen market. during the quarter, we launched our first ever direct-to-teen campaign in emea focused on educating teens about the benefits of invisalign treatment over traditional wires and brackets; increasing consumer demand as part of our wider teen growth plan, combined with our parent of teen campaign; and to help give teens critical influence in the parent decision by driving peer word-of-mouth. more recently, we launched the invisalign go express system, the latest addition to the invisalign go portfolio for general dentists.
first launched in emea in 2016 as a 20-stage aligner treatment offering, the invisalign go portfolio system is designed for general dentists to treat mild to moderate malocclusions and to integrate tooth alignment into restorative and comprehensive dental care. additionally, building of our european manufacturing facility in wroclaw, poland, remains on track to go live this quarter, increasing our flexibility and timeliness in supporting our valued doctor customers across the emea region. turning to apac for q1. apac invisalign case volumes were up 4.7% year over year with strength in the gp dentist channel, primarily through increased invisalign submissions with the invisalign go product and, in the teen market with increased submissions from the orthodontic channel.
on a sequential basis, apac was down 2.6%, reflecting a larger impact from surges in new covid-19 cases that led to significant lockdowns in china. alternatively, despite headwinds, japan and taiwan performed well and we had strong growth in emerging markets like korea and india and thailand on a year-over-year basis. earlier this month, we expanded the invisalign clear aligner product portfolio with new offerings that better serve the expanding market in china. the two new products, invisalign adult and invisalign standard clear aligners, are designed for more specific types of malocclusion cases and provide doctors and their patients with a more clinical and affordable options for moderate to complex cases.
invisalign adult and invisalign standard clear aligners built on our proven technology for a wider range and scope of malocclusion. during the quarter, we announced new invisalign innovations for the align digital platform, a proprietary combination of software, systems and services designed to provide a seamless experience and workflow that integrates and connects all users, doctors, labs, patients, and consumers. these new invisalign innovations include clincheck live update, the invisalign practice app, invisalign personalized plan or ipp, invisalign smile architect, and the cone beam computed tomography, cbct, integration feature for clincheck digital treatment planning software. these innovations will revolutionize digital treatment planning for orthodontics and restorative dentistry by providing doctors with greater flexibility and real-time treatment plan access and modification capabilities.
each of these innovations is designed to enhance invisalign treatment planning quality, efficiency and scale and contribute to a better doctor-patient experience. more recently, we introduced a new enhancement for the invisalign system with mandibular advancement feature. the invisalign system with mandibular advancement is the only clinically proven clear aligner product in the world today that addresses class ii correction with simultaneous alignment. using feedback from customers, we've enhanced the original design with new enhanced precision wings that provide increased durability and comfort, as well as great overlap to help ensure that the aligners remain seated and properly engaged to more effectively address class 2 malocclusions in growing preteen and teen patients.
our consumer marketing focuses on educating consumers about the invisalign system and driving that demand to invisalign doctors' offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. in q1, we built on a successful invis is multimedia campaign across the americas, emea, and apac, driving awareness and interest in invisalign treatment with adult, teen, and parent consumer segments. globally, we delivered strong impression volume with over 23.7 million visits to our websites, 113% year-over-year increase, and over 7.8 billion impressions delivered, representing a 32% year-over-year increase. in the u.s., we continue to amplify our campaigns across the top social platforms such as tiktok, snapchat, instagram, and youtube to increase the awareness of invisalign brand with young adults and teens.
our campaigns featured collaborations with some of the largest influencers in social media, including charli d'amelio, lana candor, devan key, michael le, and josh richards. each of these creators shared their personal experience with invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smiles with invisalign aligners. to continue growing our young adult business across the americas, emea, and apac, we built upon our successful ""invis is a powerful thing"" campaign, which highlights how powerful the smile transformation with invisalign treatment can be for even young adults' self-confidence. we leveraged top influencers like leilani green and lana candor in integrated media campaigns.
further, we are expanding our collaboration with influencers globally and are excited to welcome olympic gold medalist, suni lee, and creators josh richards, hyram yarbro, and scarlett estevez who have chosen to shape their smiles with invisalign treatment. in the emea region, we accelerated our media investments across digital media platforms, including youtube, tiktok, meta, and snapchat, and expanded our invisalign smile squad roster with new influencers. additionally, we launched a pilot in the u.k. to reach teens with special campaigns to create awareness of the unique benefits of invisalign treatment.
our consumer campaigns delivered more than 8.8 million unique visitors to our website, representing 170% increase year over year with over 2.5 billion media impressions. we continue to expand our investment in consumer advertising across the apac region, excluding china, resulting in a 278% increase year over year in unique visitors and a 265% year-over-year increase in impressions. we continued to strengthen our investments in australia by expanding our reach via social media platforms such as tiktok, meta, and youtube. in japan, we built upon our successful consumer campaigns by expanding into twitter and continue to see strong response from consumers, as evidenced by a 373% increase in unique visitors to our site.
for our systems and services business, q1 revenues were up 15.6% year over year, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services; and down 24.2% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower volumes from the previous mentioned headwinds and capital equipment seasonality. during the quarter, we saw continued adoption of the itero element 5d plus imaging system we launched last year that features innovative technology like near infra-red technology that we call niri, which aids in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities without -- above the gingiva without harmful radiation. a strong indicator of the digital adoption within dental offices is the number of intraoral scans used for invisalign case submissions. total worldwide intraoral digital scans submitted to start an invisalign case in q1 increased to 87.1% from 80.9% in q1 last year.
international intraoral digital scans for invisalign case submissions increased to 83%, up from 75% in q1 last year. for the americas, 91% of invisalign cases were submitted using an intraoral digital scan, compared to 85.5% in q1 of last year. cumulatively, over 54.9 million orthodontic scans and over 11.4 million restorative scans have been performed with itero scanners. during the quarter, the itero element 5d plus won the best new imaging or cad/cam product from drbicuspid.com, a cuspie award.
the award reflects our commitment to develop innovative solutions that help doctors transform lives by improving patients' journey to a healthy, beautiful smile. we are pleased to share that the itero element scanner received an orthotown 2021 townie choice award, which seeks to recognize the top peer-recommended products and services in dentistry. we're proud that the itero element 5d plus imaging system provides dental practices with latest in imaging technology, cutting-edge enhanced chairside visualizations, and applications that can drive practice growth and treatment acceptance. continued growth in the itero scanner installed base is driving increased services revenues, as well as exocad cad/cam software solutions that integrate workflows to the dental labs and dental practices.
our q1 exocad cad/cam products and services, which include restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery, and smile design offerings, are included in scanner and services revenues and are helping extend our digital dental solutions and broaden align digital platform toward fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows. as we continue to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, our goal is to make orthodontics a pillar of dentistry. april 2 marked our second anniversary since welcoming exocad into the align family. and together, we're working to ensure that every dental technician and every dentist planning a restorative treatment considers the benefits of digital orthodontics first.
we're continuing to focus on integration and road map development to strengthen the align digital platform by addressing restorative needs to facilitate both ortho restorative and comprehensive dentistry. two years after exocad joined align, we are more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead to shape the dental industry and with technology and expertise that complement the many benefits of the align digital platform and bringing all key stakeholders together, doctor, customers, labs, partners and users as we continue transforming smiles and changing lives. during the quarter, exocad participated in the 2022 dental south china show in guangzhou, china, showcasing its newest software release, dentalcad 3.0 galway plus other open software solutions like innovative smile design program called smile creator. the show allowed the exocad team to deepen their relationships with the dental community to discover new trends emerging in the growing dental market in china.
attendees at booth experienced firsthand how exocad's wizard-guided workflows and easy online communication programs streamline the treatment journey from consultation to final restoration. finally, this quarter, exocad is opening its new headquarters in seoul, south korea, which provides a robust high-tech infrastructure to a key region of our business. exocad has been working with a growing number of korean manufacturers for many years, and this location help facilitate strategic relationships in the region. with that, i'll now turn over the call to john.
john morici -- chief financial officer
thanks, joe. now for our q1 financial results. total revenues for the first quarter were $973.2 million, down 5.6% from the prior quarter and up 8.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. for clear aligners, q1 revenues of $809.7 million were down 0.7% sequentially due to lower invisalign case volumes, partially offset by higher asps and up 7.5% year over year, reflecting higher asps and non-case revenues.
in q1, invisalign case volume were down 5.1% sequentially and up 0.5% year over year. in addition, we shipped clear aligners to 82,400 invisalign doctors worldwide, of which over 5,000 were first-time customers. q1 comprehensive volume increased 2.4% year over year and decreased 5% sequentially. q1 non-comprehensive volume decreased 4% year over year and decreased 5.4% sequentially.
q1 adult patients decreased 1.6% year over year and decreased 5.7% sequentially. in q1, teens or younger patients increased 6% year over year and decreased 3.6% sequentially. clear aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $6.5 million or approximately 0.8 points sequentially. on a year-over-year basis, clear aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $24 million or approximately 3.2 points.
for q1, invisalign comprehensive asps increased sequentially and year over year. on a sequential basis, invisalign comprehensive asps reflect per order processing fees charged on most clear aligner shipments, lower discounts, and higher additional aligners, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. on a year-over-year basis, comprehensive asps reflect higher additional aligners and per order processing fees, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. q1 invisalign non-comprehensive asps increased sequentially and year over year.
on a sequential basis, invisalign non-comprehensive asps were favorably impacted by per order processing fees and lower discounts, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. on a year-over-year basis, invisalign non-comprehensive asps reflect per order processing fees, higher additional aligners, partially offset by foreign exchange. clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $53 million or 5% sequentially and $307.1 million or 38.1% year over year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. our systems and services revenue for the first quarter were $163.5 million, down 24.2% sequentially and up 15.6% year over year.
the decrease sequentially can be attributed to lower scanner volume following a strong q4 and consistent with seasonality in the capital equipment business, coupled with the headwinds described earlier. the increase year over year can be attributed to increased services revenue from our larger installed base, as well as slightly higher scanner volume. our systems and services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was up $16.5 million or 7.2% sequentially and up $114.9 million or 87.6% year over year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenue included with our -- with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. moving on to gross margin.
first quarter overall gross margin was 72.9%, up 0.7 points sequentially and down 2.8 points year over year. on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, overall gross margin was 73.3% for the first quarter, up 0.7 points sequentially and down 2.8 points year over year. overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.8 points on a year-over-year basis and by approximately 0.2 points sequentially due to foreign exchange. clear aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 74.8%, up 0.6 points sequentially due to higher asps, partially offset by higher mix of additional aligner volume and higher freight costs.
clear aligner gross margin was down 2.8 points year over year due to higher mix of additional aligner volume and higher freight costs, partially offset by higher asps. systems and services gross margin for the first quarter was 63.4%, down 1.3 points sequentially due to lower volume and lower asps, partially offset by lower freight costs. systems and services gross margin was down 2 points year over year due to higher manufacturing inefficiencies, partially offset by a higher mix of service revenues and increased asps. q1 operating expenses were $511.3 million, down sequentially 2.4% and up 13.2% year over year.
on a sequential basis, operating expenses were down $12.4 million. year over year, operating expenses increased by $59.6 million, reflecting increased headcount and our continued investment in marketing, sales, and r&d activities and investments commensurate with business growth. on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, and acquisition costs, operating expenses were $480.2 million, down sequentially 2.9% and up 13.1% year over year due to the reasons described above. our first quarter operating income of $198.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 20.4%, down 1.1 points sequentially and down 4.8 points year over year.
the year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology, as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, and acquisition costs, operating margin for the first quarter was 24%, down 0.7 points sequentially and down 4.6 points year over year. interest and other income and expense, net for the first quarter, was a loss of $10.6 million, down sequentially by $9.7 million and down year over year by $46.8 million. q1 of 2021 included the sec arbitration award gain of $43.4 million.
the gaap effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.4%, compared to 13.2% in the fourth quarter and 23.4% in the first quarter of the prior year. our non-gaap effective tax rate was 24.2% in the first quarter, compared to 11.5% in the fourth quarter and 20.2% in the first quarter of the prior year. the first quarter gaap and non-gaap effective tax rates were higher than fourth quarter effective tax rates, primarily due to tax benefits related to expiration of statutes of limitations for timely asserting claims and an out-of-period adjustment recorded last quarter. first quarter net income per diluted share was $1.70, down sequentially $0.70 and down $0.81 compared to the prior year.
our eps was unfavorably impacted by $0.13 on a sequential basis and $0.28 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. on a non-gaap basis, net income per diluted share was $2.13 for the first quarter, down $0.70 sequentially and down $0.36 year over year. moving on to the balance sheet. as of march 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1.1 billion, down sequentially $176.1 million and down $11.1 million year over year.
of our $1.1 billion balance, $453 million was held in the u.s. and $667.6 million was held by our international entities. q1 accounts receivable balance was $950.9 million, up approximately 6% sequentially. our overall days sales outstanding was 87 days, up approximately nine days sequentially and up approximately 15 days as compared to q1 last year.
cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $30.5 million. capital expenditures for the first quarter were $87.3 million, primarily related to our continued investment to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to negative $56.8 million. in february, we repurchased $75 million of our common stock through open market repurchases of approximately 143,600 shares at an average price of $522.61 per share.
we have approximately $650 million remaining available for repurchase under our may 13, 2021, $1 billion repurchase program. as described during our q4 2021 earnings call, we provided our fiscal year 2022 outlook with revenue growth in line with our long-term revenue range of 20% to 30%. this revenue growth assumed no significant new covid surges after current wave, no meaningful practice disruption nor material supply chain issues throughout the year. at that time, we were seeing some recovery as omicron headwinds began to ease and covid restrictions were relaxing.
however, later in the quarter, unfavorable impacts on our business occurred, driven by china lockdowns, weaker consumer confidence, inflationary pressures, and the russia-ukraine conflict. for april, we have not seen momentum return as the headwinds previously mentioned persist. now turning to full year 2022. we remain confident in the huge under-penetrated market, our technology and industry leadership, and our ability to execute and make progress toward our long-term model of 20% to 30% revenue growth.
at the same time, the headwinds we're experiencing, which include increased covid waves and significant china lockdowns, weaker consumer confidence, inflation pressures, and the russia-ukraine conflict, have increased uncertainty across all markets. we also anticipate capital equipment sales will be increasingly constrained throughout the year as practices adjust to these headwinds. given less visibility and an increasing unpredictable operating environment, we are not providing revenue guidance for the year. however, assuming no additional material disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, our goal for fiscal 2022 is to deliver gaap operating margin above 20%, while making strategic investments in sales, marketing, r&d, and operations.
in addition, during q2 '22, we expect to repurchase up to $200 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. for 2022, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements, as well as digital manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. this includes our investment in an aligner fabrication facility in wroclaw, poland, which is expected to begin serving doctors in the second quarter of 2022 as part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to customers.
as we continue growing, we intend to expand our investments in research and development, manufacturing, treatment planning, sales, and marketing operations to meet the actual and anticipated local and regional demands. with that, i'll turn it back over to joe for final comments. joe?

thank you. [operator instructions]. the first question is from nathan rich with goldman sachs. please proceed.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs
thank you, good afternoon. hey, joe and john. i guess, i wanted to start high level. joe, you kind of highlighted the consistent case in revenue trends in the second quarter relative to the first.
but within the context of a challenging macro environment, i guess, how does that influence your thinking on the trajectory of the business? and have you seen an impact on patient traffic to dental practices or treatment acceptance rates that's kind of driving that commentary?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
nate, it's a -- if you look at this from a domestic standpoint, you can pull out some signal, but i think you have to when you're asking a demand question like that, you have to look at this globally. and i think like john and i were just clear in our introduction that basically, if you took asia, covid-19 impacted us pretty tremendously in asia. japan for a little bit in the first part of the quarter in china almost throughout the quarter. so it was really a covid discussion there, and it's hard to pull a demand signal out.
in the united states, i mean, if you look at the data that we do, you'll see from a general practitioner standpoint or whatever, some stability in patient vision to what's going on. our concern here is, obviously, this is a product where like a cap or a crown or cleaning or something that needs to be done, it's somewhat discretionary. and we see that from an adult standpoint, more variability in adult selection than in teens. teens have been pretty stable in that way if we talked about before.
moving over to europe. we're working off 300% growth rates in europe last year, ok, which you have to internalize that. it's a pretty big comparison year on year. and there weren't standard vacations being taken in europe to the beginning of the end of the second quarter and the third quarter.
so overall, i'd say, as you look around the globe, i fee like -- i felt good, as we mentioned in the script, about q1 versus q2 and pretty much the same kind of demand pattern. but right now, i can't really give you a trajectory in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, because of the macro environment, concerns again in china from another covid shutdown and those types of things. i hope that makes sense, nate.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs
yes, definitely. and maybe just a quick follow-up. were you, i guess, able to size kind of the headwind from the lockdowns in china? and with that -- in that market specifically, have you started to see those volumes recover as we're starting to see those lockdowns ease?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
for sure. i mean it's direct correlation there as soon as they let shanghai open again, we saw it reflected in our order rates there. and look, we continue to feel good about china in a stable market. it's just the dramatic way that china continues to address covid cases by major cities.
this just creates a huge amount of uncertainty as when the next lockdown will be.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs
thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. rich. the next question is from the line of elizabeth anderson with evercore. please proceed.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks so much for the question. one thing i was wondering if you could comment about -- i know in the sort of fourth quarter of last year, and into the first quarter, you did increase the sales hiring, sequentially and year over year. could you sort of talk through sort of the impact of those salespeople? where are they in the ramp process? and how do you -- should we think about their potential for contributing in the back half of the year? thanks.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
that's a good question, elizabeth. obviously, our sales force -- being a direct sales force is really important to us in that way. and so the way we do this, obviously, as you indicated, we hire a lot of salespeople upfront. we have sales training programs too that help to initiate them as they come into the corporation.
but i would tell you, depending on where you are around the globe, there is a six-month and nine-month burn-in period, before you really feel that they're up to speed. they understand the invisalign system, the digital platform and those types of things. so i would say in some simpler kinds of situations geographically, it could be six months. but in general, it's nine months or so before we have confidence that they're going to be really good on their feet as they talk to our doctors.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then one thing that depressed me in the quarter a little bit was about the teen number. i know that sometimes this quarter, it's been off because of covid in terms of seasonality, and it's not necessarily always the strongest quarter for teen.
but how are you thinking about that versus the economic sensitivity of adult cases and sort of how -- do you expect that to sort of trend in the sort of near-term?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. keep in mind, we see a lot more concern from an adult standpoint, when you look year over year in the sense of our order growth in adults, i mean it's been affected elizabeth, and there's a lot of data that we produce that will show you that. on the teen side, it's hard to pull a lot of the second quarter because it really starts in the third quarter. but i felt overall good about it, but again, not surprised because we've always felt that teens have a certain window of time from a treatment standpoint.
and so it's not necessarily an emotional purchase in a way, it's usually planned for and anticipated. and -- and what we saw between the second quarter and beginning of the third quarter, it really bears that out.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. ok. thank you very much.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you, ms. anderson. our next question is from the line of jon block with stifel. please proceed.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. good afternoon. i'll follow up on teen, maybe just to go there.
i think worldwide teen was down year over year. and i believe, joe, you mentioned that teen and apac was up year over year, which sort of implies that north american teen was down maybe a decent amount. so anything to call out there? why do we see that maybe specific to north america? and then more importantly, you did have some positive commentary around teen case packs, you talked about enrollment. so maybe just talk to us on how long it might take for the teen case pack program in north america to give that segment a shot in the arm and then your plans to roll that out internationally? i've got a follow-up.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
jon, on the teen side, remember, we kind of lost -- or we had a muted signal on the team side. it needs to be very clear from quarter to quarter before covid. if you remember last year, it was much more muted. this year, we're hoping to see a less muted cycle.
and i think we're starting to feel that, jon. so it's -- i don't think you can look too much between what we're doing between the first quarter and second quarter and pull a clear teen signal out of there. the other thing on teen too is there's always competitive concern with other clear aligner whatever. but basically, this is a wires and brackets competition with us.
it's always been and continues to be that way. and in new products that we're launching these teen packs, we feel good about them. they've been -- as i mentioned in my script too, they've been received well. and it's been with the lower-end orthodontics from our standpoint that haven't done a lot of teen cases in the past.
and that's a segment that we were fishing for to give them more confidence to be able to move in with teens. so we're not declaring victory, but we feel we have a good product that's timed well. and we're not seeing the cycles in the teen marketplace as we're seeing in the adult marketplace. and obviously, jon, as we get through the third quarter, we'll have a much better understanding of how we turn out that way.
but i didn't pull anything out between the first and the second quarter that concerned me.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. helpful. thank you. and then for my second one, let me try to maybe jam two in one, and hopefully not make a mess of it.
so just for us on the 3q versus 2q overall case volumes, china is reopened. china is a decent chunk of business for you guys. so if china snaps back, you talked about shanghai, then maybe talk to us on why we wouldn't see you guys resume some sequential growth 3q versus 2q? i know there's many other markets. and then maybe just to stick with china.
i just love your thoughts on what's going on over there, maybe in terms of market share, your main competitor had some quasi numbers out recently. it looked like they were down mid-single digits in cases 1h 2022 year over year, which quite honestly, i actually thought that was a good number considering the environment. so i would love your thoughts on just china and your ability to hold share on what's going on from a market share perspective? thanks, guys.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll start with the china and move backwards, jon. and i'll get john involved here, too. but from the china side, obviously, we saw what you published there, whatever, but i looked at angel numbers, and it basically same thing we experienced.
i mean, we experienced a shutdown of shanghai, slowdowns in some other regions, and there was nothing in those numbers that really surprised me. as i look at china, our ability to compete there. i feel great about it. and again, our investments we've made there in treatment planning and manufacturing.
we've only added to that. the efficiency of those organizations have done well. our product is great for that marketplace, and some of the most difficult cases that we encounter exist there too. so i feel good about our ability to compete in that market against angel or anyone else who's there.
we just need a stable marketplace that we can operate in, and it hasn't been stable for -- goodness knows, it's been, what, almost two years. and i mean i just read this morning, the wuhan's looking at the close down. so i mean, jon, there's a lot of variability there, a concern with covid and shutdowns, particularly in the second half of this year in china, but i continue to be concerned about that can disrupt the marketplace. but if that stays clear, we're going to have china in the second half that we can operate from.
to answer your question, i feel good about our competitive position there, our ability to compete against with anyone.
john morici -- chief financial officer
and we should see some of the sequential history that we normally see in our business. it goes to what joe said that, there's just some unforeseen variables that are still there. if there is a shutdown in china, that will impact our numbers. if there's no shutdown, we should see sequential improvement.
and then you have some of the other macro economics that we've talked about in terms of potential recession or other things that people are concerned about, that affects their decisions on whether they go into treatment. but we're watching closer to see how sequentially things are behaving and making investments appropriate based on what we see.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
and jon, sorry, just staying back to your second question --
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
sorry. if i can just jump in --
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
go ahead, jon.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
sorry, joe. i was just going to say, john and joe, maybe to follow up on that lasts comment just for clarity purposes because i think it's an important one. are you guys saying sort of as you sit here today, who the heck knows what's going on with wuhan, i don't know, something worse incrementally with the economy. but as we sit here today in late july, you're expecting the resumption of sequential growth off the 2q number, this evening?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
well, i'd say, jon, expecting anything in this market might be a sign of a low iq. when you look at what's going on in china, i'm not going to sit here and tell you i expect a stable market in the second half based on their covid policies. so i hope -- from the united states standpoint, there's a lot going on trying to explain to the teen market overall outside of china, i feel is the most stable market we have, and the one that we're ready to compete with, and we're moving into seasonality, what really makes a difference. we have -- we're positioned well with products.
but as you know, jon, as well as anybody, that's always been a wires and brackets marketplace. we've been taking share 1.5 points, two points a year. we're hoping some moves we make can make that better, but we'll know a lot more when the third quarter is over in the sense.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thanks, guys.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jon.
operator
thank you, mr. block. our next question comes from the line of jeff johnson with baird. please proceed.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, guys. hey, joe, so i just wanted to talk maybe on the doctor shift to that number this quarter. it's trended down each of the last couple of quarters.
this quarter in the americas, it did trend back up just a touch. what are your views on what that means? is that a -- market stabilized a little bit? is that maybe the competitive positioning is stabilizing a little bit? just how do you view that number in the americas? and is there room left in the americas for that number over the next couple of years to keep moving higher? are you kind of at a point where you've saturated kind of the americas market with a number of doctors who are going to be performing in these cases?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
just to answer your last part of your question first, jeff. no, we have a lot of room to grow in the americas, too. in united states, canada, but also you have to throw in latin america and brazil in that. there's a lot of growth, john and i have ported over these numbers a lot.
you know what happens, if you backed these numbers up before really the big surge in orders that we had before, we can draw a line through these things. it doesn't upset us. you have to split orthos and gps very clearly. remember, you have some gps that do like three cases a year.
as things kind of slow down, they'll be out of the circulation for a while and then they order another and whatever. and these numbers will go up 81, 1,000, 2,000, we'll see them go up and down. but don't look at this in any way as that we're saturated in this marketplace, both from an orthodontic standpoint and a gp standpoint. jeff, the other thing too, i think, that people forget from an orthodontic standpoint is that our orthodontists who do teens.
these are orthodontists that are really committed to invisalign for the most part, and they do a lot of teens. but we still have a significant amount of orthodontists at do invisalign almost exclusively for adults. and so you'll see that whole piece from a utilization standpoint as we increase our team penetration, you should see the utilization rates there improve.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes, that's helpful. and then maybe kind of a follow-up on all that a two-parter, just the international number again, kind of, did tick down a little bit that number of factors shipped to internationally. one, i would assume you think there's a lot more room even there to saturate that market over the next few years, that would seem to make sense to me anyway. but is there any way to look at what that number did in china? and was there sequential decline largely driven by the shutdowns in china, or ex-china, would that number have been up? and then i was a little surprised to hear cases down, i think you said in uk year over year.
is that just a tough comp, or what's going on in the uk? i think we are all aware of china pressures in early, japan pressures or early quarter japan pressures, but uk caught me off guard a little bit there? thanks.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
i'll answer the uk piece first. the uk was outstanding for us last year. remember, europe grew 300% for us last year, jeff, right? the uk led that. so i'm sure that uk number is higher than what that aggregate number is.
and so what you're seeing is adult retrenchment in the uk from an order standpoint, but not an indication of a utilization issue that i'd say, across the doctor base that we have in the uk. 
john morici -- chief financial officer
and just on the china piece or the apac piece for international. so that was certainly an impact in terms of the lockdowns, and doctors just not being able to transact and therefore, don't have ship to. so the international side of the doctor ship was certainly impacted by covid. we won't break it out by the sub-regions.
but that was an impact that look, as those offices open up, as those lockdowns are minimized, we would expect that to increase from a ship to stand.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
thanks guys.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, jeff.
operator
thank you, mr. johnson. our next question is from the line of justin lin with william blair. please proceed.
justin lin -- william blair and company
hi, good afternoon. can you just touch on your sales and marketing spending strategy a little bit in the short-term and longer term? i guess, when can you decide to flip the switch?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
you mean flip the switches as far as up or down?
justin lin -- william blair and company
yes. yes.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, obviously, obviously, we saw our adults dramatically decreased, and so the return on investment in some specific geographies. john, as i take a look at it, and we don't eliminate it, but we reduce it in accordance with what we think the demand pattern is. and we spread it around into other countries that we feel we can get a higher return on.
and we just basically sizing our advertising to what we think the demand patterns are around the business in different areas. and so i wouldn't look at this as any way that we'll continue to advertise aggressively and promote our brand and to drive value in our change to bring customers to our doctor base, but we can be responsible to we can advertise at the rate that we did last year when we were growing at over 100% in a lot of these regions, we have to modify it somewhat in order to address that demand pattern.
john morici -- chief financial officer
and we adjust into the market. so keep the overall brand awareness, keep that averages. remember, still sudden spending even as we right-size things, hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing and media to be able to go to market, drive that awareness. but then in certain markets, if there's covid or if there's economic concerns and so on, we're adjusting things to make sure that we right-size and continue to make sure that we make the right trade-off between how we're investing in go-to-market, and continue to reinvest in the rest of the business like r&d and operations.
justin lin -- william blair and company
got it. that's very helpful. and i guess just pivoting to a more sort of higher-level question. any update on commercial operations in sort of your emerging markets like brazil, india, africa, what would you say current penetration levels are over there? and i guess, realistically, how much revenue can you capture from those regions in the next, let's say, five to 10 years?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
and the region that you mentioned were really underpenetrated, huge opportunity. i mean we've seen great progress in brazil. we're seeing good progress in india. reported in -- i mean, it's -- when we talk about those 500 million patients, they're out there.
and the way to get them is we do -- we put salespeople in place. we put the right kind of capability on the ground. this is a direct sales force that you have to have in order to sell our product line. but to answer your specific question, the penetration rates aren't even close.
and that's -- again, you can see that in our script, that's how we remain so confident that in a stable environment, we'll continue to perform really well.
john morici -- chief financial officer
and we're built as a company to really expand into those markets. we've got that global footprint for manufacturing now in all three geographies. we've got treatment planning. we've got that go-to-market sales force -- direct sales force with great products.
so we're built in all those markets. we like the dynamics of these markets where you have a growing middle class, big population. you've got people who want to straighten their teeth, and we've got a great way for them to get to that. so all the markets you described as well as many others, those are where we think of some of the investments because it's a great return on those investments.
justin lin -- william blair and company
got it. thank you very much.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. lin. our next question is from the line of jason bednar with piper sandler. please proceed.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hi, jason.
jason bednar -- piper sandler
hey, good afternoon. yes. so, joe, i'll go big picture here in the us market, and maybe go back to clarifying point on jon block's question earlier. on one hand, demand in the category broadly just did seem to show some signs of moderation in the second half of last year relation to a bit of a leading indicator in other parts of high end then on the help of the average consumer.
i mean this needs are going to be coming into some easier absolute comparisons as we head into the back half of this year, which i don't know, maybe helps reverse this downtrend in invisalign case growth. but i guess we're also in the early days of what still could be some more pain coming for the consumer. so i guess what dominates in your opinion? do the easier comps dominate, or does it more challenge on consumer dominate? and again, just thinking about the domestic market you're and ignoring again some of that china and predictability that's out there.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll let john take a shot at this, too. but i would say, i mean, obviously, you talk about easier comps. i mean when you're comping against 300% growth, like we just talked about, it's one of the tougher comps on a large number i've had in my business career.
and so obviously, when you get some light on that line, it helps somewhat. but consumer confidence. i'd say, outside of the covid, the way i'd look at the business again is covid affected asia in a big way. we had some covid staffing issues or whatever, but predominantly in the west, it's consumer confidence that we look at.
and so those consumer confidence numbers start to equalize to start to get better. some of the ones we look in europe are all-time lows. i feel that means a lot. it means that means more to meet in those comparisons years from here.
we report more confidence in consumers in a trend where in that kind of environment, we think we see the adult cases resume at a pace that we'd be equal to our long-term growth rate.
john morici -- chief financial officer
yes. it's consumer confidence overall, and in certain cases --
jason bednar -- piper sandler
i guess, just real quick, i guess i would -- yes, i guess i was just focusing more on the us market. and i totally understand europe and china and apac and all the different dynamics there. but just in within the us market, i mean, the comps do get easier, absolute comps -- they did tick down starting in the second half of last year. so just i'd be where i'd be focusing the question here, sorry to interrupt.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. no, jason, that's ok. i look at the united states too is -- i just give you consumer confidence more than anything. not just saying that there's no big variant issue or something that happens with covid.
we're all kind of have ptsd in that sense and what we experienced over the last two years. but yes, i like the comparison year over year. that's going to be helpful. but those consumer confidence numbers, whether i'm talking about europe or i'm talking about the states, those are the ones that we stay alluded to that we think are a really good indicator in the sense of our market, and that adult market that we appeal to, both in the gp segment and the adult market in the orthodontic segment, too.
john morici -- chief financial officer
and the piece that i would add to the us is just that as we get into teen season now as we go from q2 to q3. teens will be important to see. we've got great products. we've got great go-to-market opportunities to be able to grow in those markets and get more market share.
when we think of teens everywhere in the world, it's single digit and even in the us. so we look at growth opportunities that will be teens, maybe a little bit less of more resistant to maybe some of that consumer concerns that they have. consumer concerns certainly show up on the adult side, but we think teams can help offset that just a bit because it's less discretionary.
jason bednar -- piper sandler
ok. that's helpful. and maybe just a quick follow-up here. a lot of questions out there right now from investors on the decremental margin impact for the business with volumes and revenue doing what it's doing here.
you added a lot of head count. it's significantly expanded branding and advertising efforts during the pandemic really helped to widen the competitive moat, so really impressive. it sounds like some of that marketing though has been recalibrated here. are there further resets that -- with the opex structure that might be necessary in this environment? and i guess, what's the trigger for you to decide that a further rightsizing is necessary?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
i mean rightsizing, when i hear words like that, it means that we've gone to the layoffs, so we haven't laid anything off. remember, we -- any one off in that sense. we normally hire to a 20% to 30% growth rate. and so -- and we -- our opex spend is in that range, too.
so, obviously, we didn't -- we couldn't hire in that range, and so if you call that a cutback, it's a cutback from our normal opex. what we do is we normally balance opex to revenue at about a 50% range, and there's a lot of variables in that line from an opex standpoint that we can go about. remember, our most important areas that we want to make sure we take care of is our commercial team, our engineering effort and also our marketing. we know those are really key.
and we focus on those, and we balance the business well. john, anything you want to add?
john morici -- chief financial officer
it's a balance, both short and long-term. so as we balance out our plans, we look to the growth opportunities we have, we want to make sure we continue to invest in those growth opportunities. but then obviously, we have to be mindful of the current conditions that we're in, and we'll adjust as needed to still maximize the return on investments that we're making.
jason bednar -- piper sandler
all right. thanks so much.
john morici -- chief financial officer
thanks jason.
operator
thank you, mr. bednar. our next question is from the line of erin wright with morgan stanley. please proceed.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. and i wanted to ask another americas teen question here. but just given the seasonality and given this is an area where you should have some better visibility.
i just want to clarify, does this -- does this mean you're going to see a meaningful sequential pickup in the coming quarter, or why would that not happen for you? and just given that should be an area more under your control here. thanks.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. our normal growth pattern between the second quarter and the third quarter is flat to down 1 percentage point or so. john can confirm that. so the second quarter to third quarter is a big teen season, but there's other parts of our portfolio that kind of balance out with that.
it's not traditionally a jump from second to third quarter. but again, we're focused on teens because we feel teens have a lot less elasticity than what adults have right now based on the consumer confidence level. so i just -- but i'd just caution you here. remember, this is a wires and brackets play.
it's something that's systemic that we have worked on for years. we have many new products like invisalign first, i mean give advancement and several new teen products that help us with this. the new teen packs help also. we think we're well positioned, but we have to get into the quarter and be able to assess how well that market is actually holding up.
john morici -- chief financial officer
but specifically in the us, us teen, we should see sequential improvement as we get into teen season, going from q2 to q3, notwithstanding any occurrences that happened from an economic standpoint, but the expectation is given our products, given the opportunity, given the utilization that we have, we should be able to see growth. notwithstanding, anything else that gets in our way.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thanks. and then asps for the balance of the year, how should we be thinking about that and the fx impact?
john morici -- chief financial officer
erin, fx, obviously, q1 to q2 was a big impact in fx. we see it in the numbers from revenue all the way down to our eps. i would think of it's tough to forecast where fx is going to go. certainly, dollar has strengthened.
i think you kind of take the numbers that they're at now and kind of play that forward for the rest of the year is how we look at that. i think from an overall asp standpoint, there's always going to be puts and takes. so we're not doing anything different from a discounting standpoint, how we're going to market and so on. you might have some mix effects that come through.
but i take the fx rates kind of as they are now, project those forward and then asp should be too much different than what you see now notwithstanding any fx.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you, ms. wright. the next question is from the line of brandon couillard with jefferies. please proceed.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks, john, a quick follow-up on that fx question. i appreciate all the details in the deck. it is very, very helpful. just curious, what is the estimated impact of currency on the operating margin for the year now in the ballpark?
john morici -- chief financial officer
well, ballpark, i would look at that is about one point, maybe just over one point of impact. we saw that 1.1 point impact from q1 to q2 in op margin. i would kind of look at the full year and about the same.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. and then joe, on the scanner business, any color between the north american segment and international in terms of growth rate, how would you sort of characterize the capital spending environment in those two regions, specifically?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll start with -- i mean, obviously, we had trouble selling scanners in china because china shut down. and china is one of our bigger markets is between china and japan and asia. so i didn't look at that so much as and overall market problem, i looked at that as more of a covid problem.
and so hopeful of, as i mentioned before, if that covid stays clear, that will write itself. united states, just a good job by the team, strong demand there. 5g plus tends to be the really strong scanner out there. on the restorative side, dentists liking the neri, the near-infrared technology for carries detection and orthodontists continue like the exactness of how our workflows at all from an overall itero standpoint.
so i feel good about the americas and what the performance was in that piece. and as i mentioned in my script is 40% with a large installed base now, 40% is services, too, which is really helpful in that business overall. and look, i feel good about, again, our scanners in europe compared to get some pretty big numbers again last year. so i wouldn't be blinded by the year-over-year number in that sense.
but europe has the added pressure right now from a ukraine standpoint. it's just -- it wears on the consumer sentiment piece. i think it makes docs a little more reluctant in -- but there's -- i feel good about our position in europe from a scanner standpoint. and as the market hopefully starts to stabilize here, we'll see that business that we had return loans.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of kevin caliendo with ubs. please proceed.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
hi, thanks for getting me in. so just want to think about how -- or what it would take for you guys to feel comfortable with providing guidance again, or feeling comfortable that you can hit your longer term targets rather than making progress toward it. do we need to see consumer confidence go back above 99% or something like that, or i mean, at the beginning of the year, you caveated and said, listen, if there's no more covid outbreaks, we'd still be able to do this. what do you need to see before you can come to us and say, hey, we're back on track or we think we can do this? so we feel comfortable.
we're going to be able to grow at ex-rate going forward, even be able to provide guidance for like a quarter going forward, even if it's not for the full year. what needs to happen, in your mind?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
i'll turn it over to john. but first of all is, remember, we don't carry inventory in this business outside of scanners. so it's a real-time business. we don't have any inventory to reflect from or any -- very little business from a week-to-week standpoint.
so i'll move it over to john, but keep that in mind that we, kind of, feel these trends early on both ends. as the economy picks up, we'll probably feel it first. and as it turns down, we feel it by just the nature of the business first.
john morici -- chief financial officer
it really comes down to, kevin, more just having more predictability on a macro basis, understanding you mentioned covid and thinking that we're through it, then you have china lockdowns or some of the consumer sentiment and things that come up that are outside of our control, we feel very good about being able to control what we can control, making the right investments as we go to market or adding investments in r&d to better our products and so on, and drive that return. and, therefore, like i said, we can manage that 20%, that's something that we can manage as we go through the quarter. it really comes out to having more predictability on a macro basis. and once we get confidence in that, and we work our way to that understanding, look, the economies are going to do what they're going to do.
they're going to go up or down. but if i have more predictability on the direction that they're going and how they're going to go, then we can give a good forecast.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
all right. appreciate that. thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. caliendo. our next question is from the line of michael ryskin with bank of america. please proceed.
michael ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question guys. i have kind of a follow-up to one of the earlier ones, and some that kevin just asked sort of on the moving pieces going forward. i mean we spent a lot of time talking about china lockdowns and the impact that had, and there was some discussion on consumer confidence as well.
but it was sort of brought up in the sense of, well, what happens when things improve. i hate to be the pessimist here, but can we talk about the other side of things as inflation is one thing and consumer sentiment and consumer confidence is another thing. but recessionary impact, if unemployment goes higher, if job losses start to accelerate, there is a scenario where things are -- should get worse for the next couple of quarters before they get better. so can you talk through sort of how you view the likelihood of that happening, the impact you think it will have on the business? and also sort of what's your response going to be what's the game plan? you talked a little bit about controlling costs in the quarter already.
what would be the other levers you would pull if things for the consumer in the americas and in europe get materially worse over the next three to six to nine months?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
it's joe. look, i think you've seen that -- i feel we've been responsible in the sense of adjusting the business to a lower demand signal than the business is used to having. i think you saw us respond the same way when covid hit in march of in 2020, and how we ran the business. if it gets worse, and it could get worse is the way -- i mean from the standpoint of whatever happens from an economic standpoint.
i'd just say that, look, john and i come from businesses where we've been through these cycles. we know how to operate in a down cycle. we run a business that way. this is a growth business, and we'll treat it as a growth business, but we're responsible from a standpoint of making sure that we adjust this business to whatever economic conditions that we see out there.
john morici -- chief financial officer
and as a result, we've been able to make these adjustments. we're fortunate as a company to have the cash position, the balance sheet that we have and all these other. and in the end, you know the story, we have a huge opportunity to be able to grow. you just have this in our way.
and like joe said, and what many others say is it could get worse. we have to be able to be able to balance those short-term worse to with our long-term goal of being able to make invisalign the standard of care. and that's what we're balancing right now, and that could play out -- that will play out in the next -- whatever, a year to 18 months, things will evolve. we hope that the economies improve.
we hope that that a lot of this has just got a short term and things get better. and when things do get better, we're well positioned to be able to grow into this market, but we just have to be based on the realities of what's happening in short term.
michael ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and a quick follow-up, if i can. on 1q, you kind of gave some comments on pacing through the quarter, and gave some comments on april as it relates to march. kind of get the sense that things probably slowed down at the end of 2q or bit in june, both between fx and china lockdowns being worse.
any sense you can give on sort of the progression through the course of 2q? and just any early signs you've seen from july, again, realize that walk-down in china and fx is playing a big role. but maybe if you could just focus on america's trends through the quarter, and july. that will be helpful.
john morici -- chief financial officer
yes. no, it's a good question. so if you think like an overall picture, you hit some of the fx and so on, you look -- everybody can look at fx rates and see the changes and so on, you can project based on those. when you talk about a covid lockdown or talk specifically in china, there was an impact for us.
and we've seen that in the first quarter, we saw it in the second quarter, but it's -- happens in china. it happens in every place that we see where there's a lockdown, we have a reduction in volume. where that lockdown goes away, the volume starts to come back. so i would say when you think of china, as you go from lockdown to not lockdown, that's favorable for us.
we start to see some of the volume come back. and i think when you look at -- i think part of your question is around the us, i think what do you see for the us is it's -- maybe things stabilizing a little bit more. you're not seeing -- maybe it's pretty similar to what we exited q2 into q3. and i think when you look at the team benefit that ideally comes through with some of the products and programs that we have in teen in the us and other places, but focus on the us, we think that's helpful for us as we go from q2 to q3.

greetings. welcome to the align q2 2022 earnings call. [operator instructions]. i will now turn the conference over to your host, shirley stacy with align technology.
you may begin.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. i'm shirley stacy, vice president of corporate communications and investor relations. joining me for today's call is joe hogan, president and ceo; and john morici, cfo. we issued second quarter 2022 financial results today via business wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com.
today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately one month. a telephone replay will be available today by approximately 5:30 pm eastern time through 5:30 pm eastern time on august 10. to access the telephone replay, domestic callers should dial 866-813-9403 with access code 137829. international callers should dial 929-458-6194 using the same access code.
as a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about align's future events and product outlook. these forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission available on our website and at sec.gov. actual results may vary significantly and align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. we have posted historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations, including our gaap to non-gaap reconciliation, if applicable, and our second quarter 2022 conference call slides on our website under quarterly results.
please refer to these files for more detailed information. and with that, i'd like to turn the call over to align technology's president and ceo, joe hogan. joe? 
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, shirley. good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. on our call today, i'll provide an overview of our q2 results and discuss the performance of our two operating segments, systems and services and clear aligners. john will provide more detail on our financial performance and our view for the remainder of the year.
following that, i'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. i'm pleased to report solid second quarter results with top line revenues relatively unchanged from q1, and operating margin of approximately 20%, despite unfavorable foreign exchange. the underlying market for orthodontics continues to be impacted by macroeconomic environment factors and lingering effects of covid-19 variants in certain markets. notwithstanding, these headwinds, we've remained focused on achieving our strategic initiatives, including opening new offices in the middle east and africa and our new manufacturing facility in poland, launching new solutions to better support the way our customers want to do business, such as a doctor subscription program, and teen case packs, and announcing new products and innovation to help our doctors and their patients.
these new innovations are revolutionizing the digital treatment planning and helping to drive the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry. align is well-positioned to withstand the current market conditions to lead the digital revolution in orthodontics and dentistry as the environment and growth trends improve. for system and services, q2 revenues were up 4.7% sequentially and up slightly year over year, compared to q2 2021 year-over-year growth of 215%. q2 services and systems revenues increased sequentially driven by scanner volume growth in the americas and apac, partially offset by lower volume in emea, and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
the itero element 5d imaging system continues to represent the majority of our scanner volume as doctors recognize the benefits of going digital. in apac, the itero entry-level flex scanner offering was up sequentially in q2, reflecting increased adoption. i'm also pleased with sequentially increasing services revenues in q2, reflecting growth from the installed base. services revenues represent approximately 40% of our systems and services business.
for our clear aligner segment, q2 revenues were down slightly sequentially and down 5.1% year over year, compared to our q2 2021 record year-over-year revenue growth of 182%. for the quarter, q2 clear aligner volumes reflect sequential growth across the americas and parts of emea, partially offset by china, and uk q2 invisalign case starts for teens and younger patients was 177.3000 up slightly sequentially and down 2.1% year over year compared last year when our teen case shipment growth rate was an all-time high. for q2, invisalign first for kids as young as six years old, grew year over year and was strong across all regions. during q2, we introduced invisalign teen packs in the us and canada and france.
teen packs, our new subscription program, which enables orthodontists to buy clear aligners and packs in advance, similar to the way they buy wires and brackets today. our teen case pack simplified the ordering process and make the billing more predictable for doctors. teen case packs also include exclusive practice development benefits with the invisalign brand and requires an incremental volume commitment from doctors. to date, enrollment has been encouraging with early adoptions highest among doctors who have not historically used invisalign aligners to treat their teen patients.
for other non-case revenues, which include retention products such as vivera retainers, clinical training and education, accessories, e-commerce, and our new subscription programs such as our dsp revenues, were up both sequentially and year over year. for retainers, q2 shipments had strong momentum with sequential and year-over-year growth across all regions driven by both submitters and utilization. momentum in our doctor subscription program continued and q2 revenues increased over 60% sequentially. now let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results, starting with the americas.
for the americas region, q2 invisalign case volumes were up sequentially, reflecting increased submissions from the orthodontic channel and increased utilization from the gp channel. from a product standpoint, q2 sequential invisalign case growth reflects increases in both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, including invisalign first and invisalign moderate. q2 also benefited from increased utilization in the dso channel. our international clear aligners, q2 invisalign case volumes were down 1.7% sequentially, primarily as a result of the headwinds described previously.
for emea, q2 invisalign case volumes were down slightly primarily reflecting a slight increase in iberia and italy, offset primarily by slightly lower sequential volumes in the uk and france. for q2, expansion market shipments declined sequentially. q2 invisalign teen patients increased sequentially driven by an increase in the number of doctors submitting teen cases. turning to apac.
invisalign case volumes were down slightly, reflecting a full quarter effect of continued lockdowns in china. for q2, taiwan, hong kong, japan, and india performed well during the quarter. on a year-over-year basis, invisalign case shipments growth was strong in japan, india, taiwan, thailand, and korea. the apac teen case volume increased year over year, primarily driven by increased doctor submitters.
turning to new innovations. the align digital platform is an integrated suite of proprietary technologies and services delivered as a seamless end-to-end solution to customers that connects all users, doctors, labs patients and consumers to transform smiles, and change lives. our technology advancements help our doctor customers deliver superior clinical outcomes, treatment efficiency and also superior patient experience. in q2, we introduced invisalign outcome simulator pro and cone beam being computed tomography systems, integration for clincheck software, building on several new innovations announced last quarter that we'll begin rolling out across the regions in august.
invisalign outcome simulator pro, the next-generation patient communication tool that empowers doctors to help patients visualize their potential new smile after invisalign treatment. use in-phase visualization in 3d dentition view, all done chairside in minutes. cone beam computed tomography systems, or what we call cbct, integration for clincheck software is designed to deliver a complete view of a patient's roots, crown, and jawbone. cbct integration for clincheck software enables doctors to confidently deliver a more informed invisalign clear liner treatment plan or a wide range of cases.
the user-friendly interface makes easy for doctors to see their patients root, crown, and jawbone and one automatically digitally fused 3d model. this allows doctors to tailor their treatment plan based on their experience and their patients' needs. cbct integration for clincheck software gives doctors the control and confidence to expand treatment planning to a broad range of mal inclusions, including surgical, restorative, expansion, extraction as well as teen cases with impacted or unterrupted team. while it's still early in the commercialization of these new products, initial feedback from doctors is encouraging.
we are excited to begin scaling them across our customer base in the second half of 2022. also, during the quarter, we awarded 11 new research grants, totaling $275,000 to universities around the world. through our annual research awards program, we help advance orthodontic and dental research, furthering our commitment to the future of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. our consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the invisalign system, and driving that demand to invisalign doctors offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles.
for q2, we had over 16.2 million visits to our websites, a 15% year-over-year increase, and delivered over 6.3 billion impressions. both metrics were lower versus q1 as we chose to rightsize our size and media spend in q2, given the macroeconomic environment. during the quarter, we built on our successful ""invis is"" multimedia campaign and launched in the us the next evolution with two new campaigns, invis is trauma-free, targeted at teens, and invis is when everything clicks, targeted at adults. our invis is trauma-free campaign highlights the benefits of invisalign treatment, while numerously juxtaposing teams with the significant hassles involved with using braces.
our invis is when everything clicks campaign showcases invisalign treatment, transforming smiles and the resulting confidence it gives the young adults. both campaigns will be rolled out to markets around the world in q3. about some of our consumer patient app my invisalign continued to increase with 1.8 million downloads to date. uses of our four digital tools continues to increase, for example, invisalign virtual appointment tool was used over 12,000 times, and our insurance verification feature was used 36,000 times in q2.
further, we received more than 91,000 patient photos in our virtual care feature globally, which continues to provide us with rich data to leverage our artificial intelligence capabilities and improve our services for doctors and patients. additional consumer demand metrics are included in our q2 earnings slides posted on our website. we are pleased with our q2 systems and services revenues, which were up 5% sequentially and up 1% year over year. q2 sequential growth primarily reflects higher scanner volumes in the americas and apac, and increased subscriptions.
year-over-year results primarily reflect increased scanner revenues in the americas, offset by lower volume in apac and emea. growth of our itero scanner installed base is driving an increase in services revenue. on a year-over-year basis, systems and services growth reflects increased service revenues from our largest scanner installed base, higher subscription revenues and increased sales of scanner once leased. the number of intraoral digital scans used for invisalign case submissions in q2 reflect continued adoption of our digital scanners and our larger installed base.
total worldwide intraoral digital scan submitted to start an invisalign case in q2 increased 88.4% from 82.2% in q2 of last year. international intraoral digital scans for invisalign case submissions increased 84.4%, up from 76.2% in q2 of last year. for the americas, 91.4% of invisalign cases were submitted using an intraoral digital scan, compared to 87% in q2 last year. cumulatively, over 60.4 million orthodontic scans and over 12.6 million restorative scans have been performed with itero scanners.
our q2 exocad cad/cam products and services, which include restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design offerings are included in our systems and services revenue. exocad products and services are helping extend our digital dental solutions and broaden the align digital platform toward fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows. during the quarter, exocad released dental cad 3.1 rijeka in the new powerful lab software, which saves design time and offers more intuitive workflows along the designs earning from cad to cam. in addition, the release -- the exocad release launched the new, myexocad portal, introducing mandatory end-user software use registration that for the first time, allows exocad to collect information about who and how customers are using the software.
this expands the opportunities for future product improvements. also during the quarter, we signed a new long-term contract with exocad's largest customer, arming gearbox, further strengthening our relationship. finally, we continue to execute our strategy of geographic expansion. in june, our european manufacturing facility in wroclaw, poland began manufacturing clear aligners for the emea region.
locally, for the first time, we also continued our operational expansion in poland with our latest treatment planning facility. our expanded operation in poland supports invisalign doctors in local languages, increases our flexibility and timeliness and supporting our doctor customers across the region, and we expect will positively influence the quality and time of preparation of clincheck treatment plans and provide our doctor customers with benefits of digital orthodontics with the invisalign system. we are uniquely positioned with manufacturing and treatment planning in all three regions, and no other clear aligner manufacturer has our global footprint and capabilities. with that, i'll now turn the call over to john.
john morici -- chief financial officer
thanks, joe. now for our q2 financial results. total revenues for the second quarter were $969.6 million, down 0.4% from the prior quarter and down 4.1% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. this is compared to q2 2021 revenues of $1 billion, which had a year-over-year growth rate of 186.9%.
for clear aligners, q2 revenues of $798.4 million were down 1.4% sequentially, due primarily to product mix and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher non-case revenues, and down 5.1% year over year, primarily reflecting lower volumes, unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and product mix shift, partially offset by higher additional aligners per order processing fees and higher non-case revenues. q2 2022 clear aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $12.3 million, or approximately 1.5% sequentially, and approximately $32.9 million, or approximately 4% year over year. for q2, invisalign comprehensive asps decreased sequentially and increased year-over-year. on a sequential basis, the decline in comprehensive asps reflect higher discounts and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional aligners.
on a year-over-year basis, higher comprehensive asps reflect the impact of higher additional aligners and per order processing fees, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts. q2 invisalign non-comprehensive asps increased sequentially and year over year. on a sequential basis, invisalign non-comprehensive asps were favorably impacted by lower discounts, partially offset by product mix and unfavorable foreign exchange. on a year-over-year basis, higher invisalign non-comprehensive asps reflect lower discounts, per order processing fees and higher additional aligners, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix shift.
clear aligner of deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $25.4 million, or 2.3% sequentially and $231 million, or up 2.5% year over year, and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. q2 2022 systems and services revenue of $171.2 million were up 4.7% sequentially, primarily due to higher scanner volume and asp, and were up slightly by 0.8% year over year, primarily from higher services revenues from our larger installed base, partially offset by lower scanner volume and lower asp. systems and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.9 million, or approximately 1.7% sequentially. on a year over year basis, systems and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $7 million, or approximately 3.9%.
systems and services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was $13.3 million, or 5.4% sequentially, and up $99.6 million, or 62.3% year over year primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. moving on to gross margin. second quarter overall gross margin was 70.9%, down two points sequentially and down 4.1 points year over year. overall, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points sequentially and 1.1 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange.
clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 73.3%, down 1.5 points sequentially due to lower asps and higher freight costs. clear aligner gross margin was down 3.6 points year over year due to a higher mix of additional aligner volume, higher freight and manufacturing spend, partially offset by higher asps. systems and services gross margin for the second quarter was 59.8%, down 3.6 points sequentially due to higher manufacturing variances and freight costs, partially offset by higher asps. systems and services gross margin was down 6.1 points year over year due to lower asps and higher manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher service mix.
q2 operating expenses were $499.4 million, down sequentially 2.3%, and up 2% year over year. on a sequential basis, operating expenses were down by $11.9 million mainly due to lower incentive compensation and controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs. year over year, operating expenses increased by $9.7 million, reflecting our continued investment in marketing, sales, and r&d activities and investments commensurate with business growth. on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions and acquisition costs, operating expenses were $466 million down sequentially 3% and up 1% year over year.
our second quarter operating income of $188.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 19.4% and down 0.9 points sequentially and down 7.2 points year over year. operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1.1 points sequentially due to foreign exchange. the year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributable to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 2.4 points. on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, of intangibles related to certain acquisitions and acquisition costs, operating margin for the second quarter was 23.3%, down 0.7 points sequentially and down 6.5 points year over year.
interest and other income expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $14.6 million, down sequentially by $4 million and down year over year by $14.5 million, primarily due to larger net foreign exchange losses from the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar. the gaap effective tax rate in the second quarter was 35%, compared to 28.4% in the first quarter and 25.7% in the second quarter of the prior year. our non-gaap effective tax rate was 25.6% in the second quarter compared to 24.2% in the first quarter and 19.5% in the second quarter of the prior year. the second quarter gaap effective tax rate was higher than the first quarter effective tax rate primarily due to foreign income tax at different rates and lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
second quarter net income per diluted share was $1.44, down sequentially $0.26 and down $1.07 compared to the prior year. our eps was unfavorably impacted by $0.26 on a sequential basis and $0.42 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. on a non-gaap basis, net income per share was $2 for the second quarter, down $0.13 sequentially and down $1.04 year over year. moving on to the balance sheet.
as of june 30, 2022, cash, cash equivalents, and short- and long-term marketable securities were $977.2 million, down sequentially $143.4 million and down $109.2 million year over year. of our $977.2 million balance, $251.4 million was held in the us and $725.8 million was held by our international entities. q2 accounts receivable balance was $931.9 million, down approximately 2% sequentially. our overall days sales outstanding was 85 days, down approximately two days sequentially and up approximately 13 days as compared to q2 last year.
cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $127 million. capital expenditures for the second quarter were $76 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $51 million. in q2, we purchased $200 million of our common stock through an accelerated stock repurchase program, receiving approximately 757,000 shares at an average price of $264.37 per share.
we are over halfway through our may 2021 $1 billion repurchase program, and have approximately $450 million remaining available for purchase. now turning to full year 2022 and the factors that influence our views on our business outlook. overall, our q2 results were solid, and we feel good about the execution across the business, especially in an increasingly challenging global economic environment. delivering revenues and volumes relatively unchanged from q1 and down only slightly year over year despite unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange speak to the strength of our underlying products and services and the size of our market opportunity.
we remain confident in the huge underpenetrated market for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, our technology, and our industry leadership and our ability to execute and make progress toward our long-term model of 20% to 30% revenue growth. we also remain committed to our goal for fiscal 2022 to deliver gaap operating margins above 20%, while making strategic investments in sales, marketing, r&d and operations, notwithstanding the impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, which was not factored into our operating margin guidance for the full year. capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as a digital manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. for 2022, we expect our investment in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million.
this includes our investment in our aligner fabrication facility in wroclaw, poland. in times like these, our strong fundamental business differentiates align, and we are grateful to have a profitable underlying business model that generates strong cash flow as well as a healthy balance sheet that provides flexibility to invest in our growth while supporting our employees, customers, and shareholders. as we move into the second half of the year, we will continue to manage our investments to account for headwinds and uncertainty while focusing on successfully delivering on our strategic growth drivers. with that, i'll turn it back over to joe for final comments.
joe?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. closing q2 in the first half of 2022 has proved to be tougher than we expected. as we continue to navigate macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker consumer confidence and impacts related to covid-19 variance, we cannot lose sight of the strong fundamentals of our business and the enormous market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. the decisions we make this year will have lasting strategic implications for the future of our industry and the competitive landscape.
we are holding true to our business strategy, and making good progress in a very difficult operating environment. we remain committed to balancing investments to drive growth and long-term strategic priorities with near-term headwinds while acting with a sense of urgency to ensure that we're ready to capitalize and extend our global innovation leadership as growth resumes. thanks for your time today. we look forward to updating you on our next earnings call.
with that, i'll turn it over to the operator. operator?

at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from jason bednar with piper sandler. your line is now open.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. hey, everyone. thanks for taking the questions here. joe, from what we've seen and heard in the market, i think it goes without saying that monthly demand has just been quite choppy here in the u.s.
i think july and september were pretty darn soft; august, maybe not as weak but still not great. i guess did you see a similar level of uneven demand when we look outside the u.s.? and i guess is there anything you'd call out geographically or in any of your channels that was maybe less bad than what you were prepared for three months ago?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
jason, we started with not high expectations, to begin with, all right? but i would say the u.s. market panned out the way we thought overall, maybe a little more strength in latin america, a little momentum despite the elections and some economics there. europe just wasn't quite as strong as what we thought. and as we tried to explain in my notes that i really feel it's just -- it's the uncertainty that circulates europe right now and ukraine situation doesn't help either.
from an asia standpoint, we're affected by covid again. we saw it in china, even though we had growth in china, which was respectable, and in japan also, but we saw the market impact in those two areas, too. i felt great about it's a smaller part of the business, but korea, taiwan, thailand, and other businesses that were up significantly, but our major three were still affected, primarily the three is australia and china, and japan with some covid issues. so, it's a way of saying, i think in general, we anticipated where we are, we were hoping for the best year.
but what really grabs me, too, jason, maybe i'm giving you too much for your call is that the teen demand, we felt good about overall across the globe in the united states, too. the teen packs did well overall. and obviously, we'll roll that out in other parts of the world, too. the adult -- the impact on the adult cases is what was -- to me, is astounding in the sense, and you see that flow through the orthodontic community, the gp community, too.
and that's not just in the united states, we see that all over the world.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. all right. that's really helpful. and thanks for all that.
maybe joe or john, just on the margin topic, you are backing away from that 20% margin floor commentary that you had given previously. fully understanding part of this is fx related. but maybe can you talk about how much of it's tied to the decremental impact from lower volumes. and then you fully understand this is a tough macro environment to forecast.
but a lot of investors right now are really trying to get comfortable with how defensible margins and profitability are as we look out to 2023, which i hope it's not, but it could very well be another tough year for the business just given the global macro environment we're in. so, just -- are you willing to provide any guardrails around what we can consider for 2023 margins? or maybe talk about how much flexibility you have in the p&l to offset pressures from lower volumes? thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
jason, it's a fair question. first of all, i'll turn it over to john, but i'm the one that gave that 20% operating margin piece. i had no idea you'd see international currency swings and the way we've seen it. i've been in these jobs for a long time, and you don't expect 25% decreases year over year in currency.
and so, obviously, we had to back up on that piece. i feel good about the way we managed our cost i feel good about where we're investing and where we continue to rightsize. john will give you more specifics.
john morici -- chief financial officer
so, on a constant-currency basis, we expect to be at that 20% or above. it's -- just like joe said, it's pretty dramatic to see the fx changes that we have. as noted in the comments, we said it going to affect the year by two to three points. so, there's no -- there's a commitment to that margin, and we're investing based on volume that we see and other priorities that we have on r&d and go-to-market activities and so on.
but it's just that fx piece that we're calling out. but on a constant-currency basis, we feel that that number of 20% still holds from earlier.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jason.

our next question comes from brandon vazquez with william blair. your line is now open.
brandon vazquez -- william blair and company -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. i wanted to go -- i'd like to go back for a second kind of to the monthly progression just to -- i think what might be helpful to kind of understand underlying market dynamics and maybe you can tease it out a little bit in americas versus international. just -- what were you seeing through the quarter when you -- did you exit the quarter and going into q4, were things stabilizing? were they getting better? were they getting worse? any kind of color you can give us around what the situation is like as we go forward from q3?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
again, like on the last call, brandon, i think it played out the way our expectations, i think were formatted. we talked about teens in the third quarter. and obviously, that's teen season. that played out well from what we anticipated.
and as we mentioned before, we think teens are somewhat shielded -- not completely but shielded from the economic environment because of the time window for treatment and parents that want to help their teens through that whole process. the adult segment was the -- we saw the most volatility in for sure, both in the united states, europe, and in asia. it's hard for me to tell you that we're -- there's any kind of change from month to month or quarter to quarter. it was pretty consistent from what we've seen.
john, would you add anything else?
john morici -- chief financial officer
i mean, that's how we saw it.
brandon vazquez -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. and then internationally, you guys sound pretty excited about kind of the new product launches within china, specifically offering that new maybe lower-tier product. can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? how strong has the recovery been in china? how much of that recovery has come from really opening up the product portfolio there? and how should that kind of continue going forward? thanks.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brandon. that's a good question. i mean, china is a very important market for us. as we talked about on other calls, those tier 3 and tier 4 cities have been an important target for us.
we've known for about two years, we have a hole in our portfolio in those areas, particularly with -- we have comprehensive on top, and then we have a moderate product between it. so, we announced invisalign standard, invisalign adult. and what this does is it just helps us segment the market. these are not -- they can't handle -- these products can have -- handle cases like invisalign first scan or mandibular advancement or some of the sophisticated cases we have out there.
we don't offer cbct, five-minute clincheck, and those kind of things around those products, too. so, we tailor those products for more moderate kinds of cases in those specific areas where public hospitals have been strong. and we -- really good results from the standpoint of what we saw in the uptake that we saw over this last quarter, and we'll continue with that strategy. we feel good about it.
john morici -- chief financial officer
and it's about market expansion there. we're selling to more doctors than we've sold to in the past with these products. so, we're really trying to capture more of that market, as joe said, into tier 3, tier 4 cities, and we saw good uptake from that. and it's something that we know to go to the market and be able to reach these potential customers.
these are the types of products that we need.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, brandon, i think honestly, i feel really good about our positioning there. china did perform well from a volume standpoint, and we'll continue to update on progress.
brandon vazquez -- william blair and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from jon block with stifel. your line is now open.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks, guys. hey, joe. hey, john. maybe just first one for me.
the 3q '22 asp of $1,150 versus $1,220, so i'm counting down 6% q over q. some of that's fx, but i think if i look at your comments, it seems like half of that 6% headwind is fx. and john, i know you said mix, but i'm counting that teen was about 35% of your 3q '22 cases versus 30% of your 2q '22 cases and teen is a high acuity comprehensive asp. i would think dsp is also helping pull out some of the lower asp cases as dsp ramps quarter in, quarter out.
so, can you just help me with the asp movement, what else was it outside of fx? and if it was mix, why mix based on my teen commentary?
john morici -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think you've hit the major pieces, jon. when you look at it majority was fx. we saw the dollar strengthening, that obviously hits our numbers.
and then you look at the other parts, we do have a higher proportion of teen in the third quarter, and that's a help. we also have things that we've done like we answered on the previous call about mix in china and expansion out, and there's offsets to that. but it's primarily fx, and then you have some mix. but from a discounting standpoint, or other things, there was really no overall change to how we've done stuff.
it's primarily the fx piece and the mix.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
jon, one other thing to add to that, too, on the dsp program, we look at that as incremental, not as replacing other business that we've had in the past. so, like we feel good that's an expansion play for us. and i think you see that in the numbers, too.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. so, maybe just quickly on that last point, joe. question 1b would be, you don't really think any cases are being pulled out of the case volume number into dsp that's actually having an incremental negative impact to '22? do you think those are just truly largely incremental? that was 1b, just to be clear.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. you know, i think you learn a business, jon, never be binary, either or. i'd say the majority of those cases, if you look at it, we're picking up from an ortho standpoint, a lot of retention we never had before. we see orthos doing touch-up cases and all that might have been done in-house at times.
so, i'm not saying that there's absolutely nothing that would transpose from one to another, but i'd say primarily, we're looking at that as a growth opportunity for us.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, helpful. and then the last question, and it's just where i struggle the most. i think sort of who cares, but my view on teen versus how you guys have positioned it with all due respect. and i get the teen 2q to 3q had a good sequential growth rate, but the 1q to 3q, because 2q was weak, was actually below trend on a four-year average throwing out 2020.
and joe, just -- if we can go down that road a little bit more, teen case vols were still down 3% year over year. this whole story is about taking maybe 200 bps of share every year in this market. what do you think overall teen case volume was globally if you guys were down 3%? and maybe just really the questions about market share gains and if you still feel like you've got the momentum there or if that has slowed as of late and what can reaccelerate it? thanks for your time.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. jon, again, that's a good question. i think when you talk about first quarter to second quarter, the rhythm that we had there, remember, the normal rhythms we've seen in this business is seasonality, we call it. we have not seen that since really 2019.
and so, we had muted signals on teens through 2020, '21. just -- it wasn't the same. what i liked about -- what i saw in the third quarter was we saw teens come back in the sense of in a pattern of what you'd expect in teen season, q3, q4. it's too early for me to dig out the data and tell you how much share we're gaining against wires and brackets.
well, jon, we don't talk about a lot or products like -- and we highlighted it here today, when you look at the invisalign first product line, we're really getting tremendous results out there on young patients, six to nine years old, the phase 1/phase 2 treatments, where often the phase 2 can be a lot less extensive than what the phase 1 was with wires and brackets. so, our different extension devices, so we see a big uptake in that product line from a teen standpoint. we see that as penetration too. we've seen consistent growth from a share standpoint in those teen cases in americas globally.
so, we just introduced curved wings mandibular advancement too that's having a really good start in the market, too, to address some cases that mandibular advancement couldn't get in the past. so, jon, both with technology, with our advertising campaigns, the teen packs, and whatever, i continue to feel good about our movement. we'll have more as we analyze the trends, the share trends, and stuff that we'll be able to share with you, but i do like our position in the marketplace in teens.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
appreciate it. thanks.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jon.

our next question comes from brandon couillard with jefferies. your line is now open.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, joe.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hi, brandon.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
just a question on just opex and how you're managing headcount, whether you pulled back in any parts of the business globally. and maybe just talk about the levers that might be at your disposal if the environment continues to deteriorate and maybe if there are some areas that would be ring-fenced as far as the potential cuts.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
brandon, it's joe. look, first of all, what i protect with my life here are our direct salespeople and also our technology and our engineering team and what we focus on. and so, we've made sure that we continue to reinforce those. there's just other parts of our business, too, that we rightsized.
i mean, obviously, this business is used to growing 20%, 30%. and so, we kind of came into the year with that mindset. we quickly realized it wasn't and so we've taken actions in order to do that. but you see that throughout the business.
don't forget we also have really strong productivity programs, in manufacturing and all, that really help us during these times. emory and his team do a terrific job, they help to drive that. john will give you another insight in a sense of how we're managing opex across the business.
john morici -- chief financial officer
so, we have good insight into our p&ls across the world. so, we're looking at country by country in certain regions and so on. and like joe said, from an overall focus, we want to make sure that we're going to market and protecting the sales, make sure our r&d technology is putting out the best products and the best technology going forward, so we protect that. and then we look at what expenses make sense in the short and long term in various regions, various campaigns that we have to make sure that we're getting the return that's appropriate given the market conditions.
so, we're constantly iterating and changing things, it's no different on the other side of things. when a year ago, we were looking at the growth opportunities. we're looking at it the same type of way kind of on a country-by-country, market-by-market basis is just the other way as it is now. so, we feel like we have a good understanding of our return on investment and a good understanding of the levers that we need to pull or not pull given these conditions.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
and then, john, just one follow-up. can you help me just kind of understand what's going on with the inventory line and why that continues to grow year over year and sequentially? is there something tied to the new european fab facility that may be driving that? and what we should expect on that line in the next few quarters?
john morici -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think we're kind of getting to -- we kind of get to a point where some of that is due to just the fact that you have a third manufacturing site, and you're going to have raw materials related to that and other in-process inventory and so on there. so, you're going to have some of that. some of it is also on the itero side where you're manufacturing and you're doing some things where you're securing supply.
i mean, there's been a lot of talk and we feel good about our supply to be able to components and so on. we've purchased several components just to make sure that we had adequate supply for our forecast and so on. but nothing out of the ordinary other than some expansion that we have with new manufacturing and then making sure that we secured our supply lines, and that's what we've seen in our numbers.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brandon.
operator
our next question comes from jeff johnson with baird. your line is now open.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, guys. so, joe, i want to pin you down a little bit on a couple of things, if i could here, that questions that have been asked. and on the teen packs especially, i mean, look, we know there were so many adult cases last year with the [inaudible] factor, whatever we want to call it, and stimulus spending and all that.
but the teen number is obviously the important number. i think we're all trying to focus on here. the down 3%, i think, is what you said year over year, up sequentially. that down 3% year over year on teen cases globally, i mean, how do you feel like that compares to the overall ortho market? were you better or worse than other teen cases done with brackets and wires when you throw in other clear aligners from the competitors, things like that? just how are you competing in that teen market right now?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
hey, jeff, it's a fair question. i'd first take it to europe. i mean, europe was down substantially for us, too. so, i don't think we've got a clear signal out of there because of the economics and in general.
i mean, we did fairly well in -- from a european standpoint. but third quarter in europe is never a particularly strong quarter, we're going to pull a signal out of. when you look at the united states, you go to gaidge data. and you'll see that inside gaidge data aligners were down, but invisalign was actually above what the generic aligners are reported in gaidge data, which says we continue to do well with our teen portfolio and what we do.
you see wires and brackets cases actually expanded. but what that is, is you see if they're doing more -- fewer adults -- and you know how orthos have held on to teens for a long time, you get a mix phenomenon there where it looks like they're doing more wires and brackets, but they're not. they're just doing fewer adults, and they mix down in that sense. and then move over to asia, i've always felt good about asia is different by country.
but the covid overlay in japan, in particular, but also china. i thought the teen case volume was still reasonable. but it's still hard to pull a signal out of a lot of noise with the covid shutdowns in all of those countries. so, again, just like in john's question, jeff, is i do feel great about our portfolio.
i feel good about how we're positioning the product. i think the teen packs are a way to sell the way doctors want to commit in this area, i think we'll continue to get strong there. the future of those teen cases, there's no question it's digital. it's just how we approach it, the products we launch, and convincing doctors more and more that teens will use these and showing them the results that we're seeing all over the world.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yeah. fair enough. all right. and then i'm going to jam two questions together, kind of as jon block here, i'd call it 2a and 2b and other separate questions.
but any update on volume-based procurement in china, how we should think about that? and then i didn't see a breakout for americas versus international doctors shipped to. you provided that in the past. any way we could get that number this time? thanks.
john morici -- chief financial officer
well, on the doctor shipped to, what we've done is consolidated them together to a total. and what we saw, if you looked at international versus domestic, they're both up. and the numbers that we had -- this is actually our second highest ever from a shipped-to standpoint. but we decided to consolidate those together, without giving too much more details on that.
but they're both up.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
is that sequentially, john, just to be clear?
john morici -- chief financial officer
yes. yes.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
john, both up sequentially. sorry, joe.
john morici -- chief financial officer
yes, yes, correct.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. on sequential, yes. on the volume-based purchasing in china, we have our eyes all over it, jeff, as you can guess. it represents anywhere between 15% and 18% of our business there.
the way they're setting this up, pretty much in what we recall, in not our main areas in where we do business in china. i think we've positioned ourselves for this. strategically, i feel we can make the right move here. look, i have friends and other medical device businesses, i was in the medical devices for a while.
we know what this did to stents and hip transplants and different things. i feel like the way they set this up, one is 70% of it will be dbp in those areas, 30% will still be up to the doctors in the sense of what they want to use and how they want to use it. so, what's key here is that we exercise our portfolio and the capacity that we have over there to just have a strategic positioning in that. so, i don't expect any major differences as we move into 2023.
we'll just have to wait to see how that goes. and as we move into 2024, 2025, how the government -- which way the government moves.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from elizabeth anderson with evercore isi. your line is now open.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks so much for the question. i guess my first question is just on equipment line. i noticed you sort of talking more about leased equipment in the quarter.
can you sort of talk about how that's been growing and sort of what contribution that made to the equipment revenues in the quarter?
john morici -- chief financial officer
yes, i can start with that. it's obviously a strategy that we have. we've got great equipment, great products, and we want to be able to get those to our customers in a way that they want to buy. sometimes those doctors of ours don't necessarily want to purchase it outright.
they want to try other things. and so, we've tested in certain markets, just alternatives, kind of the rental model and so on. and we see good uptake. we see them these doctors now wanting to get a scanner to be able to digitize their practice.
so, it's really at early stage right now, elizabeth, but it is something that when we think about how we want to go to market, we want to offer alternatives such as leasing or expanding rental or other parts of our business are going to see the certified preowned where you have upgrades and other things that happen as we have a larger and larger installed base, we're going to get some of that equipment back. we want to be able to have a mechanism to be able to use that equipment, use it in other places, and give our customers alternatives, both in terms of the equipment that they can purchase from us and then how they purchase and use that equipment from a financing or maybe leasing or rental options. and we think that they'll end up using our equipment more and more. and then we know that helps from a digital standpoint when they use their equipment, and then they'll end up using more invisalign.
so, it all kind of works from an ecosystem standpoint.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and then just in terms of on the p&l, like one of the things that, obviously, saw the change in sg&a spend in the quarter and how you pulled back on spending there. what about on the r&d line? do you sort of see an opportunity to pull back on r&d as well going forward? or is that something you're sort of keener to defend going forward?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
elizabeth, it's joe. we want to defend r&d. very important part of the business. you can see the programs are rolling out.
the programs we're rolling out, we didn't do them this year, right? some of these are three-year-old programs that we've been working on. and so, i don't want to stop the momentum on those. i mean, obviously, we'll take any steps here to preserve the cash flow and integrity of this business that we have to do. but our front lines are our sales organization and technology.
and before we go anywhere near those, we want to make sure we do everything we can, then rightsize the business in other areas.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and then just in terms of my 2b question, in terms of like what you're seeing through the month of october so far, if we're sort of thinking about how the cadence of 4q is shaping up, would you then expect like the cases to be sort of flat sequentially at this point based on what you're seeing? or like how do we think about sort of where we are now?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
you know, kind of anticipating that question is, we're not seeing any major change, i'd say, from the momentum that we saw in the second quarter.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
you mean the third quarter?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
i'm sorry, third quarter. that's right, a little bit, yeah.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. appreciate it.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from erin wright with ms. the line is now open.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks so much. so, how should we think about underlying asps going forward, excluding the fx dynamics from here just given some of the mix dynamics you noted? and fx is fx, and that's understandable. but if we do continue to see what we're seeing in terms of the macro environment, what do we think about in terms of trough margins from here? and do you see an opportunity for a sort of recovery near term? or any sort of margin expansion? anything you can give us on that front would be helpful.
thanks.
john morici -- chief financial officer
yeah. obviously -- erin, this is john. obviously, gross margin, op margins is a primary concern for us. we want to make sure that we manage things appropriately.
from an asp standpoint, take fx out of this and really fx out of our margin because it's hard to so much coming through from a p&l standpoint. but we're always looking at productivity to be able to help drive the business. and as we scale up poland is a great example, we'll become more productive there, and that will help our margin. it's kind of in our margins right now as an impact, but it will get better over time through utilization.
we look at the technology that we have in the business and what it means from an asp standpoint. and our customers understand that. there's always going to be geographical mix shifts that happen. certain parts of the world are at different times throughout the year.
but i don't expect a dramatic shift in our overall asps. take fx out of it from an overall asp standpoint and then we're really focused on what can we do to look at savings that help us from a gross margin standpoint and see that. and then also on an op margin standpoint for all the opex things that we previously talked about.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thanks. and then just going back to elizabeth's question on the quarterly cadence. just in the teen market, in particular, what are you seeing in terms of typical seasonality there? and did you see some of that momentum continuing here into the fourth quarter in that particular segment? or how should we be thinking about the quarter-to-quarter cadence given -- relative to what you typically see from a seasonal standpoint.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
the teen market, predominantly, if we look at the third quarter. obviously, it bleeds some into the fourth quarter, whatever, but i wouldn't take anything we're seeing right now and project it into the future to change what the normal fourth-quarter sequence could be. so, like i said previously on the question as far as when you look at third quarter moving in the fourth quarter, we're not seeing any meaningful change one way or another.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from nathan rich with goldman sachs. your line is now open.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thanks for the questions. good afternoon. if i could go back to margins for a minute.
you mentioned not changing the target for this year on a constant-currency basis. i guess -- if i could maybe ask the question this way, if we don't see further changes to fx or the kind of overall demand environment, do you think the 16% margin that you saw this quarter on a gaap basis is indicative of what we should assume going forward, again, kind of -- assuming no kind of changes in the underlying environment?
john morici -- chief financial officer
i wouldn't say -- i wouldn't take that. i think when we're talking about for the full year, we're kind of looking at kind of that on a constant-currency basis, that 20%. and i think q3, you have impacts with poland start-up and some other things in the quarter that are impacting that. but when we look at the 20% and what we were calling earlier in the year, we were thinking about that less about the quarters, but on a -- more on a total year basis on a constant-currency basis.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and the fx headwind for the year on margins is that 2% to 3%?
john morici -- chief financial officer
that's the way to look at it, nate. it's -- you know, we're kind of looking at -- as best as we can call it now, we're kind of using the latest fx rates that you have now. it's up to predict what's going to happen in the next two months. but if you took kind of currently and kind of what we've done throughout the year and then use the current fx rates, we think that's a two- to three-point impact.
and without that fx rates, we -- our gaap numbers would have been up to 20%, like we called.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. thanks for that. if i could just ask a quick follow-up. joe, i think you had noted less willingness of consumers to finance treatments in both the u.s.
and europe. how big is that as a percent of case volumes in terms of what's typically financed? and then, you know, how much in particular kind of how might this weigh on demand? and i guess, bigger picture, are there ways kind of in this environment that you kind of see as kind of maybe being best able to stimulate demand just in terms of how you might either help customers or doctors in this environment?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. nathan, i think what we gave you is basically data that we receive from the marketplace. it's what we're hearing from orthodontists and dentists in general in treatment. we don't have any quantification to say so many patients were seeking funding, they didn't get it or there's so many losses in that sense.
that's pretty much listed as the reasons why patients have refused treatment or thinking about treatment in the financial considerations of it. john, would you?
john morici -- chief financial officer
no, i think you're always going to have a mix of -- some patients, they'll pay for it all upfront. some will finance either through the doctor or some outside group. and i think you're constantly going to have that. we do think as much as we can with our doctors to give them some of the financial flexibility, so that as they maybe have additional terms where they pay us, the doctors, they can maybe apply some of that to their patients, and they can help their patients as well, manage some of the cash flow.
so, we're aware of it. we do as much as we can. it's just kind of out there. and like joe said, we don't have a quantification of it, but in tougher economic times, we know that patients will be looking for different alternatives.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
and, you know, the other part of your question, nate, about how do we help accounts. we watch payments, we try to help in that sense at times. we try to drive direct invisalign docs to do a lot of invisalign. and obviously, our advertising is extremely important to them.
so, we have our whole lead program to help them drive those things. we just want to be as close to our customers as possible because they're feeling what we feel. and we have strong relationships with many of them, and they're part of the family here. and we work it country by country, doctor by doctor, region by region to see how we can help.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks so much.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
operator, we'll take one more question, please.
operator
our final question comes from kevin caliendo with ubs. your line is now open.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
thanks, and thanks for sneaking me in. i appreciate it. so may have found a little bit on the comment around october, saying that the momentum continued. if we think about that, that was sort of down 12%, right, year over year.
i think what we're all looking for is we saw cases flat q1 to q2. and then we saw a step down in q3 despite a stronger teen season. so, i think what we're all trying to figure out here is adjusting for the third quarter strength, seasonality in teen, when do you actually expect to see stabilization globally in cases, meaning either sequentially or year-over-year flatness? like when do you actually expect that that could happen?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
kevin, it's joe. look, i think we can sit here and tell you i think we're in pretty volatile economic times. i can't tell you what the dollar is going to be in three months. i don't know what's going to happen in europe.
i don't know how bad covid hits china. i don't know what it does in japan. so, i know exactly what you're asking for and every investor is asking for. and we'd give you that data if we thought we had it, but we are in such a volatile time right now.
we're just working this thing from month to month. as i mentioned, as we go into the fourth quarter, obviously, there's a rhythm between teens and adults from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. what i mentioned from a continuation standpoint is we haven't seen much of a change between the third and the fourth right now as we move into it. that's about as well as i can tell you of what we're seeing and what we're experiencing, trying to forecast what's going to happen toward the end of the quarter, next quarter, i can't do that.
i don't think anybody here can.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
and if i can just ask a follow-up. there's been a lot of talk about spending and margins in 20% and everything else. and historically, in the past, you guys always just invested to grow. is it now given the uncertainty of everything that you're just going to manage through a margin or try to manage to the 20% margin ex fx? or, i mean, is that the strategy? or is it still to try to get back to the -- what you would need to do normally to hit certain growth targets that you've had?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
it's a growth business, kevin. if we had good economic times here, i can tell you, we'd be having a much different conversation. so, the challenge with this business is how are we responsible on cost and obviously, a challenged demand environment, but to keep this company very strong because when this market comes back, you just go back in history and take a look, it comes back, and it comes back hard. and we've got to make sure that we're in a good position to be able to field that when it does occur.
so, you'll see us be, what i call, fiscally responsible, but we'll continue to make sure that we invest and make as many changes as we can around different areas of opex but to protect those key areas where our customer interface and the development of our technology. and actually, the operations capacity we need in this business when this thing does bring back. and that's not just in manufacturing aligners. that's in being able to service customers across the board.
so, you'll see us balance that well as we should do from a leadership standpoint.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. we appreciate your time and look forward to speaking with you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings, including the ortho summit in las vegas next month. if you have any further questions or follow-up, please contact our investor relations team. have a great day.

greetings. welcome to the align q3 2022 earnings call. at this time, all participants are in a listen mode only. a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.
please note this conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to our host, shirley stacy, with align technology. you may begin.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. i'm shirley stacy, vice president of corporate communications and investor relations. joining me for today's call is joe hogan, president and ceo; and john morici, cfo. we issued third-quarter 2022 financial results today via business wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com.
today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately one month. a telephone replay will be available today by approximately 5:30 p.m. eastern time through 5:30 p.m. eastern time on november 9.

joe? 
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, shirley. good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. on our call today, i'll provide an overview of our q3 results and discuss the performance of our two operating segments, system and services and clear aligners. john will provide more detail on our financial performance and our view for the remainder of the year.
following that, i'll come back, summarize a few key points, and open the call to questions. our third-quarter results reflect the continued macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker consumer confidence, as well as significant impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates across currencies that affect our operations. on a constant-currency basis, total q3 revenues were reduced by $25 million or 2.7% sequentially and $57.4 million or 6.1% year over year, one of the largest quarterly foreign exchange impacts in our history. we remain confident in the execution of our strategic growth drivers despite the continuing economic headwinds.
in q3, we reached our 14 millionth invisalign patient milestone during the quarter, which includes nearly 4 million teenagers and kids as young as six years old, who have been treated with invisalign clear aligners. in q3, teen case starts of 200,000 were up 13% sequentially and just off slightly compared to q3 '21 a year ago with a record 206,000 teenagers started invisalign treatment. we're also excited to be launching significantly new products and technologies that further enhance the align digital platform, leading the digital transformation are the practice of dentistry. during the quarter, we also began to commercialize clincheck live update software, invisalign practice app, invisalign personal plan, invisalign smile architect, the invisalign outcome simulator pro with in-face visualization, cone beam computed tomography with clincheck software invisalign, virtual ai software, and itero-exocad connector.
these technology advancements represent an important expansion of our digital platform that we believe will help our doctor customers increase treatment efficiency and deliver superior clinical outcomes and patient experiences, positioning us to drive growth when the market inevitably rebounds. we'll be showcasing these innovations next month at the invisalign ortho summit, las vegas, the premier education, and networking experience for invisalign practices with the most peer-to-peer presentations of any invisalign education event. through q3, systems, and services, interest in our itero scanners was good with increased product demos across the regions. doctors are increasingly recognizing the substantial benefits of intraoral scanning and end-to-end digital workflows with the itero scanner and imaging systems.
at the same time, increasing inflation, rising interest rates, and less patient traffic and dental practices are lengthening sales cycles and conversion time. for q3, system and services revenues of $157.5 million were down sequentially year over year. on a constant-currency basis, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced q3 '22 systems and services revenues by approximately $4.1 million or 2.5% sequentially and approximately $9.9 million or 5.9% year over year. for q3, scanner services year-over-year revenue growth was strong across all region particularly due to increased subscription revenue driven by growth of the installed base of itero scanners.
year-over-year growth also reflects increased sales of itero warranties and continued growth of our scanner leasing rental programs. we continue to work closely with our doctor customers to support their practice growth and digital transformation goals. this includes understanding different ways to enable them to navigate to more uncertain economic environment. over the past year, we've had good success rolling out new leasing programs in latin america and certified preowned or cpo, as we call it, options in india and north america.
we're also looking at new opportunities on the capital equipment side for our dso partners. this is a natural progression in an equipment business with a large and growing installed base. as we introduce new products, there are more opportunities for customers to upgrade to make trade-ins and to provide refurbished scanners for emerging markets, too. we expect to continue to roll out programs that are especially helpful for customers in the current macroeconomic environment.
it's selling the way doctors and customers want to do business and leveraging our balance sheet. we're still early, we're pleased with the contribution of margin accretion we're seeing. for our clear aligner segment, macroeconomic uncertainty and waiting consumer confidence continues to impact the dental market overall, making for a challenging operating environment across the board. for q3, third-party reports indicate there are fewer new patient visits, less traffic flow and lower orthodontic case starts overall.
our clear aligner volumes further reflect the underlying orthodontic market trends and a shift away from adults toward teens in q3. q3 clear aligner revenues were down 8.2% sequentially and down 12.5% year over year compared to q3 '21 year-over-year revenue growth rates of plus 35%. on a constant-currency basis, q3 '22 clear aligner revenues were reduced by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $21 million or approximately 2.8% sequentially and approximately $47.4 million or approximately 6.1% year over year. for the quarter, q3 aligner volumes reflect a sequential increase in invisalign shipments from asia pacific and latin america, as well as north america invisalign teen cases offset by lower volume in emea and north america, primarily invisalign adult cases.
for q3, invisalign first for kids as young as six grew year over year and was strong across all regions. on a trailing 12-month basis, as of q3, invisalign clear aligner shipments for teens and young kids using invisalign first up year over year to over 734,000 cases. for q3, the total number of new invisalign-trained doctors increased sequentially 8.5% driven by north america and asia pacific. in terms of invisalign submitters, the total number of doctors shipped to for q3 increased sequentially to 84,400 doctors, the second highest number this year, driven by asia pacific and the americas.
from a channel perspective, ortho submitters were slightly, year over year, up, especially from doctors submitting teen cases, offsetting -- offset by a few gp dentists year over year, especially in emea. for other noncase revenues, which include retention products such as vivera retainers, clinical training and education, accessories, e-commerce, and our new subscription programs such as our dsp, q3 revenues were up both sequentially and year over year. this reflects strong growth in retainers sequentially and year-over-year growth across all regions, driven by more submitters. in u.s., revenues for our doctor subscription program increased sequentially and year over year.
i'm very pleased to see continued momentum in noncase revenues driven by subscription-based programs that we expect to continue to expand across the business. now let's turn to the specifics around the third quarter results, starting with the americas. the q3 invisalign case volumes for americas were down sequentially single-digit percentages and primarily due to lower invisalign bulk shipments. the environment remains challenging and feedback from our customers indicates consumer financing and patient no-shows affecting their practices in q3, especially with adult patients.
q3 invisalign volume also reflects increased case submissions from orthodontic channel and sequential growth in the teen segment. for q3, teen patients were most resilient, reflecting continued momentum in younger patients with invisalign first, as well as the new invisalign teen case pack. during q3, invisalign teen case packs grew both sequentially and year over year. as a reminder, invisalign teen case packs, a new subscription program that enables orthodontists to buy clear aligners and packs in advance.
they also include exclusive practice development benefits with the invisalign brand and require an incremental volume commitment from doctors. teen case packs are currently available in the u.s., canada, and france, and we expect to be expanded more in emea region. turning to our international business for q3, invisalign clear aligner volume was down very slightly sequentially, 1.4%, with strong sequential growth for apac, offset by lower volume in emea. for emea, q3 operating environment was challenging.
inflation in the eurozone is more than 10% and global macroeconomic factors weighed on consumer sentiment and purchasing decisions, especially for adult patients, which compounded the impact of q3 summer seasonality. similar to the americas, doctors in emea also reported increased appointment cancellations and the impact of less patients financing their purchases. emea teen patients also resilient in q3 increased sequentially in iberia, as well as france, where we introduced teen case packs during the quarter. in apac, q3 sequential growth was led by china, japan, and anz despite ongoing covid restrictions and lockdowns in parts of china and japan.
on a year-over-year basis, invisalign case volumes reflected increased shipments across almost all markets, led by taiwan, thailand, india, and korea, driven by increased submitters. in q3, apac sequential growth also reflects strong demand from our expanded invisalign clear aligner product portfolio in china. recall in late april, q2, we introduced two new products that better serve the expanding market in china. invisalign adult and invisalign standard clear aligners leverage our proven technology while broadening our appeal to more consumer segments.
q3 was the first full quarter offering these new products that provide doctors and patients in china with broader clinical and affordable options for moderate to complex adult cases. finally, i'm pleased to share that the invisalign system was recently awarded the good design award for 2022, making it the first orthodontic appliance to win the prestigious award in japan. in the judge's assessment of the invisalign system, they emphasized that the opportunity for teeth straightening is high in japan and cited the barrier to adoption by japanese consumers is resistance to metal braces and praised the invisalign system as an orthodontic solution that can improve the quality of life during treatment. we certainly recognize the importance of the japanese market for digital orthodontics and is one of the reasons we opened our first office in tokyo nearly 15 years ago and established treatment planning operations in yokohama a few years ago.
turning to new innovations, we continue to deliver our technology road map. as i mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we began to commercialize several new products and services that we previously announced would come to market in the second half of 2022. these technology advancements illustrate our commitment to continuous innovation in digital orthodontics, and we remain excited about the transformational projects that we're working on as we continue to drive the evolution of our industry. no other dental company has the experience, including over 14 million patients treated to date to lead the transformation of the practice of dentistry.
our consumer marketing focus on educating consumers about the invisalign system and driving that demand to invisalign doctor's offices ultimately capitalize on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles globally. in q3, we built on our successful invis is media campaign and continued our launch of the invis is drama free, targeted at teens, and invis when everything clicks, targeted at adults. our teen campaign, invis is drama free highlights the benefits of invisalign while humorously juxtaposing them with the significant trade-offs involved with using braces. our invis is when everything clicks campaign showcases invisalign treatment transforming smiles and the resulting confidence it gives to young adults.
during q3, we had over 4.3 billion impressions delivered in 14 million visits to our website, a 1.6% year-over-year increase as a result of rightsizing our media investments. we're also rightsizing our consumer media investments across all core emea markets, impacting the impressions and unique visits. in u.s., we continued our influencer and creator-centric campaigns, partnering with leading smile squad creators like olympic gold medalist, suni lee, michael le, josh richards, and marsai martin. each of these creators shared their personal experience of invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smile with invisalign aligners.
most recently, suni lee shared her positive experience with invisalign in major media programming include good morning america, people.com, resulting in over 93 million impressions. we continue to invest in consumer advertising across apac region, resulting in a 72% year-over-year increase in impressions and 29% year-over-year increase in unique visitors. our ongoing campaigns were omnipresent across the top social media platforms such as tiktok, snapchat, instagram, and youtube to increase the awareness of the invisalign brand with young adults and teens. in q3, we launched a global plot on the roblox platform within the popular game livetopia creating a fun experience for players to learn about the benefits of invisalign treatment.
to date, we had over 5.9 million impressions delivered in over 2.6 million unique visitors on the game experience. adoption of my invisalign consumer and patient app continues to increase with 2.2-plus million downloads to date. usage of our key digital tools also continued to increase. live update was used by 41,000 doctors or more than 395,000 cases, reduced time spent in modifying treatment by 18%.
invisalign practice app has been downloaded 314,000 times to date. further, we received more than 110,000 patient photos in our virtual care capability to date, providing rich global data to leverage our ai capabilities and improve our services for doctors and patients. the investments that we make to drive patient demand and conversion to support our doctor customers is unparalleled in our industry, leveraging the global recognition of the invisalign system. no other dental company equals our brand strength today.
for more details on our consumer marketing programs, please see our q3 '22 earnings and conference slides. turning to exocad. overall, i'm very pleased with our progress with the exocad business and its leadership and restorative dentistry. in addition to the itero-exocad connector, i mentioned previously, during the quarter, we also introduced itero niri, niri is near-infrared technology intraoral camera images and are now automatically imported into dental cad when designing restorations, enabling technicians to visualize the internal and external tooth structure and optimize the process of margin line tracing.
the new xsnap module is a model attachment for a printable 3d articulated system, featuring a spherical head, which allows a precisely executed movement. and ivoclar's ivotion dental system, a complete workflow for digital production of high-quality removable dentures is now available on exocad. together, the itero and exocad product portfolios help accelerate the digital transformation of dental practices by facilitating the way doctors and labs collaborate to deliver better care for their patients. as part of the align digital platform, the integration of itero's digital scanning and exocad's complete software solution delivers seamless end-to-end digital workflows from diagnosis to treatment, planning, and then fabrication.
customers are already utilizing the automated workflows, unlocking efficiencies and productivities, which are more important than ever in the current economic climate. with the recent integration of itero niri and intraoral camera images unique to itero element 5d imaging systems and exocad rijeka software release, align is redefining restorative visualization and treatment planning for the doctors and labs. we are committed to continuing and innovating in the dental industry to drive efficiency and clinical excellence for the benefit of our customers and their patients. with that, i'll now turn it over to john.
john morici -- chief financial officer
thanks, joe. now for our q3 financial results. total revenues for the third quarter were $890.3 million, down 8.2% from the prior quarter and down 12.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. on a constant-currency basis, q3 2022 unfavorable foreign exchange reduced q3 revenues by approximately $25.1 million sequentially and approximately $57.4 million year over year.
for clear aligners, q3 revenues of $732.8 million were down 8.2% sequentially primarily due to lower volumes, unfavorable foreign exchange, higher promotions and discounts, and product mix shift, partially offset by higher additional aligners. on a year-over-year basis, q3 clear aligner revenue were down 12.5%, primarily reflecting the aforementioned items, offset somewhat by per-order processing fees and higher noncase revenues. on a constant-currency basis, q3 '22 unfavorable foreign exchange reduced q3 clear aligner revenues by approximately $21 million or approximately 2.8% sequentially and approximately $47.4 million or approximately 6.1% year over year. for q3, invisalign asps for both comprehensive and noncomprehensive treatment decreased sequentially and year over year.
on a sequential basis, decline in asps reflect unfavorable impact from foreign exchange that joe described earlier, as well as higher discounts and product mix shift, partially offset by higher additional aligners. on a year-over-year basis, the decline in asps reflect the significant impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, product mix shift, and higher discounts, partially offset by the higher additional aligners and per-order processing fees. as our revenues from subscription, retainers, and other ancillary products continue to grow and expand globally, some of the historical metrics that focus only on case shipments do not account for our overall growth. in our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total clear aligner revenue per case shipment which is more indicative of our overall growth strategy.
clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $37 million or 3.3% sequentially and $184 million or up 18.6% year over year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. during the three months ended september 30, 2022, we recognized $137.2 million that was included in the clear aligner deferred revenue balance at december 31, 2021. the q3 systems and services revenue of $157.5 million were down 8% sequentially, primarily due to lower scanner volume, partially offset by higher services revenues from our larger installed base, and were down 11.7% year over year primarily due to lower scanner volume and lower asp, partially offset by higher services revenue from our larger installed base. q3 '22, systems and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $4.1 million or approximately 2.5% sequentially.
on a year-over-year basis, system and services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $9.9 million or approximately 5.9%. systems and services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was up $4.1 million or 1.6% sequentially and up $76.5 million or 40.9% year over year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. during the three months ended september 30, 2022, we recognized $13.3 million that was included in the systems and services deferred revenues balance as of december 31, 2021. moving on to gross margin.
third quarter overall gross margin was 69.5%, down 1.4 points sequentially and down 4.8 points year over year. overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.8 points sequentially and 1.8 points on a year-over-year basis due to the impact of foreign exchange on our revenues. clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 70.9% down 2.4 points sequentially due to lower asps and increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in poland. clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was down 5.3 points year over year due to increased manufacturing spend for the reasons stated previously, higher freight and a higher mix of additional aligner volume, and lower asps.
systems and services gross margin for the third quarter was 63.3%, up 3.6 points sequentially due to improved manufacturing absorption and lower freight costs. systems and services gross margin for the third quarter was down 2.3 points year over year due to higher inventory costs and manufacturing inefficiencies coupled with lower asps, partially offset by higher service revenues. q3 operating expenses were $475.5 million, down sequentially 4.8% and down 3.7% year over year. on a sequential basis, operating expenses were down $23.9 million, mainly due to controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs.
year over year, operating expenses decreased by $18.5 million for the same reasons as sequential, as well as lower incentive compensation. on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $443.4 million, down sequentially 4.8% and down 4.9% year over year. our third-quarter operating income of $143.7 million resulted in an operating margin of 16.1%, down 3.3 points sequentially and down 9.6 points year over year. operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1.6 points sequentially due to foreign exchange and lower gross margin.
the year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology, as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 3.5 points. on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisition, the operating margin for the third quarter was 20.2%, down three points sequentially and down 8.6 points year over year. interest and other income and expense net for the third quarter was a loss of $21 million, compared to a loss of $14.6 million in q2 and an income of $0.8 million in q3 of '21 primarily due to larger net foreign exchange losses from the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar.
the gaap effective tax rate for the third quarter was 40.7% and compared to 35% in the second quarter and 30.9% in the third quarter of the prior year. the third-quarter gaap effective tax rate was higher than the second-quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to the decrease in profits and changes in jurisdictional mix of income, resulting in lower tax benefits from foreign income tax at different rates and higher than in the u.s. on a non-gaap -- our non-gaap effective tax rate was 33.1% in the third quarter compared to 25.6% in the second quarter and 22.2% in the third quarter of the prior year. third quarter net income per diluted share was $0.93, down sequentially $0.51 and down $1.35, compared to the prior year.
our eps was unfavorably impacted by $0.30 on a sequential basis and $0.48 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. on a non-gaap basis, net income per diluted share was $1.36 for the third quarter, down $0.64 sequentially and down $1.51 year over year. moving on to the balance sheet. as of september 30, 2022, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1.1 billion, up sequentially $163.8 million and down $96.8 million year over year.
of the $1.1 billion balance, $471 million was held in the u.s. and $670 million was held by our international entities. q3 accounts receivable balance was $859.6 million, down approximately 7.8% sequentially. our overall days sales outstanding was 86 days, flat sequentially and up approximately 11 days as compared to q3 last year.
cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $266.5 million. capital expenditures for the third quarter were $75.3 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $191.1 million. we are well capitalized to continue to invest for growth while managing through these challenging market conditions, exiting the quarter with over $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet and zero debt.
now, turning to full year 2022 and the factors that influence our views on our business outlook. underlying market dynamics, as well as the reactions to macroeconomic headwinds by central banks, governments, and consumers, remain uncertain. we will continue to focus on those matters that have been central to our historically successful business strategies by managing those things within our control. this includes maintaining fiscal controls and focused delivery on our business model so that we are positioned for success once the difficult operating environment ultimately abates.
we remain confident in the huge underpenetrated market for the digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, our technology and industry leadership, and our ability to execute and make progress toward our long-term model of 20% to 30% revenue growth. we expect to be below our fiscal 2022 gaap operating margin target of 20%, which includes the impact from the current unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately two to three points that was not factored into our operating margin guidance for the fiscal year 2022 when we gave an update on the q1 '22 earnings call in april. for 2022, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements, as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion.
this includes our investment in the aligner fabrication facility in wroclaw, poland, which began servicing doctors in the second quarter of 2022. in addition, during q4 2022, we expect to repurchase up to $200 million of our common stock through either -- or a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. with that, i'll turn it back over to joe for final comments. joe?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. as we continue to navigate a macroeconomic uncertainty, weaker consumer confidence, and the lingering impacts of covid-19 shutdowns primarily in china and japan, we remain focused on our strategic initiatives, as well as the incredible market opportunity for digital dentistry and our products. we believe our unwavering drive to transform smiles and change lives for millions of people around the world is on one other clear aligner company can match and positions us to better address this market opportunity. regardless of the operating environment, we are committed to balancing investments to drive growth and long-term strategic priorities that will transform the practice of dentistry and strengthen our business.
these are uncertain times. every business is being impacted by macroeconomic environmental uncertainty. in addition, as a multinational company based in the united states with roughly half of our sales outside the country, the negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange has been like anything i've ever seen in my career. we will continue to invest in digital solutions and demand creation to help doctors and their patients.
we are committed to doctor-directed care and transforming the industry together while working through these global macroeconomic challenges. thank you for your time today. we look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. now i'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.
operator?

operator
at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] one moment, please, while we poll for questions. the first call is from jason bednar with piper sandler. you may proceed.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions. joe and john, congrats on seeing the stability return to the business.
maybe i'll start with that point. if you could talk about maybe what's changed versus, say, three to six months ago, the adult part of the market still sounds maybe a little sluggish, but you also saw that sequential improvement. teams are holding in. could you maybe speak to the visibility you have today versus where you sat last summer or in the fall? what has led to the greater confidence in demand forecasting?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
jason, it's joe. you know, first of all, i think we have a more stable macroeconomic environment. mean obviously, 2022 is pretty unprecedented. when you think about china situation, ukraine situation in europe, the rapid increase federal reserve rates that really put the economy in a lot of ways.
so, i mean, we're working from a better platform in that sense. and i think, you know, obviously, powell's comments today and 0.25 increase in all. i mean, it shows a little bit of confidence on the fed's partners and what they're seeing and what they're directing to. so, i'd just say, jason, from a broad standpoint, we feel really good about our portfolio.
we feel good about the technology we talk about and all those things. we're just looking for a stable platform from an economic standpoint to operate from.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. no, that's helpful. it definitely sounds more macro-related than anything else. but that's helpful.
and then maybe, joe, i wanted to pick up on one point you mentioned regarding the bracket and wire piece. it sure seems like maybe a profit-motivated decision for docs, maybe shortsighted but still profit-motivated as they focus on the cost of brackets and wires versus that clear aligner lab fee. maybe what do you think it's going to take to reverse that trend back to clear aligners picking up meaningful share i guess, especially with teams, do market volumes need to come back in a bigger way to convince doctors to free up more chair time with clear aligners? or is there something you can do on your end to really stimulate that shift back toward invisalign? thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
jason, that's a great question. first of all, i mean, doctors are doing what they think are in the best financial interest and from a patient standpoint, too, a stronger economic environment will help in that sense because they'll have a higher patient traffic, and the trade-off won't be as severe in that sense because of the patient throughput. but where we help us in technology and that's why we emphasize the technology developments and the investments that we're making that are really significant as we launch in this year. and like i talked about with just software alone to pick one in the sense of being able to move patients through faster being able to have doctors really do cases a lot faster before with our products like ipp in different areas.
so, those technology advancements are really important. and then how we put those together in business models like our digital subscription programs really help doctors get over that line, too. so, i feel we have a good format to be able to address that going forward. but again, i'll emphasize, we need a market that we can stand on in the sense and predict.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. thanks so much for the color.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
appreciate it. next question, please.
operator
absolutely. the next question comes from jeff johnson with baird. you may proceed.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
thanks, guys. hey, guys. good afternoon. joe, i just want to ask a couple of questions here.
i guess, one, just on the clear aligner volume guidance for 1q. it sounds like it's because china, incrementally weaker stability in americas and the emea, you kind of had that in the press release. you got some hedging words in there about primarily due to weakness in china and some stability in the americas and emea. i mean, should we be thinking at this point that your americas and the emea are kind of kind of a baseline here? and i know, obviously, macro can change from here, but assuming that macro change away? are we kind of at a baseline level now in absolute volumes for americas and the emea? and do you think china could be a recovery play throughout this year? are you seeing any early signs of some pickup in some of those big dental hospitals or the new adult standard product there or anything?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
jeff, you know, first of all, on the front end with the western economies is we just see stability. that's what we talked about. that's what we see versus before we saw the market falling away from us. so, right now, we see it being stable.
and feel better about that point. on china, i mean, uncertainty in china is incredible when you think about billion people being sick there right now or have been sick over the last couple of weeks. and jeff, i refuse to give a forecast over a number of quarters now because a lot of it has to do with the uncertainty that we see in china and specifically, which our second biggest market in the world. so, i don't want to try to forecast china right now.
i can tell you now, it's a blur for us and very difficult but just we feel good about where we stand with emea and the states from a stability standpoint. we try to reflect as much in our words, what we see for the first quarter for you, too.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
understood. and i'm sure there's going to be a lot more questions here on the short-term things. i don't want to look or ask you about the desktop metal deal, though. you know, on that, right now, is it all for kind of milling using itero to connect to the lab there for milling and/or 3d printing of just restorations? are you guys doing any early work with them on 3d printing of clear aligners? and just kind of, again, kind of update us maybe with your most recent thoughts on when we might start seeing 3d printing of the liners in the office and kind of your competitive advantages you think you can -- as a line carve out in that kind of setting.
thanks.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. jeff, that's a good question. you know, the desktop metal, primarily we think about a restorative play, how labs play a huge role and restore a dentistry with general dentists. i mean, they're really strong partners in that sense.
what desktop metal represents is you see a lot of 3d printing going on. there's some really great resin development around restorative types of things, dentures, different areas the desktop metal leads in and our itero scanner can really help with that, too. also, we have a vision of ortho restorative where you use our orthodontic procedures in order to reduce the amount of toothloss mass that often comes with restorative procedures, too, that we'll work together with desktop about. the idea of printing aligners and standard types of stl kind of processes from a 3d standpoint.
i don't see that. and honestly, jeff, i'm not one to think that doctors should turn their offices into production facilities. 3d printing is hard. the materials are difficult.
there's a lot of doctors actually trying it, but i feel like doctors are much better being physicians and doctors in that sense than trying to run a manufacturing operation.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
even in that first case to try to seal the deal and really lock that patient in as a pain customer?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
you know, jeff, i just think there are some things that kind of make sense from a productivity standpoint and some things that don't. maybe the technology changes to the point, jeff, will have a different conversation. but as it stands today, i really don't believe that.
jeff johnson -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
understood. thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from elizabeth anderson with evercore. you may proceed.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks so much for the question. hi. i was wondering if you could talk about, one, how you sort of think about the opex spend in terms of particularly sales and marketing in this environment? do you sort of -- obviously, with the uncertain demand profile, are there things that you're doing incrementally fourth quarter and the first quarter sort of switch that spend around?
john morici -- chief financial officer
yes. i think, you know, what we always look at, elizabeth -- this is john. we're always looking at trying to buy find the right return on investment. so, as you see some of the markets stabilize and start to come back that we see, that's where we'll continue to make investments.
and as we see volumes come back, we'll invest even more. like we talked about some of the stability in americas and emea. so, we'll also look at trying to find the right return on investment. and as those markets stabilize and come back, you'll see us continue to invest in there.
and as we said, last year, we kind of had to pair some of that back based on the conditions. and ideally, we could be in a better situation where we can make additional investments this year.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
that makes sense. and maybe i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the gp demand profile because it was interesting how that was sort of holding up on a relative basis. i heard what you said, obviously, about the teen commentary. is it something about that market or maybe the lower price point per case or anything like that that would sort of be impacting that? i'd be just curious to get more color on that.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
elizabeth, it's joe. could you restate that question? i didn't quite get the entire question.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
i think in your prepared remarks, you talked about the gp dentist sort of strength versus the ortho on a relative basis in the quarter. so, i was wondering if you could talk more about sort of the underlying color about why that -- why you sort of think that is at this point.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a good question. when you think about it, we have -- we're an elective procedure, right? and so someone is going to go to an orthodontist on a procedure like this advertise straight with the gp dentist, there is patient traffic there constantly with cleaning and restorations and different things. and so, just it's an area right now where since it's not just elective procedures there, we feel gps are just seeing more patients than the north of wood when you compare period to period.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. thank you.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
operator
thank you. the following question comes from jon block with stifel. you may proceed.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
maybe for the first one, john or joe, can you just talk about the 5.5% price increase for 2023? the 1q guidance is lower cases, lower scanner, and services but revs flat. so, clearly, asp benefits. and i think you realized the 5.5% the dock stays on comprehensive or goes to three by three. but how do we think about what flows to realized asp, john, is that sort of a, i don't know, a plus 2% or 3% from the 4q '22 levels when we think about 1q '23 and into the balance of '23?
john morici -- chief financial officer
that's a good way to look at it, john, because you're going to have some cases that kind of carry over where they kind of order them and they get shipped a little bit later. and then you're right, you're going to have some mix shift between the three by three, which is kind of the same price and then the full comprehensive. so, 2% to 3% in that first quarter is about in that range. ok.
go ahead, jon.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
i'm sorry, i know it was to clarify. that was just 2% to 3% sequential, john, correct from the 4q to 1q?
john morici -- chief financial officer
yes, that's correct. ok.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and sorry, the second question, just on the op margin, i think you said 18% non-gaap for 1q greater than 20% for the year. i'll just sort of load up a modeling question here. do we think about a sequential improvement for each of the quarters throughout 2023? and then that might be for john and joe for you.
just talk to us on how you're comfortable on that om guide, when you still have a lot of moving parts with the economy, you've got what's going on in china. i think you bring it as a fragile environment. how do you get comfortable with that om guide there's enough wiggle room, i suppose, in the opex where you feel you could titrate spend accordingly? thanks, guys.
john morici -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll take the modeling question, jon. yes, you would expect that just like we have in maybe prior years and so on, as you start to get that volume leverage, you'll start to see some of that margin improvement as you go throughout the year. so, kind of starts at that lower point and you would model it to see some improvement as you go through the year.
and like we said, total year slightly above the 20%.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
and, jon, on the om guide and the confidence is related to what we see right now and what we think is some macro trends that are much more stable than what we've experienced before. so, from that, we understand our costs, and we know what we have give and take. and john and i watch it closely, and we obviously manage it as a percentage of the total revenues are two. so, revenues have to adjust.
we have to adjust to. but again, i think we know what the levers are in this business. and within the context of stability, we feel we can manage to the numbers that we've given.
jon block -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
fair enough. thanks, guys.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jon.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from nathan rich with goldman sachs. your line is open.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for the question. joe, i just wanted to kind of follow up on your comments about starting to commercialize.
obviously, product and technology cycle that you seem very excited about in that sort of ortho and restore division. i guess, could you maybe just kind of help crystallize that for us in terms of how that kind of come to market in 2023 and the kind of type of investment that the company needs to make to kind of go after that opportunity?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
you know, nathan, overall, obviously, we do spend a significant amount on r&d in the business. and the foundation of that is the history of a line because basically, we realize we're a revolutionized digital orthodontics overall. but what we see is it's not just invention for inventions sake, we're always after, how can we do these cases faster, how do we do them more predictably, how do we make it simpler for doctors, a better treatment for patients overall and experience? and just to give you one statistic, right? so, versus wires and brackets, which you talked about in the script. on an average, we do patient cases five months past and 35% fewer visits to a doctor.
and you do that from technology, right? you do that through remote monitoring, you do that through the consistency of your algorithms and moving teeth and knowing when those seats are going to land as long as patients were. and so, the technology i talked about in those three areas, first of all, whether it's scanning, we get better on scanning every year. ai is a real important part of that because, through ai, you can anticipate a lot of things move these scans through a lot faster. inventions last year like ipp, invisalign, personal plan, those kinds of technologies really reduce the traffic and communications between a doctor and us in the sense of setting up treatment plans.
and lastly, 3d printed devices, as i mentioned, has always been the holy grail because we're the biggest 3d printer in the world, but we don't really 3d print devices, we print molds, which you vacuum form over top of it. when you vacuum-form over top of a mold, you can't control wall thickness as you can in 3d printing. and all think this is really critical to move teeth. so, all these inventions take a lot of time and money overall, but we just see a huge opportunity for us to be able to increase clinical efficacy, efficiency for doctors and patient experience, and that's why we're so excited about it.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. great. and then just a quick clarification. on the adult side, cases were up 7% sequentially and it sounds like you saw a modest improvement in north america.
i think that was the case in apac as well. i guess i didn't your reference to adult as you're talking about emea. i guess, was the kind of adult dynamic kind of more in -- when thinking about the western economy is more in north america. just curious if you also saw the same thing play out in emea as well?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
if i get the question right, nathan, i mean, emea was great, both adults and teens. we felt good about it. they came -- you always go around, i call it, the dark side of the moon in europe in the third quarter, right? but when they came out from the third quarter, we had a good fourth quarter from that. and so, we felt good on both the adult side and the teen side in europe.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. thank you. 
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you. 
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kevin caliendo with ubs. you may proceed.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. i always struggle with this number that you really haven't grown the number of docs and it's been a while. and i understand that when demand is down, you don't ship to docs every quarter.
but even the ones that are registered invisalign users haven't really grown. and i guess my question is, is there an issue with that? like why hasn't that number really expanded over the last four to five quarters? and do you need it as part of your growth algorithm to keep expanding the number of doctors? is it just a change in culture in the world right now? or is it competitive pressures? or is it just harder to find docs or are willing to do this? because the penetration of clear aligners would suggest there's a lot of doctors out there that could be doing this.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, doctors both on the orthodontic side and on the gp side. i mean, obviously, you're right about that. and obviously, we expand a lot globally, too. so, everything you said is true.
i'll just give you one word on your questions on china. china is china is like -- it's down. we ship the thousands of doctors in china, we can't ship to right now. and that's the answer to your question since why it's gone down.
there's no systemic overall issue in the sense of us being penetrated to the point that we can't buy more doctors, it's just we can't escape the downdraft of china right now.
john morici -- chief financial officer
and your equation is right. it's new doctors, doctors shipped to, as well as utilization. that is -- those are two key metrics that help us grow our business.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
can i ask a quick follow-up? you talked about, you know, the need to see consumer demand signals improving. and how far ahead can you actually see that? meaning -- is it -- is there something in ordering and planning? like can you see three months ahead or six months ahead in terms of you're starting to see demand increase? or is it really real-time, like we've made -- we're starting to see an inflection point. i guess it gets to the point of like what do you need to see in terms of consumer demand, how far forward can you look before you can really feel comfortable that there's been an inflection point?
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
kevin, when we look at things, we're a real-time business, obviously, when you have 3d freebies like we do what we make. and there's no leading indicator that would say it hasn't or squared of overnight, you know, 90%. but what we watch closely are the consumer confidence indices in the states in europe where we can get good wins. now they're more confirming than they are predictive in what we're seeing but they reflect the, i think, best from a demand standpoint of what we can expect in the consumer confidence indices that we see both in europe and the states have flattened out or turned slightly positive in the last month or so.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
thanks, kevin. next question, please.
operator
absolutely. our next one comes from brandon vazquez with william blair. you may proceed.
brandon vazquez -- william blair and company -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. i wanted to ask one to kind of go back to a couple of us who are trying to get at. you guided to a full-year op margin above 20%, and you're a little bit below that now, of course, probably transient. the question being, do you need sequential improvements in sales to then drive the sequential improvements in op margins through the year? like how should we be thinking about that? or are you prepared to kind of deliver that 20% even if let's say, were just stable through the rest of the year rather than improving?
john morici -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's a good question. i mean, you know, we would expect, you know, as we start to see demand, does it stabilize as things change in the world and give us a better operating environment? we would expect to see some sequential improvement in revenue as you go through the year. and that would help us get some of the leverage that we need from an op margin standpoint.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
thanks, brandon. next question, please.
operator
absolutely. the next question comes from erin wright with morgan stanley. you may proceed.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. just a follow-up to that last question, just to clarify, i understand you're not giving the full-year guidance from a volume perspective. but if you do continue to see the environment is what you're saying, sustained where it is today or get slightly better, you are in a position to grow volume year over year in 2023.
and then just a separate question on subscription offerings, particularly in retainers. and i'm curious how that's resonating with customers today as another revenue driver for the practice. and when do you think that that will be material in terms of contribution? thanks.
john morici -- chief financial officer
i can start on the volume. i mean, we would expect -- we're watching a lot of the signals closely. we tried to give more color around q1, and the rest of the year will play out as things in the world change to the situation. so, we'll watch volume closely.
but like i said, we would expect some sequential improvement as you go forward through the year. but -- we're not getting into the specifics of what it is for total.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
it's joe. on the dsp program, originally, that was targeted primarily at retainers or orthodontists because a lot of orthodontists are making their own retainers in the back room and for wires and brackets. and so, we signed up, we also obviously do the touch-up cases with that too is 10 aligners less. that's worked out well.
and we -- i think what you're referring to in the end is that's a subscription program to the doctor, but we also have a subscription program we offer from the doctor through the patients, and we're implementing that now. there's a lot of enthusiasm from our doctors about that because it becomes a reoccurring revenue stream for them that they haven't many of them haven't tapped into before. and so, we feel good about that. and we'll be working closely with our doctors to implement that more fully this year.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
thank you. next question, please.
operator
absolutely. the next question comes from michael ryskin with bank of america. you may proceed.
michael ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. i'll throw in a couple just real quick, some other stuff. first, on china, i think you mentioned that you used the word on more, which is kind of understandable.
but any updated thoughts on the bpp or any of the local on-the-ground detail? can you tell what's going on there while the covid situation is ongoing? or is it just kind of a box? and then i also wanted to ask on the tax rate, the non-gaap tax rate, you called out 20% in 4q, should we sort of assume that the tax rate as we go forward?
john morici -- chief financial officer
so, michael, this is john. on tax rate, for the non-gaap tax rate, assume 20% going forward.
joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
on china, bpp, i mean, obviously, that program over there, we talked about it several times, it's in tier 3, tier 4 cities. it's really not in the middle of our portfolio was picked up by some chinese competitors. we're primarily private over there. we will sell the public hospitals.
the program is not exclusive in that sense, too. so, i feel like we can manage in china right now around this fine.
shirley stacy -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
well, thank you, everyone. we appreciate your time today. this concludes our conference call. we look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings, including chicago midwinter, ids, and aao.

joe hogan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, shirley. good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. on our call today, i'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our two operating segments: systems and services and clear aligners. john will provide more detail on our q4 financial performance and comment on our views for 2023.
following that, i'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. you'll note that we have shortened our formal remarks in order to leave more time for q&a. overall, i'm pleased to report fourth-quarter results that reflect a more stable environment for doctors and their patients than the recent quarters, especially in the americas and emea regions, as well as parts of apac. for q4, trends in consumer interest for orthodontic treatment, patient traffic and doctors' practices, and itero scanner demos improved.
however, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results reduced our revenues and margins significantly. despite the large impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, q4 revenues of $901.5 million increased sequentially from q3, reflecting growth in systems and services, as well as a slight increase in clear aligner shipments. this is the first quarter in a year that our total revenues and clear aligner volumes increased sequentially. as we move through 2023, i'm hopeful that we'll see continued stability in an improving operating environment but remind everyone that the macroeconomic situation remains fragile.
regardless, we are confident in our large untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. we anticipate 2023 will be an exciting year for new innovation at align, and we'll begin to commercialize one of the largest new product and technology cycles in our 25-year history. the q4 systems and services revenue of $169.9 million were up 7.8% sequentially and down 21.3% year over year. on a constant-currency basis, q4 systems and services revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $2.7 million or 1.5% sequentially and approximately $11.2 million or 6.2% year over year.
for q4, systems and services revenues increased sequentially, driven by growth in the americas and emea regions, reflecting continued sales of intraoral scanners, especially the itero 5d. q4 sequential growth also reflects continued growth of our scale rental programs, as well as initial deployment of a certified preowned, what we call cpo scanner leasing rental program with desktop metal, that i'll describe in more detail shortly. we continue to develop new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers, and dso partners, which is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold. as our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade to make trade-ins and provide refurbish scanners for emerging markets.
we expect to continue rolling out programs such as leasing and rental offerings that help customers in the current macroeconomic environment by leveraging our balance sheet and selling the way our customers want to buy. on a year-over-year basis, q4 services revenues increased primarily due to increased subscription revenue, resulting in a larger number of field scanners. we also had higher noncase systems revenues related to our scanner leasing rental programs previously mentioned. to help accelerate the adoption of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry.
in q4, we announced a strategic collaboration with desktop metal to supply itero element flex scanners to desktop labs, one of the largest lab networks in the u.s. serving general dentists. the itero element flex is now the preferred restorative scanner for desktop labs and will connect dentists directly to a suite of offerings from desktop labs that simplifies the digital design and manufacture restorations with both traditional and digital technologies. our collaboration with desktop metal reflects our commitment to a relationship we expect will evolve and expand to being advanced restorative workflows to market.
we see significant opportunities to enable dentists to use scan data to directly order restorative services or printed ready digital files from desktop labs that we can be used for 3d printing in their offices. in addition to itero scanners, we're also excited about extending the benefits of the align digital platform, including the invisalign system and exocad software to desktop labs customers as well. for q4, total clear aligner revenues of $731.7 million were down slightly, 0.2% sequentially and down 10.3% year over year. on a constant-currency basis, for q4 clear aligner revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of $13.4 million or 1.8% sequentially and $56.4 million or 7.2% year over year.
q4 total clear aligner volumes of $583,000 was up slightly sequentially, reflecting growth in the americas and emea regions, offset by lower apac volumes primarily in china. for the americas, q4 clear aligner volumes were down slightly sequentially, reflecting lower ortho cases, expecting team starts as compared to the typical higher teen season in q3. offset primarily by an increase in adult patients from the gp dentist channel. for q4, clear aligner volume from dso customers continue to outpace non-dso customers.
for emea, q4 clear aligner volume increased sequentially in all markets and across products, especially recently launched invisalign moderate, igo plus, and igo express, which enabled gp dentists to treat a broader range of cases. mild to moderate types of malocclusions and can easily be integrated in a wide range of restorative treatments in a dental practice. emea had a strong sequential growth in the teen market segment with continued demand for invisalign teen case packs, which are available in france and iberia, as well as invisalign first treatment for kids as young as six years old. apac, q4 clear aligner volumes were lower sequentially due primarily to china, which continues to be impacted by covid.
in q4, ongoing covid restrictions and lockdowns in china persisted throughout the quarter. outside of china, apac volumes increased sequentially led by japan, taiwan, india, and southeast asia markets. on a year-over-year basis, q4 clear aligner case volumes reflected increased shipments led by korea, india, japan, taiwan, and vietnam. while the easing of covid restrictions in china and the more recent downward trend in covid infection rates are encouraging, many uncertainties remain, including the lingering impacts from covid across the population and the time and effort needed to restore consumer confidence.
for the other noncase revenues, which include retention products such as our vivera retainers, clinical training and education, accessories, e-commerce, and our new subscription program such as our dsp, fourth-quarter revenues were down slightly sequentially and up double digits year over year. for retention and e-commerce products, q4 revenues were relatively unchanged from q3. we are pleased with our subscription-based programs like dsp, which increased sequentially and year over year, and expect to continue expanding dsp offerings in other regions. for q4, the total number of new invisalign-trained doctors decreased sequentially due primarily to fourth quarter being a seasonally slower period for clinical education holidays, etc., as well as fewer trainings in china and brazil.
this was offset by somewhat significantly higher numbers of new invisalign doctors trained in emea. teen orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for clear aligner sales to orthos. we continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal braces through team-specific sales and marketing programs and product features, including invisalign first for kids, as young as six, which was up sequentially across all markets. for q4, total clear aligner team cases were down sequentially due primarily to the impact of covid in china, as well as seasonally fewer team starts in north america as compared to q3.
according to the december gauge report, which tracks approximately 1,000 orthos in the united states and canada, new patient exams routines slowed in q4, while new patient exams for adults improved slightly. a smaller pool of potential teen patients may put pressure on traditional orthos and cause them to go between clear aligners and wires and brackets, especially those practices that have failed to understand the significant benefits of adopting more efficient digital workflows, believing metal braces are more profitable. in emea, q4 was a record quarter for teen case starts. on a year-over-year basis, q4 case starts were relatively unchanged.
for q4, invisalign first increased year over year and was strong across all regions. invisalign first clear aligner treatment is designed for predictive results and a positive experience while addressing the unique needs of growing children from as young as six to treat phase 1. for the full year, invisalign clear aligner shipments for teens and young kids was approximately 733,000 cases, our teen case mix overall was a record 31% of invisalign cases shipped for the year. finally, in q4, the total number of doctors shipped was 82, 900 doctors a slight decrease due primarily to the impact of covid in china and off our q3 '22 high point, which included a major dso onboarding in north america.
for the full year 2023, we also shipped to the highest cumulative number of invisalign-trained doctors over 124,000 doctors, reinforcing our commitment to doctor-directed care for clear aligner treatment to achieve the safest and best possible clinical treatment outcomes for patients. with that, i'll now turn the call over to john.
john morici -- chief financial officer
thanks, joe. before i go through the details of our q4 results, i want to comment on two items in our fourth quarter financial results. restructuring and other charges, during q4 2022, we incurred a total of $14.3 million of restructuring and other charges of which $2.9 million was included in the cost of net revenues and $11.5 million included in operating expenses. restructuring and other charges included $8.7 million of severance-related costs and $5.6 million of certain lease terminations and asset impairments primarily related to rightsizing operations in russia in light of business needs.
second, non-gaap tax rate. in q4 2022, we changed to a long-term projected tax rate for our non-gaap provision for income taxes. our previous methodology for calculating our non-gaap effective tax rates included certain nonrecurring and period-specific items. that produced fluctuating effective tax rates that management does not believe are reflective of the company's long-term effective tax rate.
we have recast non-gaap results for our provision for income taxes. effective tax rate, net income, and diluted net income per share for each reporting period in 2022 to reflect this change. we did not make any changes to the results reported for 2021 as reflecting the change in our methodology for the computation of the non-gaap effective tax rate was immaterial to our 2021 results. refer to the section in our q4 press release titled recast financial measures for prior periods in 2022 for a tax rate change under unaudited gaap to non-gaap reconciliation for further information.
now, for our q4 financial results. total revenues for the fourth quarter were $901.5 million, up 1.3% from the prior quarter and down 12.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. on a constant-currency basis, q4 2022 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $16 million or approximately 1.7% sequentially and approximately $67.6 million year over year or approximately 7%. for clear aligners, q4 revenues of $731.7 million were flat sequentially, primarily from lower asps, mostly offset by higher volumes.
on a year-over-year basis, q4 clear aligner revenues were down 10.3% and primarily due to lower volumes and lower asps, partially offset by higher noncase revenues. for q4, invisalign asps for comprehensive treatment were flat sequentially and decreased year over year. on a sequential basis, asps reflect the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional liners and product mix shift. on a year-over-year basis, the decline in comprehensive asps reflect the significant impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, product mix shift, and higher discounts partially offset by higher additional liners and per-order processing fees.
for q4, invisalign asps for noncomprehensive treatment decreased sequentially and year over year. on a sequential basis, the decline in asps reflect product mix shift, unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, and higher discounts, partially offset by higher additional aligners. on a year-over-year basis, the decline in asps reflect the significant impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, product mix shift, and higher discounts, partially offset by hire additional liners and per-order processing fees. as we mentioned last quarter, as our revenues from subscriptions, retainers, and other ancillary products continue to grow and globally, some of the historical metrics that focus only on case shipments do not account for our overall growth.
in our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we've added to added our total clear aligner revenue per case shipment, which is more indicative of our overall growth strategy. clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $56.4 million or 4.8% sequentially and $171.9 million or up 16.2% year over year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. q4 2022 systems and services revenues of $169.9 million were up 7.8% sequentially, primarily due to higher scanner volume, services, and exocad revenues, partially offset by lower asps and were down 21.3% year over year primarily due to lower scanner volume and asps, partially offset by higher services revenue from our larger installed base of scanners and increased nonsystem revenues related to our certified preowned and leasing and rental programs. q4 2022 systems and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.7 million or approximately 1.5% sequentially.
on a year-over-year basis, system and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $11.2 million or approximately 6.2%. the systems and services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was up $9 million or 3.4% sequentially and up $42.9 million or 18.7% year over year primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. moving on to gross margin. fourth quarter overall gross margin was 68.5%, down one point sequentially and down 3.7 points year over year.
overall, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange on our revenues by approximately 0.6 points sequentially and 2.2 points on a year-over-year basis. clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.8%, down 0.1 point sequentially due to lower asps and higher warranty and restructuring costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing absorption and lower training costs. clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was down 3.4 points year over year, primarily due to lower asps, increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in poland, and a higher mix of additional aligner volume. systems and services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 58.8%, down 4.6 points sequentially due to lower asps and higher inventory costs and manufacturing inefficiencies, partially offset by higher services revenues and lower freight costs.
systems and services gross margin for the fourth quarter was down 5.9 points year over year for the reasons stated previously. q4 operating expenses were $505 million, up sequentially 6.2% and down 3.6% year over year. on a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $29.5 million, mainly due to restructuring and other charges and our continued investment in sales and r&d activities, along with higher consulting expenses. year over year, operating expenses decreased by $18.6 million primarily due to controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs, as well as lower incentive compensation, partially offset by restructuring and other charges.
on a non-gaap basis, excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring, and other charges, and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $459.7 million, up 3.7% sequentially and down 7% year over year. our fourth quarter operating income of $112.7 million resulted in an operating margin of 12.5%, down 3.6 points sequentially and down 8.9 points year over year. operating margin was unfavorably impacted by 0.9 points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange and lower gross margin. the year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology, as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 4.2 points.
on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions. operating margin for the fourth quarter was 18.3%, down 1.9 points sequentially and down 6.4 points year over year. interest and other income expense net for the fourth quarter was income of $2.7 million compared to a loss of $21 million in the third quarter and a loss of $0.9 million in q4 of 2021. primarily due to net foreign exchange gains from the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the u.s.
dollar. the gaap effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 63.8% compared to 40.7% in the third quarter and 13.2% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. the fourth quarter gaap effective tax rate was higher than the third quarter effective tax rate primarily due to decreased earnings in low tax jurisdictions as and an increase in the amount of u.s. minimum tax on foreign earnings.
our non-gaap effective tax rate was 20% in the fourth quarter and reflects the change in our methodology that was discussed earlier. our non-gaap effective tax rate was 11.5% in the fourth quarter of the prior year in 2021, which does not reflect the change in our methodology. fourth-quarter net income per diluted share was $0.54, down sequentially $0.39 and down $1.86 compared to the prior year. our earnings per share was unfavorably impacted by $0.04 on a sequential basis and $0.22 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange.
on a non-gaap basis, net income per diluted share was $1.73 for the fourth quarter, up $0.10 sequentially and down $1.10 year over year. note that the prior year 2021 non-gaap net income per diluted share or prior year 2021 eps does not reflect the q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of the non-gaap effective tax rate. moving on to the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1 billion, down sequentially $99.5 million and down $255.1 million year over year.
of our $1 billion balance $387.9 million was held in the u.s. and $653.7 million was held by our international entities. in october 2022, we purchased approximately 848,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $188.62 per share through a $200 million accelerated share repurchase under our may 2021, $1 billion stock repurchase program. we have $250 million remaining available for repurchase under this program, and we plan to repurchase this remaining amount starting in q1 2023 through either/or a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement, completing the repurchases in q2 of 2023.
q4 accounts receivable balance was $859.7 million, flat sequentially. our overall days sales outstanding was 85 days, down one day sequentially and up approximately seven days as compared to q4 last year. cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $144.7 million, capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $53.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $91.5 million.
we exited the cycle 2022 with a strong balance sheet, including $1 billion in cash and investments, a healthy cash flow position, and no long-term debt. as we announced with our earnings, align's board of directors has authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the current $1 billion program. this new $1 billion program reflects the strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow generation, as well as management and our board's continued confidence in our ability to capitalize on large market opportunities in our target markets and trajectory for growth while concurrently returning capital to our shareholders. now, turning to our outlook.
as joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our q4 results and what appears to be a more stable environment in north america and emea. we are cautiously optimistic for continued stability and improving trends as we move through the year. however, the macroeconomic environment remains fragile. and given continued global challenges and uncertainty, we are not providing full-year revenue guidance.
we would like to see improvements in the operating environment and consumer demand signals, including stability in china before revisiting our approach. at the same time, we are confident in our large untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry and our ability to make progress toward our strategic initiatives. we intend to focus on the things we can control and influence, which includes strategic investments in sales, marketing, technology, and innovation. for full year 2023, assuming no additional material disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 non-gaap operating margin to be slightly above 20%.
with this backdrop for q1 2023, we anticipate clear aligner volumes to be down sequentially, primarily due to weakness in china from covid, partially offset by some stability from our americas and emea regions. we anticipate clear aligner asps to be up from q4 2022 primarily due to higher pricing and nonfavorable and favorable foreign exchange rates. we anticipate itero scanner and services revenue to be down sequentially as the business follows a more typical capital equipment cycle. taken in total, we expect q1 2023 revenues to be about flat to q4 of 2022.
we expect our q1 2023 non-gaap operating margin to be consistent with our q4 2022 non-gaap operating margin as we continue to make investments in r&d and other go-to-market activities. for 2023, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $200 million. capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements, as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. with that, i'll turn it back over to joe for final comments.

thanks, john. in closing, we're pleased with our fourth quarter results and the improved trends in sequential growth we saw in the americas and emea regions and parts of apac that reflect a more stable environment for doctors and their patients. while still very early and many uncertainties remain, we're hopeful that we'll see continued stability across the business and regions, especially in china. as we continue to work through these challenges, we're confident in our ability to focus on our customers and deliver key technology and innovation that furthers our leadership position in digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry.
we are balancing investments to deliver shareholder value through transformative digital orthodontic solutions unique to align. align is a purpose-driven business, and we are committed to helping doctors transform smiles and change lives of millions of people around the world. over the last year, we have flooded our customer base with a lot of new technology that represents one of the largest new product cycles in our history. but there is still a great deal of room for innovation.
in the next one to three years, you should expect to see new platforms from us that will continue to revolutionize doctors' practices and patients' expectations for doctor-led treatment. and scanning, making it simpler and faster. in software, saving both doctors and patients more time with improved clinical outcomes. in direct 3d printing and evolution in both product and material science.
these three platforms will give doctors tools only dreamt of before with a singular focus to make the invisalign system the standard of orthodontic and restorative care, and we couldn't be more excited about it. thank you for your time today. we look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. now, i'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
