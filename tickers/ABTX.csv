our first question comes from line of brad milsaps with sandler o'neill. your line is now open.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
steve retzloff -- president
good morning, brad.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
paul, i was curious, you could maybe first, start with the operating expenses. i know you guys had a lot going on in the quarter with conversion. you talked about, you know, $400,000 of fica taxes that hurt, obviously, in the first quarter. i know last quarter when we were discussing cost savings, you know, thought you might continue to reinvest in franchise and spend a lot of those.
so long winded question saying, you know. what do you think, you know, your expense rate can fall to, if at all. kind of looking out over the next several quarters or is it gonna be a situation where it's kind of stays where it is because of the investments that you're making.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, by virtue of continually investing in the franchise, i think, first of, you'll -- you will see a fall in -- from the first quarter to the second quarter, and normalization, but our normalized numbers are going to have just embedded in them an upward trend by virtue of our investing in the business, and and inspiring producers. but if we're going to see -- we saw in addition to conversion related things, a little bit of extra one off items that weren't necessarily discussed during the call. we look forward to seeing that operating expense line normalize back into call it, $29 million to $29 and a half million dollars range so to speak in the second quarter, and maintain some growth there, but but really try to dampen the growth as we squeeze out other redundancies relating to [inaudible] because there still are some things that are running in parallel.
well, we -- we will have closed the door on a lot of redundancy here in the first quarter, but more -- there's a little bit more to come as we continue our efforts.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
ok. and just to follow up on, on the hiring. maybe, ray could comment, you know, what success you had in the first quarter in terms of bringing in people, and are you still looking at kind of the same pace, you know, that you guys have been targeting throughout the year.
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president of personal insurance
yeah, brad. we're real pleased with these -- the first of so far 19 of the six. they're all -- actually all six came from banks larger than us, of which, one was the money center. the other five were more regional type bank, focused banks.
so -- and the candidate flow has been very good. so yeah, this pace of, you know, i think, you know, we were at one a month, and we talked about maybe one and a half, something like that still seems like what we're -- the kind of talent flow that we're seeing right now for the rest of the year.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
got it, and i think, last quarter we talked about, you know, we kind of worked through math of the 2017 and '18 class. you felt like you sort of had capacity of several hundred million dollars, maybe $350 million. does that still kind of equate to a double digit, low double digit type loan growth in 2019 in your mind?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president of personal insurance
i would say so, yeah. but the -- with the -- in that number still the $350 million to $400 million is probably a good number when you start adding the '19 hires.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
ok. great. and one final for paul. you mentioned you said there were $600,000 of non-recurring fee income items at post oak.
is that correct?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
ok. great. thank you, guys.

our next question comes from matt olney with stephens. your line is now open.
adam freyaldenhoven -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey guys. this is adam freyaldenhoven on for matt today.
steve retzloff -- president
good morning, adam.
adam freyaldenhoven -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. so i wanted to start on the non-interest bearing deposits. they were down this quarter on an average basis, and i know you said that there was some seasonality, but was any of that from customers switching to interest bearing accounts?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president of personal insurance
so we don't see that in the first quarter as far as the migration of -- between the products. the -- if you kind of break it out into just in general, the components that -- what we call, the waterfall that makes up that decrease. you got basically opened accounts, closed accounts and carried accounts. and really the driver of the decrease in that demand was, what we call it, in the carried accounts, so those accounts that were currently on the books, just dropped in the first quarter.
and if you look at our -- if you try to pick up some trends, it's not a whole lot of trend there other than -- if you take -- if you look at '17 and '18 plus this quarter, the nine quarters, five of them carried balances go up, four of them carried balances went down. so that's why we're kind of looking at it temporary. what we really want to focus on and control more, which is the new account opening. and for the first quarter that was at a high watermark in terms of number of accounts and the dollar amount associated with those accounts.
adam freyaldenhoven -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. thank you. that's helpful. and one more on the nim.
i've known, previous quarters you bounced around the idea of toddling loan growth to help maintain the margin. is that something you're once again considering?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
what do you mean by that?
adam freyaldenhoven -- stephens inc. -- analyst
just to slow loan growth with the reprising pressure eases and you can kind of protect that -- protect your core margin?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
certainly. that is consideration and when you see this mix shift that is provoked thought. but when we disaggregate the difference in margin, what we see is that our core margin in terms of core loans funded by core customer deposits is actually stable. and we can really isolate the mix shift that occurred in this quarter very much -- that mix shift to effectively, let's call it, of that nim decline.
so really the core piece of our business we talked about it in the january call is if we're able to successfully fund our business and execute with core customer deposits, we should have stable margins. this quarter, we were not able to [inaudible] the margin decreased by product. so --
adam freyaldenhoven -- stephens inc. -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you. that's it for me.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of david easter with raymond james.
david easter -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president of personal insurance
david.
david easter -- raymond james -- analyst
just kind of following up on the core nim. i mean, you know, the key obviously is core deposit growth. could you just talk about core deposit strategies that you've got in place? and i guess with the flatter rate outlook, do you think that the rate of deposit cost increases could slow from here? and maybe combined with add-on rates in your loan portfolio actually stabilized the nim?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i'll speak to some stabilization, and ray will speak to the deposit initiatives. with -- this quarter, we did kind of see the full quarter effect with that december rate hike. and as you might imagine, a lot of more wholesale sources of fund that we had -- that we used during the quarter are more quarterly and the cost of that is directly proportional to the front end of the curve. so we saw some stabilization going into the back half of the quarter.
but ultimately, improving our mix is going to drive the nim story, the extent we can use less of those -- less desirable sources of funds. and ray, maybe you can hit on the deposit strategy.
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president of personal insurance
yeah, david. so this leading indicator we believe up in new accounts opened is just really where we're focused. and we do have markets where we're -- where we've just become more active, for instance, sugar land, stafford, north of the houston and the woodlands. those are markets where we are working on market share penetration there.
and some of the hires that were made in the first quarter going offices to further develop that market where we -- right now, we just don't have a lot of penetration. so the upside there, we're very excited about the growth we can get there. and that mix will look like our normal mix, which is -- where we've enjoyed this non-interest bearing as compared to the total deposit mix. our tm, we -- or treasury management in the first quarter, i'm not going to call fully implemented for the first quarter.
it currently got implemented maybe in february, but second quarter will be our first full quarter of a full team of treasury management sales and service. it has improved our customer experience on onboarding, and we've seen really nice growth in onboarding and treasury management customers going back in forth -- from the third quarter, fourth quarter and now first quarter, increases in all of those quarters.
david easter -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. you know, one of the other strategies we've talked about is the increasing your c&i composition, hoping that to drive deposit growth. it looks like c&i was relatively stable this quarter.
could you just talk about what you're seeing in that segment and your thoughts on growing that portfolio and ultimately, what it could mean for core deposit growth going forward, too?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president of personal insurance
definitely, strategy of the bank, and we -- you know, that almost -- it looks somewhat like the deposit announced, where you look at the leading indicator being new accounts opened. and so on the c&i side, we look at originations because at c&i with revolvers you may -- our funding history, as you know, you get some funding, not a 100% funding. so as far as the originations, we're very pleased with what's happened over the last few quarters, and even first quarter, the originations had slight increase from the previous quarter. and then you need to see that waterfall what happens when it turns.
but it is an effort we have actually of our 108 producers in the field. we actually have a team that really focused on c&i, a section of those, as well as, rest of the bank are working to improve that concentration.
david easter -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. thanks.

our next question comes from blair brantley with brean capital. your line is now open.
blair brantley -- brean capital -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president of personal insurance
good morning, blair.
blair brantley -- brean capital -- analyst
just a couple of quick questions. first, on the last comment, you mentioned 108 lenders. i think you had 107 last quarter, but you had six hires. was there some shift there, people leaving?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president of personal insurance
yeah. we had a couple of retirements and a couple exits.
blair brantley -- brean capital -- analyst
all right, great. and then just kind of think about capital plans you're going forward. paul, with buyback and kind of where you bought back last quarter, are you still kind of thinking about doing similar activity there? and how does that kind of fold into future m&a thoughts?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, we're trying to be as thoughtful as possible as it relates to our capital position. we're enjoying really being closed to high watermark as it relates to where we've operated from a cap [inaudible], and we expect improving profitability. so we plan on continuing the current share repurchase program. and there will be follow-up with our board as to whether to pursue more or consider other ways to return capital to shareholders.
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president of personal insurance
as far as m&a, we're continued to be, you know, a potential buyer and we're continued to enjoy relationships with a lot of bankers in the area, and so we're ready andwilling.
blair brantley -- brean capital -- analyst
is there any shift in the turn or the frequency of conversation or they attend out there at all?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
really in our market, i think there's a lot of digestion by virtue of last 18 months. we had about eight bank fields and has really a bumper crop of activity. so there isn't -- i'd say, the tone and pace of discussions have been a little quiet. but we continue to -- continue our own calling efforts so to speak.
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president of personal insurance
yeah. we've been active for quite a while. i mean basically, as i say, increase is just continuing at the same level that we've always been on for the last number of years. would you --
blair brantley -- brean capital -- analyst
thank you. i appreciate it.

we have a follow-up question from the line of brad milsaps with sandler o'neill. your line is now open.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
hey, paul, just wanted to ask quick housekeeping question on the tax rate. usually, it takes a step down in the first quarter with the way the option accounting works. i know you mentioned, you know, less contribution from [inaudible] and other nontaxable income. but just curious does it take a step up from here, and run at a higher rate than previously your -- kind of what are your thoughts around the tax rate?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
now that a lot of our expiring options that we enjoy the tax benefit from over the last year and a half, that's a bumper crop that has expired. and we don't expect that piece of the tax benefit to be. that means, we're going forward from here on end. and really what you see is a crawling out of those tax preferential revenue items.
and if anything, we may consider future mix shift in our securities portfolio away from municipal securities. so i'd expect to see our tax rate slowly migrate up.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
great. thank you.

george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, courtney, and we welcome all of you to our first-quarter earnings call. the first quarter of 2019 was a busy one for allegiance. during the quarter, we completed a successful conversion of post oak locations into allegiance bank, and we are well on our way to a common culture across our houston region footprint. additionally, during the quarter, we completed an acquisition of the lowerybank branch in sugar land, acquiring loans of approximately $45 million and deposits of approximately $16 million.
we are excited about our new customers from lowerybank and the strategic location we acquired, positioning us very well to support new and existing customers, as well as, to build our brand in this attractive houston submarket. also during the first quarter, we optimized our footprint by consolidating two bank offices in addition to the galleria office that was closed in november 2018. we exited our existing sugar land location in conjunction with the lowery bank branch acquisition. and we consolidated the legacy allegiance town & country bank office into the town & country location that was acquired in post oak bank.
as there were lot of moving parts during the quarter, but we are pleased with the results, and we feel the table is set for improving results as the year progresses. we experienced organic loan growth across our footprint without compromising our credit culture, even in the midst of our integration efforts, which is attributable to our highly dedicated bankers. core loan growth increased 12% annualized in the first quarter 2019 compared to the end of the fourth quarter 2018, including the loans acquired from lowery bank. loan deposits increased in the first quarter by $118 million albeit with a temporary increase in wholesale funding, partly to cover the shortfall that resulted from the lowerybank acquisition.
we continue to see exceptional loan loss experience as our net charge-offs were two basis points annualized for the first quarter and for the fourth quarter of the '18. we were pleased to see an increase in net income to $12.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.58 for the first quarter 2019 compared to $7.7 million and $0.57 per share for the year ago quarter. all of these successes point to the confidence that we have in our diligent employees and their ongoing ability to generate solid returns for our shareholders. our focus continues to remain on maintaining a work environment second to none, which is critical for attracting the best bankers in the houston region.
next, steve will describe our results in more detail followed by paul who will explain some of the numbers behind steve's narrative. then we will open the call for questions.
steve retzloff -- president
thanks, george. i also welcome everyone to our first-quarter conference call. what best characterizes the first quarter of 2019 particularly, given the intense handholding effort provided to our customers doing the core and online electronic banking conversion is a comment from one of our commercial customers who wrote, ""i've been so impressed with the level of professionalism and courtesy surrounding the conversion. from the start, i got the impression that allegiance bank was very concerned about making the conversion as smooth as possible.
i was impressed with the training held locally at your bank. very pleased that it was made convenient for all of your customers located in this area. the treasury department is totally amazing, but limited concerning questions i have were handled with professionalism and speed."" we received many other similar compliments. i will spare you a reading of them all.
all i can say is for us a successful conversion with an abundance of happy customers. it just doesn't get any better than that. notwithstanding the q1, all hands on that commitment to customer service and ongoing management of our integration, our bankers maintain strong momentum in growing our core loans, which we defined as loans excluding our mortgage warehouse lines. total core loans ended the first quarter at $3.78 billion, an increase of $109.4 million during the quarter, a growth rate of 12%.
excluding the acquired loans from the branch purchase of $45 million, the organic loan growth rate was 7%. this compares to core loan growth of $104 million or a rate of 11.7% for the fourth quarter. during the first quarter, our lender team booked $305 million of new loans that funded to a level of $200 million by march 31. this compares to the fourth quarter when $353 million of new loans were generated, which funded to a level of $223 million in the fourth quarter.
paid-off loans were $159 million in the first quarter compared to $166 million in the fourth. the average size of the new organic core loans generated during the first quarter was $418,000 submitted and $275,000 funded, which, once again, reflects our focus on the small to medium-sized business sector. based on total loan amount, the weighted average interest rate charged on our new first-quarter core loans was 5.76%, or based on period-end, funded balance was 5.70%, which is in line with the fourth-quarter weighted average rate of 5.75%. notably, the $159 million of paid-off loans during the quarter had a weighted average rate of 4.94%, whereas during the fourth quarter the $166 million of paid-off loans at a weighted average rate of 5.44%.
resulting from the new loans, paid loans, renewals and the resulting loan mix, the period-end weighted average interest rate charged on our portfolio, our core loans reflect an upward trend. at the quarter-end, weighted average rate, before accrued fees and acquisition accounting, increased from 5.47% as of december 31, 2018 to 5.52% as of march 31, 2019. paul will discuss the resulting portfolio yields and margins in his report. the mix of new loan production based on fourth-quarter funded levels was represented by the following four commercial categories: owner-occupied commercial real estate 22.8%, nonowner-occupied commercial real estate 14.3%, commercial term loans 13.5%, commercial working capital 9.1%.
these four commercial categories represented 59.8% of the new funded production compared to 52.1% for the fourth quarter and 61.8% for the third quarter of 2018, indicating our ongoing commercial concentration. loans secured by one to four family residential real estate contributed 17.9% of the new funded core loans. construction and development, including land loans contributed 14.5%, and multifamily contributed 2.9% of the new funded core loans during the quarter. the overall loan mix was a little changed on a linked-quarter basis.
the slide deck posted on our website provides added color regarding the overall mix of loans. the average funded loan size ended the quarter at $337,000. net charge-offs experienced during the quarter was once again very low at $210,000 on annualized rate of two basis points. the 2018 full-year net charge-offs were $1.57 million or six basis points.
the bank's quarter-end asset quality position remains solid. nonperforming assets ended the quarter a little changed from the fourth quarter, declining from 72 to 71 basis points of total assets. the $522,000 increase in ore was a foreclosed, undeveloped property for which we already have entered into an earnest money contract. non-accrual loans decreased only slightly during the quarter, ending at $32.7 million.
ten relationships represent 75% of the non-accrual loans, which, as a group, have a 14% specific reserve and a well-collateralized improvement. in terms of our watch list, our classified loans, as a percentage of total loans, once again declined, slightly ending at 2.08% of total loans at march 31 compared to 2.15% at december 31 of '18 and 2.26% at september 30 of '18. criticized loans increased slightly to a 3% from a linked quarter of 2.86%. the specific reserves for the impaired loans increased, ending the quarter at 18.5%.
total deposits increased in the first quarter by $117.5 million, ending the quarter at $3.78 billion, which looks good on the surface, but we experienced a challenging quarter as it relates to deposit mix. core or non-brokered deposits decreased by $65.6 million during the quarter with non-interest-bearing deposits representing $27.4 million of the decrease. the difference, which we view, is temporary to support the timing differential of loan and deposit growth exaggerated by our branch acquisition was funded with approximately $183.1 million of brokered deposits. we reiterate our emphasis on our core deposit growth initiatives, notwithstanding the setback in the quarter.
and i might add that the second quarter is off to a good start. given the decrease in non-interest-bearing deposits of $27.4 million, the non-interest-bearing deposit ratio ended the quarter at 31.2% compared to 33% at year-end. oil prices have elevated nicely since we reported last quarter to the mid-to-upper 60s per barrel recently, which although, allegiance continues to not focus on this sector, a higher price bodes well for the region. our local economic data remains positive.
according to the recently revised u.s. bureau of labor statistics, the houston msa gained 73,300 jobs during 2018 with unemployment at 4.2% as of february 2019. revised statistics indicated growth of 4,600 new jobs for beaumont rather than a previously reported decline. in the latest forecast from the perryman group, as reported by the greater houston partnership, metro houston is expected to grow by 600,000 people, add 340,000 jobs and $100 billion of increased gdp by the end of 2023.
for the trailing 12 months ended march 2019, single-family homes sales reached a very robust level of 97,000 homes in the houston msa. current inventory is at 3.9 months. and finally, the houston area purchasing managers' index ended february at 56.1%, further indicating expansion. so the overall tone with our commercial customers remains positive, and the local economic outlook is strong.
with a completed purchase of the bank office in sugar land and with the dust settled on our other bank office adjustments, including three office closures, allegiance bank now have 27 bank locations, including 26 in the houston area and one in beaumont, plus one lpo in southeast houston. our six new 2019 lender hires and other recent producer hires have been deployed into an existing available branch infrastructure into markets where they can be most productive. the remainder of 2019 will be focused on completing all remaining phases of our integration, including the elimination of redundancies, further market penetrations and a deeper dive into both procedural and technology-based efficiency enhancements. with that, i will now turn it over to our cfo, paul.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, steve. first quarter net income was $12.7 million or $0.58 per diluted share as compared to fourth-quarter earnings of $13.2 million or $0.59 per diluted share. our first quarter was impacted by higher funding costs and certain non-interest expenses related specifically to the post oak integration. first quarter net interest income decreased slightly to $44.6 million from $45.8 million in the fourth quarter.
this is primarily due to an increase in funding cost, and interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by continued organic growth. i should note, the first quarter had two fewer days than the fourth quarter. average interest-earning assets for the first quarter 2019 increased 2.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 and 60.6% compared to the first quarter of 2018. in conjunction with a full-quarter effect of the december rate hike, our cost of deposits and borrowed fund continued to increase during the quarter.
increased rates on the front end of the curve, coupled with overall trends in funding mix and cost, led $2.1 million, an increased interest expense in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. approximately $1.4 million of the increased interest expense came directly from increased levels of average broker deposits and borrowed funds balances over the quarter where the balance came from the migration and cost of customer deposits. total cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 178 basis points for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 153 basis points for the fourth quarter of '18 and 118 basis points for the year ago quarter. overall, cost of funds for the first quarter was 127 basis points versus 106 basis points in the fourth quarter and 87 basis points in the year ago quarter.
excluding acquisition accounting adjustments in the first quarter, the total cost of interest-bearing liabilities would have been 182 basis points, and the overall cost of funds would have been 129 basis points. we saw progress on core asset yields as the yield on loans in the first quarter was 5.86% versus 5.81% in the fourth quarter, and 5.4% in the year ago quarter. adjusting for the acquisition accretion recorded in the first quarter of 2019, yield on loans would have been 5.57% in the first quarter and 5.51% in the fourth quarter. total yield on interest-earning assets was 5.5% for the first quarter, 5.44% for the fourth quarter and 5.01% for the year ago quarter.
adjusting for the acquisition accretion, total yield on earning assets would have been 5.24% compared to an adjusted yield on earning assets of 5.18% for the fourth quarter. within the first quarter, acquisition accounting accretion increased loan income by $2.7 million, and reduced cd expense by $287,000 for a total positive effect on net interest income of $3 million. this quarter's accretion leaves $11.8 million in the loan mark and $1.1 million in the cd mark. the tax equivalent net interest margin for the first quarter was 4.31% compared to 4.45% in the fourth quarter.
adjusting for the acquisition accounting accretion, net interest margin would have been 4.03% for the first quarter compared to 4.16% for the fourth quarter. non-interest income increased to $3.3 million for the first quarter from $2.3 million for the fourth quarter, primarily due to losses from the sales of ore and ora of $429,000 during the fourth quarter of 2018 and approximately $600,000 of onetime items relating to post oak. first quarter 2019 also represents a very nice pickup from the $1.6 million from the year ago quarter. total non-interest expense for the first quarter 2019 was $31.1 million compared to $29 million for the fourth quarter of '18, primarily due to $1.2 million of merger-related expenses incurred during the first quarter of 2019 related to the post oak integration and systems conversion.
i should also note, the first quarter salary and benefits line featured some seasonality due to approximately $400,000 of elevated fica taxes as well as the annual salary increases, elevated temp and overtime expense around the conversion and expense related to certain employees that stay due to conversion. efficiency ratio for the first quarter increased to 64.97% compared to the 60.3% we posted for the fourth quarter, an improvement from 65.59% for the prior-year quarter. excluding merger-related expenses, the efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2019 and fourth quarter 2018 would have been approximately 62.52% and 58.55%, respectively. the provision for loan losses was $1 million for the first quarter of 2019 and the ending allowance at $27.1 million, a 71 basis points of total loans.
due to -- if you were to include $11.8 million in loan mark remaining on acquired loans, the ending allowance plus loan mark to total loans is 102 basis points and 103 basis points on core loans. this compared to 109 basis points to total loans and 111 basis points to core loans at december 31. our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.6% compared to 18.6% for the fourth quarter as municipal securities and boli represent increasingly smaller portion of our revenue mix. bottom line, our first quarter 2019 produced a return on average assets of 1.08%, and a return on tangible equity of 11.22%.
on the pre-tax, pre-provision basis, our roaa during the quarter was 1.43%, and excluding m&a-related expenses, it would have been 1.53%. before passing the call back to george, i should note that during the first quarter we made additional share repurchases under our board authorized share repurchase program. we repurchased just over 486,000 shares at a weighted average price of $35.65 per share during the quarter. entering the second quarter, we had about 444,000 shares remaining under the share repurchase program.
i will now turn the call back over to george.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from brad milsaps with sandler o'neill. your line is open.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, bryan.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
certainly, appreciate all the color on all the different dynamics. i was just curious, paul could you talk a little bit about your main outlook, if the fed decide to go ahead and cut rates next week, it looks like you're getting good pricing on loans, but still some creep on deposit costs, maybe those can start to go the other way for you, just kind of curious how you're positioning for potentially lower short-term rates would affect the nim?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
absolutely. i'd like to note, expansion to the nim during the quarter is a real credit to our broader team, working really diligently to reprice our loan portfolio over the past year, and it has been of real good help relative to the creep of cost of funds. also there is good execution on the deposit side that let us to be able to reduce certain levels of borrowings and broker deposits to a cumulative total of close to $100 million during the quarter. so that helped as well.
from a nim positioning standpoint and a downgrade scenario, we're as neutral as we kind of ever been, as it relates to kind of the absolute value of our interest rate modeling in any given shock. so traditionally, we've always tried to manage to a neutral stance on interest rate risk, and more often than not, we've either been slightly liability sensitive or slightly asset sensitive, but right now, we're really as neutral as we've ever been. so i think that bodes well. there could be a little bit of lag as it relates to the timing as to where we're going to get meaningful progress on the cost of funds.
but we're very bullish and we're looking forward to the opportunity of repricing the liability side of our balance sheet and have been taking the opportunities to do so, when certain broker funds and other things have come due. so we feel like we're very well positioned to entering into the third quarter, but it's hard to project significant change, given the cost of funds situation as it currently stands.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
no, that's helpful. can you or ray remind us what percentage of loans would kind of reprice with prime or libor? and what success have you had in maybe putting loan floors in at this point where some of the new loans you've been putting on?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
sure. yeah, so on the floating portfolio, it's about $1 billion, about $1 billion on loans that are floating. and almost -- except for the sba, most of those have floors. there is a portion that will, with the floor, that's lets say, not at 5.5, so there might be a little bit decline in the rate, if we get a rate cut.
but we would have floors in almost all variable rate loans with the exception of the sba loans.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
ok. so roughly 25% of the book is floating?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
correct. or there's another significant percentage that sticks within -- that is fixed with one year or less maturity.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
ok. and then just kind of a final...
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
we look at that a little bit like floating, so we had the floating plus the one-year fix, you get to a little higher number.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
ok. got it. and then just one final question from me, and i'll hop back in the queue. paul, if i understood correctly, the $576,000 of additional purchase accounting that was embedded in fee income this quarter along with a couple of hundred thousand in small business fund gains as well?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. the $576,000 in accelerated purchase accounting accretion came through in yields.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
ok. that was part of the 2.8?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
precisely.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
perfect.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the portions that hit the non-interest income, we had that lumpy piece of a sbic fee income, totaling a little over $200,000 and then, of course, we had the gains on sale of securities.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
got it. thanks for that clarity.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from matt olney with stephens. your line is open.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, guys.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i want to circle back on the core margin. it sounds like the bank is relatively neutral with interest rate, so i guess, the fed impact shouldn't have much of an impact on your core margin. any more color you can give us on the margin outlook? for you guys it seems like deposit costs continue to be challenging, but any more commentary? thanks.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
when we've been able to hit on all cylinders as it relates to execution in the quarter, you tend to see an effect on margin. this quarter was a great quarter as it relates to the positioning of our funding mix and as a result, we saw a nice pickup in nim. we also, obviously, got a little bit of benefit coming from securities portfolio repositioning, where we increased the taxable equivalent yields by about 20 basis points. that is relatively meaningful.
we'll get benefits from that kind of on a go-forward basis. but really, in contrast to the first quarter, where we lost on non-interest-bearing balances and saw a kind of an unfavorable mix shift in the portfolio in the funding mix, that's ultimately going to be what drives our nim story. we will continue to execute the way we did in the second quarter. we feel good about being able to see the stable nim and potentially even see some upside.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and paul, it looks like the interest-bearing deposit cost increased about 12 bps this quarter. how much confidence do you have that those have peaked, and we could see a decline in the third quarter?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. not huge confidence at the peaks such that you will see a decline in the third quarter. but i feel pretty comfortable that the peak is likely to hit in the third quarter and that we've got the potential for benefit deeper into the year that will manifest more clearly in our cost of funds story deeper into the year. so it's definitely a position where we look forward to repricing opportunities, but we don't want to put the cart before the horse here.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. and then going back to strategically positioning of securities portfolio, can you give us some more details around that? at what point of the quarter did you execute this? and what types of securities were you buying at what yields?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
certainly. well, it was generally rotation out of municipal securities into mortgage-backed securities and really, what you saw was the allocation of munies or tax-free securities in our portfolio go from about 51% to 24%. and for the portion that was sold about $148 million of municipal sold. we were able to get a pickup of, in tax equivalent yields of, just over 20 basis points.
and really decreased the credit risk profile of the securities portfolio, because we went into some agency securities and the overall risk weighting of the securities portfolio went down as well. so kind of one of those rare opportunities where you could achieve increased tax equivalent yields, decrease the risk weighting of your securities portfolio, expose yourself to less credit risk and take a nice stand. so it happened predominantly in april, but we had little bit in may and june.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and i assume you also shortened up the duration of the book, what was the duration before and after the trade?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we only slightly decreased the duration. so it was -- the goal wasn't to meaningfully change our interest rate risk profile, so i believe the duration of what was sold was at foreign change and what was bought was foreign change but slightly lower.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. thanks for the color. i'll hop back in the queue. 
operator
[operator instructions] and our next question comes from daniel mannix with raymond james. your line is open.
daniel mannix -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. hey, guys. good morning. 
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
hey, daniel.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
daniel mannix -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning. first, i wanted to dive a little deeper into the impacts of exiting the mortgage warehouse business. can you give us a little more color around how that's going to impact the efficiency ratio, what does that to the margin? and i guess, how much capital that frees up. and then, what the plans are to do with that capital? thank you. 
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
certainly. so unfortunately, the mortgage warehouse business had the footings that kind of waned. so it really made sense for us to send such a scale-oriented business to exit. secondarily, there's never core business for us.
and the yield profile is significantly lower than our core business. so as you can imagine, that's going to have the potential to be accretive to our yield profile and the capital associated with that is the type of capital that we can feel comfortable buying back under the new share repurchase authorization and really focusing on optimizing our return profile. so we feel good about a lot of the dynamics going into that strategic decision.
daniel mannix -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. great. my other question was just generally looking at the cre markets in houston, we've heard a couple of other banks complaining about some stretching in underwriting standards, let's say, and elevated paydown. so i want to get your perspective on what you're seeing in the market?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
yes. so, i probably can't speak to whether this is a more lenient underwriting, but we did have an outsize payoffs in loans for the second quarter. and i would attribute that to probably a maybe a lower rate offering from some of our competitors in houston cre out of the banks. so we did see that.
it was probably a high watermark as far as the payoff. we did have really strong originations, but we did see payoffs spike compared to previous quarters.
daniel mannix -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. thank you. that's it for me. thanks, gentlemen.
operator
thank you. we have a follow-up from matt olney with stephens. your line is open.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yeah, thanks. i just want to follow-up and ask more about the loan growth for the balance of the year. i think we're running so far this year, hfi growth around 8% annualized growth, can i get a bit better idea of the outlook for the back half of the year? and especially as ray mentioned the paydown, are those expected to subside at the back half of the year?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
matt, so we talk about the leader indicator being the loans originated and we're pleased with the origin nation we're seen in the first two quarters. so both quarters had originations in excess of $300 million. that's a pretty healthy number for us. but we did like we talked about these payoffs, does the -- will the payoffs at this level continue, i'm not -- i'm really not sure.
i think that we probably are entering may be a norm -- a new norm maybe of slightly increased payoffs. we're also looking at the, as far as our relationships, to making sure, we really to do have the kind of relationship that we need with our borrowing customers. so some of that payoff could be a function of where we're not really obtaining the entire relationship and have actually strategically let some of that, there is a portion of that in those payoffs. but with competitors if we are still seeing some long-term fixed rates out there, we'll probably still see some payoffs elevated in the cre portion.
we're really not doing 10-year fixed-type products.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
so i guess, kind of combining all that, is the right way to think about loan growth for you guys it will be similar between high single, low double-digit to pay upon the overall level of paydowns?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
that's probably fair. again, we'd like to see this loan originations in excess of 300. that is really the -- what happens with the waterfall after that will happen, but we're really focused on the top line of getting the originations that we need to generate that type of growth.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and i might add that, the organizations we are getting are really high-quality originations where we've been successful in repricing to the positive.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
we've got -- the added team that we brought in this year plus last year's team that gives us a lot of capacity to bring on new loans as well as deposits.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and then on the operating expense side, if i exclude some of the non-recurring charges this quarter, it looks likes the operating expenses were a little heavier than you're expecting. any color you can give us as far as what drove that in 2q? and then kind of looking forward from here, the back half of the year, what would you point us toward as far as a good run rate for operating expenses?
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
when we circle around the different items on the nie, we identify about $0.5 million in expenses that wouldn't be just continuing quarter to quarter. so -- and really newly tightened, i guess, if you want to call it that or something of that nature in terms of managing that nie, really tightly. given the growth rate and the payoffs that we've had year to date, it's just by increases. something in that same ballpark without those extra expenses would be probably where we are lining up the rest of the year.
with a real -- just a real disciplined approach to any increases at all, if any.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. that's all for me. thank you guys.
operator
thank you. and i'm showing no further questions in the queue. i'd like to turn the call back to mr. george martinez, for any closing remarks.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer

we have also provided an investor presentation on our website. although it is not being used as a guide for today's comments, it is available for review at this time. at the conclusion of our remarks, we'll open the line and allow time for questions. i'll now turn the call over to our ceo, george martinez. 
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, courtney, and we welcome all of you to our second-quarter earnings call. the second quarter of 2019 was one of execution on our strategic initiatives that resulted in record earnings of $14.2 million. we were pleased to see solid operating metrics as we continue to build momentum during the quarter. our net interest margins remained strong and even experienced growth over the first quarter, as a result of the dedication of our allegiance bankers.
the higher-margin benefited from solid loan repricing as well as the ongoing optimization of our balance sheet. at allegiance we're committed to revenue growth and achieving it by recruiting the best financial professionals in our market. we have enjoyed great hiring success year to date, as we added 10 revenue producers and a chief human resource officer as part of our investment in future organic and market share growth. additionally, we bolstered our treasury management group, who collaborates with our 27 bank offices to deliver first-class service to our existing and prospective customers.
we have also made a strategy decision to exit the mortgage warehouse business line, which allows us to redirect operational resources to focus on our core lending. the consistent growth of the earnings capacity of the bank demonstrates our focus on the execution and the earnings power of allegiance. we also continue to maintain strong capital levels that allow us to invest in opportunities to drive future performance and considerable return of excess capital to our shareholders. we completed our current share repurchase authorization of 1 million shares and are pleased to report that our board of directors has authorized another 1 million share repurchase which provides additional flexibility to optimize our capital structure.
we're pleased to see that our continued emphasis on overall asset quality has also proven to be strong as our experienced credit team has made significant progress toward the integration of one credit culture across allegiance. in essence, our solid performance was driven by the fantastic job of our talented bankers, to create relationships with prospects, deepen relationships with existing customers within the communities that we serve and achieve great results for our shareholders. next, steve will describe our results in more detail followed by paul, who will explain some of the numbers behind steve's narrative, then will open the call for questions.
steve retzloff -- president
thanks, george. i also welcome everyone to our second-quarter conference call. we continue to execute on our super-community bank strategy, where we offer not only strong technology but also a high level of local personalized service, particularly through independently on commercial businesses. we provide our customers with a relationship value that differentiates allegiance bank from an increasing array of out of territory and out of state competitors.
our growing brand awareness and reputation as houston's bank continues to lead the opportunities for sourcing great new bankers in addition to a reliable organic pipeline as we more broadly establish ourselves within the region. first, i will review our loan production metrics for the second quarter. total core loans, which excludes the mortgage warehouse lines, ended the second quarter at $3.81 billion, an increase of $42.4 million, during the quarter, or an annualized growth rate of 4.5%. this compares to our organic growth rate of 7% in the first quarter after, excluding the first-quarter branch purchase.
year to date, core loans growth has been $152 million or 8.3%, which reduces to organic growth rate of 5.8% after excluding that first-quarter branch purchase. during the second quarter, our staff and lending team booked a very strong $327 million of new loans that funded to a level of $222 million by june 30th. in the first quarter, $305 million of new loans were generated, which funded to a level of $200 million by the end of the first quarter. paid off loans were a little higher at $175 million in the second quarter compared to $159 million in the first.
the average size of the new organic core loans generated during the second quarter was $350,000 committed and $221,000 funded, which once again reflects our continued focus of building a diverse and granular loan portfolio. regarding interest rates on loans, based on total loan amount, the weighted average interest rate charged on our new second-quarter core loans was 5.74%, which is in line with the first-quarter weighted average rate of 5.75%. the $175 million of paid off loans during the quarter had a weighted average rate of 5.71%. carried loans experienced advances of $122 million at a weighted rate of 5.75% and paydowns of $118 million at a weighted rate of 5.44%.
thus the overall period in weighted average rate charge on our funded core loans, excluding fee and acquisition accounting increased 1 basis point during the quarter, ending the quarter at 5.53%, ended at 6 basis points since december 31, 2018. paul will discuss the resulting portfolio yields and margins in his report. the mix of new loan production based on second-quarter funded levels was represented by the following four commercial categories. owner-occupied commercial real estate 17.7%; non-owner occupied commercial real estate 13.8%; commercial term loans 11%; and commercial working capital of 5.5%.
these four commercial categories represented 48% of the new funded production compared to 59.8% for the first quarter and 52.1% for the fourth quarter of 2018, which indicates our ongoing commercial concentration. loans secured by one-four family residential real estate contributed 27.3% of the new funded core loans. construction and development, including land loans contributed 17.9% and multifamily contributed 3.9% of the new funded core loans during the quarter. the overall loan mix was little changed on a linked-quarter basis.
a slide deck posted on our website provides added color regarding our overall mix of loans. i note that the average funded loan size ended the quarter was unchanged at $337,000. at the asset quality which at quarter end remains in a solid position, a headline metric is level of net charge-offs experienced during the quarter, which was once again very modest at $590,000 for an annualized rate of 6 basis points. half of the second-quarter charge-off number was due to a single one-four family residential loan, where the collateral was sold during the quarter.
so far, 2019 year-to-date net charge-offs has been at a rate of 4 basis points as compared to 6 basis points for all of 2018. non-performing assets, including both non-approval loans and ore ended the quarter up slightly from the first quarter increasing from 71 to 79 basis points of total assets. but as i will explain, both are well covered by specific reserves, collateral and in some cases sba guarantee. non-approval loans actually decreased by $1.3 million.
of course, the change was a net effect of the increases and decreases. the decreases were primarily from two relationships totaling $7 million. one was a $5.8 million commercial real estate relationship, which by foreclosure was moved to ore. the other was a one-four family residential property, which was foreclosed and sold during the quarter, which had been $1.2 million.
the increases were five relationships totaling approximately $5.9 million. of those, the three largest were $1.8 million loan within an appraised value of $2.6 million, a $1.75 million loan which is currently under contract to be sold and $900,000 loan within an appraised collateral value of approximately $1.2 million. the nonaccrual loan ended the second quarter at $31.4 million, down from $32.7 million at march 31st. the combination of specific reserves and sba guarantees equals approximately 31% of that outstanding balance, with the remainder well covered by underlying collateral.
just to provide adequate color, our ore consisted only two properties. the first is the aforementioned $5.8 million cre loan, which has a recent appraised value of $6.5 million and is being marketed. the second was a $575,000 loan for a home in an upscale gated community with a very competitive asking price of $635,000. any listeners planning a near-term move to houston, should give us a call.
overall, we believe our non-performing assets are well collateralized and manageable. in terms of our broader watch list, our classified loans as a percentage of total loans, once again, declined slightly in 2.02% of total loans as of june 30th compared to 2.08% at march 31st or 2.15% at december 31st of '18, or 2.26% at september 30th, 2018. criticized loans also decreased to 2.91% at june 30th, compared to 3% at march 31st. this specific reserves was impaired loans increased ending the quarter at 20.4% from 18.5% at march 31st.
on the deposit front, we're pleased by organic deposit growth in the quarter. total deposits increased in the second quarter by $80.6 million, while also repricing broker deposits by approximately $18.5 million of core deposits. thus core deposit increased by $99 million during the quarter. non-interest-bearing deposit declined slightly by $8.5 million with the non-interest-bearing deposit ratio ending the quarter at 30.4% compared to 31.2% at march 31, 2019.
so we continue to focus the entire allegiance team on our core deposit growth initiatives from both borrowing and nonborrowing customers. i'll make a few notes related to the local economy first, touching briefly on oil prices which have recently softened to a trading range in the $50 to $60 per barrel over the past month, more recently near the mid-50s. while this softness is generally unwelcome, u.s. oil production continues to be projected to further increase from current high levels through 2020, according to the energy administration's recent forecasts.
as said, allegiance continues to not focus on this sector with no reserve base lending and only 3.2% of our existing loans having a direct or indirect dependency on the industry, which is a decline from 3.4% at march 31. a wider view of our local economic data remains broadly positive. according to the recently revised u.s. bureau of labor statistics, the houston msa gained 79,8000 jobs during the 12-month period ending may 2019, and currently has a record level of non-farm payroll jobs at 3,164,000 jobs.
unemployment for the msa registers at 3.2% compared to 4.1% a year ago. for may of 2019, 8,346 homes were sold in the area, an increase over a year earlier. year-to-date vehicle sales remained strong at 25,000, up 2.7% from last year. the houston area purchasing managers index ended may at 52.7, further indicating expansion.
the houston msa has grown by over 1 million people since 2010, and the trend is expected to continue both due to net migrations and due to natural population increases. as it relates to allegiance bank branch footprint, the data shows that the recent population growth over the past eight years has been at a faster rate in suburban county as compared to the larger harris county, where the city of houston is located. our expanded branch footprint from the recent post oak and larry branch acquisitions overlay that trend perfectly, with incremental offices, including two in fort bend county, two in montgomery county, two in liberty county, one in chambers county and one in jefferson county which is in beaumont. several of the new lenders additions have been in those markets, which we anticipate bolsters our opportunity for further market share gains.
these and other indicators present a positive outlook for the region and for our commercial customers. as i conclude it, i would note that so far in 2019, we've added 10 new lenders, as we continue to hire opportunistically and selectively, and notwithstanding the performance of our acquired and legacy producers, we highlight that these new additions and other recent lender hires provide substantial growth capacity going forward. during the second quarter, we also completed the selection and began implementation of a robust new loan origination system, which will provide operational improvements and efficiencies going forward. acknowledging though, the importance of generating further efficiency improvements, we hired a high-level chief human resource officer who has hit the ground running, being tasked with developing and implementing enhanced organizationwide disciplines for kpi-based performance reviews, workflow balancing, training, compensation design, and enhance business case analysis for all staffing decisions.
with that, i will now turn it over to our cfo, paul.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, steve. second-quarter net income was $14.2 million or $0.66 per diluted share, as compared to first-quarter earnings of $12.7 million or $0.58 per diluted share. second-quarter performance benefited from certain one-time items, most notably $846,000 gain from the sale of securities. accelerated purchase accounting accretion due to payoff totaling $576,000 and $214,000 of sbic income.
second-quarter net interest income increased to $45.6 million from $44.6 million in the first quarter, primarily due to increased yields on assets and growth in average earning assets in the second quarter versus the first quarter, partially offset by the increase in funding cost on interest-bearing liabilities. note that in the second quarter, purchase accounting accretion increased net interest income by $2.8 million compared to $3 million in the first quarter. within the second quarter, acquisition accounting accretion increased loan income by $2.5 million and reduced cd expense by $213,000 for a total positive effect on net interest income of $2.8 million. this quarter's accretion leaves $9.1 million in loan mark and $848,000 in cd mark.
we continue to see progress on core asset yields, as the yields on loans in the second quarter was 5.88% versus 5.86% in the first quarter, and 5.52% for the year-ago quarter. adjusting for the acquisition accretion, recorded in the second quarter of 2019, yield on loans would have been 5.62% in the second quarter versus 5.57% in the first quarter. total yield on interest-earning assets is 5.58% for the second quarter, 5.5% for the first quarter and 5.12% for the year-ago quarter. adjusting for the acquisition accretion, total yield on earning assets would have been 5.34% compared to an adjusted total yield on earning assets of 5.24% for the first quarter.
a portion of the increase in asset yields came from a strategically positioning of securities portfolio out of municipal securities and into taxable securities, which is also the source of the significant gain on sale income in the quarter. the total cost of interest-bearing liabilities is 186 basis points in the second quarter, compared to 178 basis points for the first quarter, and 137 basis points in the year-ago quarter. the overall cost of funds for the second quarter was 132 basis points versus 127 basis points in the first quarter and 98 basis points in the year-ago quarter. excluding acquisition and accounting adjustments in the second quarter, the total cost of interest-bearing liabilities would have been 189 basis points and the overall cost of funds would have been 134 basis points.
taxable net interest margin for the second quarter was 4.33% compared to 4.31% in the first quarter. when you adjust to the acquisition accounting accretion, net interest margin increased to 4.07% for the second quarter compared to 4.03% for the first quarter. non-interest income increased to $3.8 million for the second quarter from $3.3 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the sale of securities, which netted gain on sale of $846,000 and $214,000 of lumpy sbic income. total non-interest expense for the second quarter was $30.1 million compared to $31.1 million in the first quarter.
note that we incurred $1.2 million of merger-related expenses during the first quarter related to the post oak integration and systems conversion. q2 non-interest expense came in slightly higher than expectation due to continued investments, strategic hires and other non-recurring items totaling over $500,000. so the efficiency ratio for the second quarter improved to 61.93% from 64.97% posted for the first quarter and 67.05% from the prior-year quarter. excluding merger-related expenses, the efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2019 would have been 62.52%.
provision for loan losses was $1.4 million for the second quarter, and the ending allowance at $27.9 million is 72 basis points of total loans. if you were to include the $9.1 million in loan mark remaining on acquired loans, the ending allowance plus loan mark total loans is 96 basis points and 97 basis points on core loans. this compares to 102 basis points for total loans and 103 basis points to core loans at march 31st. our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.51% compared to 19.6% for the fourth quarter, as municipal securities and increasingly smaller portions of revenue mix, more so this quarter, due to the securities portfolio repositioning.
the bottom line, our second quarter of 2019 produced record results as we saw return on average assets of 1.9% and return on tangible equity of 12.52%. on a pre-tax pre-provision basis, our roa during the quarter was 1.62%. and excluding the onetime items, previously discussed, would have been 1.55%. now as previously mentioned, during the second quarter, we did complete the share repurchase program by repurchasing just over 444,000 shares at a weighted average price of $35.63 per share during the quarter.
we're very comfortable with our capital position and we're pleased to have board approval for another 1 million shares repurchase authorization until july 31, 2020. i will now turn the call back over to george.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from matt olney with stephens. your line is now open.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey. thanks. good morning, guys.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, matt.
steve retzloff -- president
good morning.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i'll start on the deposit side. i think paul, i believe you mentioned that this was an inflection point on the deposit cost side. in the third quarter, we still see higher deposit costs versus 2q. so i'm curious, what month did this inflect in 3q? and can you give us some color about how much improvement of deposit costs we should expect over the next few quarters?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
certainly. it's a little bit slower on the way down than it was on the way up. interestingly enough, the deposit costs or cost of funds really peaked in june and july and showed positive -- decreased slightly in august and september, respectively. so progress is being made, but the -- it sure did ramp up a lot faster than it's coming down, really because we want to be as thoughtful as possible as we approach those repricing discussions with our depositors, particularly since we still have growth ambitions as it relates to ensuring that those deposits stay at the bank.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. great. and then on the loan side, i think it sounds like the payoffs remain elevated. i think it's a theme that we're hearing from others as well.
anything you can point to specifically that you've seen recently? is it bank competition, nonbank competition? are these borrowers selling their businesses? any more color's appreciated.
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
hey, matt, the -- we hadn't looked at that really on just the entire year because the outsized payoffs has really been that way for all three quarters. and if you look at all three quarters in aggregate and you look at those paydowns, we're seeing about 20%, 21% of paydowns are related to better terms, better pricing where we're just -- we just remain disciplined on those loans as far as how we price. and then about 80% is in the category of sale of business, sale of company, cash in bank to -- i just got the loan, had nothing to do with competition or anything like that. so that's where we stand year to date.
and we are looking at that but again, we're going to remain disciplined in our pricing, and i think we may see some of that in the company. that's what's happening in the competitive market on the loan side.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and, ray, are you sensitive that those headwinds and those challenges intensified in the third quarter or had just remained consistent throughout 2019?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
i think on the -- i looked at it on a year-to-date basis, there may have been a little uptick in the third quarter in the better terms, leaving for terms and conditions. but it looks to be pretty consistent over all three quarters.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. and then as far as the producer headcount, i think, as steve said, it's been 13 year-to-date additions. but on the other hand, it sounds like you've lost a handful of employees. were those revenue producers or nonrevenue? and how many employees have you lost? and i guess, just give us the overall headcount of the total producers.
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
on the producer side, the -- in the quarter, the two that were added in the quarter kept our producer level the same. so we entered the quarter with 115, and we finished the quarter with 115. so there was an add of two and a loss of two.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. ok. thank you, guys.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, matt.

our next question comes from brady gailey with kbw. your line is now open.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
thank you. good morning, guys.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
steve retzloff -- president
good morning.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
i wanted to start with the sub debt raise of $60 million at a pretty attractive cost. how do you think that plays into continuing the buyback? i mean, you've repurchased about 6% of the company year to date. do you anticipate utilizing the full $60 million of sub debt to continue to repurchase stock here?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, our first kind of step on bringing that sub debt in was to pay down our holding company line of credit, which we did in early october and then the remainder and what we had drawn to finance some repurchases ahead of that sub-debt raise. so some of that repurchase activity that we stated on the prepared comments had been financed by the holding company line of credit. and then what remains of that proceeds in the bank would be sufficient to cover any additional share repurchases under our existing plan.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
ok. all right. and any color on the cecl impact to your reserve that's coming up next quarter?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i can provide some -- our reserve will be higher directionally. i've note that probably the -- one of the larger points of comparison is the fact that the discount that we have on purchased loans will manifest itself more directly in a reserve, come cecl adjustment on january 1, and then the adjustment will go from there. and we're comfortable with the levels. and in particular, we feel like we've been able to be pretty agnostic as it relates to the outcome of cecl because of that tier 2 capital treatment from the overall reserves did it not fall into the income statement.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
all right. and then you had roughly $2 million of accretable yield this quarter. i know cecl can impact that number just as that $7.2 million discount moves into the reserve. do you expect a notable drop-off in yield accretion in 2020?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. and actually, it stands to reason as you've seen, the accretion we've had since the closing of the transaction. what you witnessed in the first three quarters was a transaction -- first quarter -- pardon me, the fourth quarter of '18 and the first two quarters of '19, relatively higher levels of accretion. it dropped off rather significantly here in the third quarter.
it'll step -- it's scheduled to set down to, by a large margin, here in the fourth quarter. i'd say that at least 25% if you don't have an impact from early paydowns and some of the things along those lines. there's a lot of stuff that can affect the schedule of our accretion. and then what's left really accretes into the earnings stream at a less rapid pace.
so 2019 -- 2020 accretion will be significantly lower than 2019 accretion levels.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. and then finally for me, the benefit you saw from the fdic assessment credit. i mean, is there any of that left that will be a benefit in future quarters?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, there is a -- some left for the fourth quarter. i don't believe it will be as large as the third quarter. we were fortunate in that we get the benefit -- based on timing, we get the benefit of both our small bank assessment credit and that of post oak. so we will have some remaining benefit going into the fourth quarter.
and we're hopeful that future assessment credits could come through from the fdic, but we'll see.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
right. great. and george, good luck in retirement, wish you all the best.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer

our next question comes from brad milsaps with sandler o'neill. your line is now open.
peter ruiz -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
hey. good morning. it's actually peter ruiz on for brad.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, peter.
peter ruiz -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
just wanted to maybe follow up on the margin. i appreciate all the color you guys gave, but just was thinking about -- you've previously kind of indicated that you thought the nim could maybe hold steady here even on future rate reductions. but just wanted to get your sense on what that looks like going into 2020 if we do get this -- get another cut here in -- next week and just what you guys are thinking from here.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
certainly. we're working hard to execute such that we can maintain a stable nim. the structural implication of the sub-debt deal will have some effect on our nim positioning. and as we see in the longer term, we like our overall nim story by virtue of the nature of our lending being a little higher rate, and you just really have to go back to the prior interest rate cycle two or three years ago to see where our yield on interesting assets played out or tend to be.
we do have a rate-sensitive liability base. so we think as we hit floors, there's the potential for there to be some wind at the back of our nim. but up to this point, we've been feeling pressure. and it's hard right now, given some changes in the funding markets and the lending markets, our competitive markets, to give too bullish signals on nim, notwithstanding the fact that, kind of broadly speaking, we like the nim implications of where we operate our business.
peter ruiz -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
ok. maybe following up on matt's question. just in terms of the deposit cost, you mentioned you reached an inflection point. total deposit costs were essentially flat linked to quarter.
so can you kind of give a sense of where spot rate kind of deposit costs were for some of the products, maybe the month of september versus where they were in july?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
they're certainly lower. i mean, we -- if you follow where the wholesale curve was in september versus july, we try to keep our pricing at consistent spreads from that. and so that's what's enabled us to have a little bit more of a -- empowerment when we go to repricing discussions with some of our more price-sensitive deposits. but we tend to kind of base our pricing -- deposit pricing methodology based on the competitive markets we're in using where the wholesale fhlb and brokered curves are as the baseline and pursuing certain spreads within there and then letting that guide a little bit of our -- of how we think about exceptions.
so i think that point-to-point comparison would probably be the right thing to look at probably with a little bit of a lag, particularly as it relates to how we approach the deposit repricing discussion, there is some lag, particularly on the cds since it's a function of that, of what's coming due and renewing. but other than that, we try to -- we do operate on somewhat of a lag. so the benefits aren't going to be as stairstep as they would in some cases. although we do have certain portions of our deposit base that our 100 beta linked to fed funds.
it's just that's not the preponderance.
peter ruiz -- sandler o'neill + partners, l.p. -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of david feaster with raymond james. your line is now open.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, david.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
i'd just like to follow up on that, the comments on -- about your -- floors on your loan portfolio. could you give us some more details into that? how much of your book has floors? how close to -- are we to hitting those? and ultimately, given your history and your client base, how effective have floors been? and how effective do you expect them to be at protecting loan yields?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
well, about a third of the portfolio is variable and almost, i would say, other than the sba piece that's in there, those loans generally have floors. so i think the question is where does the floor -- what is the level of the floor? so, i mean, we've seen floors that are -- some floors that we've had that never -- we never busted through the floor, even on a rising rate environment and some of those loans are still on the book. so i mean the floor is going to range somewhere between four something to five -- fours and the fives. so we feel really good about that on our variable book.
and that's -- again, that's about a third of the portfolio.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then i guess, so looking to the core nim, you've got the sub debt coming off. it sounds like loan yields, there were some noise there that are -- caused loan yields to decline more than what we would have expected.
i mean how do you think about a core nim next year as we -- with the prospect -- you got the september cut coming through and prospects of another one. i mean do you think we're going to have a core nim here in the mid 3.80s ? or is there opportunity to get it closer to 3.90.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
where we'll project our core nim is the -- where we operate and where we land and our ability to have a little bit more pricing power than the anecdotal discussions of loan competition out there about kind of 10-year nonrecourse funding at 3.85. we don't operate in that type of market, in general. and we're not -- we do see that competition. but generally speaking, it's not targeted toward our client base.
and we're -- we've historically been able to benefit from some pricing power as a byproduct, and we're going to seek to do just that in this rate environment to overall kind of maintain a floor on the overall yield story on our assets and put us in a position to appreciate the lag benefits of repricing the deposits. so we see that as being a medium to long-term stabilizer in our nim. so, but in the short term, as you see in the third quarter, we felt the squeeze and how it plays out and then determines probably what's a little more uncertain for us as we know and are pretty confident in the overall strength of our long -- medium and longer-term nim composition in a down rate environment.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're just going to remain very disciplined on pricing and underwriting and terms and so forth. and given the kind of the smaller loan-type customer, as paul says, we're underwriting that particular client base at rates that are commensurate to the type of risks that they pose. and the underwriting, like i say, is not changing in terms of credit quality.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and kind of along the same lines, i mean, with you sticking to your guns in terms of underwriting and pricing and that as ray talked about, increasing competition and elevated paydowns, i mean, how do you think about loan growth going forward? i mean, some originations are obviously holding up pretty well. but i mean, given elevated pay downs and potentially higher competition, is a more of a mid- single-digit rate of growth more appropriate or do you think you can stay somewhere in that high single-digit level or north of that?
ray vitulli -- executive vice president and president
well, i mean we're originating. and other than the -- i mean, paydowns are a big piece. but i mean, we're originating to grow than what you're describing. we do have -- with the lenders we brought on board, we do have capacity of market share growth that we're going to rely on to get the growth that we -- that we're looking for.
so it's like we've seen this year, it's a function of the pay downs, and we'll just continue to originate. and we like that leading indicator, which is the levels of originations we've had and we're happy with that.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. all right. thanks, guys.
operator
our next question comes from matt olney with stephens. your line is now open.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hi. yes. just a follow-up on the overall strategy here. we're talking about the revenue headwinds with respect to the margin and slower loan growth from some of these paydowns.
and i'm just curious on the operating expenses and if you're going to slow down the rate of expense growth. and so specifically, i'm looking for some help on operating expense growth in 2020.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're -- we've been unabashedly investing in the future for many years. and then there comes times when you can take advantage of some of that previous spin and leverage off of that into the future. and we feel like there's probably a reasonable amount of opportunity for that on the margin going forward. so we're looking for improvements.
the spend rate is probably tapered a little bit just in some of the changes in the third quarter and year-to-date, such that i think we can take advantage of that a little bit in q4 and early in '20. and so again, we've got capacity and a lot of the lenders already. we are opening an office in january. we are proud of that, as we mentioned.
those lenders that are in there are already working for the bank so that's not a net increase. so we're -- we think we can improve that operating leverage a bit going forward. and i mean, loan growth will certainly be a part of that equation. and with nim?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. in george's prepared remarks, he acknowledged, really leveraging productivity gains and where we have retirements or certain levels of turnover of being in the position to not replace. and yes, i think that can have structural benefits in helping our cost structure, notwithstanding the fact that we want to maintain a growth posture and continue to invest in the business.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and i respect that you guys are probably in your budget planning sessions for next year but, paul, are there any numbers you can help to put behind that as far as thinking about the expenses in 2020?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
[inaudible] seeing that we don't have a practice of giving guidance just yet. i'll defer on that but we are planning to be mindful of some of the potential realities of the current environment as we plan for 2020.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. and then i'll also ask about credit quality. i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks, the addition of a $9 million -- i think that was a nonaccrual loan, if i heard it correctly, commercial construction loan with some delays. any more color on that? what type of project is this? any specific reserve? and what's the loan-to-value on this project?
steve retzloff -- president
the loan-to-value in that kind of 80%, 85% range. and not too much color on the loan but it looks like a viable project with good demand that just experienced some delays and a few cost overruns. some actually weren't even caused by mother nature. but yes, we feel good about what we're doing to work with that particular borrower in that case.
but -- and that was a big part of the number. when you look at the nonaccruals or the nonperforming assets that -- the big jump was that one loan. but again, real estate collateral is something that doesn't run away at the end of the day, and you still have it to work with. so we feel good about that one, at least in terms of the base and type of nature of it.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and there was a higher provision expense for loan losses this quarter. was there something specific on that loan or a separate loan that drove that?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
nothing specific on that one. but there was some impairment activity on smaller loans. i think steve actually acknowledged a little bit of that. what you did see is by virtue of the to-date accretion on the acquired loans.
our methodology called for topping off our allowance for our loan losses relating to the relative size of the discount on the acquired loans. so that ended up being a relatively meaningful piece of the overall provisioning story.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. ok. thank you, guys.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the allegiance bancshares, inc. third-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, ms.
courtney theriot, executive vice president and chief accounting officer. please go ahead.
courtney theriot -- executive vice president and chief accounting officer
thank you, operator, and thank you all who have joined our call today. this morning's earnings call will be led by george martinez, chairman and ceo; steve retzloff, president; ray vitulli, executive vice president and president of allegiance bank; paul egge, executive vice president and cfo; and shanna kuzdzal, executive vice president and general counsel. before we begin, i need to remind everyone that some of the remarks made today may constitute forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended. we intend all such statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the act.
also note that if we give guidance about future results, that guidance is only a reflection of management's beliefs at the time the statement is made. management's beliefs relating to predictions are subject to change, and we do not publicly update guidance. please see the last page of the text in this morning's earnings release for additional information about the risk factors associated with forward-looking statements. if needed, a copy of the earnings release is available on our website at allegiancebank.com, or by calling heather robert at (281) 517-6422, and she will email you a copy.
we also have provided an investor presentation on our website. although it is not being used as a guide for today's comments, it is available for review at this time. at the conclusion of our remarks, we will open the line and allow time for questions. i'll now turn the call over to our ceo, george martinez. 
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, courtney, and we welcome all of you to our third-quarter earnings call. third quarter of 2019 was a productive quarter for us, in which our team of dedicated employees worked to achieve several strategic objectives. we were particularly pleased to see quality growth in noninterest-bearing deposits of 18.5% annualized for the third quarter compared to the second quarter, and broader success on the deposit front that allowed us to let nearly $100 million in broker deposits roll off the balance sheet during the quarter. new loan production was strong at just over $315 million, approximately in line with expectations, although net loan growth came in below expectations due to higher-than-anticipated loan payoffs.
we continue to exercise discipline on pricing and terms. at the end of the quarter, we successfully completed a $60 million subordinated debt offering, which enhances our capital position and also positions us well for future growth. our investment in our culture across allegiance is reaping great rewards as we are seeing successes from our recruiting efforts over the years and our ability to increase market share. we added two new lenders during the third quarter to support our future growth and made the strategic hire of a chief information officer to enhance our utilization of technology in all aspects of our business.
at the same time, some bankers have left the bank, and as a result of productivity gains, many will not need to be replaced, thereby improving our cost structure on a go-forward basis. we continue to focus our efforts on creating new and deepening existing customer relationships by providing the same steadfast commitment to delivering personalized service for which we are known within our community. it is this commitment that has helped us grow to better serve our employees, our customers, shareholders, that sets us apart as a premier community bank in the houston region. we are encouraged about our position of strength and our outlook for the remainder of the year as we work to leverage our talent and capital to produce results for our shareholders.
this morning, we also announced a time line for transitioning to steve as ceo of allegiance bancshares. i will remain as chairman of the board, but steve as the new ceo will be leading the earnings calls going forward. as i prepare to step away from ceo duties at the end of the year, i'm extremely pleased with the accomplishments of the entire allegiance family in building houston's largest community bank, and i know the best is yet to come. next, steve will describe our results in more detail followed by paul, who will explain some of the numbers behind steve's narrative.
then we will open the call for questions.
steve retzloff -- president
thanks, george. i also welcome everyone to our third-quarter conference call. we recently completed our 12th year since our start-up in 2007 and are currently ranked 11th in deposit share within the houston msa. we accomplished this by way of a near-even split between organic growth and acquisitions.
the brand value behind the allegiance name and the differentiation that accompany our super-community bank strategy continues to grow and be recognized. being houston's bank is core to our identity, and as we continue to gain market share. that relationship deepens every day, not only through the bank services we provide but also from the many hours of volunteer service our staff contributes to the local community. allegiance bank was recently recognized for our many efforts with the 2019 community builder award by the west houston assistance ministries.
our commitment, beaumont was also reflected through participation by allegiance bankers from both houston and beaumont in their world habitat day event. for these and many other community activities, we appreciate the ongoing generosity and dedication from all of our employees. first, i will review our loan production metrics for the third quarter. total core loans, which excludes mortgage warehouse lines ended the third quarter at $3.85 billion, an increase of $37.6 million during the quarter or an annualized growth rate of 4%.
this compares to the organic growth rate of 4.5% in the second quarter. year to date, core loan growth has been $189 million or 6.9%. during the third quarter, our staff and lending team once again booked a very strong $315 million of new loans that funded to a level of $210 million by september 30th. this compares to the second quarter when $327 million of new loans were generated, which funded to a level of $222 million by the end of the second quarter.
paid-off loans continued to be high at $188 million in the third quarter, compared to $175 million in the second quarter and $159 million in the first. the average size of the new organic core loans generated during the third quarter was $407,000 committed and $270,000 funded, which once again reflects our continued focus on building a diverse and granular loan portfolio and as the average size of our funded loans ended the quarter at $337,000. regarding interest rates on loans, based on total loan amount, the weighted average interest rate charge on our new third quarter core loans was 5.5%, which is below the second quarter weighted average rate of 5.74%. the $180 million of paid-off core loans during the quarter had a weighted average rate of 5.74%.
carried core loans experienced advances of $109 million at a weighted rate of 5.67% and paydowns of $103 million, which were at a weighted rate of 5.54%. all in, the overall period-end weighted average rate charge on our funded core loans, excluding fees and acquisition accounting, decreased eight basis points during the quarter, ending the quarter at 5.45%, which is close to where the year began at 5.47% as of december 31, 2018. paul will discuss the resulting portfolio yields and margins in his report. the mix of new loan production based on third quarter funded levels was represented by the following four commercial categories: owner-occupied commercial real estate, 22.2%; nonowner-occupied commercial real estate, 15.6%; commercial term loans, 13.1%; commercial working capital, 8.3%.
these four commercial categories represented 59.2% of the new funded production, compared to 48% for the second quarter and 59.8% for the first quarter of 2019, indicating our ongoing commercial concentration. loans secured by one to four family residential real estate contributed 21.8% of the new funded core loans; construction and development, including land loans contributed 11.7%; and multifamily contributed 2.6% of the new funded core loans during the quarter. the overall loan mix was little changed on a length-quarter basis. the slide deck posted on our website provides added color regarding our overall mix of loans.
asset quality at the quarter end remained in a manageable position. the level of net charge-offs experienced during the quarter was once again very modest at $729,000 or an annualized rate of seven basis points. so far, 2019 year-to-date net charge-offs have been at a rate of five basis points as compared to six basis points for all of 2018. nonperforming assets, including both nonaccrual loans and ore, ended the quarter up from the second quarter, increasing from 77 to 88 basis points of total assets.
nonaccrual loans increased a net of $3.3 million during the quarter from $31.3 million to $34.5 million, resulting from both increases and decreases. the decreases were from payoffs of approximately $3.4 million; payments applied to principal of just under $1 million; foreclosures of three properties from two relationships of $2 million, which are now ore; and charge-offs of $729,000. the increase is totaling $10.3 million for downgrades primarily from two relationships, one at $9 million and a smaller load of approximately $600,000. the additional $700,000 of downgrades was from six smaller relationships.
regarding the two larger relationships, the smaller one, which is at $600,000, is fully reserved. the larger is a commercial construction project, where although a recent appraisal reflects adequate loan-to-value coverage, project delays and increased construction costs led to the downgraded status. we are working to optimize the outcome of these relationships. to that end, i am pleased to report that since the end of the quarter, two other nonaccrual loans totaling approximately $1.8 million have paid off.
these specific reserves represent approximately 18% of the outstanding balance of the nonaccrual loans. approximately 75% of the outstanding balances are collateralized by real estate, and the overall estimated loan-to-value at the unreserved exposure of the nonaccrual loans is 80%. our ore consists of five properties totaling $8.3 million. the largest is a $5.8 million industrial/commercial real estate property which has a recent appraised value of $6.5 million and is being marketed.
the second largest at $1.2 million is a lot located in the well-established upscale river oaks subdivision. the third largest is a $575,000 home in a popular gated community. the remainder are three smaller properties, located west of houston. overall, we believe our nonperforming assets are well collateralized and manageable.
in terms of our broader watch list, our classified loans as a percentage of total loans increased slightly, ending at 2.18% of total loans as of september 30th, compared to 2.02% at june 3rd. criticized loans decreased slightly to 2.87% at september 30th, compared to 2.91% at june 30th. the specific reserves for the impaired loans ended the quarter at 18.2% from 20.4% at june 30. on the deposit front, we are pleased by the changes in our deposit mix in the quarter.
total deposits increased in the third quarter by $36.8 million, representing a 3.8% annualized growth rate in the quarter and 8.5% year to date while, as george mentioned, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $54 million or an annualized growth rate of 18.5%. with that, noninterest-bearing deposits improved to 31.5% of total deposits at september 30th, compared to 30.4% at june 30th and to 31.2% at march 31st, 2019. finally, the deposit mix further improved during the quarter as we were able to let just under $100 million of broker deposits roll off the balance sheet. obviously, we are pleased with the recent mix change and continue to focus the entire allegiance team on our core deposit growth initiatives from both borrowing and nonborrowing customers.
as to the houston economy, let's first look at the data. the west texas intermediate oil price began 2019 at its low of $46.50 has traded as high as $66.30 and is more recently in the mid to low 50s range. the houston msa has added 81,000 jobs over the past 12 months, led by professional, scientific and technical services, some manufacturing, other services, distribution and healthcare. houston unemployment rate was at 3.9% in august, compared to 4.4% a year ago.
home sales are on the pace for a record-setting year at 58,128 homes sold through the first eight months of 2019. the local area purchasing managers index registered in the expansion zone at 51.6% in august. new vehicle sales are down, 2.4% year to date, showing more slowing in recent months than earlier in the year. but the port of houston is reporting increased tonnage, up 4.7% year over year.
and finally, hotel occupancy is down slightly, and average room rates are down a bit. with all of that, there are both signs of strength and some softening. we do, however, note the benefits of houston's growing population as well as increased economic diversification in globalization. we continue to be disciplined with regard to underwriting standards and monitoring of our relationships in pursuit of consistent, strong, long-term asset quality performance.
as i conclude, i would note that so far in 2019, we have added 13 new lenders, one of which a promising promotion from within. construction continues to make progress for our new leased branch office in the east side of downtown houston. the leadership team for that new office and the easton community anxiously await opening of the branch in early 2020. finally, as george mentioned, i have humbly accepted the request and election by the board of directors to serve as ceo of the company as george martinez leaves that responsibility, but continues to serve close by as our chairman.
i'm excited to serve in this capacity alongside ray vitulli, who will ably serve as president of the company and ceo of allegiance bank; with paul egge, our talented cfo; and okan akin, soon to serve as the bank's president. i mentioned these three today, but my thoughts of appreciation contain many others. and in contrast to most new ceos, mine is not a newfound excitement. rather, my journey began 12 years ago when george and i co-founded the bank and has since evolved into tremendous confidence in our ability to represent excellence for all of our stakeholders as we both weigh and pursue our future.
my great confidence comes from my familiarity with the leadership, talent, and culture that exists at all levels in our organization. i am so grateful to be able to serve the individuals who very much deserve all of the credit for our past accomplishments and from whom our high expectations are derived. with that, i will now turn it over to our cfo, paul.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, steve. third-quarter net income was $12 million or $0.57 per diluted share as compared to second quarter earnings of $14.2 million or $0.66 per diluted share. third-quarter performance is impacted by a certain onetime item, most notably $1.4 million of severance costs, partially offset by a $676,000 small bank assessment credit from the fdic, netting to additional expense of about $755,000 in the quarter. also recall that second-quarter performance benefited from significant nonrecurring revenue items, partially offset by acquisition expenses, netting to an approximately $1.5 million benefit.
adjusting for these onetime items, net income would have been $12.6 million or $0.59 per diluted share for the third quarter versus an adjusted $13.1 million or $0.61 per diluted share in the second quarter. third quarter net interest income was $44.8 million, down from $45.6 million in the second quarter, primarily due to lower acquisition accounting accretion versus the second quarter as higher interest-earning assets was essentially offset by lower net interest margin before acquisition accounting. in the third quarter, acquisition accounting accretion increased net interest income by $2 million, compared to $2.8 million during the second quarter. beginning the third quarter, acquisition accounting accretion increased loan income by $1.9 million and reduced cd expense by $154,000 for a total positive effect on net interest income of $2 million.
this quarter's accretion leaves $7.2 million in the loan mark and $694,000 in the cd. yield on loans in the third quarter was 5.72% versus 5.88% for the second quarter and 5.49% for the year-ago quarter. adjusting for the acquisition accretion recorded during the third quarter, yield on loans would have been 5.43% versus 5.62% in the second quarter. the total yield on interest-earning assets was 5.43% for the third quarter, 5.58% for the second quarter and 5.12% for the year-ago quarter.
adjusting for the acquisition accretion, total yield on earning assets would have been 5.26%, compared to an adjusted total yield on earning assets of 5.34% for the second quarter. the total cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 188 basis points for the third quarter, compared to 186 basis points in the second quarter and 153 basis points for the year-ago quarter. overall cost of funds for the third quarter was 133 basis points versus 132 basis points in the second quarter and 109 basis points in the year-ago quarter. excluding acquisition accounting adjustments in the third quarter, the total cost of interest-bearing liabilities would have been 190 basis points, and the overall total cost of funds would have been 135 basis points.
during the quarter, we did see inflection in our cost of funds on a monthly basis, and we feel well positioned to show incremental improvement in our cost of funds as we work to reprice our deposits in the current lower interest rate environment. taxable net interest margin for the third quarter was 4.16%, compared to 4.33% in the second quarter. adjusting for the acquisition accounting accretion, the net interest margin would have been 3.97% for the third quarter, compared to 4.07% in the second quarter. noninterest income decreased to $2.9 million for the third quarter from $3.8 million for the second quarter, primarily due to the second quarter being bolstered by certain nonrecurring revenue items, including $846,000 on the gain of sale securities and $214,000 of lumpy sbic income.
total noninterest expense in the third quarter was $30 million, compared to $30.1 million in the second quarter. note that during the third quarter, we incurred $1.4 million of severance expenses, partially offset by the $676,000 small bank assessment credit from the fdic. the efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 62.88% from 61.93% that we posted in the second quarter and 63.95% for the prior-year quarter. excluding the onetime expenses during the quarter, the efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2019 would have been 61.3%.
the provision for loan losses was $2.6 million for the third quarter, and the ending allowance at $29.8 million is 77 basis points of total loans. if you were to include the $7.2 million in the loan mark remaining on acquired loans, the ending allowance plus loan mark to total loans is 95 basis points. bottom line, our third-quarter 2019 produced a return on average assets of 0.98%, and a return on average tangible equity of 10.33%. on a pre-tax pre-provision basis, our roaa during the quarter was 1.45%.
and excluding the onetime items previously discussed, it would have been 1.51%. last, we'd like to highlight that we were actively repurchasing shares under our new repurchase authorization, buying just over 437 shares at a weighted average price of $32.45 per share during the quarter. we feel comfortable with our capital position and our flexibility to consider future share repurchases under the existing authorization. i will now turn the call back over to george.
george martinez -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, paul. operator, we would now like to open the line for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from brady gailey with kbw. your line is now open.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
yeah. thank you. good morning, guys.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
good morning, brady.
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
good morning, brady.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
i wanted to start with loan growth. as we look to 2020, how are we thinking about loan growth? it looks like in 2019, outside of a little noise, you grew loans and kind of that mid- to high single-digit level, does that feel like the right outlook for 2020 as well?
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
that's probably safe. the -- for '19, we probably -- the elevated paydowns were probably maybe about $150 million more over the entire year than what we expected. and we did see a little bit of relief in the fourth quarter on paydowns, but it was still elevated compared to what we expected, but i think that's fair.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
yeah. last year was also an integration year as well, and we've kind of got a really good start going into 2020. so, i think we have a decent year.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
all right. and then, how should we think about growth in the expense base in 2020 relative to 2019?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'll take that. so seasonally in the first quarter, we tend to have a little bit higher growth -- higher expense levels, if you look back from the past four, five quarters, you'll see our march quarter tend to have a little seasonal adjustment. that's when we do salary adjustments on an annual basis, as well as, there's higher payroll taxes that hit predominantly in the first quarter. but the overall run rate of our expenses, we do expect it to have some growth, although, we don't think it's going to be too -- as meaningful because we're very focused on getting operating leverage, but we will acknowledge that that first quarter will increase.
if you're trying to build a bridge from the fourth quarter to that first quarter, i'd acknowledge really that $900,000 differential. other than the other one-time items, the differential in our bonus accrual going into the back -- into the fourth quarter of the year was relatively significant in the fourth quarter and gave an expense relief that if we're hitting on all cylinders in a normalized quarter, you're not going to see that.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
right. that's helpful. and then any color on cecl and the impact that will have next quarter, paul?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
definitely. so, when you think about our loan loss reserve as the existing loss reserve on the prior standard plus the double-counting of the discount on acquired loans, you'll get to about where cecl is going to be. granted, there's some volatility there as it relates to the -- we expect some quarterly provision volatility in the future as a byproduct of the pace of quarterly loan growth changes in unfunded balances and changes in economic forecasts and other assumptions, which is one of the reasons we're not doing back puts about cecl. but the overall effect is not that significant on us when you adjust -- really add back that -- what's the existing credit mark on loans to our existing reserve level.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
all right. great. thanks, guys.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt olney with stephens. your line is now open.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, guys.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
good morning, matt.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i want to start with a core or call it, the adjusted margin. we saw some good stability in the fourth quarter. what's the outlook for the margin from -- in 2020 from the fourth-quarter levels? and specifically, how much more opportunity do you see to move down deposit costs from here? thanks.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
certainly. we're expecting stability, but working hard to create expansion. it's just in this market, where we're really fighting -- the good fight competitively on both the asset and liability side. it's hard to pencil in anything other than stability.
but as we execute, we do think that there is potential, just as much as there's risk for contraction if the execution falls off, but there is potential. when you look at the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and i think the -- i'll note that the potential is greater on the funding side and getting back to levels that we were at, call it, five quarters ago. the rate at which cost of funds really increased in that first half of the year was quite phenomenal, and we're working really hard to ratchet that down without upsetting the proverbial apple cart with existing clients and position ourselves to do better. we are finding that the competitive dynamics are supporting our ability to walk down rates and exercise more discipline.
but at the same time, we are focused on continuing to be able to fund loan growth, which we hope to get back on track in 2020.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok, great. thank you, paul. and then on the credit front, i believe in the prepared remarks, you mentioned there was an upgrade of a credit to help drive lower nonaccruals. i think the upgrade you said was over a $7 million credit.
any more color on that upgrade? and then on the other side, charge-offs were a little bit elevated in the fourth quarter. any more color on what drove the higher charge offs? thanks.
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
well, matt, on the upgrade, i mean, that was just the case of a pre-identified credit that we've been watching closely and performance of the credit over a significant period of time warranted the upgrade, as well as, the collateral position. on the charge-offs, the -- it was elevated compared to prior quarters, but it's nothing that we're really in the significant concern factor. it was -- majority was three customers, and we continue to work with recovery as far as collateral and liquidation of collateral for those credits.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok, got it. thanks, guys.
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david feaster with raymond james. your line is now open.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
hey, david.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
so, we've historically talked about that kind of $1.5 billion origination level, and we're trending a little bit below that just given the competitive landscape. but looking forward, i guess, given the hiring initiatives, and just again, taking the competition into play, too, do you think that's still a reasonable target for 2020?
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
oh, hey, david, the -- i would say, we were really targeting about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion on the origination. and yes, we do feel that's still a good number going forward. we did have 14 producer hires in '19 that will be gaining traction in '20, with also two internal promotions through our officer development program. so, there's capacity there that will help toward those origination numbers, but that kind of $300 million a quarter is still a number that we feel is an achievable number.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. and then, it was great to see the core deposit growth. could you just talk about what our strategy is to continue driving this? is it the treasury management that's just started to hit stride? is it the commercial growth that's helping there? just some more color into your strategy there.
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
yeah, you hit it there, david, it's more of the same. we definitely are feeling really good about our, what we call, a leading indicator of new accounts opened and both non-interest-bearing, and then, across all account types. and then also our -- we do track our onboarding of new treasury, whether it's brand new treasury customer that's never been here before or an existing customer that's never had treasury services. and so, those numbers are heading in the right direction, and that was definitely a function -- or that resulted in the growth that we enjoyed in '19.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. last one from me. just any updates on the warehouse and the runoff there? and are there any expected expense savings from that?
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
so the exit is going on track. we're down to really just a handful of customers. it's been very orderly, and it worked as we had hoped. there will be some reallocations.
it was a very small department. there will be some reallocation of some of that staff as we -- but we're not going to probably have that executed until we actually fully exit. we do still have customers right now.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from brad milsaps with piper sandler. your line is now open.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
good morning, brad.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
ray, steve, i joined a few minutes late, so, i apologize if you addressed this. but ray, you just mentioned 14 new producers in '19 plus two promotions. i was going to see if you guys had handy the stats as you sort of grade each class of new lenders, 2017, '18, '19, and kind of what their capacity is at this point in terms of what they're able to take on to get them to that sort of $30-ish million loan book goal that you typically have?
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
yeah. that's -- brad, the -- that population of '16 -- i'm sorry, '17, '18, and '19 is around 30 producers and there's probably capacity there of another -- we actually -- if you look at the population that's not '17, '18, and '19, but all of our legacy lenders. that's around $41 million, is that average. so, there's definitely embedded capacity with '17, '18, and '19, probably something like $250 million is probably just from those 30.
it will not necessarily happen in 2020, but that's the -- that would be where we're headed with that -- where they stand today and once they get to, let's say, the average of the others at 41.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
and, ray, it's still kind of -- you're targeting kind of one new producer a month?
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
yeah, that's how '19 shaked out. i think that we'll -- there will be some in '20, but i also feel we'll have some homegrown in '20 as well, supplement that growth through our officer development program, where we had two this year or in '19, we may have four or so in 2020. so, i think you'll see something close. i'm not sure if it will be the '14 or '16 that was in '19.
but --
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
we're also excited about opening that branch on the east side of houston pretty soon. so that will help us at least get some geography there for '20.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. and paul, just on the federal home loan bank advance that you prepaid, did that happen toward the end of the quarter? we see some pick up in 1q? or did that kind of happen toward the beginning of the quarter where most of the benefit from that's in the -- already in the run rate?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
happened about one-third of the way through the quarter. and yes, we got two months of benefit from it.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. what was the rate on that advance?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it was $50 million that was costing around 280 basis points.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok, great. thank you, guys.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
thanks, brad.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt olney with stephens. your line is now open.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking the follow-up. just wanted to circle back on the dividend announcement, first-ever dividend, $0.10 per share. loved here, just more about the decision to institute the dividend and just a general view on current capital levels? thanks.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
yeah, matt, thanks a lot. yeah, we're just managing capital, and obviously, we've got capital accretion through our earnings. and with the growth expectations balanced out throughout the year. we'll take a -- this is a just kind of a modest entry-level of dividend that we would like to enter into and hold to.
but we also will look at other capital strategies, such as buybacks as appropriate to manage our capital levels. so with the accretiveness that we've got on capital today, it just seems like the right thing to do, and it's a good balance for us.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i might add that it just really represents the diversification of our capital management effort, a steady dividend, it isn't that much in the grand scheme of things, but it does allow us to kind of diversify how we pursue returning capital to shareholders. so, we'll continue to pursue share repurchases when it makes sense to buy back stock, but this is a good step for us.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. and paul, do you have it in front of you on the share repurchase plan, what the current authorization stands at right now?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the -- so we -- our second authorization for 1 million shares, we have about 230,000 shares remaining on that authorization to that.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and when does that expire?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i don't think it expires for another nine months or something along those lines.
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
eight or nine months, yeah.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
but if we run to the end of it, we'll seek board approval for additional authorization.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok, perfect. thank you, guys.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
thanks, matt.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the allegiance bancshares, inc. fourth-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, courtney theriot executive vice president and chief accounting officer of allegiance bank.
please go ahead, ma'am.
courtney theriot -- executive vice president and chief accounting officer
thank you, operator, and thank you to all who have joined our call today. this morning's earnings call will be led by steve retzloff ceo of the company; ray vitulli president of the company and ceo of allegiance bank; paul egge executive vice president and cfo; okan akin executive vice president and risk -- chief risk officer of the company and president of allegiance bank; and shanna kuzdzal executive vice president and general counsel. before we begin, i need to remind everyone that some of the remarks made today may constitute forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended. we intend all such statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the act.
also note that if we give guidance about future results, that guidance is only a reflection of management's beliefs at the time the statement is made. management's beliefs relating to predictions are subject to change, and we do not publicly update guidance. please see the last page of the text in this morning's earnings release for additional information about the risk factors associated with forward-looking statements. if needed, a copy of the earnings release is available on our website at allegiancebank.com, or by calling heather robert at (281) 517-6422, and she will email you a copy.
we have also provided an investor presentation on our website. although it is not being used as a guide for today's comments, it is available for review at this time. at the conclusion of our remarks, we will open the line and allow time for questions. i now turn the call over to our ceo, steve retzloff. 
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
thank you, courtney, and we welcome all of you to our fourth-quarter earnings call. as was previously announced, i accepted the election by the board to serve as ceo of the company, as george martinez retired from the ceo position as of january 1st. we are extremely grateful for george's tremendous contribution and visionary leadership, as he has been instrumental in shaping the company's success. george is also highly regarded in the industry and a respected friend to many.
we look forward to continuing the work -- to work with them daily in the chairman's role as he is an incredible asset and will continue to provide ongoing strategic guidance. a review of our accomplishments during 2019 reflects another successful year for allegiance. we finished the year with strong operating results, including record diluted earnings per share for the quarter and year that resulted from both our strategy and the continued hard work and dedication of our team. in early 2019, we acquired the lowerybank branch in sugar land, consisting of approximately $45 million in loans and approximately $16 million in deposits.
we also successfully completed the technology conversion and integration of post oak and its employees. the leadership of each of these bank offices has become a cohesive unit, which would not have been possible without the commitment demonstrated by the employees of our combined bank. this became particularly apparent as we were recognized as one of houston's top workplaces for the 10th consecutive year, an award in which over 2,300 companies were nominated. but only 150 made the final cut.
we are honored to be one of only 10 companies that have been on the list of houston's top workplaces, 10 consecutive years. in addition, allegiance was recognized as one of 2020 best companies to work for in texas and awards program created as a project of texas monthly, and several other organizations. these awards are impactful to us as we continue to focus our recruiting efforts on strategic hires who we believe are the best in our market. we added 14 new bankers and internally promoted two others, along with several professionals, including a chief information officer, a chief human resource officer, a training and development officer, and bolstered our team of treasury management professionals.
at the same time, although some bankers exited the bank through productivity gains, many did not need to be replaced. we believe in our people who continue to provide outstanding service to our customers every day. this high-energy team sets us apart from our competition as the premier community bank in the houston region. the value-added approach allows us to anticipate continued growth and returns for our shareholders by winning business without sacrificing our standards.
we were pleased to end the year with positive trends in asset quality as we experienced solid improvement in our non-performing classified net charge-off and coverage ratios. we view our strong credit culture as an important ingredient for our long-term success. we once again had strong loan originations for both the year and quarter, a higher-than-expected level of paid off loans did, however, impact net loan growth. that said, we reiterate our small commercial market sector and maintain our underwriting standards.
as previously announced, we made the strategic decision to exit the mortgage warehouse business line, which allowed us to redirect operational resources to other areas. due to increasing -- increased trading volumes of our stock in 2019, we were included in the s&p smallcap 600. finally, we successfully completed a $60 million subordinated debt offering, which serves to better optimize our capital position without sacrificing our future growth potential. these results allowed us to return capital to our shareholders, as we repurchased 1.7 million shares for approximately $59 million during the year, and have now crossed a milestone, as we have announced plans for our first quarterly cash dividend to be paid in 2020.
in the year ahead, we remain focused on growing relationships, continuing investments in technology initiatives such as our new loan origination platform and our infrastructure as we look forward to opening of our new branch office on the east side of downtown houston. next, ray will describe our loan and deposit production results followed by paul, who will cover our financial results, who will then open the call for questions.
ray vitulli -- president and chief executive officer, allegiance bank
thanks, steve. first, i will review our loan production metrics for the fourth quarter. total core loans, which excludes mortgage warehouse lines, ended the fourth quarter at $3.91 billion, an increase of $57.6 million during the quarter or an annualized growth rate of 5.9%. this compares to the total core loan growth rate of 4% for the third quarter.
year-to-date, core loan growth was $247 million or 6.7%. during the fourth quarter, our staff and lending team once again booked a very strong $299 million of new loans that funded to a level of $189 million by december 31. this compares to the third quarter where $315 million of new loans were generated, which funded to a level of $210 million by the end of the third quarter. paid off loans continue to be elevated at $182 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $188 million in the third quarter, and $175 million in the second.
to give you a picture of the increased level of paydowns over the prior year, paid off loans for the year-ago quarter were $109 million. of the paydowns in the fourth quarter, $16 million were attributable to the planned reduction in the mortgage warehouse portfolio. for the year, we were very pleased with our level of new loans booked, which totaled $1.2 billion. the average size of the new organic core loans generated during the fourth quarter was $393,000 with an average funded balance of $246,000, which once again reflects our continued focus on building a diverse and granular loan portfolio.
the average size of all funded loans ended the quarter at $337,000. regarding interest rates on loans based on total loan amount, the weighted average interest rate charge on our new fourth-quarter core loans was 5.39%, which is below the third-quarter weighted average rate of 5.50%. the $166 million of paid off core loans during the quarter had a weighted average rate of 5.50%. carried core loans experienced advances of $124 million at a weighted average rate of 5.56% and paydowns of $94 million, which were at a weighted average rate of 5.43%.
all in, the overall period-end weighted average rate charged on our funded core loans decreased 3 basis points, ending the quarter at 5.42%, which is close to where the year began at 5.47% as of january 1, 2019. the mix of new loan production based on fourth-quarter funded levels was represented by the following four commercial categories: owner-occupied commercial real estate, 22.5%; non-owner-occupied commercial real estate, 13.8%; commercial term loans, 17.1,% and commercial working capital, 4.2%. these four commercial categories represented 57.5% of the new funded production, compared to 59.2% for the third quarter and 48% for the second quarter of 2019, indicating our ongoing commercial concentration. the overall loan mix was little changed on a linked-quarter basis.
the slide deck posted on our website provides added color regarding our overall mix of loans. asset quality at quarter end remained in a manageable position. the level of net charge-offs experienced during the quarter was $1.3 million or an annualized rate of 13 basis points. full-year 2019 net charge-offs amounted to 7 basis points as compared to 6 basis points for 2018.
we were pleased to report that non-performing assets, including both nonaccrual loans and ore ended the quarter down from the third quarter, decreasing from 88 to 74 basis points of total assets. nonaccrual loans decreased a net of $6.2 million during the quarter from $34.6 million to $28.4 million, primarily due to the upgrade of a $7.2 million loan payoff of approximately $2.6 million; payments applied to principal of $607,000; foreclosures of $214,000, which are now ore, and charge-offs of $1.1 million. this decrease was partially offset by increases to nonaccrual loans totaling $5.4 million, as a result of downgrades from 13 relationships, three of which totaled more than half or $3.3 million. the additional $2.1 million of downgrades was from 10 smaller relationships.
our ore consists of seven properties totaling $8.3 million. the largest is a $5.7 million industrial/commercial real estate property, which has a recent appraised value of $6.5 million and is being marketed. the second-largest at $1.2 million is a lot located in the well-established upscale river oaks neighborhood. the third-largest is a $576,000 home in a popular gated community.
the remainders are three smaller properties located west of houston and one in beaumont. generally, we believe our non-performing assets are well collateralized. in terms of our broader watch list, our classified loans as a percentage of total loans increased slightly to 2.21% of total loans as of december 31 from 2.18% at september 30. criticized loans decreased slightly to 2.85% at december 31 compared to 2.87% at september 30.
the specific reserves for the impaired loans ended the quarter at 14.5% from 18.2% at september 30. on the deposit front, we were pleased by the changes in our deposit mix in the quarter. total deposits increased in the fourth quarter by $170.6 million, representing 17.5% annualized growth rate in the quarter as a result of a very strong back half of the quarter, although we do expect a portion of this late quarter growth to be temporary in nature. for the year, total deposits increased $405.6 million or 11.1%.
non-interest-bearing deposits increased $24.4 million or an annualized growth rate of 7.9% during the fourth quarter and increased $42.9 million for the year or 3.6%. with that, our non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits ratio was 30.8% at december 31 compared to 31.5% at september 30. we seek to continue our track record keeping this ratio at or above 30%. the most notable change in our deposit mix was our ability to decrease our wholesale funding position by $62.8 million, which included the prepayment of certain fhlb borrowings and letting broker deposits roll off the balance sheet.
obviously, we are pleased with the recent mix change and continue to focus the entire allegiance team on our core deposit growth initiatives from both borrowing and nonborrowing customers. with that, i will now turn it over to our cfo, paul.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, ray. fourth-quarter net income was $14 million or $0.67 per diluted share, as compared to third-quarter earnings of $12 million or $0.57 per diluted share. fourth-quarter performance benefited from certain one-time items, including a $443,000 small bank assessment credit from the fdic, a $146,000 gain in fdic income, and $613,000 related to the gain on sale of securities. this was partially offset by $572,000 in fhlb pre-payment penalties, all netting to additional pre-tax income of approximately $630,000 in the quarter.
you will recall that third-quarter performance was impacted by certain one-time items as well, most notably, $1.4 million of severance costs partially offset by $676,000 small bank assessment credit from the fdic, netting to additional expense of about $755,000 in the quarter. adjusting for these one-time items, net income would have been $13.4 million or $0.64 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019 versus an adjusted $12.6 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the third quarter. fourth-quarter net interest income was $44.5 million, down from $44.8 million in the third quarter, primarily due to changes in market interest rates, acquisition accounting accretion, as well as, changes in the volume and relative mix of the underlying assets and liabilities versus the third quarter. most notably, fourth-quarter net interest income reflects the first full-quarter impact of the $60 million sub-debt issuance closed in late september.
within the fourth quarter, acquisition accounting accretion increased loan income by $1.7 million and reduced cd expense by $118,000 for a total positive effect on net interest income of $1.9 million, a decrease of $185,000 compared to the third quarter. this quarter's accretion leaves $5.5 million in the loan mark and $576,000 in the cd mark. during full-year 2019, acquisition accounting accretion increased net interest income by a total of over $9.6 million. in 2020, though, we expect acquisition accretion to increase net interest income by less than $2.5 million.
yield on loans in the fourth quarter was 5.65% versus 5.72% for the third quarter, and 5.81% for the year-ago quarter. adjusting for the acquisition accretion recorded during the fourth quarter, yield on loans would have been 5.47% versus 5.53% in the third quarter, and 5.51% in the year-ago quarter. total yield on interest-earning assets was 5.35% for the fourth quarter, 5.43% for the third quarter, and 5.44% for the year-ago quarter. adjusting for the acquisition accretion, total yield on earning assets would have been 5.19%, compared to an adjusted total yield on earning assets of 5.26% in the third quarter, and 5.18% for the year-ago quarter.
the total cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 185 basis points for the fourth quarter, compared to 188 basis points in the third quarter, and 153 basis points for the year-ago quarter. overall cost of funds for the fourth quarter was 130 basis points versus 133 basis points in the third quarter and 106 basis points in the year-ago quarter. excluding acquisition accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter, the total cost of interest-bearing liabilities would have been 186 basis points and the overall cost of funds would have been 131 basis points. we're particularly pleased with the improvement in our cost of funds notwithstanding the first full quarter impact of the sub-debt offering we closed late in the third quarter.
going forward, we feel well-positioned to show incremental improvement in our cost of funds as we work to reprice our deposits in today's relatively lower interest rate environment. tax equivalent net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 4.11% compared to 4.16% in the third quarter. adjusting for the acquisition accounting accretion, net interest margin would have been 3.94% for the fourth quarter compared to 3.97% for the third quarter. non-interest income increased to $3.4 million for the fourth quarter from $2.9 million for the third quarter, primarily due to the fourth quarter being bolstered by certain nonrecurring revenue items, including $613,000 of gain on sale of securities and $146,000 of lumpy fdic income.
total non-interest expense for the fourth quarter was $29.4 million compared to $30 million in the third quarter. one-time items to consider during the fourth quarter that affected noninterest expense included the $443,000 small bank assessment credit from the fdic, offset by $572,000 expense related to the early redemption of $50 million of fhlb borrowings. third-quarter non-interest expenses were also impacted by one-time items, including $1.4 million of severance expenses, partially offset by the $676,000 small bank assessment credit recognized from the fdic. separately, i should note that bonus accrual for the fourth quarter of 2019 was down nearly $900,000 relative to the average accrual during the prior quarters in 2019.
the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 62.2%, compared to 62.88% posted in the third quarter, and 60.3% for the prior-year quarter. the provision for loan losses was $933,000 for the fourth quarter and the ending allowance at $29.4 million is 75 basis points of total loans. if you were to include the $5.5 million in loan mark remaining on acquired loans, the ending allowance plus loan mark to total loans is 89 basis points. bottom line, our fourth-quarter 2019 produced a return on average assets of 1.13% and return on average tangible equity of 11.96%.
for the full year, we produced an roaa of 1.1% and a return on average tangible equity of 11.5%. we remain pleased with our strong capital position, which has allowed us to introduce a quarterly dividend and to continue to be active in repurchasing shares under our share repurchase authorization. in the fourth quarter, we bought approximately 325,000 shares at a weighted average price of $35.44 per share. and as steve noted earlier, for the full-year 2019, we repurchased almost 1.7 million shares at a weighted average price of $34.79 per share.
last, we'd like to highlight the year-end tangible book value per share of 22.62% increased 9.5% over the prior year-end. i'll now turn the call back over to steve.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
thank you, paul. as we conclude, i would note that we entered 2020 with good momentum and a clear focus on the priorities of our customers. we are well-positioned for a strong 2020, as we believe our competitive advantage will allow us to reach new heights and capitalize on opportunities. we will continue to execute on our strategic plan and achieve the goals that are set for ourselves throughout 2020 and beyond.
with that, i will now turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions.
",2019-Q4,ABTX
,,,1.0," were able to be handled by our bankers located in our 27 bank offices with support from our highly experienced sba team and many other essential department areas. for some perspective on the first authorization of ppp funds, the $640 million in aggregate approvals represents 2.25% market share of all approvals in texas and 0.21% market share of all approvals nationally, compared to our deposit market share of 0.49% in texas and 0.03% nationally, meaning our ppp results were around five times would be expected for a bank of our size. we are now processing additional applications as a result of the funding reauthorization, and we'll be able to report total ppp numbers at a later date.
i will now go over our first-quarter results and provide some additional information on several segments of our loan portfolio, including the volume and nature of payment deferrals that have been granted as a result of the pandemic, before turning it over to paul. total core loans, which excludes mortgage warehouse lines, ended the first quarter at $3.95 billion, an increase of $47.4 million during the quarter or an annualized growth rate of 4.9%. this compares to the total core loan growth rate of 5.9% for the fourth-quarter 2019. during the first quarter, our staff and lending team once again booked a very strong $294 million of new loans that funded to a level of $202 million by march 31.
this compares to the fourth quarter when $299 million of new loans were generated, which funded to a level of $189 million by the end of the fourth quarter. paid-off loans continued to be elevated at $204 million in the first quarter, compared to $182 million in the fourth-quarter 2019 and $188 million in the third quarter of 2019. to give you a picture of the increased level of paydowns over the prior year, paid-off loans for the year-ago quarter were $159 million. the average size of the new organic loans -- core loans generated during the fourth quarter was $323,000 with an average funded balance of $239,000, which, once again, reflects our continued focus on building a diverse and granular loan portfolio.
the average size of all funded loans ended the quarter at $344,000. regarding interest rates on loans, based on total loan amount, the weighted average interest rate charge on our new first-quarter core loans was 5.08%, which is below the fourth-quarter 2019 weighted average rate of 5.39% and the third-quarter 2019 weighted average rate of 5.50%. the $203 million of paid-off core loans during the quarter had a weighted average rate of 5.34%. carried core loans experienced advances of $142 million at a weighted average rate of 5.30% and paydowns of $94 million, which were at a weighted average rate of 5.25%.all in, the overall period-end weighted average rate charge on our funded core loans decreased 13 basis points, ending the quarter at 5.29%, compared to 5.42% as of december 31, 2019.
the mix of new loan production based on first-quarter funded levels was represented by the following four commercial categories: nonowner-occupied commercial real estate, owner-occupied commercial real estate, commercial term loans and commercial working capital loans. these four commercial categories represented 58% of the new funded production for the first quarter, compared to 57.5% for the fourth-quarter 2019, indicating our ongoing commercial concentration. i would now like to provide some additional information on three loan categories that could have heightened risk due to energy prices and/or the covid pandemic, those being our oil and gas portfolio, our hotel portfolio and our restaurant and bar portfolio. despite being a houston region bank, our overall exposure to oil and gas is largely indirect as we do not have any reserve-based loans.
so we have defined the category to be any borrower that operates in or directly supports the upstream, midstream or downstream segments of the industry. at march 31, this category is approximately 2% of our funded loans or $80.7 million, of which $46.7 million was c&i and $34 million was commercial real estate. regarding our hotel portfolio, at march 31, we had $133 million of hotel loans, of which $126.1 million was commercial real estate, $4.4 million was c&d and $2.6 million was in c&i. of the cre, $126.1 million, the weighted average ltv for the portfolio was 53.8%.
a 20% stress testing of the most recent appraised value, plus 6% marketing expenses, resulted in an overall collateral deficiency of approximately $1 million, and regarding our restaurant and bar portfolio, at march 31, we had $101.3 million of restaurant and bar loans, of which $71.1 million was commercial real estate, $27.9 million was c&i and $2.4 million was c&d. for the $71.1 million in cre, the weighted average ltv for the portfolio was 47.7%. a 20% stress testing of the most recent appraised value, plus 6% marketing expenses, resulted in an overall collateral deficiency of approximately $8.2 million. in terms of our overall loan portfolio, the loan type mix was a little changed on a linked-quarter basis.
the slide deck posted on our website provides added color regarding our overall mix of loans. asset quality at quarter end remained in a manageable position. the level of net charge-offs experienced during the quarter was $2.9 million or an annualized rate of 30 basis points, primarily due to a previously announced $2.1 million charge-off on a loan that had been impaired and reserved for in 2019 that is now in ore. we are pleased to report that nonperforming assets, including both nonaccrual loans and ore, ended the first quarter down from the fourth quarter, decreasing from 74 to 68 basis points of total assets.
nonaccrual loans decreased a net of $6.8 million during the quarter from $28.4 to $21.6 million, primarily due to foreclosures of $8.7 million, charge-offs of $3 million and payoffs and payments of approximately $1.1 million. this decrease was partially offset by increases in nonaccrual loans totaling $6.1 million as a result of downgrades, primarily from 18 relationships, three of which totaled $4.1 million. the additional $2 million of downgrades was from 15 smaller relationships.our ore consists of six properties totaling $12.6 million. the largest is a $5.5 million commercial real estate property; with the second largest being a $5.2 million industrial commercial real estate property; and the third largest, a $995,000 residential lot.
the remainder are three smaller properties, one in houston, one located in west of houston and oen in beaumont. all properties are being actively marketed, and several are currently in contract negotiations for a potential sale. generally, we believe our nonperforming assets are well collateralized. in terms of our broader watch list, our classified loans as a percentage of total loans increased slightly to 2.41% of total loans as of march 31 from 2.23% as of december 31.
criticized loans remained at 2.85% at march 31 and december 31. the specific reserves for the impaired loans ended the quarter at 11.3%, compared to 14.5% at december 31. on the deposit front, we saw a decrease in total deposits in the first quarter by $114.5 million but still up $173.5 million over the year-ago quarter. as we noted last quarter, we expected a portion of the late fourth-quarter 2019 growth to be temporary in nature.
the vast majority of the decrease in this category we call carried accounts, meaning the outflow was from accounts that remain at the bank as opposed to accounts being closed. the nature of the decreases were generally for tax payments, partner distributions and moves to brokerage accounts to take advantage of the opportunities in the equity markets. noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $34.7 million during the first quarter but still up $35.6 million over the year-ago quarter. with that, our noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits ratio was 30.8% for both march 31, 2020, and december 31, 2019, compared to 31.3% at march 31, 2019.
we seek to continue our track record of keeping this ratio at or above 30%. back to some other items related to the effects of the pandemic on our borrowing customers. in march, we started to offer payment deferrals of generally no more than 90 days to eligible borrowers. as of april 26, we had deferred 1,563 loans with an aggregate loan balance of $838 million.
the deferrals in the largest categories by loan type are as follows: retail, 18%; c&i, 13%; hotel, 8%; c-store, 8%; rental or investment property, 7%; one-four family, 6%; office, 6%; and restaurant and bar, 5%. inclusive of these amounts were 1% of deferrals on oil and gas loans. as previously mentioned, our approved ppp loans totaled approximately $640 million. we are still gathering data for the entire population of ppp loans in terms of industry breakdown.
but for more than 75% of this population, the breakdown by industry is as follows: manufacturing, 15%; services, 13%; subcontractors, 11%; restaurants and bars, 6%; commercial construction, 6%; oil and gas, 5%; retail, 3%; hotels, 1%. while it is too early to quantify the impact of the cares act stimulus program, loan deferrals and ppp on our loan portfolio, we feel good that the impact will be a positive one and provides the bridge for our borrowing customers until we return to better economic conditions. as steve mentioned, houston is a vibrant, growing region, and our economic diversification of the region continues to increase with the expansion of sectors, such as the port of houston, texas medical center and numerous process industries, which are all well noted in our prior-quarter calls. according to the texas workforce commission, direct oil and gas jobs in the houston msa have decreased from 13.2% in 1991 to the current level of 8.6% of all jobs, indicating this improved diversification.
we remain enthused by the change that has taken place in the region over the past few decades and are optimistic of the market opportunity that lies ahead of us as the region's largest locally focused community bank. finally, i want to acknowledge that the entrepreneurial spirit is in the dna of all those that call the houston region home. it is this spirit that attracts many to this region, contributing to the consistently strong population growth and demographic trends that we believe are the true success drivers for much of our clientele and the broader small- to medium-sized business community in houston. i'll now turn it over to our cfo, paul.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, ray. as steve mentioned, first-quarter results were significantly affected by the $11 million provision expense in response to covid and oreo writedowns of $2.2 million during the quarter. net income was $3.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the first quarter as compared to fourth-quarter earnings of $14 million or $0.67 per diluted share and first-quarter 2019 earnings of $12.7 million or $0.58 per diluted share. recall that fourth-quarter 2019 performance benefited from certain onetime items that netted to additional pre-tax income of approximately $630,000.
adjusting for these onetime events, net income would have been $13.4 million or $0.64 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. so if we adjust our first quarter for the $2.2 million oreo writedowns and net gain on sale of $125,000, net income would have been $5.2 million or $0.25 per share. pretax pre-provision income for the first quarter was $15.3 million, compared to $18.5 million in the fourth quarter and $16.8 million for the year-ago quarter. adjusting for oreo writedowns and net gain on sale income in the quarter, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income would have been $17.4 million for the quarter as compared to an adjusted $17.9 million for the fourth quarter.
first-quarter net interest income was $45 million, up from $44.5 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower interest expense, partially offset by lower interest income due to less purchase accounting accretion. total interest expense decreased by $1.2 million, and acquisition accounting accretion decreased by $601,000 compared to the fourth quarter. acquisition accounting accretion increased loan income by $1.1 million and reduced cd expense by $110,000 for a total positive effect on net interest income of $1.3 million during the first quarter. this quarter's accretion leaves $4.3 million in the loan mark and $466,000 in the cd mark.
yield on loans in the first quarter was 5.59% versus 5.65% in the fourth quarter and 5.86% for the year-ago quarter. adjusting for acquisition accretion, yield on loans would have been 5.47% for both the first and fourth quarters, compared to 5.57% in the year-ago quarter. total yield on interest-earning assets was 5.28% for the first quarter, 5.35% for the fourth quarter and 5.5% for the year-ago quarter. adjusting for the acquisition accretion, total yield on earning assets would have been 5.18%, compared to an adjusted total yield on earning assets of 5.19% for the fourth quarter and 5.24% for the year-ago quarter.
total cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 168 basis points for the first quarter, compared to 185 basis points for the fourth quarter and 178 basis points for the year-ago quarter. overall cost of funds for the first quarter was 119 basis points versus 130 basis points for the fourth quarter and 127 basis points in the year-ago quarter. excluding acquisition accounting adjustments in the first quarter, the total cost of interest-bearing liabilities would have been 170 basis points and the total cost of funds would have been 120 basis points. so tax equivalent net interest margin for the first quarter came to 4.15%, compared to 4.11% in the fourth quarter, expanding 4 basis points, notwithstanding lower acquisition accounting accretion.
adjusting for the acquisition accounting accretion, core net interest margin expanded 10 basis points as net interest margin would have been 4.04% for the first quarter, compared to 3.94% for the fourth quarter. we are particularly pleased with our progress in the quarter on our core net interest margin driven by improvement in our cost of funds more than compensating for decreases in asset yields. going forward, we feel well-positioned to maintain a strong net interest margin as we seek to further optimize our funding mix and maintain discipline on loan pricing. noninterest income decreased to $2.7 million in the first quarter from $3.4 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to fourth quarter being bolstered by certain nonrecurring revenue items, including $613,000 in the gain on sales of securities and $146,000 in lumpy sbic income.
total noninterest expense for the first quarter was $32.4 million, compared to $29.4 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to $2.2 million of writedowns on other real estate owned. you'll remember that there were several onetime items to consider during the fourth quarter that decreased our noninterest expense by a total of approximately $870,000. so the efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 68.13%, compared to 62.2% posted in the fourth quarter and 64.97% for the prior-year quarter, primarily due to these writedowns on oreo. so if we adjust this quarter's efficiency for the oreo writedowns and fourth quarter's efficiency ratio for the aforementioned onetime items, our adjusted efficiency ratio for the first quarter would have been 63.48% as compared to an adjusted 62.12% for the fourth quarter.
the provision for loan losses was $11 million for the first quarter. this is more than 10 times the provision we took in the fourth quarter and the year-ago quarter. and it brings our allowance for loan losses to $37.5 million, representing 95 basis points of total loans. if you were to include the $4.3 million in the loan mark remaining on acquired loans, the ending allowance, plus loan mark to total loans, will be 106 basis points.
it is very important to note that we elected to take the relief that came with the cares act, and we deferred the implementation of cecl, so the reported allowance is under the current incurred standard. our decision to take the relief was primarily a function of efficiency with respect to closing the books and related disclosures, comfort with the existing standard given economic uncertainties and our overarching preference to allocate time and focus on business continuity. the covid-19 situation is fluid and brings significant economic uncertainty. our entire team is focused on supporting our customers and better understanding the unique impacts of the pandemic and related oil price weakness on our individual customers and our loan portfolio as a whole.
we look forward to being able to further refine our allowance for loan losses with the benefit of additional time and information. our covid-related provisioning and oreo writedowns during the first quarter significantly impacted our bottom-line profitability metrics of roaa and roatce for the quarter, which came out at 0.29% and 3.02%, respectively. notwithstanding current economic uncertainties, we are buoyed by our strong margins, which drive a solid pre-tax pre-provision earnings stream, and we are fortunate to be at or near all-time, high-capital levels at our allegiance bank subsidiary. we feel very well-positioned given the circumstances.
in february, we announced the completion of our prior share repurchase authorization and a new share repurchase authorization, but we have not made share repurchases on the new authorization and do not see them on the near-term horizon. our capital and liquidity positions are strong, and we are committed to maintaining financial flexibility as we navigate the current economic environment. our board of directors declared a $0.10 dividend on april 23, and we currently feel good about our ability to maintain our strong capital position and our modest dividend. i will now turn the call back over to steve.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
thank you, paul. good job there. with that, i will now turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions.
 :
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of brad milsaps with piper sandler.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
good morning, brad.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
i appreciate all the detail. i'm sure i missed some of it, but i'll have to go back and take a look, but certainly, appreciate all the detail you guys included this quarter. kind of one big thing that stood out to me was the nim expansion that you guys had in the first quarter. i'm just kind of curious if you could just talk a little bit more about your ability to hold loan yields flat and kind of what your outlook for the nim would be sort of outside the impact of the ppp program.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
great question. outside, i think for good intelligence as to how our nim kind of performs through cycles, you can look back to the prior time period for which we had -- we're at a zero balance in interest rates, and we're able to maintain our loan yields nicely above the 5% level. and i think that is really what's going to help us maintain a comparably strong net interest margin. we've always battled a little bit of liability sensitivity as we sought to keep the company asset neutral or interest rate neutral.
but the balance and what we've always found ourselves battling is the liability sensitivity outweighing the asset sensitivity in our balance sheet. and here, the current interest rate environment really does play into our hand, to a degree, and it allows us to continue a process that we started six to nine months ago as the interest rate cycle turned, and that is strategically repricing our liabilities. and otherwise, we've got great protection on the assets side with floors. and even when we don't have floors, we, generally speaking, by the nature of the size of lending we do, we operate with floors in our overall lending pricing, whether they're technically there or not.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks, paul. i think in 2015 and '16, your deposit cost were maybe -- total deposit costs were maybe half of what they are now. do you think this is a type of environment where you can drive deposit costs back to that level over, i don't know, call it, a three- or four-quarter period? or do you think funding is still so competitive in your markets that it will be more difficult to do that this time around?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we still operate in a very competitive funding market, but i like our chances. it's going to take time, particularly as it relates to our cd book, which is large and will be subject to repricing. but it all depends on the relative duration of the current zero balance policy. the longer it lasts, the higher our probability is to work it down.
and also, it will also depend on the overall kind of loan growth dynamics that we have locally and regionally because that has a relatively large -- it's a relatively large arbiter as to how competitive the broader deposit market is locally and regionally.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
yes, brad, there's something else to be said for -- this is steve. just the service experience that people are receiving from us right now, i think that's going to bode well for us when it comes to deposit pricing as well.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. and paul, kind of given where you are with funding, would you anticipate using the fed facility to fund the ppp program? or do you have other sources in mind on how you kind of plan to fund that? obviously, it will somewhat depend on how long the loans stay there, but just kind of curious what your thoughts are around that.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we're fully operational on the ppplf funding program with the fed, and we'll be -- we're effectively going to pivot our daily cash desk from previously being managed -- managing excess and/or capital needs to target through the fhlb that's kind of aligned to the ppplf line of credit. so we'll be using it to the extent necessary. and as it currently stands, we haven't had to use it much because the -- we booked the loans and fund the accounts in allegiance bank deposits. but we do expect that money to start being spent.
and at which point, we'll be accessing the ppplf with the fed.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. and paul, final question for me. i apologize if i missed this, but do you think you can kind of hold expense growth to kind of this low kind of single-digit rate in 2020, even if you incur some additional covid-related or ppp-related expenses over time, etc.?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think so. i mean, we're obviously being very mindful of discretionary spend, but we're being -- we're focused on, as we've always been focused on, kind of spending to support the business through this cycle. so we do think that you can expect, i think, spend to not vary too widely from current levels.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
yes. i think, generally, we're -- we believe we're probably incrementally leverageable as we grow through over the rest of the year and next year.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. i'll hop back in the queue. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of matt olney with stephens, inc.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, guys. want to go back to the discussion around loan growth. and on the prepared remarks, i think there was a mention that the paydowns were elevated again in the first quarter as they were most of last year.
some of your peers have pointed toward a slowdown of the level of paydowns given the uncertainty. did you see this toward the end of the quarter? or have you seen this in recent weeks?
ray vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank
matt, no. i think the $200 million in paydowns was pretty reflective of the entire quarter. i don't think there was any peak or valley in the quarter. it was pretty consistent.
so it may -- we may see something different in the second quarter, but for the first quarter, it was elevated. there were still some -- early in the quarter, and so it probably closed later in the quarter. but there were still some rates out there that were offered that were -- had a three handle. so we did lose some of those loans to more favorable pricing that maybe was quoted at the beginning of the quarter that maybe got closed at the end of the quarter.
that's all i could think about maybe.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i guess, ray, just in general, are you seeing some of the competition pull back just overall in recent weeks that would lead you to believe that the paydowns could slow this year?
ray vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank
the -- i would say that the paydowns would have been slow, at least the conversation around paydowns and anything non-ppp related. so core is probably has been shifted a little bit out. but whether that results in the outlook on the year, matt, i don't have -- i don't know that. i think that there's definitely been a pause in the industry of movement of core loans, but i don't know if we can just say that's the way it's going to be if we're going to enjoy, let's say, lower payoffs for the rest of the year.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
yes. and that's a great question. i just feel highly speculative to think about it from the rest of the year and where that's going to go.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
sure. no. i appreciate it. it's still very early in the process, so i definitely i appreciate that.
and going back to the discussion around operating expenses, paul, i think you mentioned that the $2.2 million of writedowns in the first quarter. so if we remove that, i guess, is it fair to think about the overall launch point of expense growth this year somewhere in that $30 million to $30.5 million range per quarter?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. and then just overall, you gave us some good details on your loan portfolio on slide 13 from a risk management standpoint. you gave us hotels, the restaurants, the retail and the indirect impact of oil and gas, and that's helpful. i'm curious, how are you guys assessing the more riskier, the more dangerous part of the portfolio at this point? where -- what has your attention at this point within those descriptions?
ray vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank
well, one thing we can look at, matt, is the deferrals associated with some of those buckets. so it's not that it's 100% deferral on those buckets. so there are -- we do have some, what sometimes steve says, well-heeled customers that are in those segments. but the other ones, we are seeing deferrals.
we do have some sba loans in those buckets, and those sba loans are right now enjoying six months of payments on those sba loans as part of the cares act. so it's pretty early, but i think the fact that we -- that we're talking about lodging, foreign restaurants and oil and gas is obviously top of mind for us.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
partly, it's just really going to be looking at it in kind of that detail level, but we've got a pretty good amount of restaurant loans. but a lot of that cre, it would be the c&i portion of that, that you'd probably have little more concern about, and yet, we don't have a lot to go on about what the recovery will look like for them. hotels is mostly cre, really good loan to value overall, really good stress test results. in the oil and gas, i look at that.
we've got about 45% or 46% that's upstream related, and the rest is midstream to downstream, some refineries, a lot of gas distribution-related businesses, people that support. but when you look at the upstream side, we -- a number of those companies are related to one of our guarantors that has -- probably one of our largest depositors in the bank in terms of cash deposits. so we feel very good about a big, big portion, probably more than a third of our upstream is related to that one relationship. so we've got good cre collateral on a lot of that as well, so it's a little early to tell.
when we did our quarter-end analysis for the reserve, it was based on the data, the quantitative analysis. and obviously, we're going to be watchful for that as the quarter progresses, and we'll update our analysis from that. but we feel very good about where we go into this from a collateral strength of guarantor, quality people, great business operators. we like our customers as much as they like us, so it's going to take a little time to sort it all out.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. and then just one more question. i guess, paul, back to you on the discussion around the margin, can you just remind us what portion of your loans are variable versus fixed? i think you touched on this earlier, but i missed it. and then within variable, how much of those loans are now at their full rate?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
all right. so you've got about a little under a third of our loans are in -- are variable-rate loans. and really, all of them -- just about all of them are at or through floors, so are supported by floors or are at floors. there's very few loans in our loan book that are -- that do not have floors.
so appreciably, everything is at or below a floor. and i think only about a third of what we currently have is at or below a floor, so to the extent -- or at a floor. so to the extent we were to get rate hikes of that variable rate -- variable portion, only a third of it would be sensitive to a rate change. but really, almost all of that portion of our loan portfolio is supported by floors.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. thank you, guys.
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
all right. thanks, matt.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, guys.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
hi. good morning, brady.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
what is the average fee for phase 1 of the ppp?
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
average fee --
ray vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank
it's around 3%.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
3%. and in phase 1, you did $640 million. any estimate on how active you'll be in phase 2?
ray vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank
it will be less than $640 million.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
that's what you do.
ray vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank
yes. sorry. i mean, we'll know here pretty soon. i think we still have a window.
the window is still open as of today, right?
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
yes. we're still funding today. so we've been getting approvals.
ray vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank
yes, brady. it would be some -- i don't expect -- i wouldn't expect 50%. it would be -- maybe 25% to 50%, not more.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
call it a third.
ray vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank
yes. maybe a third of that level, brady, in the second round.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
ok. all right. so about $200 million or so. and then what would have the cecl impact had been if you had adopted -- i know in the case, you talk about, i think, the reserves going up 25% to 50% with cecl.
what would that january 1 adjustment have been with cecl?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think you can probably take the midpoint of that range and be around there if i were to be estimating. but -- and that represents predominantly the effect of both purchase -- the adjustment on purchase accounting and then reserve for unfunded commitment. when we try to roll forward, we did run cecl side by side, obviously not audited or anything along those lines. but it's -- after the day one, you'll -- you would have seen an overall provisioning story that would line up relatively well to our provisioning story under the current incurred model that we reported under today.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
ok. all right. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of david feaster with raymond james.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
good morning, david.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
just following up on the ppp questions. i guess how are you looking at this program? are you focused on existing customers only? or are you using this as an opportunity to acquire customers and gain share? and i guess, how has that translated into maybe any deposit growth, thus far, in the second quarter?
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
i'll answer -- okan and i will both answer that one. so on the way we've approached it, david, is you -- as you know, we've had a market share strategy approach for a long time. so we have in the last -- for '19 and '20, we have 13 producers hired in '19 and four more in '20. so this has been more of as a catalyst to those folks that are here that are going to get those customers that they've had for a long time.
so there's definitely going to be a market share piece to how we handle ppp. we also were extremely focused on handling our customers. so i wouldn't refer to as customers -- i'd say customers and new customers is how we've approached it. and i don't know, okan, do you have anything?
okan akin -- executive vice president and chief risk officer of the company and president of allegiance bank
yes. i agree. so we've opened our program to both customers, noncustomers, and there's been a demand from both sides, actually, in opening additional accounts with our new technology. we were able to open a number of new accounts at the bank remote electronically.
and so there's a market gain share that's occurring through the program, and we're able to start the community, at large, and it's not just our customer base.
ray vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank
and we're getting an awful lot of people sending us nice cards and letters, too, that, obviously, they got served well. and kind of the gist of the letters are we never knew how important it was to have a relationship with a bank, like you guys, and the importance of that is really strong. and it's also coming from new. so i -- we think that there's an opportunity for some new customer pickup out of this.
but the benefit to our customers to receive the assistance from ppp is hard to measure but something we really think is a strength and one of the reasons why we've done it in as a stronger a way as we possibly could.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
that's helpful. and i guess, kind of along those same lines, i guess, has the way that you performed and the strength of your balance sheet and your -- just your overall culture, given the disruption in the market, has that created additional hiring opportunity for you or any other kind of opportunities?
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
we've had some folks on our radar for a long time. this -- how we've handled this may be able to attract those and now see how we performed. but it's been probably quiet on the hiring side during the ppp. and even if we did, the onboarding would be difficult doing it remotely to get someone set up.
ray vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank
yes. we've been pretty much head down for the last month or so. but you're right, it's a small community. people that we've talked to that are in other community banks, smaller banks, they're all working hard, too, right now.
so those things will probably show up in the next quarter or two.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. that's fair. and then last one for me. just wanted to follow up on the core nim.
i mean, i guess, in light of the seemingly limited downside on loan yields and pretty substantial opportunity on the funding side as you optimize and reduce costs, i mean, i guess, do you think -- exclusive of the ppp program, are you thinking that you can continue to see core nim expansion or maybe just more modest compression?
paul egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we think there's -- depending on the nature of our execution, there is potential to expand, but it's hard to model that as it currently stands, particularly given competitive dynamics that are shifting. we do know the opportunity for repricing liabilities from here on in. it's going to be a little bit more gradual since it's going to manifest itself predominantly in repricings in the cd book. but we're still working things down and optimizing our funding mix.
some of the broader nim story is also going to be a function of what we do on the asset side, and it will be dependent upon the path our earning asset take in whether loan growth is as stout or weak as a function of certain uncertainties related to covid. and not to mention, we're in an election here. so many moving parts, but we're focused on optimizing both sides of the balance sheet.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. that's great. thank you.
operator
thank you [operator instructions] and i'm showing no further questions. so with that, i'll turn the call back over to steve retzloff, ceo, for closing remarks.
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
well, i think we had a great conversation today, and i thank everybody for -- and appreciate your time and interest in allegiance. we look forward to speaking to you again in next quarter and in the future, so thank you all very much for your participation.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the first-quarter 2020 allegiance bancshares, inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to introduce chief accounting officer courtney theriot.
courtney theriot -- chief accounting officer
thank you, operator, and thank you to all who have joined our call today. this morning's earnings call will be led by steve retzloff, ceo of the company; ray vitulli, president of the company and ceo of allegiance bank; paul egge, executive vice president and cfo; okan akin, executive vice president and chief risk officer of the company and president of allegiance bank; and shanna kuzdzal, executive vice president and general counsel. before we begin, i need to remind everyone that some of the remarks made today may constitute forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended. we intend all such statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the act.
also note that if we give guidance about future results, that guidance is only reflective of management's beliefs at the time the statement is made. management's beliefs relating to predictions are subject to change, and we do not publicly update guidance. please see the last page of the text in this morning's earnings release for additional information about the risk factors associated with forward-looking statements. if needed, a copy of the earnings release is available on our website at allegiancebank.com or by calling heather robert at (281) 517-6422, and she will email you a copy.
we also have provided an investor presentation on our website. although it is not being used as a guide for today's comments, it is available for review at this time. at the conclusion of our remarks, we will open the line and allow time for questions. i'll now turn the call over to our ceo steve retzloff. 
steve retzloff -- chief executive officer
thank you, courtney, and we welcome all of you to our first-quarter earnings call. all of us here at allegiance certainly hope and pray that, under the current circumstances, the pandemic has had as little detrimental impact on all of you who are listening as possible with regard to your personal health, your business pursuits and particularly your outlook and vision for our collective future as we all work together for an effective and complete recovery, including locally, nationally and worldwide. ray will speak to our well-executed pandemic response in recent activities in more detail, but i cannot delegate my expression of deep gratitude to the allegiance bankers whose sacrificial efforts during late nights and consecutive entire weekends has been beyond inspirational and which constitute a significant adhesive for the communities we serve. our focus, as the pandemic has unfolded, has not so much represented a shift to something new, but rather, due to unwelcomed circumstances, it has strangely showcased our bankers by being right where they have always pledged to be, taking care of our customers, their employees and their families.
as we report under today's present uncertainties, it is important to note that we entered 2020 in a position of considerable strength, bigger and better than ever, and we preserve that strength notwithstanding lower q1 2020 earnings. during the quarter, our recurring pre-tax pre-provision earnings were solid. the bottom line was negatively impacted by significant provisioning due to the broader risks and uncertainties relating to the covid-19 pandemic and ore writedowns. core nim actually expanded in the quarter, and we like our prospect for maintaining a strong margin despite today's low interest rate environment.
perhaps, most importantly, we ended the quarter at just over $5 billion in assets and in a very strong capital position with a consolidated total risk-based capital ratio of 14.73%, compared to a year earlier at 13.28%. and our bank-level regulatory capital ratios remain at near all-time highs. as we address the current economic environment, our super-community bank strategy is not only alive and well but, in my opinion, hits many proverbial bull's-eyes. by providing extraordinary service to small and medium-sized businesses in our region, while building the scale to provide a full range of relevant products and services, we are differentiated from the competition and able to take advantage of a long-held marketplace opportunity, which condenses down to two words: extraordinary service.
this differentiation, however, is less significant as a marketing talking point but rather more of a manifestation of a true value proposition for our customers, which we believe translates into an excellent risk/reward opportunity for our shareholders. in short, our close customer relationships are exactly what is required to address the current evolving needs of our client base. just as we stepped up in the aftermath of hurricane harvey, we are at it again and even better at it than before. i also like the position that our super-community bank strategy places us in.
as a bank oriented toward small, local businesses, our loan portfolio remains granular, diversified, well underwritten by predominantly real estate assets, predominantly owner-occupied with an emphasis on personal guarantees from our borrowers. these customers are precisely the small businesses that are the target of the government's relief efforts through the ppp loans, and our team has stepped up in a big way to serve as a conduit in that effort, which ray will explain shortly. as to broader exposures to the virus-related economic challenges, the analogy to masks and gloves or ppe that serve to protect the bank is our relative lack of or limited exposure to a number of hot topic risks, including direct oil and gas, shared national credits, hospitality, big-box retail, large land development, high-rise office and nonrecourse lending. also, fortunately, for us, our technology is more solid than ever.
our product set is aligned to our customers' needs, our service unparalleled, and our scale presents a great, long-term earnings potential. finally, i would remind everyone that the houston region has weathered many economic cycles and storms. it is a vibrant area of texas, growing in economic diversity and continues to be for people like myself and most of our bankers who have called it home for our entire lives, a region filled with people who have a great heart, a strong will to succeed and understand deeply what it means to take the bull by the horns. so next, ray will describe our loan and deposit production results, as well as an outlook on credit; followed by paul who will cover our financial results.
we will then open up the call for questions.
ray vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank
thanks, steve. given the impact of covid on how we do business and how we are assisting business owners, as steve mentioned, i will provide details on our execution of both our business continuity plan and ppp loan approvals, followed by our normal reporting of first-quarter results. we are very pleased with all aspects of the execution of our business continuity plan. in early february, we placed our plan in motion, which resulted in a seamless transition from our normal work environment to all things necessary to meet the ever-changing requirements once covid was declared a pandemic.
from working remotely to social distancing, to no more than 10 in the gathering, to creating covid-related policies and procedures, to communicating internally and externally, our team executed in a way that i can only describe as extraordinary. we certainly leveraged our experience and best practices learned from hurricane harvey, but our agile project management process has paid off, and we are able to respond and deliver to whatever comes our way, sometimes within minutes. we're also very pleased with our ppp loan results and the impact of our efforts on the houston region. as of april 26, we had more than 3,500 loans approved with aggregate approvals in excess of $640 million, affecting more than 55,000 jobs.
we believe that our super-community banking strategy allowed for these type of results as our bankers work closely with our customers. and the outreach, gathering of information and ",2020-Q1,ABTX

[operator instructions] our first question comes from brad milsaps with piper sandler. you may proceed with your question.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, brad. how you're doing, brad?
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
good. hey, ray, i was writing quickly during some of your commentary, and i think i may have missed a number of -- but i think our production of $310 million during the quarter, what did that fund up to in terms of outstandings and kind of -- it sounds like that was higher linked quarter and kind of based on that, how do you kind of feel about loan growth in 2021, kind of based on your finish to the year?
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, brad. yes, so the $310 million was the originations for the quarter that funded up to 220 and -- which was nice compared to the third quarter. what was really nice is that $310 million is our first quarter in excess of 300 since third quarter of '19. so that kind of momentum going into '21, we're really excited about that and and still the fourth quarter was a quarter where we continued customer outreach, all the other things that we need to do as bankers, but to get that kind of core origination was -- really nice to see the return to those levels that we've kind of expected in the past, which we've talked about before that 300 benchmark kind of 300.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
do you think -- obviously one quarter may not make a trend, but is that -- does that push you maybe higher than sort of mid single-type run rate in loans, growth rate loans in '21 or is it higher than that?
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
no, i think that's -- i still think that's good. it definitely puts us in a position for that brad and that what you're -- that mid to high single -- absolutely puts us in where we will get our fair share and and the stage is set for that, as paul mentioned, we're in a three-point stance, i'm ready for that.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
this is steve, brad. the effort that we put forth last year on the ppp really took our eye off the ball on loan growth, i mean to the extent that we spent so much time and our team was just spending a tremendous amount of energy on taking care of our customers outreach and ppp. we're going to repurpose that energy and '21. and that while we have some ppp activity, we do believe that this team is ready to go in '21 for a pretty robust loan production year.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's great color, steve or ray. what about hiring? can you talk about that activity opinion in fourth quarter and maybe kind of what your plans are for 2021?
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
yes, sure. so for the whole year, we brought on nine new producers for the year and then plus two internal promotions from our analyst pool. so feel real good about that. that's coming off in 2019, which was -- we had 15, so a little bit down from 2019, but a really strong class of nine for the year and i would expect that to continue in 2021, something similar to what we did in 2020. we're talking to folks, a handful that we're talking to at this moment. so we feel good about it, brad.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's great. and then maybe just one more here, paul. obviously, it looks like you had some incentive kind of catch-up in the fourth quarter on the expense side is -- is the fourth quarter you think a pretty representation, a pretty good representation of run rate expenses in '21 or kind of based on some things you guys are doing. do you think you can kind of back off that rate a little bit?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, the fourth quarter did tech us some items that gives the overall level of expenses, but it does kind of present a little bit of a glide path as to what to expect in the quarters within 2021. it's actually a little on the high side, but it's that range of 32 or so million dollars is really consistent with expectations and i think our spend story is largely going to be a function of a little bit of how our core loan growth story manifests itself in 2021. so we're very well positioned to actualize on whatever growth that's out there and as we assess dynamics, ultimately that can have the resulting effect as to how forward we are on that side
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it, thanks. and just a housekeeping question pau, do you have the average balance of ppp loans in the quarter?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it was around --i'm going to speak in approximation, i believe it was around 450 to 500.
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
average balance on ppp. actually that is...
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
more like 125, 135 range.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
you ended the quarter at 570. so it's got to be north of there right.
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
i'm talking individual..
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'll split the difference between where we were at the end of the third quarter. yeah.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
it was a pretty steady state, steady flow of forgiveness during the quarter.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the majority of our forgiveness was in november that was our largest kind of push forgiveness it's followed by december.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. okay, great, thank you guys. i'll hop back in queue.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brady gailey with kbw. you may proceed with your question.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
hi, thanks, good morning guys.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
good morning brady.
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
good morning.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
you all had a decent amount of success with ppp round one, i know round two is just now kind of starting, but any idea what the opportunity could be on round 2 for you guys?
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
i think i want to take this, oaken is managing that very, very well. so..
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you. so yes, we still see added ppp early on open our portal in january 11th. we have, what we're seeing is that the vast majority of the applications we're receiving are from second draw customers currently running at a rate i would think somewhere between 35% to maybe 40% of what we've done last time is what we are geared up to do easily, it could be more. we have twice the applications that have been requested by our customers. that are actually in so, so of every two applications received from customers. we have received one complete back so far, and based on what we're seeing is that all continues to progress the same way, somewhere around 35% to 45% is what i would expect.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
so we did 700 last time, that would mean that we'd be in the 300, 250 to 300 kind of that ballpark.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
all right. and that i think if you look at your core nim ex accretion in ppp, i think you guys mentioned that was a little above 4%. yeah, i know in the past you pointed to some nim compression. but do you think at the 4% level, you've reached stability or are we going to see that core nim dip into the 3s?
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
i think structurally there is there is a chance you're going to see that core nim dip into the 3s because the number of cited is one where if you assume away both the balances and the revenue from ppp. i think what more likely is that when ppp runs its course. the the earning assets are likely going to be there just redeployed into something other than ppp and that has the potential to dilute overall earning asset yields. but the mix will be a function of what we're able to produce on core loan growth. and then separately, where we ultimately redeploy any excess liquidity, so it will be a different the nim might be if this come to pass the nim will be lower, but it'd be a function of more structural implications, as in a lower level of run rate. core loans to assets. that
makes sense?
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
yeah, yeah, that makes sense. and then finally from me just on buybacks and m&a if you look at your currency, your trading at about 135% of tangible book value. so it doesn't seem quite high enough to do bank m&a as a buyer, but may be too expensive on the buyback front too. so just thoughts on, it looks like you've repurchased about 1% of the company this quarter. will that continue and then thoughts on bank m&a everybody is expecting 2021 to be a fairly active year. you guys think you'll be active as well in m&a.
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
sure. i'll first start on the repurchase discussion and then we'll hit on m&a, and steve will add some thought there too. but from the standpoint of our stance on repurchasing, we don't think current share prices are necessarily too expensive to be an active share repurchase, and ultimately how that manifests itself will be a function of our -- of the 10b5 plan we put in place and we're not, but we do see share repurchases as a very viable tactic to manage our capital structure in our capital ratios and we value the flexibility that comes with that, as it relates to managing and shaping our return on tangible common equity profile, and we think that would have the potential to pay dividends down the road in from a valuation standpoint as well.
from an m&a standpoint. i wouldn't say that our current valuation necessarily boxes us out. but you're right, it could always be better. i think we have, we're in a better place now than we were three to six months ago, as it relates to our currency and ultimately we plan if the right opportunity presents itself to be at it.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
yeah, there is no doubt about that. there is two things, really the kind of drive the m&a mood i guess is, one is the currency and it's always better to be higher, and we're moving in that direction. so that's good, but the other one is the cloud of uncertainty with regard to covid, a year ago, we were all kind of perplexed with that and so as that cloud starts to lift, i think this is going to be a year where those conversations will heat up and we may see some, some deals take place. so we're active and people know that and so we are -- we maintain conversations in our region.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
great, thanks guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt olney with stephens inc. you may proceed with your question.
matthew olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thanks, good morning. i wanted to circle back to the discussion on the core margin, and paul, you mentioned the liquidity aspect is going to be challenging as some of these ppp loans are paid down, and that's definitely something we're hearing from other banks. but if we try to put liquidity aside and the ppp impact aside, i'm curious if you think that the improvements of lower and-or sparing deposit cost will be comparable to the pressure on the core loan yields. thanks.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, we still have room to go to improve our cost of funds and we look forward to really seeing that manifest itself, albeit a little bit more gradually quarter-over-quarter in 2021, than it was in 2020. but we still see that as a -- as a real driver and ultimate protector of our overall nim profile as we go forward. we're very pleased to note that a lot of that loan growth we had in the fourth quarter are really that production we had in the fourth quarter, which was quite strong at over $300 million, with actually at pricing that was a basis point higher on core loan yields than it was in the prior quarter. so we're seeing stabilization as it relates to the yields on our core loans, but we are very mindful of the competitive environment that we're in and the fact that core loan yields could be subject to additional risk. that said, i'm pretty buoyed by the the last quarter's pricing, as it relates to our core loans, and i think that helps us to be able to protect our overall revenue prospects in 2021 and beyond.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
that in our sense right now is there. we have a growing pipeline as well. so a good momentum. we have -- we obviously had good new loan production in the fourth quarter and we feel good about our pipeline as it sits. will that -- will that hold, we don't ever know that, but we certainly feel really good about our entry into '21 with regard to that. and so that that growth in the loan portfolio is going to mitigate off a lot of that nim compression pressure.
matthew olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, thank you for that. and then going back to the share repurchase discussion, you may have mentioned this i just missed it. what's the average price of the 270,000 shares? i think you mentioned that you repurchased in the fourth quarter.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i believe it was around 33 and change, we'll have that in our 10-k. yes.
matthew olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
what was that?
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
slightly over 33. yeah.
matthew olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and then you mentioned the m&a, i was wondering if you could be more specific and just talk about the m&a priorities for the bank at this point. what you are looking for, is it simply additional scale within the greater houston market or is it something besides that, thanks.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
we'll all hit -- first and foremost on scale in the power scale, we see that kind of loud and clear, as it relates to the current interest rate environment and potential pressures on the revenue profile that's spread away in the banks. the scale and being able to get cost savings is obviously in operating leverage is ultimately high on our minds, but separately to the extent we're able to broaden our our diversity of income profile to get more non-interest income. we see that as being potentially powerful as it relates to really building a more diversified and strong revenue profile.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
each one of the potential candidates to that are unique and we will evaluate each one on their own merits, but primarily, i guess the one thing that would probably guide us in this year is to -- is going to stay in the region, and i would call as the houston to beaumont gulf coast southeast texas region is where we'll be expending our energy.
matthew olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. okay, that's helpful and then just lastly, in the prepared remarks, there was the mention of the loans -- of loan sale and it was non-accrual loans, i missed some of the details behind that. can you just kind of go over the highlights of that and is that something you would consider again in 2021. thanks.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
ray you want to cover that in detail?
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. so matt. so the total -- the total is about $16 million, of which a portion of that was non-accrual. so it was a handful of loans really all previously identified as loans that were watchlist type credits or even more deteriorated than that. so it's a tool that we had -- that we've felt to be proactive was appropriate and then we've, it was prudent -- it was the right thing to do for those loans. whether we do it in the future or not, it's just really on a case-by-case basis depending on where we stand with those -- with these problem credits.
matthew olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and ray, just any, any color on the pricing of those loans versus where you had them on the books more recently?
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
it was actually pretty well over our debt book value.
matthew olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yeah. right.
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
we had identified reserve on those -- on number of those loans that we basically just recognize that loss through the reserve, we'd already had on the books. so we basically picked up a price that was equivalent to what the net book value was.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think about 10% or so.
matthew olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, perfect. thank you guys for taking my questions.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you bet.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from david feaster with raymond james. you may proceed with your question.
david feaster -- - raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning everybody.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
good morning, david.
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
hey dave.
david feaster -- - raymond james -- analyst
i just wanted to start. just curious on the kind of the pulse of your clients. how much of this growth is great to see accelerating originations? how much of it is existing clients, may be expanding versus new client acquisition from the new lenders or the ppp program? and just i guess their thoughts on additional investment in growth as we head into 2021, obviously texas is the economy strong there, but just curious the pulse of the client?
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
hey, david. yes. so we do keep track of -- keep track of that exact what you're asking, new and new customers and existing customers. so when you look at the $310 million, the $310 million was actually 60-40 of existing to 60 to 40 of new, but the qualifier i would say though there is that we have a bunch of new customers that are going to, that are going to fall into the existing category right now because of -- because they might have been here from ppp. so while i say a 60-40 existing, we really need to do another look at it, to really see what are new maybe new new, which is another category probably. but i guess the answer is that we're definitely getting traction and building relationships with customers acquired through ppp and of our 6,000 ppp loans that we made more than half were to new customers. so those new customers returning in the new business on the treasury side, we're on-boarding. basically every quarter of 2020 was twice of the on boarding of treasury that we did in 2019. and then we're seeing new loan requests from those customers as well. so we feel really good about it and of converting those to permanent customers. and yeah, the mood is i mean when you originate $310 million, i think that's a pretty indicative of the mood that there are, there is some, some growth and expansion happening.
i mean it definitely market share. there's nothing market share gains in there too, but there is some growth and expansion.
david feaster -- - raymond james -- analyst
okay, that's helpful and encouraging too. and then is great to see the c&i growth in the quarter. i mean we've been talking about that for a while. just curious, the composition of your pipeline and maybe whether you think c&i can potentially be a larger contributor going forward.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
certainly there is definite upside on the c&i david the the challenge there is utilization. we will -- we definitely book quality lines of credit to customers. the question is utilization and when they -- when we most customers get back to seeing revenue growth and we'll see, we'll see more utilization, which will result and larger funding, but there is an opportunity for us and we have experienced c&i lenders in our in our producer team.
david feaster -- - raymond james -- analyst
and then just last one from me, just any thoughts on the competitive landscape? it seems like almost as fast as originations are growing payouts and pay-downs are accelerating to just -- just curious how much of this is just strategic you're passing on because of unattractive terms or rate or clients is using cash to pay down debt or even asset sales. just any comments on the competitive landscape and pay out and pay down activity? thanks.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
yeah, so the -- you mentioned the cash to pay down debt, that is a component that we hadn't seen before where customers are just liquid and just -- if not a function of rate or sale of property just reducing de-levering on the -- on their own balance sheet. so we're still seeing some of that. where we are passing on some on some pricing terms, but as paul mentioned, this $310 million that we originated in the fourth quarter came on at $464 million, the $280 million that we did in the third quarter came on at $463 million.
so really like that trend there of picking up a basis point on the, on the 300 that happened in the third quarter. so that kind of positive signs in kind of a reflection of the competitiveness.
david feaster -- - raymond james -- analyst
that's great. thanks everybody.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
thank you, david.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from john rodis with janney. you may proceed with your question.
john rodis -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
good morning, guys.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
good morning john.
john rodis -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
just one question for me on fee income, the rebate line item ticked up a little bit in the quarter, but still well below 2019 levels. how should we think about that going forward in the current environment.?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'd see that tick up as a relative outlier. it is a function of larger than normal cash balances being held in our correspondent bank that hopefully will not necessarily be the case as much going forward. predominantly from the standpoint of deploying that liquidity into core loans or to a lesser extent securities both the cash in our core funding.
john rodis -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
yeah. i guess,paul along those lines. as far as the securities portfolio goes, like you said you grew that what, about $100 million during the quarter. so you -- should we expect that to continue to move somewhat higher. i guess it's a trade-off with loans in deposits to i realize, but how should we think about that?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
ideally, no really what you saw there is a investment in short variable rate 0% risk weight cash alternative types of securities. so it's really a function of excess liquidity and ultimately deciding to deploy it somewhere where we're not taking significant amounts of credit or interest rate risk, but doing better from a risk weighted capital standpoint -- risk weighted asset standpoint and otherwise on and the cash.
john rodis -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay, thanks guys.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
thank you.

i now turn the call over to our ceo, steve retzloff.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
thank you, courtney. welcome everyone to our conference call and thank you for your attendance. as we report on our results for the fourth quarter and for the 2020 year, we are buoyed by the heroic effort put forth by our bank team. i differentiate the actions of our staff this past year between that of mere duty and that of genuine dedication. our purpose of opening doors to success and helping small to medium-sized businesses in our region and understanding the importance of our special role within our community is what drove our team through the late nights and weekends that it took for not only our vastly outside ppp response, but also as we remained in close contact with our customers throughout 2020.
in addition to strong operating results during a covid-impacted 2020, we completed and initiated numerous projects including opening a new branch in the exciting east side of downtown, houston, while we announced the closure of a branch related to occur in january of this year.
we also furthered the implementation of a new loan origination system adopted cecl, enhanced our cyber security, expanded our electronic banking services including online account opening, improved numerous electronic workflows, implemented additional card controls, introduced factoring as an in-house product, incorporated letters-of-credit production into our international services group, executed share repurchases, began paying dividends, in this quarter, we'll increase that dividend by 20%. most importantly, we continue to support the community through local organizations, such as the houston food bank and many others, and we were recently awarded for the 11th year in a row, the distinction of being a best places to work in the region.
all of this and more was accomplished with a large number of our staff working from home and-or dealing with family challenges resulting from the worldwide pandemic. to say that we are proud of our team and the culture in which we operate, is an understatement. during the fourth quarter, $140 million of ppp loans were processed through the forgiveness phase, while core loans increased approximately $40 million notwithstanding approximately $16 million of loan sales, which ray will describe in his report. while core loans only slightly increased during 2020, our customers and consequently, the community and the bank benefited from the $700 million of first-round ppp loans that were booked.
our team is well under way as we readied ourselves for the opening bell of ppp 2021 and we're transmitting loans to the sba on day one of the new program. i am pleased with our asset quality position as we were able to reduce non-accrual loans in the fourth quarter resulting in an improved coverage ratio. we continue to work with customers with payment relief where possible, and consider that our reduction in the volume of this activity is an encouraging sign of optimism, broadly speaking.
the past two quarters reflected high watermarks for allegiance in terms of earnings per share, which was driven by both the accelerated ppp fee recognition and our ability to on-board new lending relationships at an impressive pace. the houston and upper gulf coast region of texas continues to be resilient in this cycle, and our bankers are prepared to take it from here. next, ray will describe our loan and deposit production results as well as an outlook on credit, followed by paul who will cover our financial results. we will then open the call for questions. ray?
ramon vitulli -- president of the company and chief executive officer
thanks, steve. as in the previous quarters of 2020, our bankers continue the outreach effort to our borrowing customers in the fourth quarter to get updates on financial condition, perspectives on how the pandemic is affecting their industries and to continue the relationship development of our new customers as a result of our outsized ppp effort. each quarter, i look back on all the accomplishments and truly appreciate all of our bankers, who have found ways to get all the work done. given all the challenges that came our way during the year, it is very nice to look back at 2020 and see solid performance by various measures, as will be described later by paul, and some other key results that are reflective of how we have come to be houston's largest community bank. from total loan originations of $1.8 billion, inclusive of $1.1 billion in core loans and $700 million in ppp to record levels of on-boarding of new treasury management customers to a smooth ppp forgiveness process. we continue to deliver to meet the expectations of the communities we serve.
in terms of ppp, we are very pleased with our loan results and the impact of our efforts on the houston region. our approach to provide ppp loans to both the existing customers and new customers has further strengthened our market presence. we continue to execute on the forgiveness process from round one of ppp and welcome the recent announcements of the simple forgiveness application for loans up $150,000. of all 6,000 plus round one ppp loans we originated, 83% or 150,000 or less in terms of number of loans. to date, we have received forgiveness applications for 2,785 loans totaling $368 million. of those, 1,511 have been submitted to the sba with 1,274 having been approved in funds received.
we are positioned again to be a leader in the delivery of the next round of ppp funds to our existing and new customers. our application portal has been opened since january 11th, and to date, we have responded to more than 3,700 new ppp first or second draw increase with more than 1,500 completed applications having been received.
in addition to helping our customers through the ppp process, we also provided assistance to eligible borrowers with payment deferrals on outstanding loan balances of $1.15 billion or 30% of core loans. of this amount, approximately $161 million of core loans remain on deferral at the end of the fourth quarter and $126 million as of january 25th.
i will now go over our quarterly results. total core loans, which excludes ppp loans and mortgage warehouse lines ended the fourth quarter at $3.92 billion, an increase of $39.7 million during the quarter. during the fourth quarter, our staff and lending team booked $310 million of new core loans that funded to a level of $220 million by december 31, compared to the third quarter when $280 million of new loans were generated, which funded to a level of $182 million by september 30. paid-off core loans were $195 million in the fourth quarter compared to $181 million in the third quarter and $171 million in the second quarter of 2020. the average size of the new organic core loans generated during the fourth quarter was 382,000 with an average funded balance of 270,000, which once again reflects our continued focus on building a diverse and granular loan portfolio.
the average size of all core-funded loans ended the quarter at 343,000. regarding interest rates on loans, based on total loan amount, the weighted average interest rate charged on our new fourth quarter core loans was 4.64%, which is comparable to the third quarter 2020 weighted average rate of 4.63% and below the second quarter 2020 weighted average rate of 4.84%. the $195 million of paid-off core loans during the quarter had a weighted average rate of 5.25%. carried core loans experienced advances of $65 million at a weighted average rate of 4.88% and paydowns of $63 million, which were at a weighted average rate of 5.02%. all end, the overall period end weighted average rate charge on our funded core loans decreased 8 basis points, ending the quarter at 5.08% compared to 5.16% as of september 30, 2020.
in terms of our overall loan portfolio, the loan type mix was little changed on a linked quarter basis. the slide deck posted on our website provides added color regarding our overall mix of loans. i would now like to provide some additional information on three loan categories that could have heightened risk due to energy prices and-or the covid pandemic. those being our oil and gas portfolio, our hotel portfolio, and our restaurant and bar portfolio. despite being a houston region bank, our overall exposure to oil and gas is largely indirect as we do not have any reserve based loans, but we have defined this category to be any borrower that operates and-or directly supports the upstream, midstream or downstream segments of the industry. at december 31, this category is approximately 1.7% of our funded loans or $75 million of which $28.4 million was commercial real estate and $46.2 million was c&i. of the $28.4 million in cre, the weighted average ltv for the portfolio was 52.3%, a 20% stress testing of the most recent appraised value plus 6% marketing expenses resulted in an overall collateral deficiency of approximately 142,000, increasing to 440,000 at a 30% stress test.
regarding our hotel portfolio, at december 31, we had $127 million of hotel loans, of which $117.7 million was commercial real estate, $6.8 million was c&d and $2.5 million was in c&i. of the $117.7 million in cre, the weighted average ltv for the portfolio was 59%. a 20% stress testing of the most recent appraised value plus 6% in marketing resulted in an overall collateral deficiency of approximately 994,000, increasing to $30.1 million at a 30% stress test. and regarding our restaurant and bar portfolio, at december 31, we had $117 million of restaurant and bar loans, of which $83.4 million was commercial real estate, $2.9 million was c&d and $30.4 million was c&i.
for the $83 million in cre, the weighted average ltv for the portfolio was 58.1%. a 20% stress testing of the most recent appraised value plus 6% marketing resulted in an overall collateral deficiency of approximately 613,000, increasing to $1.9 million to the 30% stress test. asset quality at quarter end remained in a manageable position. non-performing assets, including both non-accrual loans and ore ended the fourth quarter down from 78 to 63 basis points of total assets, primarily due to the sale of $8.2 million of non-accrual loans during the quarter, which was part of $16 million in total loan sales during the quarter.
non-accrual loans decreased in net of $9 million during the quarter from $37.9 million to $28.9 million, primarily due to the $8.2 million in non-accrual loans sold during the quarter, $3.8 million in charge-offs, of which $2.1 million is associated with the loan sale, $1.4 million in payments and pay-offs and $321,000 that was moved to ore. we added $4.1 million in new non-accrual loans during the quarter, the largest being a $1.7 million real estate loan that paid off in full earlier this month. the additional $2.4 million increase in non-accruals was from five relationships, two of which totaled $2.2 million and the remaining 194,000 was from three smaller relationships.
ore increased to $9.2 million during the quarter compared to $8.9 million for the third quarter, primarily due to a single-family residence that was moved to ore in the amount of $321,000 and subsequently sold in january of 2021. the $9.2 million in ore consists of five properties with the largest of $4.4 million commercial real estate property. second largest is a $3.7 million industrial real estate property and the third largest a $576,000 residential property. the remaining property is in beaumont. these properties are being actively marketed, with the two largest properties in contract negotiations for potential sale. the level of net charge-offs was elevated during the quarter at $4.3 million for an annualized rate of 37 basis points, inclusive of $2.4 million related to the above -- to the aforementioned loan sale.
in terms of our broader watch list, out classified loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 3.61% of total loans as of december 31, compared to 2.40% as of september 30. criticized loans increased to 5.95% at december 31 from a 5.16 at september 30. specific reserves for individually evaluated loans ended the quarter at 12%, compared to 15.7% at september 30. on the deposit front, we saw an increase in total deposits in the four quarter by $71.1 million from the third quarter and up $920.3 million over the year ago quarter. the increased during the fourth quarter was primarily in cds and other time deposits. the increase over the prior year was primarily in the non-interest bearing deposit category as a result of new accounts associated with ppp customers as well as higher balances in our carried accounts. non-interest bearing deposits decreased $68 million during the fourth quarter and were up $452 million over the year-ago quarter. with that, our non-interest bearing deposits to total deposit ratio was 34.2% for december 31, 2020 compared to 36% for september 30, 2020 and 30.8% for the year-ago quarter.
with regards to the pandemic and covid statistics for the houston area, while not at all time peak levels, harris county is experiencing elevated levels of both percent of positive tests and icu beds occupied by covid patients. we continue to monitor these trends and remain highly focused on health and safety. we are cautiously optimistic of the progress toward the economic recovery in the houston region, aided by our ability to again deliver release to our customers with the next round of ppp, while providing banking solutions to meet the needs of our customers in 2021 and beyond.
i now turn it over to our cfo, paul.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, ray. we are very pleased to report fourth quarter net income of $15.9 million or $0.77 per diluted share as compared to $16.2 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the third quarter and $14 million or $0.67 per diluted share posted in the fourth quarter of 2019. pre-tax provision income for the fourth quarter reached a high watermark at $24.2 million, as compared to $21.2 million in the third quarter and $18.5 million for the year-ago quarter. i'll note that we had $1.9 million in oreo write downs in the third quarter. so after adjusting for this, pre-tax pre-provision income would have been about $23 million for the third quarter.
net interest income was the key driver to our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings power in the fourth quarter, where we saw an increase of $3 million or 5.8% to $54.9 million from $51.9 million in the third quarter, primarily due to revenue recognized on ppp loans and lower interest expense in the quarter, more than offsetting slightly lower core loan income. total net fee revenue related to ppp loans recognized into interest income during the fourth quarter was $6 million, is an increase from $3 million in the third quarter. additionally, interest expense decreased by $757,000 during the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
the impact of acquisition accounting accretion continue to decrease in the fourth quarter. accretion increased loan income by $281,000 and reduced cd expense by $61,000 for a total positive effect on net interest income of $342,000 versus a total positive impact of $598,000 in the third quarter and $1.9 million in the year ago quarter. only $855,000 remain in loan mark and $220,000 in the cd mark. yield on loans in the fourth quarter was 5.09% as compared to 4.89% for the third quarter and 5.65% for the year-ago quarter.
adjusting for acquisition accretion yields on loans would have been 5.07% in the fourth quarter, 4.84% in the third quarter and 5.47% in the year-ago quarter. our loan yield story reflects a combination of factors, including decreased purchase accounting accretion as previously discussed, decrease in core or non-ppp loan yields, which went from 5.25% in the third quarter to 5.11% in the fourth quarter, and perhaps most impactful was the overall impact of ppp loans.
in the third quarter, we saw ppp loans effectively dilute overall loan yields, which went from 5.13% in the second quarter to 4.89%, as average ppp balances amounted to about 15% of our loan mix. this is a pretty significant mix shifts toward lower yielding ppp loans and without the benefit of any accelerated fee income recognition from forgiveness. this dynamic flipped in the fourth quarter, thanks to accelerated ppp net-fee income recognition in the yield, totaling approximately $3 million and thereby boosting loan yields to 5.09%.
so total yield on interest earning assets was 4.71% for the fourth quarter, up from the 4.58% we posted in the third quarter and down from 5.35% for the year-ago quarter, reflecting the aforementioned effects of ppp balances, net-fee income recognition, lower accretion income and a changing asset mix. excluding ppp loans and related revenue, total yield on earning assets would have been 4.67% for the fourth quarter versus 4.85% in the third quarter.
before i move on, i should note that as of year-end, we had approximately $14 million of net deferred fee income remaining relating to 2020's ppp loans, which we will recognize in the yield over the life of the remaining ppp loans, and on an accelerated basis when we experience sba forgiveness. with respect to interest expense, our cost to interest bearing liabilities continued to decrease in the fourth quarter to 93 basis points from 105 basis points in the third quarter and 185 basis points for the year-ago quarter. the overall cost of funds for the fourth quarter was 62 basis points versus 69 basis points in the third quarter. we expect to see continued improvement in our funding cost going forward.
so, with the help of ppp net-fee income recognition and lower interest expense in q4, offsetting a significant shift in the composition of our earning assets, we are really proud to post a taxable equivalent net interest margin of 4.14% for the quarter as compared to 3.95% in the third quarter and 4.11% in the year-ago quarter. now if you were to exclude ppp loans and the related revenue, net interest margin would have been 4.02% for the fourth quarter.
going forward, we continue to feel well positioned to maintain a relatively strong net interest margin, as we seek to further optimize our funding mix and maintain discipline on loan pricing.
non-interest income ticked up slightly quarter-over-quarter increasing to $2 million for the fourth quarter from $1.9 million in the third quarter. on the expense side, total non-interest expense also remained relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, as fourth quarter expense was $32.7 million compared to $32.6 million in the third quarter. the difference is primarily due to increases in the salary and benefits line and the other expenses line, mostly offset by decreased other real estate expenses.
the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter decreased to 57.53% compared to the 60.58% posted in the third quarter and the 62.2% for the prior year quarter. as mentioned in prior quarters, we had elected to take the relief that came with the cares act to defer the implementation of cecl until this quarter, at which point we adopted cecl retrospectively to january 1, 2020. consequently, the reported allowance for the fourth quarter was calculated under the cecl standard. the provision for loan losses was $4.4 million for the fourth quarter compared to the loss to the provision we took in the third quarter of $1.3 million, bringing our total provisioning for the year to $27.4 million. our allowance for loan losses ended the year at $53.2 million representing 118 basis points of total loans and 139 basis points on core or non-ppp loans.
so bottom line, our fourth quarter roaa and ratc metrics for the quarter came to 1.05% and 12.32% respectively. year-end, tangible book value per share was $25.59, which makes for an increase of approximately 13.1% since year-end of 2019, which is something we feel great about notwithstanding such turbulent 2020, which included cecl implementation and a year-over-year reserve build of over 80%, $0.40 of dividends and the repurchase of over 500,000 shares of stock during the year.
on the topic of share repurchases. i should note that in the fourth quarter we did restart share repurchases under our existing 1 million share repurchase authorization, buying back nearly 275,000 shares. while covid still brings about significant economic uncertainties, allegiance closes out 2020 bigger and better than ever at over $6 billion in assets, with capital, reserves and liquidity levels stronger than ever. we feel very well positioned as we navigate the current economic environment and we feel confident about our ability to maintain a strong capital position. to that end, the company declared a dividend of $0.12 per share of common stock, up 20% from the $0.10 per share dividend prior.
i will now turn the call back over to steve.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman, chief executive officer
thank you, paul. with that i will now turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from david feaster with raymond james.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning everybody. it sounds like originations were really strong despite distraction from the ppp. just just curious kind of how the pipeline is shaping up and maybe what you're hearing from customers, how much of the production is kind of coming from existing clients that are more confident and willing to invest versus new client acquisition from either new lender hires or the ppp program. and just, i guess, the pulse of your clients.
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
thanks, david. morning. yes. so it was strong in that first quarter. the -- i'd say that while we would really like to target maybe a 50-50 of that growth coming from new and versus existing. it's probably more -- a little bit more of existing as we work with our established customers. we're still doing this customer acquisition on the ppp side.
but the mood is very good and the pipeline is at levels pre-pandemic type pipeline levels. and that's when the pipeline grows, that's coming from our field saying these are the -- obviously, these are the requests that we have in place and the deals that we're talking about. so feel good about that and what the future prospects are for more originations.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's encouraging. and then just how are new hires turning? you guys have always done a great job picking up new lenders. just i guess, with bonuses being paid and some disruption in the market, have you seen an increase in conversations? and maybe how is the pipeline for new liens?
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
yes. we have -- conversations have picked up. you're right. first quarter is usually a little light because of that because of the bonus. we did have one lender hire in the first quarter. and if you look back over the past four quarters in a covid environment, we had six producer hires and one out of our homegrown, out of our analyst pools for a total of seven. so given the circumstances over the past four quarters, we feel pretty good about being -- making those additions.
but yes, the conversations are picking up, and we do see some disruption and and we'll -- there's kind of two forms of disruption. one is the -- what happens in the m&a world. the other one is as our -- in our space kind of in that business banking space as the competition continues to to change their rules of what business banking means. those -- that's a disruption for customers and bankers, and we have those conversations and hanging around the hoop for that.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's correct. and then it's encouraging to hear the new loan yields in the originations. it sounds like pricing might be troughing a year. i guess do you think that's a function of mix? or just how has pricing trended more recently? has the steepening of the curve allowed for better pricing at all? and do you think maybe the shift toward larger credits that you talked about may impact new loan yields? or do you think you'll still be able to get these premium levels of rate despite going upstream a bit?
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
well, i mean we feel good about the past three quarters of that rate on the new production hanging around this 4.63, 4.64 but it's still very competitive. so i'm not sure about hitting the floor there, but we're really pleased with the last three quarters and where things landed.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
yes. and this is steven. in terms of the larger loans. it's really we're looking at larger loan relationships. there's we have a number -- a lot of customers that have multiple loans, multiple projects and if you restrict that to a certain maximum relationship size, then you're going to miss the next deal. so we're just kind of opening up that door a little bit. it's not appreciably larger loans so much to this more -- opening the door for bigger relationships.
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
okay that's great, thanks everybody.
operator
thank you, our next question comes from brad milsaps with piper stanley.
brad milsaps -- piper stanley -- analyst
hey, good morning. ray, i think i heard you correctly say you've added 5,800 customers over the last 12 months, which is a tremendous number. it looks like thus far, those have really translated into deposit balances. i know this is probably tough to handicap. but how much loan growth do you think you pull forward with your guys participation in the ppp program? just trying to get a sense of kind of when some of this production you're seeing can actually translate into actual loans outstanding on the books?
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
yes. great question. when you look at the 4,000 of the ppp, i mean, as we try to penetrate that and what we call convert those to full customers, i mean, we're seeing low maybe 1/4 of that at this moment has something other than the ppp loan. so i mean it's a process to work through and generate additional business, and we're working on that. so i mean i think it's -- we'll pick up gains every quarter.
and as we -- we have several touches with these customers, not only on the origination side but on the forgiven side and then a number of the second round were to some -- to the same to our existing customers from the first round. so we have a number of touch points plus an effort to convert these. so i think it's just going to be incremental over the next few quarters, but we have optimistic about what's ahead of us with that conversion opportunity.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
and ppp customers are getting liquidity through the ppp loan program, which stance recent has an impact on their loan demand and how they may be positioning. so when they're ready for their next loan, could be -- could involve some lag time being that there is a beneficiary of this ppp program in the near term and the recent past.
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
we're in the middle one.
brad milsaps -- piper stanley -- analyst
sure. sure. and so ray, would you say that maybe grows kind of low single-digit type rate kind of in the near term? and then hopefully, maybe by next year, you can guys can start ramping back up closer to what you've done historically?
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
talking all in on the whole. growth in the entire loan?
brad milsaps -- piper stanley -- analyst
yes, ex ppp.
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
yes. yes yes, core loads. yes, i think that.
brad milsaps -- piper stanley -- analyst
okay. okay. and then just curious kind of how you guys are thinking about resolution on some of the loans that are still having issues coming out of the pandemic, i think it sounds like kind of criticized classified had stabilized just under 6%. just kind of wanted to get a sense of kind of how you guys are thinking about potential losses as you kind of get in the back half of the year and how that might relate to your -- how you're approaching the level of reserve and the provision going forward.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
well, we obviously feel like we've got -- we have them all identified properly, and we assess them every quarter, we've experienced very good low charge-offs at this point. and we -- again, there's probably not a a way to extrapolate that out into a quarter-by-quarter projection, but we feel like we're in the right place with those that we're participating with deferrals and their underlying business model getting better over time, such as like local hotels and so forth. so i think we feel pretty pretty good that it shouldn't be outsized in terms of any kind of experience for problem assets getting worse. i really feel like it's actually more on getting better from here. obviously, lot depends on the pandemic and so forth.
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
and i might note that anything that merits individual valuation under our -- under cecl, we have evaluated and considered in our provision and allowance credit loss.
okan i. akin -- president and chief risk officer
yes. yes. in addition to that, this is okan. i'll add the fact that we're seeing a deceleration -- significant deceleration of downgrades in our portfolio and actually also experiencing in the number of instances, upgrades. and that's a very pronounced with our high-risk portfolio as well. where the -- that portfolio is hanging on better-than-expected originally set.
brad milsaps -- piper stanley -- analyst
great. and just final question for paul. excluding the branch writedown, that $33 million or so of expenses this quarter, would you think that's a pretty good run rate? or was there anything else that you may have benefited from maybe fas 91 related from ppp in 1q that might cause that to go up appreciably or is $33 million or so a decent run rate?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think 33 handle is a decent run rate i might hedge just a 30 is where you'll see things. there's some level of noise in the second quarter, we'll still be paying for some of the staff augmentation that was used to kind of really put our shoulder into the ppp effort, and we'll now pivot a little bit more into the forgiveness effort. so there's still something singing out there, but nothing i think you're in the zone.
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
yes. and things like a record earnings bring, record bonus kind of profit sharing accruals and things of that nature as well.
brad milsaps -- piper stanley -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from brady gailey with kbw.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
great, thank you. good morning guys. so i know accretable yield has been a fairly small number for you guys recently. i think last quarter, it was only about $300,000. did that remain fairly small immaterial this quarter?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, getting more immaterial every quarter, which is really why we thought we might economize here in our first quarter of 2021. it's weaning off, weaning away toward dropping.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay. great. and then when you look at the back it's great to see you all active in the quarter. it looks like you bought stock at around 135 times tangible. if you look at the stock now, it's now 1.5 to 1.6 times tangible, so it's not as cheap. so do you still have a pretty good appetite to execute on the buyback despite the stock price being a little higher?
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
price is one of many considerations that we look into when we're evaluating the share repurchases, but more so than ever, our number one use of excess capital is core loan growth. secondary to that, we want to maintain a high level of flexibility for potential m&a activity. and then, of course, there's pricing dynamics that drive a little bit of the volume-based appetite around the share repurchases. so a lot of moving parts. not intimidated too much by the current share price, but more focused on executing on the most accretive ways for us to put that capital to work.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay. and then lastly for me is just on how allegiance fits into the m&a landscape. it's been a little quieter in texas than i would have thought. i know we saw bancorp south in cadence, which was a big deal in mills backyard. but how do you think allegiance fits in m&a. is it you guys would consider acquiring some smaller, more downstream targets? or do you think it's more something either transformational like an moe type of transaction?
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
well, it's good to see the larger transactions out there. and of course, inside the pandemic, it's probably been more appropriate to do a life-sized -- a transaction like that because of the kind of the risk profile of uncertainties. coming out of the uncertainties though, i think it opens the door for smaller transactions.
you have better currency so i'd say that we're actively assertive right now in terms of an m&a profile or posture. we are probably still thinking -- we would think across the board, but acquisitions would be certainly welcomed around here, smaller, medium sized. i think they can make a difference we're working hard on the organic side, but we're also stay in touch with the community bankers around and probably know that community as well as anybody through all of our contacts.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from matt olney with stephens.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
thank you, good morning. the ppp, i want to circle back on that $22 million of amortized net fee still as of march 31. i'm curious kind of what the crystal ball says about how those will be recognized over the next few quarters.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
as our wait, predicting in the future it is one of those things. we think the second round is going to go faster than the first, but we do recognize that there's potential for stragglers as it relates to the way that the forgiveness process is ultimately going to play out. so candidly, the way we mode for purposes is around 70% or so being forgiven by the end of the year. it could be higher, but we feel that it's probably right for us to think about it in that context.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
okay. and then circling back on some commentary that that steve made earlier, you mentioned a few times some larger loans. i'm curious, i mean, it's all relative, i guess, in terms of larger to allegiance wouldn't be larger to other banks. but is that more of a -- would you call it a traditional middle market strategy? or is it just a little bit larger on the small business loan side? any numbers you can put behind that? thanks.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
i'd say larger on the small business side is the kind of the right way to put that. we just don't have loan relationships that exceed $20 million, very few over $10 million. and given our asset size and loan footings, i mean it's time that we're willing to take a look at that more closely. a lot of opportunity there. gradually, i think it just gives us a little bit more raw material to look at that number one use of capital and that's low growth, and we're really focused there.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
and to clarify on that, is it going to be new producers and new individuals that are doing this? or is it just looking at the existing team and existing customers that you were willing to grow it larger than before?
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
well, our existing team has -- and you calculate different ways, but close to $800 million of capacity. and when you look at the loan the lenders that are below our kind of average norm. so we've got a lot of capacity in our current lending staff to build portfolio. we have a lot of growth continuing, though on those at 85-or-so percent of our lending staff that are at or above our our normal portfolio size, and they continue to grow their portfolios.
but when we tell them that -- we don't want larger loan relationships. their customers go other places because they're continuing to do projects, and this is historic. so we're just kind of giving them an opportunity to go back to those customers that they can actually add another loan or taken on the loan back, that type of thing. so is still smaller loans, but we believe that it just gives the entire lending staff the opportunity to grow that book. it's not so much new for new lenders or certainly don't want to be interpreted as us going to the middle market.
operator
our next question comes from john rodis with janney.
john rodis -- janney -- analyst
good morning guys, paul, maybe just -- i guess i missed this, but on the ppp loans, you said $22 million remaining. what was in the first quarter?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we recognized in fee income of approximately $6.9 million into yield during the first quarter, pardon me. that's net fee income. we've got a slide on ppp that detailed in the investor presentation. but yes, that $2.5 million.
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
total revenue was a little higher if you could the interest.
john rodis -- janney -- analyst
okay, that's it for me. thank you guys.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the allegiance bancshares first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, courtney theriot, executive vice president and chief accounting officer. please proceed.
courtney theriot -- executive vice president-chief accounting officer
thank you, operator, and thank you to all who have joined our call today. this morning's earnings call will be led by steve retzloff, chief executive officer of the company; ray vitulli, president of the company and chief executive officer of allegiance bank; paul egge, executive vice president and chief financial officer; okan akin, executive vice president and chief risk officer of the company and president of allegiance bank; and shanna kuzdzal, executive vice president and general counsel.
before we begin today, i need to remind everyone that some of the remarks made today constitute forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended. we intend all such statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the act. also note that if we give guidance about future results, that guidance is only a reflection of management's beliefs at the time the statement is made, and such release are subject to change.
we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law. please see the last page of the text in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at allegiancebank.com for additional information about the risk factors associated with forward-looking statements. we also have provided an investor presentation on our website. although it is not being used as a guide for today's comments, it is available for review at this time. at the conclusion of our remarks, we will open the line and allow time for questions. i now turn the call over to our chief executive officer, steve retzloff.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
thank you, courtney. we welcome everyone to our conference call, and thank you for your attendance. the first quarter represented a very productive start for the year, highlighted by record earnings per share of $0.89, plus significant deposit growth of $386 million during the quarter, bringing our total deposit growth over the past 12 months to $1.42 billion or 30.9%. assets increased to $6.43 billion as we have now funded over $1.04 billion of ppp loans, with over $332 million being funded during the last quarter.
all in, we remain in a strong position relating to capital and liquidity, and we increased our dividend to $0.12 per share of common stock in the first quarter. our record earnings was aided by the accelerated recognition of ppp fees during the quarter and by the low provision number that came from having very little in the way of net charge-offs and an improving economy. that said, we absorbed added costs in the quarter due to assets writedowns as paul will describe and incurred increased overtime and third-party staff augmentation expenses totaling approximately $400,000 in the quarter further to our ppp production.
our stakeholders benefited from the continued extraordinary out forming of effort from our staff as we not only booked a large number of ppp loans, but also originated $325 million of core loans during the quarter for a total new loan production of $657 million in the quarter. with the ppp now moving into the file completion and forgiveness phase, our production staff will be able to redirect their entire focus to generating traditional core lending and depository relationships for which our pipelines are already solidly established and will be further enhanced as we use our proven relationship building muscle to deepen the connection through the approximately 4,000 new customers who we assisted with our ppp effort.
we are pleased with our overall asset quality, and we're able to significantly reduce our ore. we continue to remain alert to the impact of the pandemic has had on our community and our customers, particularly those in the higher-risk sectors. but the streets of houston are showing signs of broader economic activity as heavy traffic, which used to be curse is now and every day, welcome side. although with a sense of steadily growing optimism, we remain cautious as to the timing of a full and complete rebound for all sectors.
given our growing market penetration and size and while we continue to focus on high service levels to smaller commercial customers and the market differentiation of this strategy affords us, we are beginning to attract and retain larger lending relationships. that said, our average loan size is not expected to appreciably change. but we believe that a marginal well-managed step in this direction is not only warranted but provides incremental quality growth opportunities. from an operational perspective, we have acquired a more robust and more integrated loan origination system, which we deployed quite effectively as the platform and workflow for handling our ppc loans.
and we are now beginning to implement this new system for our entire lending platform. finally, allegiance has built and continues to add to the value of our brand and has evolved into an extraordinary franchise value by accelerating our penetration into the market with more and more customers, we have now had first-hand experience and depreciation of what our service level commitment can bring to their table.
given how we responded to the needs of this community over the past year, i believe that we are the clear proven bank of choice in the houston region, and we will be deepening our position even further over the coming year. next, ray will describe our loan and deposit production results as well as an outlook on credit, followed by paul, who will cover our financial results. we will then open the call for questions.
ramon a. vitulli -- chief executive officer
thanks, steve. the first quarter of 2021 saw our bankers back in the ppp origination business as we work with our customers, both existing and new through the second round of the program while assisting first-round borrowers with a forgiveness process. as mentioned last quarter, we designed the second round effort in a way for our bankers to meet ppp demand while allowing capacity to generate and expand customer relationships.
as a result, we are extremely pleased to report core loan originations of $325 million, the second highest level in the history of the bank. driven by improving economic conditions, market share gains and continued conversion of the nearly 4,000 new customers from our ppp effort. and in addition to our new customers from ppp, we also attracted 1,800 new non-ppp customers over the past 12 months, bringing total customer acquisition to 5,800, representing 19% growth over the past year.
we have also seen increased adoption and utilization of nearly every electric electronic banking service for mobile remote deposit capture to ach originations to wire transfers. we continue to review our electronic banking product offerings to meet customer demands and expectations and also monitor our brick-and-mortar footprint to optimize how we deliver service and position ourselves to execute on what we believe to be an extraordinary market share growth opportunity.
with regards to ppp forgiveness, as of march 31, we received forgiveness applications for 4,103 loans totaling over $505 million or about half of the $1 billion in ppp loans originated. of those, 3,320 have been submitted to the sba, totaling over $433 million, with 2,973 loans having been approved and funds received of over $364 million. in early march, we incorporated into our platform, the new simple forgiveness application for loans up to $150,000, which was welcome news that the majority of our ppp borrowers are able to use this form.
in addition to helping our customers through the ppp process, we also provided assistance to eligible borrowers with payment deferrals on outstanding loan balances of $1.15 billion or 30% of core loans. of this amount, approximately $62.1 million of core loans remain on deferral at march 31, 2021, further reduced to $54.9 million as of april 22. moving now to our quarterly operating results. total core loans, which excludes ppp loans, ended the first quarter at $3.93 billion, an increase of $8.9 million during the quarter.
during the first quarter, our staff and lending team booked $325 million of new core loans that funded to a level of $203 million by march 31 compared to the fourth quarter with $311 million of new core loans were generated, which funded to a level of $220 million by december 31. paid off core loans were $180 million in the first quarter compared to $195 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. the $180 million of paid off core loans during the quarter had a weighted average rate of 5.15%.
carried core loans experienced advances of $97 million at a weighted average rate of 4.93% and paydowns of $105 million, which were at a weighted average rate of 5.11%. we are pleased to report the weighted average interest rate charge on our new first quarter core loans of -- was 4.63%, which is just below the fourth quarter 2020 weighted average rate of 4.64% and equal to the third quarter 2020 weighted rate. all in, the overall period-end weighted average rate charge on our funded core loans decreased six basis points, ending the quarter at 5.02% compared to 5.08% as of december 31, 2020.
over the past few quarters, we have provided information on several loan categories that could have heightened risk due to energy prices and/or the covid pandemic. those being our oil and gas portfolio, our hotel portfolio and our restaurant and bar portfolio. as of march 31, our oil and gas portfolio totaled $72 million or 1.6% of our funded loans, with an average ltv of 53.8% on the cre portion. the hotel portfolio totaled $125 million or 2.78% of our funded loans with an average ltv of 60.8% on the cre portion.
and the restaurant and bar portfolio totaled $116 million or 2.58% of total loans with an average ltv of 59.2% on the cre portion. in aggregate, asset quality at quarter end continued to remain in a manageable position. nonperforming assets, including both nonaccrual loans and ore, ended the first quarter down from 63 to 55 basis points of total assets, primarily due to the sale of $8.6 million of other real estate owned during the quarter.
nonaccrual loans increased a net of $6.2 million during the quarter from $28.9 million to $35.1 million, primarily due to $15.1 million in additions that were partially offset by $4.7 million of payoffs, $2.7 million in payments and $1.5 million in upgrades placed back on accrual. the largest addition was a $4.9 million hospitality property. the additional $10.2 million increase in nonaccrual accruals was from 13 relationships, two of which totaled $6.1 million and the remaining $4.1 million was from 11 smaller relationships.
ore decreased to $576,000 during the quarter compared to $9.2 million for the fourth quarter, primarily due to the $8.6 million of ore sales. our ore is now comprised of one residential property. charge-offs for the quarter were minimal at an annualized rate of three basis points. in terms of our broader watch list, our classified loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 3.91% of total loans as of march 31 compared to 3.61% as of december 31. criticized loans increased to 5.98% at march 31 from 5.95% at december 31. specific reserves were individually evaluated loans ended the quarter at 14% compared to 12% at december 31.
on the deposit front, we saw an increase in total deposits in the first quarter by $385.7 million from the fourth quarter and up $1.42 billion over the year ago quarter. the increase during the first quarter was primarily in the noninterest-bearing deposit category, which increased $209.6 million over the fourth quarter and $696.6 million over the prior year as a result of new accounts associated with ppp customers as well as higher balances in our carried accounts. with that, our noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposit ratio was 35.6% from march 31 compared to 34.2% for december 31 and 30.8% for the year ago quarter.
as previously mentioned, we are seeing signs of economic recovery that is reflected in our level of new core loan originations and downward trend of loan deferrals and loan payment performance. recent data from the texas workforce commission shows the houston area to have created 34,000 jobs in the month of march, well above historical monthly average of 13,100 jobs. and through march, houston has recovered 168,400 jobs or 47% of the jobs lost last march and april.
with a healthy loan pipeline, customer acquisition and conversion opportunities in front of us, increased disruption in the banking industry for both business owners and bankers and an ever-strengthening market position in the eastern region, we are poised to start referring to our organic loan growth prospects with the word that has been used to describe our ppp success. that being outsized. i now turn it over to our chief financial officer, paul.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, ray. we are very proud to be posting record first quarter net income of $18 million or $0.89 per diluted share as compared to $15.9 million or $0.77 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and $3.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020. our record earnings were despite elevated expenses in the quarter, the most significant of which were approximately $1.5 million in nonrecurring asset writedown expenses, most of which relating to a branch closure during the quarter.
pretax preprovision income for the first quarter was $22.5 million as compared to $24.2 million in the fourth quarter and $15.3 million for the year ago quarter. adding back $1.5 million in nonrecurring expenses on adjusted measure for pre-tax provision income would have been approximately $24 million. net interest income was the key driver to our pre-tax provision earnings power during the quarter. where we saw an increase of $796,000 or 1.4% to $55.7 million from $54.9 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower interest expense in the quarter and higher revenue recognized on ppp loans, partially offset by lower core loan income.
interest expense decreased by $1 million in the first quarter compared to the prior quarter. and total fee revenue related to ppp loans, which were recognized into interest income during the quarter was $6.9 million, an increase from $6 million in the fourth quarter. yield on loans in the first quarter was 5.15% as compared to 5.09% for the fourth quarter and 5.59% for the year ago quarter. excluding ppp loans and related revenue, yield on loans would have been 5.06% for the first quarter, 5.07% in the fourth quarter and 5.59% in the year ago quarter.
total yield on interest-earning assets was 4.67% for the first quarter, down from 4.71% in the fourth quarter and 5.28% in the year ago quarter, reflecting a change in earning asset mix that includes a higher proportion of securities as well as significant ppp loans within the loan totals. excluding ppp loans and related revenue, total yield on earning assets would have been 4.54% for the first quarter versus 4.67% in the fourth quarter. before i move on, i should note that as of quarter end, we had approximately $22 million of net deferred fee income remaining relating to ppp loans.
with respect to interest expense, our cost of interest-bearing liabilities continued to decrease in the first quarter to 80 basis points from 93 basis points for the fourth quarter and 168 basis points for the year ago quarter. the overall cost of funds for the first quarter was 54 basis points versus 62 basis points in the fourth quarter. we expect to see continued improvement in our funding costs going forward, particularly as the cd book continues to reprice lower. so with the help of lower interest expense in q1, ppp net fee income recognition offsetting a significant shift in the composition of our earning assets, our taxable equivalent net interest margin was 4.19% for the quarter as compared to 4.14% in the fourth quarter and 4.15% in the year ago quarter. excluding ppp loan balances and related revenue, net interest margin would have been 3.95% for the first quarter.
going forward, we feel well positioned to maintain a relatively strong core net interest margin through optimizing our funding mix and maintaining discipline on loan pricing. that said, excess liquidity and changes to our earning asset competition have potential to be a drag on nims depending on how our core loan growth story plays out. noninterest income was lower quarter-over-quarter decreasing to $1.7 million for the first quarter from $2 million for the fourth quarter, primarily due to $176,000 loss on the sale of ore assets. total noninterest expense increased in the first quarter to $34.9 million compared to $32.7 million in the fourth quarter. the difference is primarily due to increases in the salary and benefits line and the other expenses line.
other expenses include the aforementioned $1.5 million in nonrecurring asset writedowns. the efficiency ratio for the first quarter increased to 60.85% compared to the 57.53% from the fourth quarter, a decrease from the 68.13% for the prior year quarter. excluding the asset writedowns, the efficiency ratio for the first quarter would have been 58.29%. the provision for credit losses was $639,000 for the first quarter. and our allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $52.8 million, representing 113 basis points of total loans and 134 basis points on core or non-ppp loan balances.
bottom line, our first quarter produced an raa and roatce of 1.18% and 14.03%, respectively, both representing all-time highs. quarter intangible book value per share was $25.75, which makes for an increase of approximately 13.5% since the year ago quarter, which is something we are proud of as well. all in all, we feel very well positioned to continue to drive franchise and shareholder value in 2021 and beyond.
to that end, the company declared another dividend of $0.12 per diluted share on common stock and reupped a one million share repurchase authorization to replace the authorization that expires at march 31, 2021. and on the topic of share repurchases, i should note that during the first quarter, we did repurchase 161,000 shares at a weighted average price of $35.11. reflecting on over a year in a covid-impacted operating environment, we are very proud to be bigger and better than ever at over $6.4 billion in assets and with capital reserves and liquidity levels at or near all-time highs. thanks to tremendous ppp success driven by the amazing dedication of the allegiance team, we've been successful in adding to our market share at largest regionally dedicated bank. i will now turn the call back over to steve.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
thanks, paul. with that, i will now turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions.
",2021-Q1,ABTX
,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw. your line is open. please go ahead.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
hi. thank. good morning guys.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
so we saw kind of a continued buildup in cash in the quarter. when do you start thinking about more aggressively putting that to use in the bond portfolio? i know the bond book grew this quarter. but does that continue for the next couple of quarters as excess cash continues to grow?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
we think about it all the time, but we really don't want to take meaningful industry risk in the bond portfolio. so we have been growing the bond portfolio, but we've been staying pretty short duration and variable rate which it -- it doesn't really drive meaningful net interest or interest income, but it really reflects the extent to which we do want to get more incrementally more invested. but effectively, we're against taking a meaningful amount of interest rate risk through that securities portfolio.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
yes. alright. that makes sense. and then there doesn't appear to be any share buybacks in the quarter. but if you look at how the stock has traded, it used to be over 40. it's now pulled back into the mid-30s. i think that's at a level where you guys have purchased stock before. should we think about you guys reengaging in the share repurchase plan at this point?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
we feel like share repurchases are a really valuable tool for capital management. our highest and best use of capital, of course, is going to be put and forth loan growth and supporting that loan growth with capital. and then secondarily, we want to maintain a meaningful amount of flexibility for m&a possibilities and things on those lines. so yes, share repurchases are definitely in the arsenal. but at the same time, we -- our preferred usage of cash is clearly going to be through either organic growth or inorganic opportunities that we want to have -- maintain a high level of when yes.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
yes, and then finally for me, i mean, if you look at the last couple of quarters, you guys have been growing core loans, kind of ex ppp in the low single-digit level. i mean, a lot of banks are talking about growth kind of accelerating in the back half of this year and as we get into 2022. how should we think about loan growth for you guys going forward?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
well, we saw -- we did see some nice growth in the back half of the second quarter, but we think the momentum will carry into the next two quarters of the year, the originations were strong. those were on a pipeline that was strong and we -- and the pipeline looks similar going into this quarter. so i think if we get what we saw in the back half of the second quarter, brady, we can tick up into that, what you're talking about, into that higher single-digit than what we should in the first two quarters.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
we're really pleased with the pipeline and the sort of the production from the staff. after ppp, they basically were no longer distracted by that. so we're seeing them making those calls no longer distracted by ppp and feel very good about our team out there shaking the bushes.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay. great. thanks guys.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of matt olney with stephens. your line is open. please go ahead.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
thanks. good morning guys.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning matt.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
want to start on the fee side and the fees were a little bit higher than the recent run rate. paul, i think you mentioned in prepared remarks, there were a few items and that we should take note of. anything you can detail for us on that.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
really nothing meaningful. they were so small that they didn't merit delineation. what we're really happy with on the fee income line and probably the new addition with respect to a breakout is the great trend we've got going on interchange or debit card and atm card income as it's listed on our financials. we broke that out here for the first time this quarter. really, it's grown from a low base, but we're extremely proud of being able to grow that number 50% year-over-year and the track record we're building there. so all in all, we like the trend that's manifesting itself on the noninterest income side, albeit we still got room to go to make it a more meaningful mix of our revenue profile.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
okay. great. and on the interest-bearing deposit costs, those continue to move quite a bit lower in 2q. any color on how much more room is remaining within that?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
there's more room. i mean, ultimately, you're going to see most of it manifest itself on the cd line, but we've been measured and gradual in working down non-maturity rates. but it is largely growing, a function of the higher rate cds rolling off and really, in this environment, especially with the level of liquidity we have, being highly more disciplined as it relates to how we approach pricing, everything that comes on the balance sheet and walking down any exception rates that have been out there and the overall sheet rates that we've got. so we've got some room to go still, but we're still want to be measured about it. so to not upset the apple cart as it relates to the nature of our deposit base.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
sure. okay. and then last question on operating expenses. paul, i think we came in around $33.5 million, kind of a core number. i think that was pretty much in line with your guidance from last quarter. what are the thoughts from here on operating expenses?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
we're working to hold the line. so that prior guidance kind of still sits there. there's definitely some variability that has the potential to try to ticket ever sit slightly upwards. but we feel pretty decent about that guidance. and ultimately, we're focused on maintaining a growth posture. and in doing so, the goal is to hold the line, but there's -- we're going to be opportunistic about what we can do to position the bank for growth. and we're pleased that at least with some of what's driven that line has been a function of the strong bottom line performance that plays into certain things like profit sharing and zones and stuff like that. so there's definitely things in there that are pushing it up while we're trying to be good about how we manage it overall.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
okay. thanks guys.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
great. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of graham dick with piper sandler. your line is open. please go ahead.
graham dick -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi guys. good morning.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
good morning graham.
graham dick -- piper sandler -- analyst
so obviously, there's been some disruption in m&a arena in texas recently caused by m&a. and this probably only accelerate, i guess, as deals start picking up in the region. but i'm just wondering -- i'm just trying to get a sense of how effective you guys have been in attracting quality lenders over the past quarter and maybe how many you'll try to add each quarter from here as they become available?
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
sure. so the -- so last quarter, we actually -- as far as external hires for lenders, we did not last quarter. first quarter, we hired one. although last quarter, we did have two promotions internally from our lender development program, which is -- we're really proud of that and expect some more of that. but this quarter has actually already started off with a couple of hires. we've onboarded a new lender this month, and we expect one next month. so at one time, we were talking about one producer a month type run rate. it's probably not that. and i think it will be a combination of both external hires, as you mentioned, from maybe some disruption in the market, but also some of our internal promotions from our lender development program in the homegrown category.
graham dick -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. great. that's helpful. and then, i guess, more broadly on m&a, obviously, seen a pullback in bank stocks recently, but i'm just wondering how conversations are going for you guys. and basically, if you think -- i think you might be able to get something over the line over the next 12 to 16 months just depending on seller expectations, i guess.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
we're always out there talking and meeting with the folks locally. we have an interest in looking even a little bit beyond the territory if opportunities arise. so we're active. we've got the capital to accomplish it. and obviously, like you say, the market has kind of pulled back a little bit. but i think our focus has always been and will be -- continue to be with sellers on their day 365 value. and we think we provide a great opportunity for them to gain value over time in joining us. so i think we've got the flexibility and certainly are interested in that right company rightsized. but we're active. we haven't shut that door, let's put it that way.
graham dick -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. great. and then just the last thing for me is, i guess, a quick one here. do you guys have the number for what average ppp loans were in the quarter? just i guess we can get a better idea of what the balance sheet looks like.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
sure thing. it was $604 million.
graham dick -- piper sandler -- analyst
alright. great. thanks guys.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
great. thank you.
operator
our next question is a follow-up question from matt olney with stephens. your line is open. please go ahead.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
thanks guys. just want to circle back on the m&a question. and it seems like the allegiance footprints between houston and beaumont, kind of in that south texas markets. i'm curious how much appetite there is to extend the footprint beyond the south texas markets? thanks.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
it's hard to gauge a degree or level of appetite. there's interest. we're $6.5 billion, the largest player in the market, and you have to look at -- i'm an old manufacturing guy, and i look at it as an inventory issue. there's an inventory of available candidates in this region, and then there's an inventory outside of this region. so i think your options are obviously better if you expand the shelves that you're looking at. and so it's just a simple matter that we want to be consistent and prudent and very careful about any conversation that we have. but i think we're certainly getting there quickly in terms of the scale needed to consider other regions or maybe just nibbling a little bit away, but it's a -- it's a process. let's put it that way. it's just a process for -- and i think there's growing interest and certainly looking at other deals that could advantage the bank.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
okay. that's all from me. thanks guys.
operator
and i'm showing no further questions at this time. and i would like to turn the conference back over to steve retzloff for any further remarks.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
well, once again, really appreciate everybody's interest in the bank. we feel great about where we are. we've got a commitment to perform and create value. so thank you, and we'll speak to you again next quarter.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the allegiance bancshares, inc. second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions].
i would now like to hand the conference over to one of your speakers today, courtney theriot. please go ahead.
courtney theriot -- executive vice president and chief accounting officer
thank you, operator, and thank you to all who have joined our call today. this morning's earnings call will be led by steve retzloff, ceo of the company; ray vitulli, president of the company and ceo of allegiance bank; paul egge, executive vice president and cfo; okan akin, executive vice president and chief risk officer of the company and president of allegiance bank; and shanna kessel, executive vice president and general counsel. before we begin, i need to remind everyone that some of the remarks made today constitute forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended. we intend all such statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the act.
also note that if we give guidance about future results, that guidance is only a reflection of management's beliefs at the time the statement is made, and such beliefs are subject to change. we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law. please see the last page of the text in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at allegiancebank.com for additional information about the risk factors associated with forward-looking statements. we also have provided an investor presentation on our website. although it is not being used as a guide for today's comments, it is available for review at this time. at the conclusion of our remarks, we will open the line and allow time for questions.
i'll now turn the call over to our ceo, steve retzloff.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
thank you, courtney. welcome, everyone, to our conference call, and we really appreciate your attendance. as was highlighted in our press release this morning, the second quarter resulted in another record for net income for the company of $22.9 million or $1.12 per diluted share, which is due in part to our outsized ppp success and continued recognition of the fees associated as we proceed with the ppp for given this process. also, as we continue to closely monitor our core loan relationships and assess economic factors that drive our allowance model, the quarter's earnings also benefited from a release from the allowance for loan losses. we feel great about our tangible book value having increased by 12.7% over the past year, not withstanding $0.44 per share of dividends and with some share repurchases. our service model has proven itself through a high level of customer acquisitions, both due to and separate from the ppp efforts. it has also been recognized through our recently completed customer survey that ray will describe, where the results place allegiance at an absolute top-tier level of customer satisfaction. over the past 12 months, deposits have grown significantly by 15.6%, with the mix of noninterest-bearing deposits ending the second quarter at 36.3%.
in addition, through the second quarter, we are continuing to reflect a steady decline in our cost of funds due to our disciplined approach in the current rate environment. our relationship officers remain focused on growing the bank through competitive loan pricing and terms, extraordinary treasury management services and are experiencing loan pipelines that are prerequisites to continued high volumes of production. we believe our capital, liquidity, asset quality, steady growing brand loyalty and strong culture, provide an excellent posture from which allegiance customers and shareholders will continue to build value. with much of the broader economy, we are glad to see that the houston beaumont region is rebounding well recently with a few notables such as higher oil prices, an excellent housing market and a purchasing managers index now well into positive territory.
while we are clearly pleased to be the largest community bank focused on this region of texas, we do, however, recognize that other texas geographies may present favorable market opportunities for a community bank like ours that possesses a proven ability to effectively serve the independent business owner. finally, allegiance serves all of our stakeholders, which includes active support of many local community initiatives, including financial support and volunteerism at the houston food bank, the formation and fundraising effort for the new banking program at texas southern university, advocator and assistance to disadvantaged youth and affordable housing options for low-income families. these and other initiatives provide compelling evidence of the integral value that our community minded model is able to deliver.
with that, i'll turn it over to ray for a more detailed review of our operational results, followed by paul, who will cover our financial results.

thanks, steve. from time to time, we have shared feedback from our customers describing the extraordinary service that our bankers provide. these stories, whether about the friendliness of our bankers, are going the extra mile to track down a wire or facilitating ppp loans to keep employees working while facing uncertainties with the pandemic, all speak to our culture of service and contribution. as steve mentioned, in an effort to be proactive in listening feedback on customer experience, we recently launched our first ever net promoter score, or nps survey. this score can range from negative 100 to positive 100, and we are extremely pleased to report an nps that has been exceeding 80 since the april launch, placing us in the 100 percentile in the broader banking industry. customer experience drives our ability to retain and attract clients and has certainly contributed to the healthy pipeline that our bankers reported heading into the second quarter that produced a record level of loan originations totaling $379 million.
we continue to take advantage of the market share opportunity that was presented with our outsized ppp success and are now starting to see core loan originations from our new customers. and our onboarding of new treasury management clients has remained steady, further reflecting the growth potential coming from those customers that are new to the bank. we had nice momentum in the back half of the quarter in terms of core loan growth and are as well positioned as ever for originations to remain strong, which is our leading indicator for net loan growth. moving now to our quarterly operating results. total core loans, which excludes ppp loans, ended the second quarter at $3.96 billion, an increase of $30.8 million during the quarter. our staff and lending team booked a previously mentioned $379 million of new core loans that funded to a level of $251 million by june 30 compared to the first quarter when $325 million of new core loans were generated, which funded to a level of $203 million by march 31.
the weighted average interest rate charged on the new second quarter core loans was 4.48% compared to the weighted average rate charged on the new first quarter core loans of 4.61%, and 4.64% in the fourth quarter of 2020. paid off core loans were $238 million in the second quarter compared to $180 million in the first quarter. the $238 million of paid off core loans during the quarter had a weighted average rate of 5.06%. carried core loans experienced advances of $129 million at a weighted average rate of 4.77% and paydowns of $114 million, which were at a weighted average rate of 5.07%. all in, the overall period end weighted average rate charge on our funded core loans decreased seven basis points, ending the quarter at 4.95% compared to 5.02% as of march 31, 2021. over the past few quarters, we have provided information on several loan categories that could have heightened risk due to energy prices in the covid pandemic. those being our oil and gas portfolio, our hotel portfolio and our restaurant and bar portfolio. while we continue to keep a close eye on these categories, we feel it will take more time to see a return to pre code performance in the hotel portfolio.
at june 30, our hotel portfolio totaled $129 million or 2.88% of our funded loans, with a weighted average ltv of 72.4% on the $126 million that's categorized to cre. a 30% stress test on the ltv, plus 6% in marketing expenses would result in a $5 million shortfall in the portfolio. we are seeing some improvement in occupancy and adr, which is welcome news. in aggregate, our asset quality at quarter end remained in a manageable position. nonperforming assets, including both nonaccrual loans and ore, ended the second quarter up from 55 to 58 basis points of total assets. nonaccrual loans increased a net of $1.5 million during the quarter from $35.1 to $36.6 million, primarily due to $7.3 million in additions, partially offset by $2.9 million in payoffs, $1.8 million in payments, $821,000 moved to other real estate, $176,000 in charge-offs and $64,000 in upgrades placed back on accrual. the $7.3 million in additions was comprised of a $4.3 million hospitality property with the additional $3 million increase coming from six relationships, one of which totaled $1.2 million, and the remaining $1.8 million was from five smaller relationships. ore increased to $1.4 million during the quarter compared to $576,000 for the first quarter, primarily due to the addition of an $821,000 retail residential property. our ore is now comprised of two residential properties.
charge-offs for the quarter were minimal at an annualized rate of one basis point. in terms of our broader watch list, our classified loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 4.18% of total loans as of june 30 compared to 3.91% as of march 31. criticized loans increased to 6.05% at june 30 from 5.98% in march 31. specific reserves for individually evaluated loans ended the quarter at 17.2% of total reserves compared to 14% at march 31. on the deposit front, we saw an increase in total deposits in the second quarter by $59 million from the first quarter and up $733 million over the year ago quarter. we continue to see solid growth in noninterest-bearing deposits that contributed to the quarter-to-date increase, primarily the result of new accounts associated with ppp customers as well as higher balances in our carried accounts. with that, our noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposit ratio was 36.3% for june 30 compared to 35.6% from march 31 and 37.3% for the year ago quarter. adding 48,600 jobs in the first six months of the year, the houston area has now recovered 59% of the jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic. the housing market remains strong with record lows in terms of months of supply for single-family homes, while multifamily occupancy has now hit 90%. our bankers are out meeting with customers and prospects, and we were encouraged by our healthy loan pipeline and look forward to carrying the momentum from the second quarter to the remainder of the year.
i now turn it over to our cfo, paul.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, ray. we are proud to report another record quarter of earnings with net income of $22.9 million or $1.12 per diluted share as compared to $18 million or $0.89 per diluted share in the first quarter and $9.9 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020. while these record results were driven in part by a negative provision for credit losses, we are pleased to note that the quarter would still represent a record for us without that negative provision, driven by lower funding costs, ppp related revenue and improved noninterest income and expense loss. accordingly, pre-tax pre-provision income for the second quarter represented a record at $25.3 million as compared to $22.5 million in the first quarter and $22.6 million for the year ago quarter. recall that in the first quarter, we had about $1.5 million in nonrecurring asset write-down expenses due to a branch closure. improved net interest income, again, was a key driver to our pre-tax pre-provision earnings power during the quarter, where we saw an increase of $898,000 or 1.6% to $56.6 million from $55.7 million in the first quarter, primarily due to lower interest expense in the quarter, partially offset by slightly lower revenue recognized on ppp loans.
interest expense decreased by $894,000 during the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. total net fee revenue related to ppp loans recognized into interest income during the second quarter was $6.4 million, a decrease from the $6.9 million in the first quarter. before moving on, i should note that as of quarter end, we had approximately $18 million of net deferred fee income remaining relating to ppp loans after recognizing that $6.4 million of net ppp income into yield during the second quarter and a total of $13.3 million year-to-date. total yield on loans in the first quarter was 5.09% as compared to 5.15% for the first quarter and 5.13% for the year ago quarter. excluding ppp loans and related revenue, yield on loans would have been 5.07% for the second quarter, 5.06% in the first quarter and 5.44% in the year ago quarter. total yield on interest-earning assets was 4.41% for the second quarter, down from 4.67% for the first quarter and 4.87% for the year ago quarter, reflecting a growing earning asset mix that includes a higher proportion of cash and securities as well as significant ppp loan balances within total loans. with respect to interest expense, our cost of interest-bearing liabilities continue to track downwards in the second quarter to 67 basis points from 80 basis points for the first quarter and 119 basis points for the year ago quarter, driven principally by cd repricing.
the overall cost of funds for the second quarter was 44 basis points versus 54 basis points in the first quarter. we expect to see continued improvement in our funding costs going forward, driven by cd repricing and continued optimization. so with the help of lower interest expense in q2 and ppp net fee income recognition, offsetting a significant shift in the composition of our earning assets, our taxable equivalent net interest margin was 4.02% for the quarter as compared to 4.19% in the first quarter and 4.1% in the year ago quarter. excluding ppp loan balances and related revenue, net interest margin would have been 3.88% for the second quarter from 3.95% in the first quarter. going forward, we continue to feel well positioned to maintain a relatively strong core net interest margin through optimizing our funding mix and maintaining discipline on loan pricing. but we do see excess liquidity and the resulting changes to our earning asset composition as a potential drag on nim expectations. noninterest income was up quarter-over-quarter, increasing to $2.3 million for the second quarter from $1.7 million for the first quarter, primarily due to a few small nonrecurring items to the positive and there being no loss on the sale of other real estate as compared to the $176,000 loss on ore taken in the first quarter.
total noninterest expense decreased in the second quarter to $33.6 million compared to $34.9 million in the first quarter. the difference is primarily due to the $1.5 million in nonrecurring asset write-downs we took in the first quarter. thanks in part to an improved expense line, we saw our efficiency ratio for the second quarter decreased to 57.07% compared to the 60.85% from the first quarter and a small increase from the 56.92% for the prior year quarter. all note that the first quarter efficiency ratio would have been 58.29%, if you were to exclude the aforementioned asset write-downs during the quarter. moving on to credit. we recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $2.7 million during the quarter, reflective of improving expectations for credit in our allowance model.
our allowance for credit losses ended the quarter at $49.6 million, representing 111 basis points on total loans and 145 basis points on core or non ppp loans. the bottom line, our second quarter roaa and roatce metrics came to 1.42% and 17.2%, respectively, both again representing all-time highs. quarter end, tangible book value per share was $27.17, which, as steve mentioned, makes for an increase of approximately 12.7% since the year ago quarter, notwithstanding dividends and share repurchases over the last year. entering the second half of 2021, we feel very well positioned to continue to drive franchise and shareholder value. it never gets old to be able to say that we are bigger and better than ever at over $6.5 billion in assets with profitability, capital and liquidity levels at or near all-time half. we look forward to building on the momentum from our tremendous ppp success to continue adding market share at houston's largest community bank.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from david feaster with raymond james. your line is open.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning everybody.
ramon a. vitulli -- president & director
good morning.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
i just wanted to follow up on the origination. its great to hear that you guys are continuing to set new records. i just wanted to get some insights from your perspective into what do you think is driving this. i mean how much is just from the general improvement in the economic backdrop versus the new hires and ppp client acquisition? and just wanted to touch on whether you expect this trend of improving production to continue.
ramon a. vitulli -- president & director
david, to the last part, yes, i expect it to continue. i think whats driving it is the economic conditions in houston are still extremely strong. customers are -- have good sentiment about the future. and we do have all of our entire lending stats out there working on their pipeline and getting that pipeline closed. so were extremely excited about the $454 million that we originated and continue to set records. and when we look at that pipeline going into the fourth quarter, it looks similar to what weve seen in the first two quarters that produced these results.
steven f. retzloff -- chief executive officer & director conference call participants
during 2020, we turned our sights to helping customers through ppp, even in a little bit in early this year. and we knew that was taking a little toll, but we also knew that it would start upticking after we werent distracted by that. and weve seen that happen. these guys are out there really making it work. so were really encouraged by it.
ramon a. vitulli -- president & director
and i would just add, david, on the loan originations from ppp, were still -- thats still an opportunity for us. those customers still are somewhat flush or dealing with whatever they were with why we needed a ppp in the first place. so i think thats just more opportunity. you dont see this record. the record is really -- doesnt have much meaningful originations from the ppp side yet.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
thats great. thats extremely encouraging. and i think i heard it correctly, but it sounds like new loan yields have been pretty stable. i just wanted to get a pulse of the competitive landscape from your standpoint. we hear a lot of competition on pricing, which makes stable new loan yields even more impressive. just curious what youre seeing on the competitive landscape and whether youre starting to see more pressure on structure and standards? or is it mostly on pricing still?
ramon a. vitulli -- president & director
theres still significant competition out there. we were extremely pleased to see a three basis point uptick in this quarters loan originations versus last quarter at four 57. i mean its very strong. thats just a tribute to the work in the field and the kind of value proposition we provide for the customers. if you kind of -- one -- another way to look at it is we saw a little bit -- although payoffs were high, we saw a little bit of the mix of the payoffs thats related to refinance, ticked down just a tad. so thats a little bit of a good -- its just one quarter, but that might be another sign that maybe were seeing a little bit of relief there, but its still -- that being said, its still competitive on the rate side.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. yes. that makes sense. and then cognizant that the margin is an output, not an input, i did just want to touch on some of the puts and takes as we go forward. just as we get more ppp forgiveness and deposit growth and probably see some more securities purchases, do you think we should see some additional compression or just -- could this be the drop as the earning asset mix is set to improve and new loan yields have at least stabilized? i guess just how do you think about some of the puts and takes with the margin as we look forward?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
david, ill take that. really, the largest dynamic thats going to drive the margin story is funded core loan growth. and funded core loan growth, were really doing a darn good job as it relates to what were originating and the rates that were putting on those on the books on for. what we havent had as much control in agency over is the payback story. and its an industrywide phenomenon, but weve been feeling it as much as anyone. all of our great work this quarter showed a little less by way of funded core loan growth than we would have hoped as a byproduct of paydown. so its -- youre right, nim is an output, not an input. and core loan growth and the extent to which core loans represent a larger part of our balance sheet is going to be the largest driver of our nim story. were down to about 59% of total assets being core loans. and if were able to get anywhere close -- any forward progress toward our pre-covid levels of 80% of our assets being core loans, thats when, from a nim and from a core profitability standpoint, well really be cooking with gas. so in the absence of meaningful core loan growth, youre going to see that liquidity build and ultimately cash sitting on the -- at the fed at 15 basis points. or alternatively, our securities at incremental levels of yield without taking meaningful levels of interest rate risk are going to be poultry returns by comparison to that core loan profile.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. thats helpful. thanks everybody.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
all right. thanks, david.
operator
our next question comes from bradley milsaps with piper sandler. your line is open.
bradley milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning guys. i appreciate the commentary around the uptick in production. when i think about allegiance bigger picture, i think high single-digit, low double-digit type of loan growth. obviously, i think we can throw 2020 out the window for reasons everyone knows. but if i look back, you guys really havent achieved that level of growth since maybe the first quarter of 19. ray or steve, i mean, do you feel like youve got the pieces in place to accelerate growth off the levels youre seeing? it just seems things have been sort of stalled out for a bit even covid notwithstanding.
ramon a. vitulli -- president & director
yes. so the -- when we talk about this how we get to the loan growth, it starts with -- i mean it starts with the origination. so where for quarters and quarters, we had talked about a -- real happy with $300 million of core loan originations. i mean we know as an organization as a lending team that, that just has to be a higher number in order to generate core loan growth after you take out paydowns and then the amortization of the portfolio and if we can get some little uptick in our advances and are unfunded. so i think that it still comes back to loan originations, and i think were positioned to get that mid- to high-digit single growth based on just this quarter, and it may take more originations to get there. and thats what were focused on. and we have the team to do it. we have the embedded capacity to do it, and its probably going to be a combination of possibly even having higher originations and as well as seeing some of that unfunded fund, which is just goes straight to the bottom line when our unfunded funds up. and we have about $1 billion in unfunded right now.
steven f. retzloff -- chief executive officer & director conference call participants
and a couple of quarters ago, we mentioned that we would be entertaining maybe slightly larger loan relationships and kind of just were exploring that territory. ray, what was the number in terms of percentage growth? from this year alone, weve...
ramon a. vitulli -- president & director
relationships over our larger relationships are now up about 50% of what we -- this year. so thats helping on both the origination side and...
steven f. retzloff -- chief executive officer & director conference call participants
and its coming off of a pretty small base. so theres a lot of room and a lot of potential for us to kind of move a little bit larger in relationship size or even loan size for that much. and so were working pretty hard on all fronts, and its showing up. we just -- unfortunately, like the rest of the country, were seeing paydowns at this particular point in time.
bradley milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thats helpful. so i mean you guys still would, over the longer term, still think about that kind of high single-digit type growth. it may take a little bit to build up back up to it.
steven f. retzloff -- chief executive officer & director conference call participants
yes. i believe thats a true statement.
bradley milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and paul, you alluded to this a little bit, but your average cash, i think our average liquidity doubled -- almost doubled linked quarter, and then the period in cash was almost $300 million higher than the average. obviously, that represents a lot of loan growth potentially down the road. but in the interim, are you thinking that you are going to hold more of that just at the fed? or do you think you did add the [indecipherable] portfolio fairly significantly this quarter? does that continue? just kind of curious how youre thinking about the cash, knowing that a lot of thats out of your control with how much deposits are coming into the bank.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
absolutely. we have just phenomenal deposit growth. and in addition, we had a lot of ppp forgiveness activity, and that really did fill up our cash levels to really all-time highs. and we have been pretty measured about what we put into the securities portfolio. we dont want to necessarily invest it all at once. and we want to be mindful of the overall interest rate risk dynamics that come as a byproduct of putting securities -- putting cash into securities. in particular, we dont -- cant go too long with too much volume in securities. otherwise, we put ourselves in an interest rate risk position that were not idealizing. so ultimately, its dynamic. we will continue to leg into the securities market. we want were valuing having excess liquidity to fund up our potential $1 billion in unfunded commitments and to support the origination. so right now, we may be testing the adage of whether you can have too much of a good thing by way of liquidity, but it definitely beats the alternative. and we feel like were pretty well positioned from both liquidity and capital standpoint to support growth as well as plenty of financial flexibility without taking...
bradley milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. can you talk about the yields of some of the bonds that youre buying or that you bought in the third quarter?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
the yield story is not super exciting, particularly as it relates to the front end of the curve, and thats why youre seeing dilution in the overall securities yield. i mean its incremental on a weighted average basis. and granted, its thankfully going up now because were seeing some steepness in the yield curve. but on a weighted average basis, when you take into account kind of the barbelling that were doing, were not really putting securities on the books for more than, call it, 60 basis points. thats weighted average whats on the front end and whats on the back end. granted, now that we have a -- and thats because were not putting more duration on our books. we dont want -- if we went and invested $500 million in securities that yielded, call it, 170 basis points, that would have a meaningful impact on our irr profile. so right now, up to this point, weve been staying relatively short in those purchases. thats why youre not necessarily seeing that some of that profitability moved the proverbial needle as much.
bradley milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. great. and then maybe final one for me. i saw professional fees are also doubled the linked quarter, paul. anything there that we should be aware that might reverse out? just kind of wanted to get a sense of kind of what -- kind of where you thought the core sort of expense rate might be.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
definitely expect that to be one-off. so it was -- the run rate would pivot back to your second quarter run rate.
bradley milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thanks guys. appreciate the color.

our next question comes from brady gailey with kbw. your line is open.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
just a follow-up on that expense question. so i mean if it reverts back to 2q levels and professional fees, thatll put you a little under $34 million on a quarterly expense run rate. is that -- that feels like the right number for you guys?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. absent that uptick in professional fees, were actually pretty pleased to be holding the proverbial line on expenses, and thats the intent as we go forward.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay. and the $11 million of ppp fees remaining, do you think you can realize the majority of those in the fourth quarter? or does that happen more over the next like two to three quarters?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
if the fourth quarter take the third quarter, the majority will happen in the fourth quarter, but it is not quite the same. ultimately, this is a customer-initiated workflow. so we dont have control over that. theres so much outside of our control as it relates to the timing of our receipt of that forgiveness. i will say so far, it has slowed down directionally, granted, the third quarter was really a record. so we expect a considerable amount of recognition in the fourth quarter but definitely less and less things were to change materially than our record third quarter. and that would leave some, of course, to go into 2022 as well.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
all right. and then on the m&a front, i mean its been about three years or so since youve announced and closed the post oak deal. anything new on that front? or are you still -- actively youre looking for possible targets?
ramon a. vitulli -- president & director
i would say were still very interested in that prospect. and as we kind of move into 22, its definitely something thats on front of mind. nothing actionable at this point that there is to report today, but there -- its -- from an acquisition perspective, theres candidates out there, and we will look at all of them that come our way.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay. and i know you guys have a while until you really need to worry about it because youre under $7 billion, but $10 billion is there. i mean how do you all think about the impact for durbin for allegiance. is that going to be a notable headwind or more in line with peers?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
for us, its not as big a deal as it is for more retail-oriented banks. now were working hard on increasing our interchange income, and were actually pleased to see our interchange income increase a lot here in the last 12 months. but still relative to most banks, its -- the 40% or so kind of haircut that we would take on interchange income is less than -- is a lower impact for us than it would be for some banks with different business mix. but we feel pretty well positioned from an infrastructure and otherwise standpoint as we kind of look forward toward thresholds like the $10 billion threshold and beyond.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
and where are you guys running on interchange fees on an annual basis roughly right now?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
our most recent quarter is $771,000. that -- interchange is effectively that line on our press release for debit card and atm card income. we actually only started to break out that line last quarter, and were pretty pleased -- on a year-to-date basis, last year, we were at $1.6 million. and year-to-date this year, were close to $2.2 million. so initiatives -- its growing from a small base, but initiatives up to this point have been pretty successful to drive meaningful growth on that line item.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
all right. great. thanks for the color.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from matt olney with stephens. your line is open.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
thanks. good morning guys. paul, you mentioned $1 billion in unfunded commitments. im trying to appreciate how big of a move this is. do you have a comparable number a year ago so we can just appreciate that more?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
youre going to have to make me dig around, but it is significantly higher than in the past.
steven f. retzloff -- chief executive officer & director conference call participants
well, even a big portion of our reserves were driven by that.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
yes. actually, you all havent asked a question on reserves, but we kind of outlined it in the discussion. nearly $1 million of our reserves was driven by an increase in unfunded commitments. so of that $2.3 million, 900 and change was driven by the increase in unfunded commitments.
ramon a. vitulli -- president & director
yes. just to clarify, matt, the -- i think about things as $1 billion unfunded. it was $1 billion at the end of the year. its $1.6 billion today.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
okay. so im sorry, its $1.6 billion today, and it was $1 billion at 12/31 last year. is that right?
ramon a. vitulli -- president & director
thats right. yes.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
got it. okay. and then you also mentioned the provision expense. the $1 million of that was from the unfunded commitment growth. i guess the question is, if originations stay at this elevated level, and it sounds like they could given some of the progress youre making in some of the new hires, is it fair to assume that this provision expense is going to maintain around these third quarter levels, around $2 million for a while?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
the provision is very dynamic. there are so many forces at play. the unfunded is meaningful. but as that funds, theres less of the need for a reserve for unfunded and then, of course, a need for funded. whats very interesting here is of that provisioning -- level of provisioning that we put forth this quarter, only about, id say, $400,000 or so of it is attributable to net funded loan growth, that $900,000 is in the unfunded. so really, so much goes into it, but that gets you down to, call it, $1.3 million in provisioning. now the x factor in our provisioning and in the provisioning of all banks is ultimately what level of qualitative reserves to layer on our cecl model. and up to this point or at least in the third quarter, we elected, due to delta variant and things along those lines, really to not loosen some of those key factors. so there is potential, as it relates to where the economy goes and where sentiment goes, for a lot of things to ultimately drive our reserve levels. and the cecl has the way of -- were getting used to cecl with -- up to this point has the way of introducing a little bit more uncertainty. but the real effect that its going to have on our provisioning levels is going to be a function of paydown. thats the x factor as it relates to funded loan growth. and if that slows down, well probably have greater need to reserve those funded loans, will presumably be increasing.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
okay. yes. now i get it, its a nuanced top of so not easy to have much of an outlook there, but i appreciate the commentary. what about on the stock repurchase plan? i dont think i saw any activity in the third quarter. just remind us what the authorization is and then what the appetite is to become active on that here in the -- more in the near term.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
absolutely. we have one million share authorization and a meaningful appetite to get into the market. but that said, its probably third on our hierarchy of what we want to be using capital for, first and foremost, is growing core loans. and absent once again the wildcard that is payoff, we feel good about our potential to drive funded core loan growth, which is our highest and best use of capital. next is preserving flexibility in what we think is a real meaningful m&a market where scale is of increasing importance. and then third, of course, is the financial engineering and the benefits that we get from kind of capital return strategies such as share repurchases. so it is very high on our minds, and it definitely an option that were very thoughtful around.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
okay. thanks for that and then i guess, going back to the discussion around the core margin, and ill put the liquidity aspect aside for a moment given thats to predict. i think the core loan yields were down about six or seven basis points if i remove ppp and accretion. i think its pretty similar to the decline that we saw on the interest-bearing deposit cost, about seven bps in the third quarter. and it sounds like you expect additional relief there and further benefits of lowering deposit costs. can you talk about just the relation -- the pressure on the core loan yields as it relates to lowering core deposits? do you think those two will continue to be in lockstep for the next few quarters? or do you think there could be -- one would be greater than the other? thanks.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think they ought to be pretty close to lockstep, but there could be more pressure. with deposits, unfortunately, having a lower bound of 0, theres likely to be a little more pressure on the loan side, although we are just over the moon as it relates to the level of pricing that were able to continue to get in tandem with this record originations, notwithstanding the fact that there are a lot of folks who are originating a lot of loans with a three handle and whatnot. so we feel really good about our pricing power. we feel great about our originations. so were just extremely focused on growing that nii line and recognizing nim as an output, especially as this level of liquidity is really just exceeding all expectations.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
okay. all right guys. thats all for me. thanks for your help.

our next question is a follow-up from brad milsaps with piper sandler. your line is open.
bradley milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
hello. thanks for taking the follow-up. paul, just kind of curious, if the fed were to raise rates late next year, early 2023, just kind of curious if you could remind us how you think your loan portfolio and margin might react to, say, a 25 or 50 basis point increase in fed funds.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
we would be thrilled to see a 25 to 50 basis point increase in fed funds. were not as -- we try to stay neutral from an overall irr position, but we are neutral with a lean toward asset sensitivity now, which is actually a little bit new for us. and to see such a meaningful level of what we have in variable rate securities as well as kind of the nature of our loan portfolio start to reprice, we feel like were going to see meaningful improvements in our overall nim profile -- or net interest income profile, i should say, immediately. so we, like the rest of the industry quietly cheer on a measure of higher absolute value interest rates. not sure about what comes with that, but were -- from an interest rate perspective, were positioned well for it. and not as that as sensitive as most, but we look forward to the potential revenue benefits that would come.
bradley milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then just housekeeping. do you have the average balance of ppp loans in the quarter?

operator
good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to the allegiance bancshares third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, courtney theriot, executive vice president and chief accounting officer. please go ahead.
courtney theriot -- senior vice president & manager of financial reporting
thank you, operator, and thank you to all who have joined our call today. this mornings earnings call will be led by steve retzloff, ceo of the company; ray vitulli, president of the company and ceo of allegiance bank; paul egge, executive vice president and cfo; and okan akin, executive vice president and chief risk officer of the company and president of allegiance bank; and shanna kuzdzal, executive vice president and general counsel. before we begin, i need to remind everyone that some of the remarks made today constitute forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended. we intend all such statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the act. also note that if we give guidance about future results, that guidance is only a reflection of managements beliefs at the time the statement is made, and such beliefs are subject to change. we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law. please see the last page of the text in this mornings earnings release, which is available on our website at allegiancebank.com, for additional information about the risk factors associated with forward-looking statements. we also have provided an investor presentation on our website. although it is not being used as a guide for todays comments, it is available for review at this time. at the conclusion of our remarks, we will open the line and allow time for questions. i now turn the call over to our ceo, steve retzloff.
steven f. retzloff -- chief executive officer & director conference call participants
thank you, courtney. welcome, everyone, to our conference call, and we appreciate your attendance. as seen in our press release this morning, allegiance has continued to provide very strong results in the third quarter. net income of $19.1 million or $0.93 per diluted share reflected a continuation of the ppp loan forgiveness cycle and increased investment income as we prudently grew our securities portfolio due to an expanding liquidity position. funded core loans grew slightly during the third quarter, which is the net effect of the funded portion of a very strong new loan production, offset by continued higher-than-historic paid-off loans. ray will provide additional color on the numbers, but i commend the efforts of our entire team for the front-end results, and i believe it reflects our growing brand and market position as the regions premier local community bank of significant scale. our asset quality metrics reflect improvement with minimal charge-offs and an improved coverage ratio of reserves to nonperforming assets.
that said, the houston msa continues to steadily improve with modest job gains in recent months. actually, excluding energy and related sectors, the broader local economy has rebounded from the pandemic, and it pays more representative of national averages. other strong initiatives such as efforts toward energy transition leadership, the port of houston improvement projects, the texas medical center and others remain shining stars for future continued economic diversification and growth. upon announcing the recent headquarters relocation to houston, the ceo of hewlett packard stated, houston is an attractive market for us to recruit and retain talent and a great place to do business. i could not agree with him more. finally, our capital position is strong, and combined with our liquidity, provides us with a great position from which to grow core loans, both in the field. and centrally, we are working to improve productivity to grow and expand our capacity to handle even more growth. with that, ill turn it over to ray for a more detailed review of our operational results, followed by paul, who will cover our financial results.
ramon a. vitulli -- president & director
thanks, steve. our lending staff set another record in the third quarter by originating $454 million in new core loans, surpassing the previous record that was set in the second quarter. 2021 has seen healthy loan pipelines as our bankers continue to both expand relationships and attract new business. and we are very pleased with the closure rate we experienced with our pipeline over the past few quarters and are entering the fourth quarter with good momentum. another area to highlight is our lender hires so far in 2021. through september 30, weve hired three lenders from outside the bank but also saw five promotions from our lender development program. many of our top producers are homegrown, so it is nice to see this healthy mix of both internal and external lender additions. moving now to our quarterly operating results. total core loans, which excludes ppp loans, ended the second quarter at $4 billion, an increase of $37.9 million during the quarter. our staff and lending team booked a previously mentioned $454 million of new core loans that funded to a level of $293 million by september 30 compared to the second quarter when $379 million of new core loans were generated, which funded to a level of $251 million by june 30. the weighted average interest rate charged on the new third quarter core loans was 4.57% compared to the weighted average rate charged on new second quarter core loans of 4.54% and 4.3% in the first quarter of 2021. paid off core loans were $290 million in the third quarter compared to $238 million in the second quarter. the $290 million of paid off core loans during the quarter had a weighted average rate of 5.04%.
carried core loans experienced advances of $141 million at a weighted average rate of 4.55% and paydowns of $113 million, which were at a weighted average rate of 4.98%. all in, the overall period end weighted average rate charge on our funded core loans decreased eight basis points, ending the quarter at 4.87% compared to 4.95% as of june 30, 2021. turning to asset quality. nonperforming assets, including both nonaccrual loans and ore, ended the third quarter down from 58 basis points in the second quarter to 44 basis points of total assets. nonaccrual loans decreased a net of $8.3 million during the quarter from $36.6 million to $28.4 million, primarily due to $9.1 million in payoffs, $1.1 million in payments, $526,000 in charge-offs and $1.7 million in upgrades placed back on accrual, partially offset by $4.1 million in additions. ore of $1.4 million at september 30 is comprised of two residential properties. and charge-offs for the quarter were minimal at an annualized rate of four basis points. in terms of our broader watch list, our classified loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 3.83% of total loans as of september 30 compared to 4.18% as of june 30. criticized loans decreased to 5.37% at september 30 from 6.05% at june 30. specific reserves for individually evaluated loans ended the quarter at 17.5% of total reserves compared to 17.2% at june 30.
we continue to keep a close eye on various loan categories that may have heightened risk due to the pandemic, including our hotel portfolio, where we feel it will take more time for financial performance to see a return to pre-covid levels. at september 30, our hotel portfolio totaled $135 million or 3.38% of our funded loans, with a weighted average ltv of 60.5% on the $120 million thats categorized as cre. a 30% stress test on the ltv plus 6% in marketing expenses would result in a $4 million shortfall on the portfolio. in aggregate, our asset quality at quarter end remained in a manageable position. on the deposit front, we saw an increase in total deposits in the third quarter by $234 million from the second quarter and up $750 million over the year ago quarter. we continue to see solid growth in noninterest-bearing deposits that contributed to the quarter-to-date increase, primarily the result of new accounts associated with ppp customers as well as higher balances in our carried accounts. with that, our noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposit ratio was 36.7% for september 30 compared to 36.3% for june 30 and 36% for the year ago quarter. while we are pleased to see oil prices in the 80s, the houston region continues to diversify as evidenced by a top 10 u.s. finish and the 2021 global innovation index recently published by the world intellectual property organization, with results primarily driven by patent filings and scientific research publications. with the u.s. ranking of seven and global ranking of 16, houston was the highest ranked city in texas.
and the houston purchasing managers index of 59.5 in september marked the 14th straight month of the pmi in excess of 50, which is the threshold to signal economic expansion in the goods-producing sectors. as the largest houston-based community bank that is focused on the houston region, these trends provide opportunity for us to serve more and more businesses, their owners and their employees. i now turn it over to our cfo, paul.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, ray. we are pleased to report another solid quarter of earnings, with net income of $19.1 million or $0.93 per diluted share as compared to $22.9 million or $1.12 per diluted share in the second quarter and $16.2 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020. these results were driven in part by lower funding costs, ppp-related revenue as well as provisioning for credit loss in the third quarter. our pre-tax pre-provision income for the third quarter represented another record at $25.9 million as compared to $25.3 million in the second quarter and $21.2 million for the year ago quarter. recall that in the year ago quarter, we recorded $1.9 million in write-downs on other real estate owned. net interest income once again was a key driver to our pre-tax pre-provision earnings power during the quarter where we saw an increase of $1.6 million or 2.8% to $58.2 million during the third quarter from $56.6 million in the second quarter, primarily due to higher ppp revenue recognized on ppp loans and lower interest expense in the quarter. total net fee revenue related to ppp loans recognized into interest income during the third quarter was $7.4 million, a $953,000 increase from $6.4 million in the second quarter. interest expense decreased by $509,000 during the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. before moving on, i should note that as of quarter end, we had approximately $10.8 million of net deferred fees remaining related to ppp loans after recognizing the $7.3 million of net ppp fee income into yield during the third quarter and a total of $20.7 million year-to-date.
yield on loans in the third quarter was 5.32% as compared to 5.09% for the second quarter and 4.89% for the year ago quarter. excluding ppp loans and related revenue, yield on loans would have been 5% for the third quarter, 5.07% in the second quarter and 5.25% in the year ago quarter. total yield on interest-earning assets was 4.23% for the third quarter, down from 4.41% in the second quarter and 4.58% for the year ago quarter. this trend is primarily reflective of changes in the mix of our growing earning asset base toward a higher proportion of lower-yielding cash and securities. with respect to interest expense, our cost of interest-bearing liabilities continued to track downwards in the third quarter to 61 basis points from 67 basis points in the second quarter and 105 basis points for the year ago quarter driven principally by cd repricing. the overall cost of funds for the third quarter was 39 basis points versus 44 basis points in the second quarter. we expect to see continued improvement in our funding costs going forward driven by cd repricing and continued optimization.
so with the help of ppp -- of increased ppp net fee income recognition and lower interest expense in the third quarter, offsetting a significant shift in the composition of our earning assets, our taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.9% for the quarter as compared to 4.02% in the second quarter and 3.95% in the year ago quarter. excluding ppp loan balances and related revenue, net interest margin would have been 3.57% for the third quarter from 3.88% in the second quarter. notwithstanding structural decreases in our go-forward nim profile due to our average earning asset mix, we are pleased to see net interest income growing nonetheless, thanks to the larger balance sheet. noninterest income was slightly down quarter-over-quarter, decreasing to $2.1 million for the third quarter from $2.3 million for the second quarter due to a mix of factors. we are pleased to see significant year-over-year increases in our interchange in [indecipherable]. total noninterest expense increased in the third quarter to $34.3 million compared to $33.6 million in the second quarter, largely due to professional fees tied to strategic initiatives to improve operating leverage during the quarter, among other things.
aside from the uptick in professional fees, which we consider to be a while, we are pleased to be holding the line on expenses. accordingly, our efficiency ratio for the third quarter decreased slightly to 56.91% compared to the 57.07% from the second quarter and 60.8% for the prior year quarter. moving on to credit. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $2.3 million during the quarter, just under $1 million of the provision related to unfunded commitments. the rest of the provision for loan losses was driven by an increase in loan balances, an increase in reserve related to individually evaluated loans and net charge-offs during the quarter, among other things. i should note that due to uncertainty related to the significant spike in covid cases during the quarter, we elected not to losing qualitative factors in our allowance model at quarter end. so our allowance for credit losses on loans ended the quarter at $50.5 million, representing 118 basis points of total loans and 126 basis points on core or non-ppp loss.
bottom line, our third quarter roaa and roatce metrics came to 1.14% and 13.49%, respectively, both representing solid results. quarter end tangible book value per share was $27.67, making for an increase of approximately 10.8% since the year ago quarter, notwithstanding dividends and some share repurchases over the last year. so as we prepare to close out 2021, we are at over $6.7 billion in assets, with profitability, capital and liquidity levels at or near all-time highs. we look forward to building our momentum as we close out 2021 and move into 2022. i will now turn the call back over to steve.
steven f. retzloff -- chief executive officer & director conference call participants
thanks, paul. with that, i will now turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions.
",2021-Q3,ABTX

operator
thank you so much. (operator instruction). our first question comes from matt olney with stephens. your line is now open.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey thanks, good morning guys.
george martinez -- chief executive officer
good morning, matt.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i want to start on the core margin. the core margin reacted nicely in the fourth quarter with the post oak balance sheet. i think that was pretty close to what you guys talked about previously. so with that being said where do you see this core margin going in 2019?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
core margin in 2019 is going to be 100% a byproduct of how we're able to execute on our loan and deposit growth in the year. if we're able to fully fund our core loan growth with core deposits, we could see our core net interest margin expand to the extent we're less successful in execution, you could see it go the other way or you could see some level of pressure. we're extremely focused on 2019 on two things, deposit growth just as much as prior, but secondarily with the uptick in -- in prime that we've experienced over the last 12 to 18 months, repricing our existing renewing loans on our books as well as new loans at favorable pricing to the bank.
so we think the combination on executing on both of those strategies will serve to mitigate any potential pressure out there relating to margins. but it's a -- each and every day its a function of our execution.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. paul, let me ask it this way. if i were to look at just the legacy allegiance balance sheet in the fourth quarter, any -- any indication how the margin performed in the fourth quarter kind of ex post oak? just trying to get a feel for what the trend was in the fourth quarter.
george martinez -- chief executive officer
hey matt, this is (inaudible) on the loan, so for the whole year just to give you a feel, we originated about $1 billion of new loans and we renewed about $1 billion of loans. that's for the full year and in the fourth quarter on a combined basis. and for the fourth quarter those origination's and renewals were at a rate higher than the third quarter. and then that was higher than the second quarter. so the trajectory is that we picked up a little on the average yield on loans is picked up each quarter in '18 and fourth quarter was a good quarter in that respect. the renewals, those loans renewed at a rate higher than the rate that were coming off of.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
what about on the liability side? i think in the prepared comments there was a remark about the improved funding allowed you guys to pay down some fhlb. did i hear that correctly? and at what point of the quarter did we see that? and what's the view on fhlb borrowings in 2019?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
just for perspective, at this point last year, we were $2.9 billion thereabout bank that had borrowings from the fhlb at $282 million. as we sit today partially as a function of our execution throughout 2018 but also partially as a function of an accretive funding base that was brought on as a function -- as part of the post oak acquisition, we're sitting at $4.65 billion in assets and we're borrowing almost $60 million less from the fhlb, which from a funding mix perspective is accretive. and the core rationale for that is two-fold and it's very much a function of being able to execute on deposit side throughout the year as well as what we brought on as part of the post oak deal. where the goal is to continue to optimize our mix, first and foremost we want to be able to fund our loan growth. but the second and equally prominent goal is to optimize that funding base.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. okay. and then shifting over to the operating expenses, how should we think about those expenses in 2019? remind me of the cost savings you expect from post oak. do we see any of that in the fourth quarter? just help me understand kind of the pace of those cost saves in 2019.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
you would've seen very little in the fourth quarter and you're not going to see that much in the first quarter. and i would say youve actually, you've seen savings in the fourth quarter, it's just that they've been mitigated by transaction expenses and of course the core deposit intangible amortization which kind of came in a little, core deposit intangible came in higher than initially expected and the amortization number came in higher and that mitigates kind of the effect of core cost savings. we had obviously $840,000 of merger related expense. that's more direct. but we also had certain expenses in the fourth quarter that were redundancies.
so if you look at the dp line, we are running through data processing. we are running some redundant systems. most of that goes away in the first quarter, but there actually will be trails later into the year. but where you'll see the operating leverage and relative operating efficiencies really expand to the -- improve to the positive will certainly be the second quarter -- more so the third quarter. first quarter will still have non-recurring expenses relating to the merger. there will be cost savings in the first quarter, which will be mitigated by one-time expenses. and then, we will get into a run rate in the back half of the year that will be reflective of the operating efficiencies that we expect from the transaction.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, thanks guys. i will hop back in the queue.
operator
thank you. our following question comes from brad milsaps with sandler o'neill. your line is now open.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning, brad.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
paul, i was writing quickly during your comments around the accretion numbers. it sounds like if you got about a little over $14 million left in a loan mark and about $1.03 million in the cd mark, can you tell me how the contribution broke down this quarter? and then, what you think the accretion schedule will look like going forward as you look out through 2019?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
so, this quarter, the cd decreased our expenses by $397,000 and the loan mark was around -- the accretion from loan $2.7 million. expectations for 2019 would be on the cd side, approximately $800,000, on the loan side. so that would be a decrease in expense of approximately $800,000 through the year. on the loan side, the approximation would be about $7 million, although that can have some variation as it relates to the behavior of the loan portfolio that we bring in. and then, separately, wasnt part of your question, but cdi, if you think about the run rate on that and expense that came in, higher because the cdi came in higher as the by-product of the interest rate environment and that will hit our non-interest expense base in 2019 to the tune of just under $4 million.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
great, that's helpful. that was my next question. do you think, just to follow on matt's expense kind of line of question, do you think your third quarter run rate expenses would be less than kind of where you were in the fourth quarter of this year, if that's kind of the targeted time or you kind of have the stars aligning so to speak in terms of having the cost savings out or do you think because of investments you're making at the company it would still be higher than kind of this fourth quarter run rate?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
the way i kind of say is it's kind of like taking two steps -- the nie story is kind of like two steps forward, one step back when you get to the point of further off in the year. you'll see in the operating efficiencies, but on the absolute value number, we have and will continue to make incremental investments into the business. if anything, you'll see us targeting hiring incrementally more lenders than the one lender a year pace that we were at before to -- one lender a month, pardon me, pace that we had kind of referenced before to drive current and future growth in the bank. so, we will -- the number, i don't have in front of me right now, but it's -- i think you are going to expect that the nie, the stand-alone nie base of abtx grows and the cost saves will be a function of the pre-deal expense base of post oak going in at an inflationary level.
george martinez -- chief executive officer
and i might add, brad, that the ads of lenders and i'll ask ray to provide the numbers, but when we just talk about the class was 2016, which was the lenders we hired that year, i mean what are they up to now, ray, in terms of production?
ramon a. vitulli -- president & chief operating officer 
yeah, brad. so, the class of 16, that is probably now in future quarters just roll the class of 16 into the -- what we call the legacy. but the whole bank right now is averaging $35 million in loans per lender and class of 16 is at $35.5 million. so, we'll move that into the legacy and then now focus on classes of 17, 18 and 19. the embedded capacity of 17 and 18 classes is right around $340 million if you take where they are now to get to that $35 million of average.
george martinez -- chief executive officer
so, we're excited about the opportunities in -- what i'm trying -- getting at is, that if we can bring on those lenders over the year, that's just going to give us a lot of capacity for the future.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
that's helpful. and ray, maybe just one follow-up. just kind of on-lending in general, now that you have the combined companies together, what's your sense of kind of what the loan growth opportunity is in 2019 in percentage terms?
ramon a. vitulli -- president & chief operating officer
well, we'll see how the percentage turns out, i'd say just on the origination side, which is what we like the leading indicator. we were somewhere around -- we originated $900 million, $950 million in 2018 and that's $220 million a quarter. if you look at the fourth quarter, which was around $350 million, that should be -- it should be similar to that. so 1.5 times what we were doing. we've gone from -- currently from 73 lenders to now 107. so it's right around 1.5 times of what we experienced in 2018 as far as the origination side. we'll see what happens with the waterfall chart to see how our growth ends up, but it'll start with the origination.
george martinez -- chief executive officer 
we're also quite pleased in the fourth quarter that a -- pretty much proportional amount of our new production came from the post oak side, that lending team that we brought over, so they hit the ground running and we're really encouraged by that.
brad milsaps -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
great that's helpful. thank you guys very much.
operator
thank you so much. our follow-on question comes from mike belmes with kbw. your line is now open.
michael belmes -- kbw -- analyst
hey, good morning.
george martinez -- chief executive officer
good morning.
michael belmes -- kbw -- analyst
so just following up on the loan growth question, in the fourth quarter were the level of payoffs paydowns kind of above or below expectations?
george martinez -- chief executive officer
slightly above, but when you take a -- 1.5 times the -- on a combined basis, it may be slightly elevated but nothing unusual as far as the payoffs.
michael belmes -- kbw -- analyst
got you. so it sounds like then you guys have had really impressive organic loan growth this past quarter that it's likely to continue at maybe this same level going forward then?
george martinez -- chief executive officer
we feel confident about what we're doing, yes.
michael belmes -- kbw -- analyst
perfect. and then coming back to the core margin, appreciate the color on accretable yield and whatnot. from interest rate sensitivity position, you guys are still targeting neutral, i'm assuming. so we could kind of expect maybe a flattish plus or minus a couple of basis points depending on funding for the core name right?
george martinez -- chief executive officer
i'd say so. i mean if you're going off the alco interest rate risk modeling which of course is flawed to a degree since it's thinking about solely parallel shifts but thanks in part to the acquired assets, we're actually gone from being slightly liability sensitive, to being slightly asset sensitive on the overall balance sheet. but our target is to remain neutral and really try not to take interest rate risk instead (inaudible) and -- or grow the business to growing loans and deposits.
michael belmes -- kbw -- analyst
perfect and then just one last one from me. on the tax rate, you talked about the shift and kind of your non-taxable securities and loans and whatnot. was the fourth quarter maybe a good run rate to use going forward?
george martinez -- chief executive officer
i'd say so.
michael belmes -- kbw -- analyst
perfect, thanks for taking my question.
george martinez -- chief executive officer
as we continue to grow, just with a lesser focus on tax preferential revenue, you may see a trend -- see our tax rate trend incrementally up as opposed to down, but i think where its at is (inaudible).
michael belmes -- kbw -- analyst
got it, thanks.
operator
thank you. our following question comes from daniel mannix with raymond james. your line is now open.
daniel mannix -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning.
george martinez -- chief executive officer
good morning.
daniel mannix -- raymond james -- analyst
just want to start by going back to deposit. so you talked about fhlb declination recently, you're sitting at about 100% on the loan to deposit ratio. can you talk about what your comfort level is with that ratio as you look forward here into 2019 and beyond? and along those lines, if you are to see some outsized growth on the loan side, talk about how you think about the trade-off between that and accelerating deposit cost to help fund that growth?
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
the way we kind of think about funding our loan growth, if theres organically a little bit of a timing delay when we bring on our lenders wherein they're able to grow loans, generally speaking thats when theyre able to grow their deposit book. and that's where kind of, that's a micro level, we're in on a macro level, we use wholesale funds to help manage that differential. and that's where we tend to have -- that's how and why we have wholesale funds on our balance sheet. so our goal is to only really use the wholesale funding fhlb principally in managing that timing differential that you see play out on a macro level and the extent to which we're using fhlb funding is going to be a byproduct of our success and funding our core loan growth to core deposit. we've got a lot of initiatives in place from treasury management. another standpoint,were getting full relationships from our lending customers, but we are very aware of the reality and the challenge in doing that. so that's where fhlb fundings and other sources of funding play into the mix. greg, you have (inaudible).
george martinez -- chief executive officer
yes, ill just -- i would just add just two things to follow up with paul. one, paul mentioned treasury management. we've gone from a basically a one person team to a five person team in our treasury management sales, which is three treasury management sales and two what we call on-boarding specialists to help collaborate with all the bank offices to generate that non-interest income  or non-interest bearing deposits that we enjoy from our business customers.
the other thing to touch on is just with the combination, steve had mentioned there were some overlap, but those back office that don't have overlap are actually distinct markets that we're now we'll be able to enjoy kind of a cross-sell of deposit growth. for example, we already have customers -- allegiance did not have presence in certainly in sugar land, the woodlands, conroe. so, we're already having customers open up accounts in those offices. we haven't even converted the systems yet. that's a pretty good sign. the -- and conversely with post oak, post oak customers did not have, let's say, out in katy or gulf freeway or clear lake. so as far as the footprint in our deposit opportunity, we're very encouraged by the footprint of the brick and mortar offices.
daniel mannix -- raymond james -- analyst
that's a great color. thank you. wanted to move on to capital mix. according to our math, it looks like it's going to be growing at a pretty nice clip going forward here. can you talk about what the capital priorities are with the buyback in place now, how do you think about potential dividend, looking at that trade-off versus your organic growth and potential m&a opportunities?
george martinez -- chief executive officer
the number one and what we believe is the highest value use of our capital is growing the business. but we are fortunately in a position where our returns on tangible capital are getting quite healthy and we plan on kind of continuing to build on that. so it does create a new level of capital flexibility that we have not necessarily had it in the 11-year history of our high growth bank.
so it does create new conversations around the boardroom. and that's why we're very pleased to have the board -- share repurchase authorization in place, hadn't put it in place in the third quarter before it got popular. and we're very happy to put that into use a little bit here in the fourth quarter.
so that i think it's kind of the first step we like to value and benefit of what that does to provide liquidity to our shareholders. and then otherwise, we're going appreciate our capital flexibility for m&a purposes and the discussion as it relates to a dividend would be a board-level discussion down the road.
daniel mannix -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. just one more if i could. just wanted to end with just your pulse on the competitive landscape in houston over the last, excuse me, couple weeks we've heard a lot of focus on the particular market. so just wanted to again get your pulse on it and understanding if m&a has created any opportunity for you guys to gain market share, potential hiring, any disgruntled lenders out there that you guys have been able to pick up? thank you.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
well i don't know about disgruntled, but we have made -- we made hires in 2018. few of those came from through acquisition where we were able to get the lender and they did not go with the bank that was the purchaser. so those opportunities to continue in 2018. collectively, we interviewed 34 candidates, qualified candidates for lending or deposit gathering position, so that candidate flow is still very good.
it is competitive, but usually once we get or able to get the quality lenders here, the environment here has fostered as we talked about this class of 16. in three years, that class of 16, has already met, basically achieved deposit -- loans and deposit levels that were at the level of the legacy lenders. so, we're encouraged by the candidate flow and what we can do in 2019.
daniel mannix -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. that's it from me. thanks gentlemen.
george martinez -- chief executive officer
all right.
operator
thank you. (operator instructions) we have a following up question from matt olney from stephens. your line is now open.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey thanks for taking the follow up. i just want to go back to credit quality. i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks there were two loans -- legacy loans that i guess drove some of the non-accrual increase. i believe that the size of those loans was a little bit bigger than i was expecting, relative to your traditional sweet spot business loans below $0.5 million.
can you just kind of remind me of the details behind that and were those sba loans you said? just any more details about how you guys got involved in those loans would be appreciated.
george martinez -- chief executive officer
well one thing is, just because the average loan size is in that $300,000 range, we obviously do loans up to the $10 milllion, $12 million size range (inaudible) loan relationships. so obviously there's an entire scale there. so one of them was a hotel loan that we funded the construction on a few years ago and it's just been kind of a little bit slower in getting its occupancy up. it was benefited actually a little bit for a time period due to the harvey experience and where a lot of people stayed in the hotel for a temporary period of time which kind of masked its real organic business base.
and -- but it's growing a little bit and -- it just doesn't have quite the cash flow we would like to see. there was a lot of equity put into it by the borrower and we were comfortable with it in the underwriting, and -- but we've since put it on non-accrual just as really to be cautious about it, and he is current on his payments, but the appraisal which really looks at where the occupancy is today and the rate of acceleration of the occupancy and it came in low and so we just simply put in a reserve for that one.
and the other one is an sba loan. that first one, the hotel is not sba, the second one is.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. and so as far as the provision expense in the fourth quarter, i missed what the comments were on that. was that provision expense as a result of specific allowance on that hotel loan or was the provision expense in fourth quarter more from the growth?
george martinez -- chief executive officer
more from the hotel, i mean it was the $3 million total provision expense in that hotel. we actually increased and put in a reserve for that hotel of $2.4 million. if we had not put that in there it would have been like say 600. so it was large part due to that one hotel loan. and there -- obviously there's a lot of other moving parts in there as well, but net-net, that was a big contributor to it.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
so i guess how should we be thinking about provision expense for loan losses in 2019, give  given that healthy growth that you talked about previously?
george martinez -- chief executive officer
theyve just -- thinking in terms of -- you have your growth, you have your net charge-offs and then you have the purchased loans that come back in through being re-underwritten by the bank as they renew, we will just continue to factor those into our model. obviously, we look at the qualitative factors in the model as well.
but when you get to the end of the quarter and you assessed your portfolio, you take everything into consideration when you do that. so i don't -- there's nothing left to appreciate from what we currently have experienced. so going forward, it would all be strictly from growth and any charge-off rate, and i have no evidence that indicates that would be incremental over what we've experienced historically.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. thanks for the comments.

george martinez -- chief executive officer
thank you, courtney. and we welcome all of you to our fourth quarter earnings call. we could not be more proud of allegiance bank and our employees as we look back on a very successful 2018. it was a transformative year, and one that will serve as the foundation for the bank's continued growth for many years to come.
during 2018, we completed our core technology conversion and announced and closed our merger with post oak bank, both of which expands our opportunity to continue to be houston's premier community bank. we are committed to delivering personalized service to our customers and serving our communities. it is this commitment and that of our dedicated employees who have worked tirelessly to create a partnership that has already produced outstanding results. we're pleased to have received such a positive reaction from our combined customers in response to the merger and look forward to completing the operational integration during the first quarter of 2019.
we are also extremely pleased to report record earnings of $37.3 million, reflecting the continued execution of our growth strategy. with record asset growth of 62.8% and diluted earnings-per-share growth of 80.6%, 2018 was our best year yet. our 2018 results are highlighted by core loan growth, low charge offs and the positive impact of the post oak acquisition which drove our strong performance.
we are particularly proud of the organic core loan growth of $294 million for the year, which is a tremendous accomplishment and is attributable to our experience in highly dedicated lenders along with our committed back office support team of bankers. our charge off experience continues to remain strong as evidenced by net charge offs of only 6 basis points for the year.
our team spirit is tremendous and is confirmed by being a repeat winner of the top workplaces award by the houston chronicle for the ninth consecutive year. the feat only accomplished by 10 companies since the award program began out of 253 companies that participated. we're most excited about our continued growth prospects as we enter 2019, and plan to continue our ongoing hiring efforts.
we are pleased with the further enhancement of our houston footprint with the branch acquisition in sugar land, which we plan to complete next month and the anticipated opening of a de novo bank office on the east side of downtown houston in early 2020. next, steve will describe our results in more detail, followed by paul who will explain some of the numbers behind steve's narrative.
then we will open the call for questions.
steven f. retzloff -- chairman
thanks george. i also welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. i would describe our fourth quarter in one word, energized. this applies not only to our growing enthusiasm and upbeat esprit de corps which now includes our new team members from post oak bank but also to the calculus that is driving our strong core earnings growth. including acquisition accounting adjustments on october 1st, we added $1.16 billion of new core loans from the acquisition. we define our core loans as loans excluding our mortgage warehouse. the combination of the acquired loans with our core loans at september 30th, 2018 had us beginning the fourth quarter with $3.56 billion of core loans including acquisition adjustments.
total core loans ended the quarter at $3.66 billion which produced an increase of $104 million during the quarter, an organic growth rate of 11.7%, which is quite impressive particularly during an early integration of this magnitude. in terms of growth rate, the fourth quarter represents the second best organic growth quarter for 2018.
for the trailing 12 months, core loans grew $1.46 billion or 66.3%, including the acquired loans from post oak. core organic loan growth was a robust $294 million for the year. given a slight decline in our funded mortgage warehouse lines, our 12 month trailing total loan growth was 63.3%, of which 12% was organic. during the fourth quarter, our combined lender team booked $353 million of new loans that funded to a level of $223 million by december 31st. this is a significant increase from the third quarter when $240 million of new loans were generated which funded to a level of $157 million in the third quarter.
notably, paid off loans also increased from $91 million in the third quarter to $166 million in the fourth. the average size of the new organic core loans generated during the fourth quarter was $456,000 committed and $288,000 funded, which reflects our continued focus on the small to medium sized business sector as being central to our super community bank strategy.
the weighted average interest rate charged on our new fourth quarter core loans continued to improve. this quarter the average rate charge was 5.75%, which is an increase of 11 basis points over the third quarter new loans at 5.64%. as previously reported, the weighted average rate for new core loans in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 5.35%. resulting from the new loans, the acquired loans which came with an average rate of 5.26% and the loan mix, the period end weighted average interest rate charge on our portfolio of core loans reflect an upward trend as the quarter end weighted average rate before accrued fees and acquisition accounting increased from 5.32% as of march 31st, 2018 to 5.37% as of june 30th to 5.44% as of september 30th and was now 5.47% as of december 31st, 2018.
also, as of december 31st, only a small portion of our variable rate loans are currently earning at their contractual floors. paul will discuss the resulting portfolio yields and margins in his report. the mix of new loan production based on fourth quarter funding levels was represented by the following four commercial categories; owner occupied commercial real estate 18.3%, non-owner occupied commercial real estate 14.5%, commercial term loans 14.1%, and commercial working capital at 5.2%. these four commercial categories represented 52.1% of the new funded production compared to 61.8% for the third quarter, loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate contributed 20.4% of the new funded core loans, construction and development including land loans contributed 19%, and multi-family contributed 1.8% of the new funded core loans during the quarter.
due primarily to the acquisition, the overall loan mix altered slightly during the quarter with loans secured by residential real estate increasing from 14.1% of total funded loans to 17.5% and the commercial real estate declined from 46.1% to 43.1%. given that post oak had no mortgage warehouse lines or sba loans, these categories declined proportionately by about one-third of their prior levels. other categories adjusted only slightly at the concentrations.
the slide deck posted on our website provides added color regarding our overall mix of loans. the average funded loan size ended the year at $332,000. it is notable that the average size of the acquired loans was in the same range at $312,000. net charge offs experienced during the quarter was once again very low at $219,000 or an annualized rate of 2 basis points. 2018 net charge offs were $1.57 million or 6 basis points.
the bank's quarter-end asset quality position is solid. although non-performing assets increased from 56 basis points of total assets at september 30th to 72 basis points at december 31st, almost all of the increase was limited to precautionary measures taken on two loan relationships which i will describe shortly.
the larger of the two resulted in an impairment reserve of $2.4 million which was the largest contributor to our approximately $3 million provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter. non-accrual loans increased during the quarter from $14.9 million to $32.9 million. the change reflected $5.3 million from the acquired loans and an additional $12.6 million net increase from the existing prior allegiance relationships. two relationships constituted 88% of the dollar, and both have been previously identified as watch list credits. the larger, a prior period impaired loan at approximately $7.6 million is a hotel which although current as to payment performance, has progressed slowly toward occupancy stabilization, and given our disciplined approach to ongoing credit evaluations was recently reappraised. the lower appraisal led to establishing an impairment reserve of approximately $2.4 million, which as i mentioned, was the bulk of the provision for the past quarter. the second is a $3.5 million sba loan for a day care which was unable to open for the fall enrollment this past season. 2019 enrollments are anticipated to lead to improved cash flows for this customer.
the overall loan to value after giving credit to sba guarantees and the established impairment reserves ended the year at 67% for non-accrual loans and 59% for impaired loans. sba loans represented 19% of the non-accrual loans of which the largest loan is about half of that total. we believe the collectability of the unreserved loan amount on our non-accrual loans and other impaired loans as of december 31st remained quite manageable. in terms of our watch list, our classified loans as a percentage of total loans declined slightly, ending at 2.15% at december 31st, compared to 2.26% at september 30th.
criticized loans increased slightly to 2.86% from 2.76% of total loans. despite this overall stability, the specific reserves for the impaired loans increased to 16%, from 11.6% during the quarter due to a large degree to the aforementioned reserve on the hotel loan. total deposits increased in the fourth quarter by $1.23 billion ending december 31st at $3.66 billion. for the past 12 months total deposits increased 65.4% with the acquisition. year-over-year organic deposit growth was 7.5% highlighted by a 13.1% organic increase in non-interest bearing deposits.
as such and with the acquired deposits, the non-interest bearing deposit ratio ended the quarter at 33% compared to 30.9% at december 31, 2017. while wti oil prices have gravitated down since we reported last quarter to the low 50s per barrel recently, allegiance continues to not focus on this sector. post oak had a similar low degree of exposure and like allegiance, had no reserve based lending. we are evaluating the indirect exposure of the acquired loans more closely, but have recognized overall strong credit quality for those identified thus far.
notwithstanding the recent softness in oil prices the economic data for the houston region remains positive. according to the texas workforce commission data the houston msa has gained over 114,000 jobs in the 12-month period ending november 2018. in its recent economic forecast report, the greater houston partnership projected the area will gain 71,000 jobs in 2019 and upwards of 120,000 new residents. for the year 2018, single family homes sales reached a record level of 82,000 homes, up 3.8% from 2017 and ended the year with 3.5 months of inventory. average home prices were up to $240,000, an increase of 3.4% over 2017. the houston area purchasing managers index ended november at 54.9, continuing to indicate expansion. unemployment was 3.8% in november, down from 4.4% a year earlier.
finally, due to a strong residential market, construction appears to remain positive as building permits are up 12% for october 2018 compared to october of 2017. the overall tone with our commercial customers remains positive and the local economic outlook is strong. prior to the merger, allegiance bank had 16 branch locations and post oak had 13. due to its proximity to the largest post oak office, we have already closed one branch merging its production staff with others.
one additional allegiance office closure is scheduled for the first quarter also due to their new nearby location. in addition, our purchase of a sugar land branch from another bank has been approved and is scheduled to close in the first quarter. the existing prior post oak branch in that area will subsequently close. the results of these strategic changes will be 27 branches, improved location prominence and cost efficiencies.
i will close, just as i began with the fact that we are excited and energized to be houston's largest community bank. we continue to manage the bank with extraordinary performance in both the big and impactful things such as quality growth, but also in the small but significant things such as community service and support. the bank was recognized this past quarter as one of our officers mark vasquez received the george bailey distinguished service award from the american bankers association in october for his leadership of our response to hurricane harvey and other local community initiatives.
we thank all of our bankers who have contributed hours and hours of personal time to support these much-needed and ongoing volunteer efforts. with that, i will now turn it over to our cfo, paul.
paul p. egge -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, steve. fourth quarter 2018 net income was $13.2 million or $0.59 per diluted share as compared to third quarter earnings of $8.9 million or $0.65 per diluted share. our fourth quarter results reflect the inclusion of the post oak acquisition, which impacted our results through increased scale, related revenue and expense as well as some acquisition-related items such as acquisition accounting accretion, increased levels of cdi amortization and certain non-interest expenses, related specifically to the integration of the post oak transaction which we will detail later.
fourth quarter 2018 net interest income increased to $45.8 million or 63.5% from $28 million in the third quarter and from $27.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to growth in average earning assets as a result of the post oak transaction and continued organic growth. average interest earnings assets for the fourth quarter increased 50.1% compared to the third quarter and 59.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
within the fourth quarter, acquisition accounting accretion increased loan income by $2.7 million and reduced cd expense by $367,000 for a total positive effect on net interest income of $3.1 million in the quarter. this quarter's accretion leaves $14.2 million in loan mark and $1.3 million in the cd mark.
tax equivalent net interest margin for the fourth quarter with 4.45% compared to 4.10% in the third quarter. adjusting for the acquisition accounting accretion, net interest margin would have been 4.16% for the fourth quarter representing progress from q3's 4.10%. yield on loans in fourth quarter with 5.81% versus 5.49% in the third quarter and 5.34% in the year-ago quarter.
total yield on net interest earning assets was 5.44% for the fourth quarter and 5.12% for the third quarter and 4.93% for the year-ago quarter. adjusting for the acquisition accretion recorded in the fourth quarter, yield on loans and total yield on earning assets would have been 5.51% to 5.18% respectively. so we are seeing progress on core asset yields.
our increased interest income for the quarter was partially offset by the increase in interest expense associated with the increased scale of our funding base as a result of post oak acquisition and overall trends in funding cost. the total costs and interest bearing liabilities was 153 basis points for the fourth and third quarters in 2018 and 100 basis points for the year-ago quarter.
overall cost of funds for the fourth quarter was 106 basis points versus 109 basis points in the third quarter and 73 basis points in the year-ago quarter. excluding acquisition accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter, the total cost of interest bearing liabilities would have been 158 basis points and the total cost of funds would have been 109 basis points.
the composition of our funding and interest expense saw some shift during the quarter due to the post oak acquisition and our continued success growing both our non-interest bearing deposits and interesting bearing deposits which allowed us to decrease our level of fhlb borrowings. non-interest income increased to $2.3 million for the fourth quarter from $1.9 million in third quarter despite losses on the sales of the ore and ora of $429,000 during the quarter.
fourth quarter also represents a very nice pickup from the $1.6 million from the year-ago quarter, again, despite those losses we experienced from the sale of ore and ora. total non-interest expense for the fourth quarter was $29 million compared to $19.2 million in the third quarter and included $840,000 merger-related expenses. the fourth quarter increase was primarily due to additional salaries and benefits that we absorbed, added headcount from post oak, increased occupancy expense as a result of that incremental post oak offices, and an increase of about $1 million in core deposit intangible and amortization.
the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter decreased to 60.30% compared to 63.95% we posted in the third quarter and 66.5% for the prior-year quarter, despite the $840,000 in merger-related expense. excluding these merger-related expenses and earlier core conversion expenses, the efficiency ratio for the third and fourth quarters of 2018 would have been 62.19% and 58.55% respectively.
as steve mentioned, the provision for loan losses was $3 million in the fourth quarter. net charge offs this quarter were $219,000 which makes the year-end net charge offs to total $1.6 million or only 6 basis points on average loan for 2018. the ending allowance at $26.3 million is 71 basis points of total loan. so we mentioned the $14.2 million in loan mark remaining on the acquired loans. if you were to include the loan mark, the ending allowance plus loan mark to total loans is 109 basis points and 111 basis points on core loans, if you were to exclude mortgage warehouse loans.
this compares to 97 basis points of total loans and 99 basis points of core loans at september 30th. our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.6% compared to 17.8% for the third quarter as municipal securities and bolis represent significantly smaller portions of our revenue mix.
bottom line, our fourth quarter produced a return on average assets of 1.12% in return on average tangible equity of 11.66%. we are particularly pleased with the progress in our earnings power on a pre-tax pre-provision basis, as our pre-tax pre-provision roaa during the quarter was 1.63%. and if you were to exclude merger-related expenses, it would have been 1.70%. we believe we are very well-positioned entering into 2019 as a significantly larger and more profitable company than we began 2018.
before passing the call back to george, i should note that during the fourth quarter we made some share repurchases under our board authorized share repurchase program. we repurchased just over 69,000 shares at a weighted price of $30.45 per share during the quarter. i will now turn the call back over to george.
george martinez -- chairman & chief executive officer
