good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the adaptimmune second quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to juli miller, investor relations. please go ahead.
juli miller -- senior director, investor relations
hello, and welcome to adaptimmune's conference call to discuss our second quarter 2021 financial results and business update. please review our forward-looking statements from this afternoon's press release as we anticipate making projections during this call, and actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those outlined in our latest filings with the sec. adrian rawcliffe, our chief executive officer, is with me for the prepared portion of the call. other members of our management team will be available for q&a.
with that, i'll turn the call over to adrian rawcliffe. ad?
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
thanks, juli. and thanks everyone for joining us. so last year we set out our 2-2-5-2 strategy for the next 5 years, and at the beginning of this year, we identified the milestones in 2021 to start to deliver that strategy. from a clinical perspective, these milestones were: one, to present initial data from our pivotal spearhead-1 trial with afami-cel asco with a full data set to follow at ctos. two, present data from our afp trial at ilca.and three, present data from our surpass trial with our next-gen program targeting mage-a4 at esmo. i'm pleased to say that in q2 we delivered on the first of these with excellent afami-cel data at asco. and we are positioned to deliver on the next two in q3 at ilca and esmo as anticipated. i would say a little bit about each of these milestones in turn.
as you can see from the press release, we had a busy q2. in june, we presented initial data from our pivotal spearhead-1 trial at asco. with the disease control rate of approximately 85% and overall response rate of approximately 40% and very encouraging initial durability, these data demonstrate that afami-cel has life-changing potential, for people with synovial sarcoma and mrcls. we plan to update data from this trial at ctos later this year. but we're working hard to file our bla next year and achieve the first element of our 2-2-5-2 strategy to have a product on the market targeting mage-a4. we're preparing for a successful commercial launch working with key industry leaders, agilent for companion diagnostic, miltenyi for our lentiviral vector supply as well as developing our in-house capabilities to support commercial delivery for afami-cel.
for the second and third clinical milestones this year, we are on-track to update in q3 on our afp and surpass programs at ilca and esmo, respectively. at ilca, on september 5, dr. bruno sangro will present data from our afp phase 1 trial. he will present data on 13 patients who've been treated in cohort 3 and expansion, 11 of who have had at least one post-baseline scan. we will issue a full press release around these data and we'll update regarding this program going forward.
at esmo, we'll present an update from the surpass trial with our next-gen program targeting mage-a4. you'll remember that last year we reported data at sitc from 6 patients in the dose escalation cohorts of this trial with two confirmed responses in patients with egj and head and neck cancer, as well as tumor reductions in three other patients with esophageal, ovarian and egj cancers. as i said in the q1 call in may, enrollment in the first half of 2021 in this trial has gone very well. out of the data cut for the esmo presentations, we've treated 25 patients in this trial and 23 of these patients have at least one post-baseline scan, and we are very much looking forward to sharing this data update as planned at esmo. the poster will be available online on september 16. again, we'll issue a full press release and provide an update on the future for the development of this therapy.
a couple of other updates on this program. the surpass trial was initially in a wide range of mage-a4 expressing tumors, but was subsequently amended to recruit in full focus indications, lung, bladder head and neck and gastroesophageal cancers, where we have seen anti-tumor activity and responses with our mage-a4 targeted therapies previously. based on emerging data in several patients with ovarian cancer treated in the surpass trial, we will add ovarian cancer back to the list of focus indications. so going forward, the surpass trial will continue to enroll patients with lung, bladder, head and neck, gastroesophageal and ovarian cancer.
in addition, our surpass-2 trial, which is the phase 2 trial with the next-gen product targeting mage-a4 for patients with esophageal and egj cancers is on-track to initiate as planned in q3. we've designed the protocol to account for the evolving standard-of-care in this setting and identify a patient population that is most likely to benefit from this type of therapy.
we are committed to identify more indications for late phase development with the 2-2-5-2 goal of having an additional mage-a4 marketed product in the next 5 years. our clinical data, our translational learnings as well as our pre-clinical pipeline including our industry-leading allogeneic program move us closer every day to our goal of cell therapy products that are both curative and mainstream.
and with that, i'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from tony butler with roth capital. your line is open.
tony butler -- roth capital partners -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks very much for taking the questions. there are two. one, with two parts. adrian, you mentioned the companion diagnostic development with agilent, and i'm assuming that you're going to see clear validation. so the question is, can you provide some information around the number of patients that you may need to see to provide to the fda? and importantly, will that cause any delay, or do you think it will cause a delay in the bla filing based on spearhead-1? and part b of that question, would you use this particular validated diagnostic in surpass-2 in esophageal cancer and egj?
question two, is around the program that you have with astellas. and i recall that one of the -- i believe it was one of the hit programs astellas had taken if you will, a ownership or joint venture and they have also taken a second program. and i wondered if you could speak to that, and if you don't want to reveal the program, fine, but how far along are the development of both? thank you.
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
thanks, tony. so we have not provided details on the development power-play for the companion diagnostic. i can confirm that there won't be any delay to -- we don't anticipate any delay to the bla file on the basis of that.
could you repeat the question on the surpass-2 trial?
tony butler -- roth capital partners -- analyst
yes. so you are going to use that companion diagnostic in the surpass-2 trial, and therefore, that trial may actually be somewhat delayed in the rolling, even though you said it's going to be in q3? thanks.
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
yeah. so the answer is no, we're not using that diagnostic in that trial and we don't anticipate that, that will be delayed in enrolling. with respect to the astellas collaboration, i'm going to ask helen to comment on the status of those programs.
helen tayton-martin -- chief business officer
thanks, ad. and so, thanks for the question, tony. can i just repeat it back to you. i think you were double checking on the second program. the first one we named mesothelin as a target. so one of our hla-independent or hit tcr, and we are co-developing that one together. the second one is, has been selected, but is not named and won't be named foreseeable. hope i got the question.
tony butler -- roth capital partners -- analyst
it is, helen and thank you. the issue was how far along has that progressed since they have decided to take that program under their wings as well?
helen tayton-martin -- chief business officer
i wouldn't take liberty to say exactly how far it has progressed. but it is moving along the timelines that we anticipated for in selecting the target. so i think early basically, but not that far behind the mesothelin program.
tony butler -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thanks very much.
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
thanks, tony.
operator
our next question comes from marc frahm with cowen and company. your line is open.
marc frahm -- cowen inc. -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on getting all these patients in and ready for presentation. maybe adrian, your comment about adding focus on ovarian within surpass, just to be clear, is that based on -- i think you had a little bit of tumors, yes, some tumor shrinkage in one ovarian patient as of the last update, is it based on that or is it really that you've seen more in additional patients that have happened subsequent to that update?
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
we are going to comment on any of the data that is in the surpass trial pending the esmo data release. i think that question will be much better answered when we can all look at the same amount of data and have that discussion made.
marc frahm -- cowen inc. -- analyst
okay. and maybe you won't answer here, but i think i missed, but can you give us a flavor -- you gave that kind of patient numbers, but can you give a flavor kind of spread of tumors that are going to be in there? and should we be thinking about any of these tumor types starting to get to that high single-digit 10-patient-type of threshold you've historically talked about that useful for kind of establishing proof-of-concept or futility, if that were the case?
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
you're correct. you're going to get the same answer as for the previous question, but i do admire your persistence on this. we haven't guided, and we're not going to guide. i think it's best -- it's only a month away. everybody can look at the data set when we put it out there at esmo. and we can talk about it from an improvement perspective at that point.
marc frahm -- cowen inc. -- analyst
okay. and then maybe turning to the plan bla. you're continuing to enroll a second cohort of patients in spearhead-1. will the filing just have the -- the first cohort that we've already have seen the response rate data, plus the couple of incremental patients or do you expect that filing to have the complete trial, including some of these patients who are enrolled into the second cohort?
elliot norry -- chief medical officer
yeah. hi, marc. it's elliot. the plan is to file the bla based on the data in cohort 1.
marc frahm -- cowen inc. -- analyst
okay. thank you.
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
thanks, marc.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael schmidt with guggenheim. your line is open.
kelsey goodwin -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey, this is kelsey on for michael. i just had two quick ones. could you just provide some color on where you stand with the launch prep and commercial readiness? and then the second one, we saw in the press release that the radiation sub-study was officially closed. maybe just a little bit of color there on why it stopped? and that's it from me. thank you.
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
thanks. thanks, kelsey. i will ask elliot to touch on the radiation sub-study, and helen, do you want to just pick up on where we are with commercial readiness and prep?
helen tayton-martin -- chief business officer
yes, sure, i'll kick off with the answer to that one. i mean, i think we're in reasonably good shape. we've been planning for this for quite some time. we've had internal focus on the key things around market access, marketing, broad commercial planning and now we're beginning to turn our attention to dig deeper and also obviously into the the outward customer facing roles. so as you'd imagine, we are working very closely with kols, etc. and then getting feedback and beginning to sort of map out all kinds of materials, pathways, enrolls on that side. and then i think john could quite easily comment on the prep that's going on for our commercial manufacturing and our operations, kind of operations in place ready for a different level of delivery of products to complement what we do on the clinical side. so yeah, that we'll say more in due course, i'm sure, but at this stage, i think we're pleased with how it's tracking.
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
john, do you want to pick up on the cmc aspects of this?
john lunger -- chief patient supply officer
sure. we've said before that our commercial launch will come out at the same facility here in philadelphia that we've been using for the clinical trials and we have the capacity that we need for that launch. so supply wise we're in good shape and then we're obviously going through all of the activities that we need to prepare for the bla filing, the process characterization work, and those types of things, which is proceeding well.
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
and elliot, do you want to touch on the radiation sub-study?
elliot norry -- chief medical officer
yeah, sure. so we decided to end enrollment in the radiation sub-study, really for multiple reasons. this is a single center sub-study of the phase 1 afami-cel multi-tumor study and really the only part that was remaining open. the study was significantly affected from an enrollment standpoint by the covid pandemic and really presented a very challenging enrollment scenario with the single center and also with expanding into other centers. and when we look back at the trial design as well based on how it had been organized, it was really unlikely to provide sufficient answer is as it relates to differentiating the addition of low dose radiation to cell therapy. so while there is still, i think scientific, promise to the idea of using low dose radiation to improve t cell trafficking and we'll sort of retain the option to reintroduce that at a later time, if it makes sense. this study really did not make good sense for us to continue to enroll. the real focus is for those same tumor types that are expressing mage-a4 to really be put into the cd8 alpha program and continue to enroll surpass.
kelsey goodwin -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. okay. thank you.
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
thanks, kelsey.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jonathan chang with svb leerink. your line is open.
jonathan chang -- svb leerink -- analyst
hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. first question, what do you see as the go, no-go bar for advancing the next-gen mage-a4 program into late-stage development for the different indications beyond the phase 1 surpass study?
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
so maybe i'll take stab of that. and so i think i don't want to get into speculation about individual tumor types. i think we'll let the data speak for itself at esmo. but i think i'd just refer everybody to the discussions that we've had previously about what efficacy in cell therapy in very late stage population, such as those that we're studying in this phase 1 trial would look like. and i think we've consistently said that three out of 10 patients responding with benefit to patients, so 6 months, give or take would probably be the ballpark we're looking to see. now obviously that does vary depending on individual settings and tumor types, but i think we need to understand the data a little bit more before we can discuss that and look forward to doing so from esmo onwards.
jonathan chang -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. and maybe a similar question in the same vein, what do you see as the go, no-go bar for picking a particular indication to be a focus indication in the ongoing surpass study?
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
that one is a bit more-- a bit simpler and that we selected those indications some time ago, the four that we have previously -- and obviously, i'm not going to comment on the rationale behind putting ovarian, and as i commented earlier, we'll talk about that when we get down to esmo, but more generally you might recall that we had analysis of all of the patients that were treated with mage-a4 targeting therapies in both the dose escalation portions of the surpass study and then also the phase 1 trial for afami cel. we recruited a number of non-sarcoma patients, you may recall, and the indications that we selected as focus indications then lung bladder, gastroesophageal and head and neck were indications where we had seen either confirmed responses or very substantial anti-tumor activity in the case of bladder our urothelial cancer. we didn't have any responses there, but we had seen very significant anti-tumor activity and really was a way of focusing down that trial from the sort of 10 indications that it was routinely express mage-a4 down to something a bit more manageable and to try to get to patient numbers where we could make development decisions.
jonathan chang -- svb leerink -- analyst
understood. thanks for taking the questions.
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
thanks, jonathan.
operator
our next question comes from mara goldstein with mizuho. your line is open.
mara goldstein -- mizuho -- analyst
thank you. hey, it's mara goldstein. just two questions...
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
hi, mara.
mara goldstein -- mizuho -- analyst
hey. on surpass-2, you spoke to in your prepared comments about making some modifications to sort of conform to evolving standard-of-care. and i'm wondering if you can just speak to that at this point in time. and then the second is, i'm just curious, we've heard from a couple of companies within the cell therapy space around vector supply constraints. and you also kind of alluded to a little bit around sort of supply management. maybe you could speak to that specifically as it relates to you guys and what you're doing?
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
certainly. thanks, mara. so i'm going to ask elliott to talk about the surpass-2 study and the standard-of-care evolution there, and then i'll ask john to pick up the discussion on our strategy around back to supply.
mara goldstein -- mizuho -- analyst
thank you.
elliot norry -- chief medical officer
yeah, hi, mara. just very briefly, the standard-of-care for really the gastroesophageal cancers has evolved from being chemotherapy approach in first-line followed by pd-1 inhibitor in most scenarios. there are some other drugs that play in, in specific settings, but those drugs are now being used fairly commonly as a combination first-line approach, which does two things. i mean, first of all, it improves the standard-of-care for those patients, but it also opens up the space for second-line therapy in many patients and that the patients don't just receive -- they don't receive first chemotherapy progress then pd-1 inhibitor, then progress, then be open to third-line treatments. they're really compressing those two treatments still into first-line. that being said, there is still tremendous unmet need in this population and that the response rate and duration of response with that combination, although better and an advancement for patients, there is still quite a long way to go to help us really devastating tumor type, the patients with those diseases.
mara goldstein -- mizuho -- analyst
so the modification you'll expect to make will be essentially to move sort of closer to a second-line therapy? is that what i'm understanding?
elliot norry -- chief medical officer
the study does allow for the drug to be used in second line beyond...
mara goldstein -- mizuho -- analyst
okay.
elliot norry -- chief medical officer
behind combination chemotherapy. we've made some other changes with respect to patient selection and whatnot based on what we've learned in the phase 1 program, but that's the most significant change.
mara goldstein -- mizuho -- analyst
okay. all right. thank you.
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
john?
john lunger -- chief patient supply officer
yeah. and on the vector probably, you'd probably recall back in 2017, we made the decision to pursue a vector strategy that had two main elements. one was an external partner that could work with us through commercial and ad mentioned miltenyi earlier, which we've worked with miltenyi for the vector supply for our spearhead trial and other trials. so that's the material that we'll use going into commercial. but secondly, we decided to also develop the internal capability. so we have done that and we're supplying our other trials with material produced internally from our facilities. it's a new cell and gene therapy catapult center in the u.k. so we've kind of executed on the plan to have two sources of vector available to us, one internal and one external.
mara goldstein -- mizuho -- analyst
okay. all right. thanks a lot.
adrian rawcliffe -- chief executive officer
thanks, mara.
operator
thank you. and there are no other questions in the queue, i'd like to turn it back to adrian rawcliffe for closing remarks.

juli p. miller -- senior director of investor relations
good morning, and welcome to adaptimmune's conference call to discuss our third quarter 2021 financial results and business updates. please review our forward-looking statements from this morning's press release as we anticipate making projections during this call, and actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those outlined in our latest filings with the sec. adrian rawcliffe, our chief executive officer, is with me for the prepared portion of this call. other members of our management team will be available for q&a. with that, i'll turn the call over to adrian rawcliffe. ad?
adrian g. rawcliffe -- chief executive officer, principal accounting officer & director
thanks, juli, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. about this time last year, we laid out our 2-2-5-2 strategy. we are now one year into that 5-year strategy, and we've made substantial progress against each of the four pillars we set out then. the first pillar was that we wanted to have two marketed products targeting mage-a4. and the second pillar was to identify further indications with two additional blas for our spear t-cell products. the first product we're targeting for approval is our first-generation tcr t-cell therapy targeting mage-a4, afami-cel. in june, we presented initial data from the spearhead-1 trial at asco, demonstrating that afami-cel is a life-changing therapy for people with synovial sarcoma and mrcls. we remain on track to file our first bla next year for afami-cel, which we anticipate will be the first engineered t-cell therapy on the market for a solid tumor indication. based on the data presented recently at esmo from the surpass trial, we have shown that our next-gen mage-a4-targeted therapy, adp-a2m4cd8, is effective with responses in five different solid tumors, an overall response rate of 36% and an 86% disease control rate. these data confirm the potential of a broader mage-a4 therapy franchise.
in q3, we announced that we initiated the phase ii surpass-2 trial for people with esophageal and egj cancers. today, we announced that we will start a second phase ii trial next year called surpass-3 for patients with ovarian cancer. we continue to enroll patients in the original phase i surpass trial with a focus on rapidly identifying additional indications for late-stage development. on to our third pillar, five new autologous products in the clinic from our extensive preclinical pipeline by 2025. we've reported substantial progress with additional hlas, new targets and next-gen programs, with our most advanced preclinical therapies being the next-generation engineered il-7 til therapy in collaboration with ccit, denmark; and our next-gen mage-a4-targeted therapy incorporating il-7 and ccl19 developed in collaboration with noile-immune. additionally, the translational data we'll present at ctos and sitc next week shows the stellar quality of our translational science teams and how learnings from this research will help us develop better products to take into the clinic. last but not least is our fourth pillar, two allogeneic products in the clinic by 2025. in this morning's press release, we confirmed that we plan to file our first ind in 2023 for our wholly owned allogeneic product targeting mage-a4. in q3, we signed a fantastic strategic collaboration with genentech that has now become effective and for which we will receive the upfront payment of $150 million in q4.
we also announced that we will open a dedicated allogeneic manufacturing facility next year. i believe that our allo platform represents a significant piece of the future of cell therapy for us and our partner. and this progress confirms we are among the leaders in the allogeneic t-cell space. looking forward, we will continue to deliver updates from our trials from a clinical and a translational perspective. following the initial data presented at asco for our pivotal spearhead-1 trial, next week, we will present a full dataset at ctos in the oral presentation delivered by dr. brian van tine from washington university. we will also present a poster highlighting translational scientific insights from this trial. at sitc next week, we'll present data demonstrating the positive impact of adding an akt inhibitor to the expansion phase of our manufacturing process. it's a feature of developing cell therapies that epigenetic modifications during manufacturing have the potential to be as important as the genetic modifications we make to the cells themselves. in this same poster, we will present clinical translational learnings for patients in the surpass trial, for whom we reported clinical data at esmo, indicating that these manufacturing improvements, along with the next-gen enhancements, make an improved and more potent spear t-cell product for people with cancer.
these types of translational learnings are critical as we aim to bring forward further next-gen products and enhancements to better address solid tumors with our cell therapy. when looking across the pipeline of ongoing clinical trials with our 2-2-5-2 goals in mind, we need to pursue our ambitions rapidly and efficiently and critically evaluate what is and is not a product. today, we announced that we've ceased enrollment in our spearhead-2 trial with afami-cel in combination with pembrolizumab. given compelling activities seen with our next-gen adp-a2m4cd8 product across a range of solid tumors, next year, we'll evaluate the combination of a checkpoint inhibitor with this therapy. we will not go into details today, but we'll update in due course about the best design and the path forward. we also announced that we have enrolled a sufficient number of patients in our phase i trial with adp-a2afp for people with liver cancer, leading us to close screening. we presented data at ilca demonstrating that adp-a2afp is an active product with several patients receiving clinical benefits, including a durable complete response, and other patients with prolonged stable disease associated with the significant decrease in serum afp. but the response rate to date is not what we had hoped for.
we'll analyze data from the full patient population in this trial and determine next steps, including evaluation of alternative tcrs, manufacturing improvements and potential next-gen enhancements. so far in 2021, we have delivered clear progress against our 2-2-5-2 strategy, and we will continue to deliver over the next four years. we're on track to file our first bla. we show compelling data from surpass confirming the potential of the mage-a4-targeted franchise. and we're working quickly to pursue further late-stage trials, starting with the recently initiated surpass-2 trial in esophageal and egj cancers and surpass-3 in ovarian cancer, which was initiated in 2022. we are also planning to explore the use of checkpoint inhibitors alongside our next-gen product with the aim of identifying further treatment regimens for our cell therapies for people with cancer.
beyond our current clinical trials, we've continued to make progress with our autologous and allogeneic preclinical pipeline including in collaboration with gsk, astellas and, most recently, genentech. all of our progress this year brings us closer to achieving our vision of being a fully integrated cell therapy company. and you can really see this when you consider that we are filing a bla and preparing for our first commercial product while simultaneously building an allogeneic manufacturing facility for future generations of cell therapies for people with cancer. as we close out the year, i'm pleased with our progress, and we'll provide further guidance for 2022 at the beginning of next year. with that, i'll turn it over for questions. operator?

[operator instructions] and your first question comes from marc frahm with cowen & company.
marc alan frahm -- cowen and company
yes. thanks for taking my question. maybe on the filing, what -- other than obviously the presentation in about a week at ctos what's kind of gating to the filing going in? is it just a little bit more follow-up on a few of the last few patients? or are there still real discussions to be had on things like potency assays and exactly what needs to be included from that front?
adrian g. rawcliffe -- chief executive officer, principal accounting officer & director
elliot, do you want to step up?
elliot norry -- chief medical officer
yes, sure. thank you. just with respect to the bla filing, clearly, there's -- the data still needs to -- is not in its final format and needs to be presented in the appropriate way. the cohort that will support the filing, cohort one from the spearhead-1 trial, has completed. so all the patients are enrolled and data collected, and we'll be finalizing that dataset in the fairly near future. so while that there's still work to be done, i don't think that, that's necessarily gating per se. there is also still work to be done with respect to demonstrating that our manufacturing and release testing are acceptable to the agencies. and that goes side by side with meeting the primary endpoint for efficacy and showing an acceptable safety profile. and while i don't think that there are issues that are insurmountable in either of those, there is still -- in any of those, there's still work to be done. and that work will take us out into 2022. and we're on track to meet the time line to file the bla next year.
marc alan frahm -- cowen and company
great. thanks. that's very helpful. and then maybe i realize you're just opening surpass-2, and surpass-3 hasn't fully opened yet. but just given the increased demand for your trials you've seen over the last six months to a year, you got kind of some broad outlines you can give on how quickly those trials might enroll and when we might be able to start seeing data from some of those kind of expansions into more specific cohorts?
adrian g. rawcliffe -- chief executive officer, principal accounting officer & director
we've not given guidance on timing for that. and we will give guidance on the -- on 2022 milestones and probably beyond at the beginning of next year, but it won't include specific guidance on rates of accrual in those trials. so...
marc alan frahm -- cowen and company
okay. fair enough. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
your next question comes from michael schmidt with guggenheim.
michael werner schmidt -- guggenheim securities
hey guys. good morning. thanks for taking my question. so i think you mentioned that you're initiating a new pembrolizumab combination study with the next-gen mage-a4 asset, which obviously makes sense. but i was just wondering if there are any learnings from the initial trial that can be applied here in terms of the combination moving forward.
elliot norry -- chief medical officer
yes. so michael, thank you. there are certainly learnings. i mean we're -- we should be learning from everything that we do as it informs our next steps. the real reason for us choosing to really change the focus of the combination to the next-gen product is based on really, at this point, having experience with the next-generation products, seeing its improved potency, efficacy and wanting to put sort of the best combination forward. i think that's really the key point here.
michael werner schmidt -- guggenheim securities
okay. got it. and then the other question i had, perhaps related to the prior question, just on cmc for afami-cel. i mean we have seen a number of fda bla delays around manufacturing and cmc of t-cell products. and yes, if you could maybe just provide some additional color in terms of what has to be done to really check the box on cmc for the blas.
john lunger -- chief patient supply officer
yes, this is john lunger. i lead the cmc organization. so a couple of things there. one is we are obviously going through all the activities we need to do to prepare the section three of the bla. the supply of our commercial product will come from the same supply chain that we've used for the phase ii trial, so there's no changes in there, which i think is a big plus for us. we had interactions related to potency assays and all the release assays, frankly. and those are progressing well, and we feel confident that we've got the right assays in place, and we'll have them in place by the time we file the bla next year.
michael werner schmidt -- guggenheim securities
okay. thanks. and then last one, just around the genentech collaboration. obviously, very interesting given their engagement with adaptive as well. but just wondering how we should think about potential news flow coming out of that collaboration over the next one to two years or so.
helen katrina tayton-martin -- co-founder & chief business officer
hi michael, it's helen here, helen tayton-martin. we haven't disclosed specifics on when we'll have a specific update of the program. but clearly, we anticipate that we will need to do that given our position and the importance of this deal with its progress and the fact that it's on a very long-term nature. we really just passed date of our clearance, so i think it's a little early to give guidance on when we will be updating this. we hope that certainly during the course of the next year, we'll be able to sort of map out when we can provide more data and more information.
michael werner schmidt -- guggenheim securities
great. thank you.

your next question is from nick abbott with wells fargo.
nicholas m. abbott -- wells fargo securities
hey good morning. thanks for taking my question. congratulations on a very, very good update, very solid. you mentioned earlier we have cohort one of spearhead-2. and there's also cohort 2. so can you provide any details on how that is enrolling?
adrian g. rawcliffe -- chief executive officer, principal accounting officer & director
elliot, do you want to take that?
elliot norry -- chief medical officer
yes, without providing specific numbers, it continues to enroll well. there's clearly interest in treating patients with afami-cel who have synovial sarcoma. and so that's the answer to the recruitment question. it's not intended to be part of the hypothesis testing for the filing but will be supportive from the standpoint of additional safety and efficacy considerations as well as looking at specific subgroups.
nicholas m. abbott -- wells fargo securities
terrific. thanks elliot. in your prepared comments, you mentioned surpass-3 in ovarian cancer. is the intent -- i mean, have you discussed the size of this trial with fda? is the intention to seek registration if that's positive?
elliot norry -- chief medical officer
i think it's early to push the boat out too far on exactly what the trial looks like and to disclose conversations with fda. we -- i think that, that's the answer. yes, thanks.
nicholas m. abbott -- wells fargo securities
okay. and then just going back to the next set of trials or the next trial with next-gen afami-cel and checkpoint inhibitor, i mean in the prepared comments, that statement is tied to spearhead-2. so i know you're not going to go into details, but is the plan here to test this in a broad range of tumors? or is it more as a replacement of spearhead-2?
elliot norry -- chief medical officer
yes. correct, nick, without going into great details, it will likely be broader than just head and neck cancer. specifically, what tumor types are in the study we haven't discussed, but it is intended to be across tumor types, not just a single tumor type.
nicholas m. abbott -- wells fargo securities
okay. perfect. great. thank you very much.
adrian g. rawcliffe -- chief executive officer, principal accounting officer & director
thanks nick.

your next question comes from soumit roy with jones research.
danielle -- jones research -- analyst
hi. this is danielle [phonetic] on for soumit. i would -- first question would be can you provide at least some color on the spearhead-2 as to -- since you ceased trial, how many patients have been enrolled and when we expect to expect data update.
adrian g. rawcliffe -- chief executive officer, principal accounting officer & director
yes. so i think we have disclosed we have not enrolled any patients in that trial and if we have or we just don't have. and that's one of the reasons why we're closing that now so that we can get on to the more potent product and combinations with the more potent product.
danielle -- jones research -- analyst
got it. and can you provide any color on the surpass-3, and you said that you provide further details. but as you are moving on to ovarian cancer, are you going to focus on platinum resistance or if you can provide any details on that?
adrian g. rawcliffe -- chief executive officer, principal accounting officer & director
yes. elliot, do you want to touch on that?
elliot norry -- chief medical officer
yes. so the -- we haven't really given details with respect to exactly what the patient population will look like. the current trial is enrolling patients who are platinum ineligible. so not -- patients who are eligible to receive another cycle of platinum will typically get that from their physicians before being entered into a clinical trial.
danielle -- jones research -- analyst
thank you very much.

your next question is from mara goldstein with mizuho.
mara goldstein -- mizuho securities usa
great. thanks so much for taking the question. so i just wanted to maybe drill down a little bit into the allo program. and i know you mentioned that you'll have manufacturing up later in 2022. but maybe you could talk a little bit about, if possible, the particular focus. i know the agreement calls for you to look at five different targets. so maybe if you could speak to us a little bit about that, that would be helpful. and then i'm just curious just on the allogeneic program given what we've seen obviously with allogene's program and how you think about that vis-a-vis approaching fda with your ind.
helen katrina tayton-martin -- co-founder & chief business officer
thanks, mara. this is helen tayton-martin again here. just talking to the allo program, obviously, we made reference to building out our allo manufacturing facility. but primarily for the first instance, that will be to support our internal mage-a4 allo program. that will be the first into the clinic and the ind we signaled late 2023. this allo facility will initially be supporting that, but obviously the capabilities in that facility will also support collaboration programs. so i think that was the first question. and i think in terms of focus, there is -- obviously, we have a proprietary differentiation process from our edited stem cells to t cells. that's going through the process of scale -- scaling and gmp transfer. but the work to be done having our own facility will be important as a component of that.
and i think in terms of the characterization work, which is really, i think, where it's relevant to the allogene position, obviously, that's a donor-derived product, as opposed to the stem cell differentiated product. and we -- obviously, it's a great [human allogene, and we know the all-over evaluation] and the interactions with the agency. it will be important not just for us but others in this field to stay close to the patients as possible. i think we're quite -- we have different system around the terms of characterization at every step of the editing process. that's always been important for our approach. and i think that, that also gives perhaps an advantage in some ways in terms of knowing exactly what the characterization in terms of edit has generated in terms of the clone and differentiation process. so obviously, we'll pay a lot of attention, and it will be quite important in our engagements with the fda between now and our ind filing.
mara goldstein -- mizuho securities usa
okay. and if i could just ask a different question, which is that as you're approaching the filing for the synovial sarcoma, how are you planning to layer in a commercial organization as you approach that filing period?
helen katrina tayton-martin -- co-founder & chief business officer
so thanks, mara. helen again here. so in terms of the preparation, as you would imagine, given the [indecipherable] has spearhead-1 trial in progress, we have been laying the groundwork for every dimension of commercial readiness obviously looking a long ways out. that obviously includes the work to prepare and scale in john's organization, and i'm sure he can touch on that, too. but we have also been looking very closely at what kinds of team we need where we need them when we need them, and they've been building accordingly. and there will be more to come on that, i think, as we get closer to the bla filing.
mara goldstein -- mizuho securities usa
alright. well, thank you very much.
operator
and there are no further questions. at this time, i will now turn the call back over to adrian rawcliffe for closing remarks.
adrian g. rawcliffe -- chief executive officer, principal accounting officer & director
so thank you, everybody, for your questions on what has been a very busy quarter, and we look forward to being a very busy next 12 months. it's notable that the questions that you asked covered the broad spectrum of the activities that define adaptimmune from our bla filed all the way through our mid-stage trials and into the earliest parts of our allogeneic platform. and also interesting that there's an increased focus, which i think is representative of the industry focus at this point in time, on the cmc aspects and actually making the product, which i think speaks to the investment that we've made over -- consistently over the last five years as we seek to build an integrated cell therapy company to deliver these potentially transformative therapies to patients. and with that, thank you for your time today, and we look forward to future discussions.
