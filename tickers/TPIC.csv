good afternoon, and welcome to tpi composites' third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to christian edin, investor relations for tpi composites. thank you. you may begin.
christian edin -- investor relations
thank you, operator. i'd like to welcome everyone to tpi composites' third quarter 2020 earnings call. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our website, www.tpicomposites.com. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the comparable gaap financial measures.
with that, let me turn the call over to bill siwek, tpi composites' president and ceo.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
thanks, christian, and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining our call. in addition to christian, i'm joined today by bryan schumaker, our cfo. i'll briefly review our third quarter results and activities, discuss the current operational status of our manufacturing facilities, including our supply chain, give a quick update on our global service and transportation business and then touch on the wind energy market. bryan will then review our financial results in detail, and then we will open up the call for q&a. please turn to slide five. we had a very strong third quarter in which we delivered net sales of just over $474 million, a 23.5% increase over q3 of 2019 and adjusted ebitda of $49.1 million or 10.4% of net sales, notwithstanding the estimated impact of covid-19 on adjusted ebitda during the quarter of approximately $8 million. during the quarter, we announced that we extended two supply agreements with ge, one in newton, iowa through 2021, with an option to extend through 2022; and one in juarez, mexico through 2022. we also announced that we will be adding an additional production line in mexico to provide blades for ge's wind turbine technologies in north america.
we also announced that we signed a multiyear agreement with nordex for two manufacturing lines in our chennai, india facility with a planned start of production in the first quarter of 2021. additionally, we extended our best disagreement in turkey during the quarter. finally, we announced that linda hudson and bavan holloway were appointed to our board of directors. linda is the former president and ceo of bae systems. prior to bae, she held various executive positions with general dynamics, lockheed martin, martin marietta and ford aerospace. linda also sits on the board of directors of bank of america and trane technologies and brings a wealth of global operating experience to our board. bavan is the former vice president of audit at the boeing company. prior to boeing, she worked for kpmg as a partner and another role primarily serving investment services, broker dealer and financial clients. bavan brings broad global finance and additional audit and risk management experience to our board.
we're all very excited that linda and bavan agreed to join the tpi board. please turn to slide six. we remain committed to operating our business safely while working to mitigate the impact of covid-19 and ensuring that we are prepared to deal with the resurgence of the virus we are seeing in many countries around the world. we have and will continue to adapt our operating procedures to enable our associates to work safely and continue to meet the strong demand we see around the globe. we also continue to drive the operational imperatives we outlined at the beginning of the year to reduce costs and improve our operations globally and are making very good progress on these imperatives, notwithstanding the challenges created by covid-19. turning to slide seven. i'll now give you a quick update of our global operations as well as a market update before turning it over to bryan for a financial update. during the third quarter, we operated at or above capacity in all of our facilities for most of the quarter. as you may recall, our plants in mexico were still ramping to full capacity at the end of the second quarter and, since the end of, july have been operating near or above our normal capacity.
in china, we still expect to deliver more volume than our original 2020 plan as production continues uninterrupted. in india, we are moving full speed ahead with the ramp of the facility, and we are preparing to start-up two lines for nordex in early 2021. in turkey, production is at a full pace with, the exception of the transition of lines for vestas to their state-of-the-art v162 blade as part of the extension of that contract. as most of you are probably aware, there was also a 7.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of izmir last friday. all of our associates in turkey are safe, and neither of our plants in izmir suffered any structural damage. production was temporarily shut down while we had structural inspections completed, and we then resumed operations on saturday afternoon. there has also been a resurgence of covid-19 cases in the izmir area, so we are watching that closely to ensure it does not disrupt our operations. as i mentioned earlier, in mexico, we are operating all plants at or above normal capacity while continuing to closely monitor our plants in juarez, given the resurgence of covid in that community. we've also expanded the production of electric vehicle components in mexico to increase our capacity and drive down cost. in the u.s., production has continued uninterrupted.
on the service side of the business, we have made very nice progress over the last couple of quarters, securing new deals with oems as well as with asset owners, and are working hard to build out our global service team to execute our growth strategy. on the clean transportation side of the business, we continued with the production of proterra buses, workhorse delivery vehicles and production parts for an ev automotive platform while continuing to work on a number of confidential development agreements. our focus remains on refining and executing our strategy to build this into a meaningful business over time. with respect to our supply chain, as we mentioned during our last call, the raw material market is now essentially back to pre covid-19 levels, and we don't expect any further supply issues at this time, including balsa's core, barring any disruptions from another significant wave of covid-19. as we've discussed in the past, we will continue to evaluate our supply chain and diversify it geographically to reduce risk, provide for security of key materials and ultimately drive down cost.
as it relates to the wind market, we expect the long-term trend for wind energy to continue to strengthen based on the current cost of wind energy, continued efforts to drive down cost and strengthening of political will around the world to affect climate change. in the u.s., while the production tax credit is set to expire at the end of 2020, utilities are planning for expanded renewables due to the unsubsidized cost competitiveness of wind, commercial and industrial demand and more state renewable portfolio targets, for example, in new york, with targets of 70% by 2030 and 100% by 2040, in california at 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2045. in europe, the support for the european green deal is strengthening. and just last month, the european parliament voted to cut emissions beyond the original target in the european green deal to 60% by 2030 and pause compared to 1990 levels. the european council is expected to make a final decision in december. in september, china announced a commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, and, at the beijing wind show in october, the wind industry pledged to provide more than 50 gigawatts of wind per year in china through 2025 and 60 gigawatts per year thereafter.
in india, prime minister modi has committed to increase its renewable energy capacity to 450 gigawatts by 2030 and has committed to 40% nonfossil fuel energy by 2030 as part of the paris agreement. these are a few examples of the accelerating energy transition we are seeing on a global basis. according to bloombergnef's 2020 new energy outlook climate scenario, to meet a well below two-degree emission scenario, which is the key aim of the paris agreement, over 11 terawatts of onshore and one terawatt of offshore wind would need to be installed by 2050. this represents about three times more than the economic transition scenario or their base case. under the climate scenario, one would represent 45% of global electricity in 2050. back to the economics of wind, according to lazard's levelized cost of energy analysis version 14.0, the unsubsidized levelized cost of energy of the most competitive new wind projects is equal to or lower than the marginal cost of operating existing combined cycle natural gas, nuclear and coal plants. furthermore, utility-scale wind lcoe remains at or below that of utility-scale solar on an unsubsidized basis and, in the best locations, significantly cheaper on a subsidized basis.
utility-scale wind lcoe has been reduced by 71% since 2009 according to lazard, and we and the industry are working hard to continue to drive lcoe down and keep wind as the most cost-effective source of new energy generation. we believe the future for wind energy will continue to strengthen, given some of the recent initiatives and goals to promote the acceleration of an energy transition that i just noted. however, our current long-term goals that we have discussed publicly, including 18 gigawatts of capacity, 20% market share and $2 billion of wind revenue are based on older and more conservative industry forecasts that do not factor in these new initiatives and goals. stay tuned as we will review and update our long-term goals in light of these new initiatives, including the optimization of our global footprint. turning to slide eight. we now have a total potential contract value of up to approximately $5.1 billion through 2024, and the minimum guaranteed volume under our supply agreements is $2.9 billion. this is a net decrease from $5.4 billion and no net change from $2.9 billion from last quarter as a result of extending existing contracts, offset by third quarter sales.
the potential and minimum contract values do not include the two lines in china that we are operating under a short-term contract this year, nor does it include the impact from some of the anticipated, new, larger-blade models that we expect to produce after the anticipated 2021 transitions or additional contract extensions. while the health and safety of our associates remains our primary objective, we remain focused on our operating imperatives, including the integration of our key esg activities to drive profitable growth and long-term shareholder value.
with that, let me turn the call over to bryan.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
thanks, bill. please turn to slide 10. all comparisons made today will be on a year-over-year basis compared to the same period in 2019. for the third quarter ending september 30, 2020, net sales increased by $90.3 million or 23.5% to $474.1 million. net sales of wind blades increased by 27.8% to $450.1 million. the increase was primarily driven by a 20% increase in the number of wind blades produced year-over-year, largely as a result of increased production at our china, mexico, iowa and india facilities. we estimate that our net sales were adversely impacted by approximately $8 million based upon when blade sets, which we had forecasted to produce in the period under noncancelable purchase orders associated with our long-term contracts, but we're unable to do so as a result of covid-19. start-up and transition costs for the quarter decreased by $13.6 million to $8.6 million. our general and administrative expenses for the quarter decreased by $1.3 million to $9.3 million. g&a as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points to 2% of net sales. this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in travel and training costs during the quarter.
before share-based compensation, g&a as a percentage of net sales was 1.5% and 2.3% in q3 of 2020 and 2019, respectively. during the quarter, we were impacted by a realized loss on foreign currency remeasurement of $17.1 million, primarily due to net euro liability exposure against the turkish lira. on a cash flow basis, this exposure is naturally hedged due to our euro-denominated revenue contracts. approximately 15% of our revenue in q3 was denominated in euros. our income tax benefit for the quarter was $32.3 million as compared to an income tax provision of $18.8 million for the same period in 2019. the q3 benefit was in line with our expectations. the q3 benefit offset some of the impact we saw in q2 as a result of applying a forecasted annual effective tax rate to a quarter that was significantly impacted by losses in several jurisdictions due to covid-19. we are forecasting our cash taxes to be approximately $20 million for the year. net income for the quarter was $42.4 million as compared to net loss of $4.6 million in the same period in 2019. this increase was primarily due to the reasons described above.
in addition, we estimate that net income was adversely impacted by approximately $6 million associated with the production volume lost under noncancelable purchase orders due to the reduced production, along with other costs primarily related to the health and safety of our associates and nonproductive labor associated with covid-19. net income per diluted share was $1.13 for the quarter compared to a net loss of $0.13 per share for the same period in 2019. we estimate that adjusted ebitda was negatively impacted by approximately $8 million associated with the production volume lost, along with other costs related to covid-19 that impacted our production facilities. however, even with the impact of covid-19 on our facilities, we were able to achieve a 93% utilization rate. the strong utilization in q3 led us to an adjusted ebitda of $49.1 million and adjusted ebitda margin of 10.4%. this compares to an adjusted ebitda of $27.5 million and an adjusted ebitda margin of 7.2% in the same period in 2019. moving to slide 11.
we ended the quarter with $149.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, total principal amount of debt outstanding of $238.7 million and net debt of $89.3 million compared to net debt of $142.5 million as of the end of q2 2020. for the quarter, we provided $60.9 million of cash from operating activities and free cash flow of $49.5 million. with our strong performance during the quarter and continued focus on our cash conversion cycle, we were able to drive our total net leverage ratio down from 3.1 times in q2 to 2.2 times in q3, as calculated under our senior revolving facility. this created significant cushion on our debt covenants. turning to slide 12. guidance for q4 2020. we are guiding to revenue of between $435 million to $455 million, utilization of approximately 90% and adjusted ebitda of between $36 million and $46 million. these numbers could be impacted by covid-19 due to the rapid evolving nature, magnitude and duration of the covid-19 pandemic, the variety of measures implemented by governments around the world to address its effect and the impact on our manufacturing operations.
although our plants are currently operating at or above planned capacity, many of our manufacturing facilities are operating in regions with continued high levels of reported covid-19 positive cases. as such, we may be required to reinstate temporary production suspensions or volume reductions at our manufacturing facilities to the extent there is a resurgence of covid-19 cases in the region where we operate or there is an outbreak of positive covid-19 cases in any of our manufacturing facilities. to ensure that health and safety of our associates, we will continue to incur approximately $5 million of covid-19 related costs on a quarterly basis until there is better treatments, options or an effective vaccine for covid-19. we plan to provide formal 2021 guidance during our q4 2020 call in february '21.
with that, i will turn it back over to bill to wrap up, and then we'll take your questions. bill?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
thanks, bryan. turning to slide 14. the health and safety of our associates and their families as well as the communities in which they live remain our number one priority. we continue to take the necessary as well as proactive steps on the covid-19 front to ensure the safety of our associates and safe working conditions in our facilities. we continue to work our wind pipeline, and we are pleased that we were able to add more capacity for nordex and ge, extend two existing agreements with ge as well as extending our contract with vestas in turkey. the impact of these additions and extensions was to increase our potential contract value by approximately $950 million. we are also very encouraged by the progress we continue to make in the service space and look forward to this being an increasingly important part of our overall strategy and wind. we are continuing to build on our momentum in the transportation space, and we'll continue to refine our long-term strategy to capitalize on the increased interest, investment and activity in the electric vehicle space.
we continue to remain focused on managing our liquidity to provide financial security and to emerge stronger as we drive through the current environment. our overall mission remains unchanged as of today, establishing 18 gigawatts of global wind blade capacity to drive $2 billion of annual wind revenue, reached $500 million of annual transportation revenue over time and achieve double-digit adjusted ebitda levels. we will continue to optimize our global footprint while using the leverage our global scale provides for operating and supply chain efficiencies to continue to drive down costs, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. as i mentioned earlier, these goals are based on older and more conservative industry forecasts that do not factor in the acceleration of the energy transition.
we will continue to evaluate the global demand and update our long-term targets accordingly to better reflect the opportunity we expect to see in wind long term under this accelerated energy transition movement. i want to thank all of our dedicated tpi associates for their commitment to our mission to decarbonize and electrify. we are confident we will emerge stronger from the current environment, and we remain energized with our multiyear game plan. thank you again for your time today.
and with that, operator, please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of laura sanchez with morgan stanley.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
bill and bryan, can you hear me ok?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
i hear you just fine. thanks, laura.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. congrats on a strong quarter. so i know that chances of a blue sweep are small at the moment, but in the even that biden wins the presidency and his clean energy plan moves forward, can you discuss the implications of a made-in-america requirement? i know it's very early to tell how that would look like, but wondering if you could comment on moving pieces in regards to how quick tpi would be able to accommodate that.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks for the question, laura. i think it's a little bit difficult to answer at this point in time because there's not a lot of detail behind the plan. so he's got the made in america and an offshoring tax as well. so we've looked at what's out there. and it's a little bit early yet to describe what the impact might be, but, again, we have manufacturing capacity here in the u.s. and depending on what that means, it could mean additional capacity over time, depending on demand and what those provisions might ultimately be if they come into fruition. but it's a little early to tell right now what the impact may or may not be.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. and is it fair to say that in next, given the higher volumes, you would expect the implementation of his clean energy agenda to be positive for tpi?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. i think his aspirations are pretty significant, and the decarbonization goals and transmission, infrastructure, investment, etc., would clearly be -- would be very favorable for renewables over the long term, without a doubt.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. and if i may, one last question. looking at your margins, you target 12% ebitda margins or double digit ebitda margin. can you reach that level while in construction of a new facility? or is the 12% dependent on the further -- on the current geographical expansion or footprint?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. no. i mean, we'll continue to drive it down. if you look at the performance of some of our plants as -- i mean, we see that margin at or above that in several of our plants, and we're going to continue to drive that across the board. so it doesn't necessarily mean all of them have to be, and you can't have any start-up, as we continue to drive down costs and look at other things, speeding up transitions and just cutting cost out of start-ups. that's where we see us achieving that 12% margin that we've put out there as a long-term target.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. and if you recall, when we put that target out, we talked about an 80% utilization. so that does anticipate transitions and start-ups while still generating that double digit ebitda. and as bryan has said, we have -- we've gone through transitions in our more mature plants and demonstrated ebitda levels at the plant level well above that. that's why we're confident in that number.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood, and congrats again.

our next question comes from the line of eric stine with craig-hallum.
aaron spychalla -- craig-hallum -- analyst
bill and bryan, aaron spychalla on for eric stine. maybe first on the lost production last quarter. can you just kind of quantify what was made up in the third quarter and what remains to be made up? i see you kind of called out an $8 million impact as well in the third quarter. so can you just kind of square those up for us, please?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. as we're looking at it, i mean, we're looking at the total revenue that's going to be made up, not necessarily the loss production as we spoke about some of the transitions we're getting pushed out to, and not just because of covid for other reasons. and that's how we're looking at, on a total revenue number, making up the lost production or the total revenue amount we forecasted in our original guidance. as far as quantifying the made up,, i mean, we had some impact this quarter. a lot of that had to do with delays and shutdowns in q2 associated with india and just the slowing of the ramp and the delay of that. and now that's getting back on track throughout q3 and into q4.
aaron spychalla -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay. and then on the field services business, can you kind of talk about how that's -- how you're building that there, what the pipeline is looking like and how big that can become over the next couple of years? and any investment that might be needed there?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. so we've made a lot of really nice progress so far on securing arrangements with some of the oems that we build blades for as well as some third parties. we're not going to give specific dollars on it right now. we may give some -- a little bit more specificity when we give 2021 guidance. but suffice it to say that we look at this business as fairly high-growth opportunity, higher-margin business than our traditional blade business. so we expect it to become a fairly significant part of the overall picture over time. we'll try to give you a little bit more specificity when we talk in 2021, but, at this point, just suffice it to say that we're really pleased with the progress we've made and what we've got from a backlog standpoint and pipeline moving into 2021.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of greg lewis with btig.
greg lewis -- btig -- analyst
yes. i guess i wanted to -- you kind of mentioned a little bit on the transportation side the decision to kind of go into mexico. just flipping through the q real quick. it looks like you generated a little bit of revenue in mexico. could you just talk, i guess, at this point about the decision, realizing that it's still early days and you guys building out transportation, the thoughts around the decisions to move into mexico?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. so this -- we had -- we moved some of the -- it's not all of the manufacturing. it's just some of the components that we're manufacturing in mexico. so it still gets assembled in the u.s. but it makes sense because what we do is still pretty labor-intensive. and to the extent we can reduce labor costs, that's a plus for our customer and for our customers' customer, much like in the wind business. so it's not -- the whole operation hasn't moved there. we still have a pretty sizable operation in rhode island that is dealing, quite frankly, with most of our transportation business today. but there are components of it that we moved to mexico for efficiency and cost reasons.
greg lewis -- btig -- analyst
okay, ok. so it wasn't really about just seeing an acceleration in growth. it was more just -- ok, ok. and then...
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
it's a combo -- greg, it's a combination. so it's cost and capacity, right? so it's both.
greg lewis -- btig -- analyst
perfect. yes, good. and then just one other one for me. i mean, you touched on it in your prepared remarks about china's new plan and india's new plan. one of the things that we've started hearing, and maybe it's some hope, maybe it's fear, around potential supply with just supply shortages just if china is able to really push through this -- their kind of ramp in wind. and i'm just kind of curious, maybe it's only been like a month out, so it's kind of hard for you guys to think about what needs to happen now. but just bigger picture, do you think that's a fair statement that kind of -- the industry as a whole, if a country like china and/or india really decides to turn it on, could that create some real strain on the supply of anything from wind blades to whatever else needs to go into wind mills?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. i think if it happened overnight, certainly. it will take a little time to ramp to those levels. so that gives our suppliers the opportunity to ramp their capacities as well. we've talked in the past about diversifying our supply chain, localizing in many respects and really derisking it to any one geography. so i think our plan to do that, which we started a number of years ago, and we will continue to do, will help to alleviate what could be some capacity constraints maybe in china if they get to those levels. but again, there's some -- there will be time for suppliers to ramp. but again, if you look at not just china, but the whole, if you look at where wind could go over time, when you look at some of these new models with the energy transition, our supply chain as well as we are going to have to ramp to be able to meet that demand. so could there be some bottlenecks in the short term when that happens? certainly, but we'll all work to make sure we get through those and make sure that we have adequate suppliers around the globe to meet our demand.
operator
our next question comes from the line of jeff osborne with cowen and company.
jeff osborne -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes. a couple on my end, if you don't mind, bill. one, i was wondering what level of visibility you have into next year as it relates to transitions. that's been sort of the evil that popped up in the past, obviously this year not as many, and you're seeing the fruits of that with the ebitda and the cash flow. but as you look out to next year, i know you're not giving guidance at this point, but do you have any visibility into planned transitions or not at this point?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. certainly, we do. we don't have perfect visibility yet. we're still working with our customers on what their ultimate product plans are really more toward the end of next year and then into 2022. so that's still being worked with our customers. but -- and we're in the process of some transitions right now that really began in the fourth quarter that will move into the early first quarter. so we have reasonable visibility. it's probably anywhere from mid to -- mid-single digits to maybe low double digits is kind of what we're thinking right now. but we'll firm that up when we give guidance with our fourth quarter call, but in that neighborhood.
jeff osborne -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. that's good to hear. pause then two other quick ones. one, you highlighted at the top of the call, the two new folks on the board with aerospace experience. can you talk about what the pipeline is for tpi and aerospace? there's been a lot of focus on evs. but now, with the board additions, i assume you're seeing something.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
no, not necessarily. i mean, we talked a couple of years ago about transportation, aero and wind. we haven't spent a lot of time in the aero side at this point. but really what bavan and linda bring to us is linda's got great global manufacturing experience in global ops, and bavan has obviously been with boeing, has not only the aerospace, but great kind of the financial expertise from a global standpoint and risk management. so it wasn't specifically for the aero, but it was the overall operations and other experiences that they bring to the board.
jeff osborne -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. and then the last question i had was just on the offshore side. is there any activity or thoughts about that space, given everything going on in the east coast of the u.s. and your potential role there?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. that's still obviously something that we're very interested in and in discussions with multiple parties on that. so yes, that's certainly in our longer-term plans. as we talked about before, revenue from those deals are probably not until '23, '24 time frame when you look at kind of what the planning cycle is for a lot of those offshore deals, could come a little quicker than that in apac, but, yes, we're actively engaged in discussions around offshore, and that's certainly in our long-term plans.
operator
our next question comes from the line of joe osha with jmp.
hilary -- jmp -- analyst
this is actually hilary on for joe. i had two for you, both kind of on the transportation side of the business. and first, i was hoping you could kind of speak to building up to that $500 million revenue target you guys have set. just kind of what opportunities do you see out there and kind of the most interesting and timing for that revenue ramp? and then secondly, as you continue to ramp the volume for the ev production, i was just kind of wondering if you could speak to the margins you expect to realize on that piece of the business as you continue to work to driving down costs. and that's all i have for you.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
thanks, hilary. on the overall transportation, i mean, there are a lot of segments that are very interesting. and there's a lot of compelling value propositions for composites in those segments. last-mile delivery, clearly, is a very interesting segment for us. and we think with a lot of the work we've already done and that we're continuing to do, we can drive some pretty unique value propositions there from both an economic standpoint and a total cost of ownership. so upfront economics as well as total cost of ownership, i should say. the class eight space is interesting. you've seen a lot of activity there. we've been working on a development agreement with navistar, and that's gone very well. so there are many other opportunities in that space that we're exploring. and then, of course, you look at the ev automotive space with the production work that we're doing right now.
again, the margins on that, to be determined depending on volumes, but i would expect the margins to be double digits on those, at least initially. but again, it's a little early and building up to kind of the ultimate level of revenue on that. there's just a lot of opportunities that we are working on right now, so that's why we're still confident long term that, that revenue is there. it's just a matter of executing on a couple of the deals we're working on and then getting them into production.
operator
our next question comes from the line of mike webber with webber res.
mike webber -- webber res -- analyst
just want to follow up on, i guess, a couple of topics that came up. i guess, first, around transitions, and maybe just within the context of having moved to more of a -- kind of, i guess, a long-term utilization guide. i'm just curious, can you maybe -- can you put a range or maybe a tighter range around how that -- that long-term guide is at around 80%. how should that trend? or what kind of realistic range should we expect for that over the next couple of quarters, kind of given kind of the movement from some of those transitions? just i know you're not going to -- i know you can't get into too many details. i'm just looking for -- to sort of tighten up the modeling on it a little bit in terms of how to think about what's a realistic floor in ceiling for that over the next couple of quarters.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. so if you look at q4, i mean, we're estimating utilization of around 90% on that quarter. and then going out early next year, i mean, we'll give you more information when we give guidance, but i think that 80% still holds of kind of what we're thinking. when you look at kind of the total transitions and start-up and what we're looking at there as we see it right now and what we've contracted. so i think that model that we gave still holds. i mean, we will see, again, higher utilization here in q4 as we finish up the year, and then from there more to come as we give guidance in early february.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. and if you think about q1, we'll be starting two new lines. we'll be in transition. and when you start-up a line, that kind of really impacts the utilization because we look at that in the denominator, if you will, as a full year of production. so you'll see that impact q1. but bryan was right. it should be in that neighborhood.
mike webber -- webber res -- analyst
yes, the spread definitely got our attention. just trying to tighten it up on our end. so i appreciate that. in terms of -- just to look back on transportation, i know you're just going to talk to the path to $500 million. i'm just curious, has the time frame changed at all from when you guys first started talking about it today in terms of maybe picking up pace and maybe getting there a bit quicker than you would have originally thought just given the acceleration in energy transition.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
no. i don't think the pace -- i mean, there are a lot of opportunities we're looking at, and there's a lot of activity in the market, i think, to build to that. revenue level takes time when you think about how long it takes. the development programs for automotive platforms takes a while. so i don't think our time frame, looking out three to five years has changed, but there are a lot of opportunities out there right now that we're obviously looking at. it's just a matter, like i said, of closing and getting into production, but that does take time.
mike webber -- webber res -- analyst
in terms of the mix of potential customers to get to that level, if you're kind of -- i think you're around 4% or 5% now in terms of, i guess, the scale of the potential customers out there, has that changed? i guess, what that future mix would look like, has that changed at all?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
not significantly. i mean, i think in the past, we've talked at five to 10 customers of $50 million to $100 million a year type run rate, and i think that's still a reasonable benchmark.
mike webber -- webber res -- analyst
got you. okay. just one more. and forgive me, i'm probably going to be backing into a number you've probably spelled out somewhere, and i just missed it, but if i just look at the backlogs you guys referenced on slide eight, it looks like there was -- and this compare year-over-year, it looks like it's about ballpark $300 million that ran off, which is actually well inside of the revenue you guys recognized in the quarter. is there -- did you guys were able to add a handful of long-term contracts in that mix? and if so, can you kind of give a bit of detail around that?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
sure. so we -- the revenue related to the ge contract extension as well as an additional line as well as the two new nordex lines that we talked about at the -- in our second quarter call, the revenue related to those was already -- we had put that in the contract value when we were having the second quarter call. all right. but -- so the only -- the incremental is related to the extension that we did with vestas in turkey.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of phil shen with roth.
donovan schafer -- roth -- analyst
this is donovan schafer on for philip shen. congratulations on a good quarter. okay, good. so my first question is around the q4 guide and the utilization. so it's going to be down sequentially. and i'm wondering, is that mostly just driven by the lower utilization. and then kind of within that is the lower utilization something where you're kind of hedging for -- while there could be some covid disruption? and if everything goes smoothly, you could be up higher at 93% or 95%? or is that really kind of tapped by the transitions you mentioned?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. i think -- so for q4, you have transitions, to your point. so that's going to -- that certainly will impact utilization. and then in q4, you do have some shutdowns toward the end of the quarter as a result of the holidays. so if you think about mexico, the u.s., some of our other sites, so you generally have a little bit lower utilization in the back half of the first -- of the fourth quarter. so that's what's driving it.
donovan schafer -- roth -- analyst
okay. great. that's super helpful. and then on the transportation or just non-blade sales side, i kind of just quickly did some math to figure out what that non-blade revenue is. and i think, last quarter, it was $25 million and then this quarter, it looks like it's down to $16 million. but you save it well on the service side. so is that mostly coming from transportation? did i do kind of a mistake on the math there? could you just talk about that non blade revenue for the quarter?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. for the quarter, the non-blade revenue, when you look at it, i mean, it's comprised of the field services, the transportation and some other smaller amounts of other revenue in there, some of the mold-type revenue. so the decrease quarter-over-quarter, if that's what you're referring to, is the q2 time frame. is that what you're looking at?
donovan schafer -- roth -- analyst
yes, the -- from q2 to this quarter. yes, the quarter-over-quarter decrease.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. so there was a decrease in transportation, but it wasn't necessarily tied to the actual production. it was more of the 606 and some of the items that go through there. so on -- looking at the true work we've done, that hasn't really changed quarter-over-quarter.
donovan schafer -- roth -- analyst
okay. that's great. and then the -- on the -- you mentioned that part of the margin improvement this quarter was from a decrease in the press release. it's a decrease in direct material, in savings and raw material costs. is that just a reduction in general raw material costs? or are you actually kind of providing less of the content in the blade?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
no. the content of a blade doesn't change, unless we're more efficient with what we use and have less waste. so it's a combination of less waste in the production process and just, again, leveraging our scale to drive commodity prices down. so that's a big part of what we're doing with our global scale is driving raw material costs as much as we can. so that's what it is.
donovan schafer -- roth -- analyst
so when you say like a decrease in direct material, is that you're getting more production out of the same amount of materials being purchased with less waste and so forth?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
it could be less waste or it could just be driving the unit cost of the same amount of material, right? because we're getting a better price from our supplier.
operator
our next question comes from the line of ken herbert with canaccord.
ken herbert -- canaccord -- analyst
bill and bryan, i wanted to ask about -- yes. i just wanted to ask about -- from second quarter to third quarter, can you comment specifically on any sort of changes you'd identify in sort of the market opportunity with some of your big customers? and i'm specifically getting at just incremental decisions for maybe more outsourced production at vestas and a few other suppliers. and i'm wondering if there was anything you'd call out that you maybe hit an inflection in the quarter or recently or how you're maybe, more broadly speaking, the nature of conversations with customers around the expansion of the market opportunity.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
no, i think discussions slowed down a little bit at the beginning of -- at the end of the first quarter beginning just because of covid. but those discussions have ramped up, and i think the amount of discussions and the quality of discussions continues to improve. so we're looking at multiple opportunities, working -- continuing to work our pipeline in multiple geographies. so i have not seen -- if anything, and i think this is what you're hinting at, has there been an acceleration of it. i wouldn't necessarily call it a significant acceleration, but there is a lot of activity and a lot of interest on additional geographies, if you will, and additional lines for our existing customers.
ken herbert -- canaccord -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and if i could, just back to the offshore discussion. i know you highlighted this earlier, and it's obviously down the road opportunity, but can you just maybe remind us a couple of the sort of the key parameters or benchmarks in that market you're going to be looking for as to when it might become incrementally more interesting for you and your customers in terms of capacity and more commitments to it?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes, it's really around volume, ken. i mean, there's got to be enough volume for the marketplace. and it's got to be -- we would rather have it be a fairly steady production process, if you will, to build a big facility and run for a year and shut down for a year and run for a year doesn't make sense for us, nor would it make sense for our customers from a cost standpoint. so it's really about the size of the market. so as more deals get closer on the east coast, again, once you get to a critical mass of blades that need to be built, where you can have a productive and efficient facility, that makes sense for us. and it would also make sense for customers, but it's really about volume.
ken herbert -- canaccord -- analyst
and i'm guessing, just on that, it's both here, obviously, on the east coast united states and in northern europe, where this market -- where it seems to have the most potential?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
not sure. i mean, i think, initially, some of the early offshore wind farms will likely be supplied from the -- from northern europe. but i think, over time, given the size that everybody expects the u.s. offshore market to be as well as the desire for jobs and economic activity on the east coast, i think there's going to be a fair amount of incentive, both economic and otherwise, to actually have those facilities be in the u.s. or near the u.s. so i think, again -- and that's a volume issue. so with lower volume, it makes sense to bring them from an existing plant in northern europe once the volumes get to where we believe that market goes, and it makes sense to localize that manufacturing capacity.

operator
good afternoon, and welcome to tpi composites' fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded, and we have allocated one hour for prepared remarks and q&a.
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to christian edin, investor relations for tpi composites. thank you. you may begin.
christian edin -- investor relations
thank you, operator. i'd like to welcome everyone to tpi composites' fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward look statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call or in our annual report on form 10-k filed with the securities and exchange commission, or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our website, tpicomposites.com. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the comparable gaap financial measures.
with that, let me turn the call over to bill siwek, tpi composites' president and ceo.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, christian, and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining our call. in addition to christian, i'm joined today by bryan schumaker, our cfo. i'll briefly review our full year results and activities, discuss the current operational status of our manufacturing facilities, including our supply chain, give an update on our global service and transportation businesses, and then a quick update on the wind energy market. bryan will then review our quarterly and full year financial results in detail, our 2021 guidance. and then we will open up the call for q&a.
please turn to slide five. we finished 2020 strong with 27% growth in adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter, while expanding this margin by 120 basis points year-over-year to 8.8%. for the full year 2020 with the backdrop of a difficult operating environment due to covid-19, we achieved double-digit revenue and adjusted ebitda growth. we delivered net sales of $1.67 billion, a 16.3% increase over 2019, and adjusted ebitda of $94.5 million or 5.7% of net sales, notwithstanding the estimated impact of covid-19 on adjusted ebitda during the year of just over $60 million. these results speak to our business model and our team's ability to adapt and stay nimble in a dynamic macro landscape. we delivered approximately 12 gigawatts of wind blades during 2020. we started wind blade production in india for vestas and added nordex as a customer in india as well with production starting for them this quarter. we extended contracts with ge and vestas, and in the fourth quarter we extended a contract with nordex in turkey. we continued to make progress in transportation, including hitting key milestones under the super truck two program with navistar, production of commercial delivery vehicles for workhorse. and we're now producing components for multiple passenger ev platforms under technology development and pilot production arrangements.
we continue to refresh our board of directors by adding global operations and finance experience, independence and diversity. we published our first esg report last march and plan to publish our second annual report this march. we remain committed to operating our business safely while continuing to mitigate the impacts of covid-19 and ensuring that we are prepared to deal with the resurgence of the virus in any of our global locations. we have and we'll continue to adapt our operating procedures in order to enable our associates to work safely and continue to meet our customers' demands. we also continue to drive the operational imperatives we outlined in 2020 and recommitted to in 2021 to reduce cost and improve our operations globally. we are making very good progress on these imperatives, notwithstanding the challenges created by covid-19.
turning to slide six. i'll now give you a quick update of our global operations as well as a market update. during the fourth quarter, we continued to operate all of our facilities at normal levels. in china, we delivered more volume than our original 2020 plan, demonstrating what an outstanding group of associates we have there. however, at the start of 2021, five lines were removed from production, and we expect the remaining lines will run at lower utilization during 2021, and therefore our volumes will be down year-over-year in china. we will continue to explore opportunities for that capacity, including chinese oems, but the shifting of capacity from geography to geography over time is consistent with our strategy to manage risk and optimize our footprint to enable the highest utilization and competitive advantage for tpi and our customers.
in india, we ramped up the first four lines of the facility for vestas, and we are starting production on two lines for nordex as we speak. the vestas ramp went remarkably well, even though we were in the middle of a pandemic. in turkey, production continued as normal, while we started the transition of three lines during the fourth quarter. that transition is continuing into the first quarter of 2021. in mexico, production also continued at normal levels. we are currently in the midst of a transition of two lines in matamoros as well as one line in juarez. and we plan on having as many as seven more lines in transition in mexico during 2021. in the u.s., blade and transportation production has continued uninterrupted. on the service side of the business, we made very nice progress in 2020, securing new deals with oems as well as asset owners, and are working hard to build out our global service team to execute our growth strategy in 2021 and beyond. to accelerate our growth and to deal with the shortage of qualified technicians, we opened a new training center in santa teresa, new mexico to increase our training capabilities and support our rapidly growing need for qualified blade service technicians. we are also continuing to evaluate blade recycling options and look forward to being able to share more on this effort during 2021 as some significant progress was made during 2020. the global transportation industry is working to rapidly increase the electrification of vehicles to reduce the impact on the environment.
according to bloombergnef, electric bus sales are anticipated to grow almost threefold in the u.s. from 2021 to 2025. the sales of commercial electric vehicles are expected to grow into the hundreds of thousands by 2030 as e-commerce continues to rapidly rise and consumers are driving demand higher for passenger electric vehicles. we expect there will be an increased demand for composite components and structures for electric vehicles, as composite material systems can be the key material building blocks for purpose-built vehicles. our composite solutions are ideally suited for transportation applications because of the benefits resulting from weight reduction and therefore extended range for evs, corrosion resistance, strength, durability, the ability to scale production with lower upfront production investment, and lower total cost of ownership for end users. the level of interest in our capabilities continues to grow. we are collaborating with our customers to develop innovative composite solutions for vehicles across passenger automotive, bus, truck and delivery vehicles.
today, we are building composite bodies for buses and delivery vehicles, collaborating on class eight vehicle programs and manufacturing components for multiple passenger ev platforms. since 2018, we have invested approximately $50 million in our transportation business, and we expect to invest upwards of $20 million more in 2021 to continue to build our team, technology and infrastructure to capitalize on the accelerating ev and lightweighting trends. with respect to our supply chain, we did not experience any significant supply issues during the fourth quarter.
we continue to monitor the material markets closely. there are still some logistics challenges. for example, there is congestion at los angeles area ports that we're working through, but nothing that has materially impacted our production thus far. we will continue to diversify our supply chain geographically to reduce risk, provide for security of key materials, and drive down cost.
turning to slide seven. we expect the long-term trend for wind energy to continue to strengthen based on the current cost of wind energy, continued efforts to drive down cost, and strengthening of political will around the world to decarbonize and reverse climate change. since our last call, the production tax credit in the u.s. was extended through the end of 2021. and we believe that the tone the biden administration is setting on climate change bodes very well for renewables over the coming years. in the last month for example, president biden committed to rejoin the paris climate agreement, announced up to $100 million in funding for transformative clean energy technology research and development via the advanced research projects agency, and announced several executive orders to promote renewable energy. a climate task force was created to set in motion a governmentwide action plan for reducing emissions, directing all federal agencies to consider climate in their decision-making, driving federal procurement to renewable energy, targeting federal lands and water for clean energy development, and accelerating the permitting of clean energy and transmission projects.
as you can see on slide seven, wood mackenzie's onshore and offshore forecast continued to strengthen both globally and in the u.s. in addition, we have layered in two scenarios to illustrate the potential of the accelerating energy transition. on the global chart, bloombergnef's climate scenario shows what global wind installations would collectively need to be to meet a well below 2-degree scenario. as you can see, it's substantial. on the u.s. chart, these are the wind installations needed to enable the u.s. to reach 50% renewable electricity by 2030. this scenario, created by wood mackenzie and the american clean power association, demonstrates how the u.s. wind market can strengthen over time and be a critical factor in reducing u.s. emissions and creating a stronger economy. one of the key findings from the wood mac and acp work is that administrative actions alone can potentially double renewable energy penetration within the next decade with transmission-focused policies to unlock renewables' potential. while it is still the early days in the biden administration, this scenario shows the strong growth potential of the u.s. wind market over the coming years.
in europe, the support for the european green deal is strengthening. and european leaders are working to finalize the strengthened plan to cut emissions beyond the original target in the european green deal to 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. we believe recent global initiatives to promote wind and renewable energy elsewhere will also fuel long-term renewables growth, including the announcement of net zero targets from china in 2060, japan, south korea and canada all 2050; and of course power to the x for the creation of synthetic fuels for use in heating, transportation and power generation by producing green hydrogen through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy.
these are a few examples of the accelerating energy transition we are seeing on a global basis, with additional drivers included on slide eight. we believe the future for wind energy will continue to strengthen, given the initiatives and goals to promote the acceleration of the energy transition. our long-term goals that we have discussed publicly, including 18 gigawatts capacity, 20% market share and $2 billion of wind revenue have not yet been updated to reflect the potential impact of the acceleration of the energy transition. as we discussed on the last call, we are working with our customers, developers, utilities, and asset owners to estimate the magnitude and timing of demand, both on and offshore, to make sure we are aligned geographically with the capacity of each of our customers' needs over the next decade. while we are not ready to present updated numbers today, we believe the long-term opportunity for us in wind is significant, and we will update our targets when we have better clarity.
finally, while the health and safety of our associates remains our primary objective, we remain focused on our operating imperatives and our esg activities to drive profitable growth and long-term shareholder value.
with that, let me turn the call over to bryan.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
thanks, bill. please turn to slide 11. all comparisons made today will be on a year-over-year basis compared to the same period in 2019. for the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2020, net sales increased by $43.5 million or 10.3% to $465.6 million. net sales of wind blades increased by 12% to $445.5 million. this was primarily driven by an 8% increase in average selling price per set due to the mix of wind blades produced and a 4% increase in the number of wind blades produced year-over-year. start-up and transition costs for the quarter increased by $8.2 million to $13.1 million as we continued to ramp up our india facility and transition lines to bigger blades in turkey and mexico. our general and administrative expenses for the quarter decreased by $4.30 million to $7.8 million. g&a as a percentage of net sales decreased 120 basis points to 1.7% of net sales. this decrease was primarily related to the decrease in travel and training costs due to covid-19 during the quarter.
before share-based compensation, g&a as a percentage of net sales was 1.4% and 2.6% in q4 2020 and 2019 respectively. during the quarter, we incurred $3.7 million of restructuring charges associated with the reduction of five lines under contract in our defunct china facility. net income for the quarter was $5.2 million as compared to a net loss of $0.9 million in the same period in 2019. this increase was primarily due to the reasons previously described.
in addition, we estimate that net income was adversely impacted by approximately $5 million associated with the production volume lost under noncancelable purchase orders due to the reduced production, along with other costs primarily related to the health and safety of our associates and nonproductive labor associated with covid-19. net income per diluted share was $0.14 for the quarter compared to a net loss of $0.02 per share for the same period in 2019. our adjusted ebitda for q4 was $40.8 million. our adjusted ebitda margin was 8.8% and our utilization was 92% for lines under contract at quarter end. this compares to adjusted ebitda of $32 million, an adjusted ebitda margin of 7.6% and utilization of 96% in the same period in 2019. we estimate that adjusted ebitda was negatively impacted by approximately $5 million associated with production volume lost along with other costs related to covid-19 that impacted our production facilities.
turning to slide 12. for the year ended december 31, 2020, net sales increased 16.3% or $233.6 million to nearly $1.7 billion. net sales of wind blades increased 18.9% to $1.6 billion despite the impact that covid-19 had on our manufacturing facilities. the increase in wind blade sales was driven by an 11% increase in wind blade sets produced and a 26% increase in estimated megawatts produced. net sales from transportation increased 25.4% to $36.2 million. we achieved a 10.1% increase in adjusted ebitda to $94.5 million, despite being significantly impacted by covid-19. globally, our associates did a great job of pulling together and managing through the pandemic, while ensuring their health and safety.
moving on to slide 13. we ended the quarter with $129.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and total principal amount of debt outstanding of $218 million, in a year where we were significantly impacted by covid-19 and invested $65.7 million in capital expenditures to grow the business. we held our net debt to under $89 million. and we were able to get our net leverage ratio, as calculated under our senior revolving loan facility, back down to under 1.8 times by december 31, 2020.
turning to slide 14, 2021 full year guidance. for 2021 we are guiding to net sales of between $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion, adjusted ebitda of between $110 million to $135 million. we will discuss this in more detail on the following slide. dedicated manufacturing lines during the year are expected to be approximately 50. utilization of between 80% to 85%. total wind blade set capacity of 4,090. average selling price per blade of between $160,000 and $165,000. nonblade sales of between $100 million and $125 million. capital expenditures of between $55 million and $65 million. start-up costs of between $8 million and $11 million, with most of it occurring in the first half of the year. and we expect restructuring costs of approximately $10 million associated with the optimization of our global footprint. approximately 50% of those costs is expected to be noncash.
on slide 15, we provided a walk from our 2020 adjusted ebitda to the midpoint of our adjusted ebitda guidance range for 2021. our adjusted ebitda guidance includes approximately $10 million of costs related to the health and safety of our associates as we continue to manage through covid-19. the overall cost of covid-19 is expected to be substantially less than in 2020.
next, you can see the results of our relentless focus on operational execution to drive down the cost of raw materials, decrease cycle time, decrease waste and continue to drive other costs out of the system. as bill previously mentioned, we have taken five lines out of production in china, and we are expecting the other 10 lines to be operating at a lower utilization during the back half of the year.
we are also forecasting lower utilization in q4 for several of our lines in other regions. our forecast of decreased utilization in the back half of the year is due primarily to what we believe is a short-term overcapacity issue with a few of our customers, as well as certain of our customers shifting production away from china to mitigate geopolitical risk and increasing costs associated with doing business in china. with the continued momentum in the ev space, we are forecasting that we will invest approximately $15 million to $20 million in the transportation business during 2021 as we continue to hire and develop our team, technology and infrastructure.
finally, we continue to make progress with the speed of our start-ups and transitions. although we are forecasting our total start-ups cost to be down year-over-year, we do expect to have more transitions this year than we did in 2020. this bar represents both the start-up and transition costs in our p&l and the margin impact associated with transitioning to a bigger blade. although we are not providing quarterly guidance, we believe that our q1 adjusted ebitda will be less than $10 million due to seasonality and the number of lines that we have in transition and start-up.
with that, i will turn it back over to bill to wrap up. and then we will take your questions. bill?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, bryan. turning to slide 17. the health and safety of our associates and their families as well as the communities in which they live remain our #1 priority. we continue to take the necessary steps on the covid-19 front to ensure the safety of our associates and safe working conditions in our facilities. we continue to aggressively work our wind pipeline, and we remain very encouraged by the progress we continue to make in the service space. we are continuing to build on our momentum in the transportation space, and we'll continue to refine our long-term strategy to capitalize on the increased interest investment and activity in the electric vehicle space. we continue to remain focused on managing our liquidity to provide financial security and flexibility as we drive through the current environment and execute our strategy to capitalize on the acceleration of the energy transition.
our overall mission to decarbonize and electrify remains unchanged. we will continue to optimize our global footprint, while using the leverage our global scale provides for operating and supply chain efficiencies to continue to drive down cost, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. we will continue to evaluate the global demand and update our long-term targets accordingly to better reflect the long-term opportunity we expect to see in wind and evs under this accelerated energy transition. i want to thank all of our dedicated tpi associates for their commitment and dedication and for their extraordinary efforts during 2020 to deliver on our commitments to our customers in the middle of a global pandemic. thank you again for your time today.
and with that, operator, please open the line for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] and the first question comes from philip shen with roth capital partners.
donovan schafe -- roth capital partners -- analyst
this is donovan schafe on for philip. i have a couple of questions for you. the first one is on the -- i was impressed with the guidance to see that there's a pretty big uptick in the asps. and i'm sort of trying to think about how to think about that, or how to model that as a trade-off with volumes. because there's -- you're moving to larger blades, but then as you guys show on slide 15, there's going to be a negative impact from volumes. that's a great bridge that you guys are providing. is it accurate to think of like the increase -- you had the increase in transition costs, start-up costs, but some of the result of that is those higher asps, that pretty significant jump that we're seeing? and is that what is -- is that kind of -- like if you held revenue [technical issues] and decreased volume but perfectly offset it by the asp uptick, is that generally going to be pushing the margins up? and should we be seeing that kind of phenomenon going forward?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. thanks, donovan, for the question, by the way. asps increasing, we've seen that year-over-year, and that's really all about bigger blades, right? so longer blades, heavier blades generally equates to higher asps. so that's why you're seeing that asp growth. and we've talked a bit about this before where over time, that's kind of why we went away a little bit from talking strictly about lines and talking more about gigawatts or megawatts of capacity. because over time, the number of lines may stay steady or actually reduce but our megawatts of production may actually go up. as long as we continue to maintain the throughput, the way we do and drive cycle time, if we're driving the same number of large blades through the same capex investment that we were doing on the smaller blades, then you're going to see a revenue uptick for sure. and over time, as you -- as those blades mature, you should see a margin uptick as well. but it takes a little time to get through the transition and get to serial production. but once you do, you should see an uptick in margins as well.
donovan schafe -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay, great. and then my second question is vestas has been having some -- there have been some headline blade issues. and there are some lightning strikes. and then they had the issue with the inserts and so forth. and so i'm just curious because i think in the last -- in q3 in your q filing, it showed vestas was something like 50%, approximately 50% of revenues for the trailing nine months. have you heard or seen anything from them or kind of any indications on the horizon of any type of slowdown coming from vestas?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. so on the blade issue, i think they were pretty clear that, that was a sub-supplier. it was a component that we clearly use in the blade, but it's not a tpi issue as it relates to that. we're still -- vestas will continue to be our largest customer. we will see a little bit of variation in their utilization at the back half of this year initially, although initial indications are showing that '22 looks very strong starting right out of the gate at the beginning of the year. so as we said, it looks like it's a temporary utilization challenge in the back half of the year, primarily the fourth quarter. some of it was a little bit of pull ahead, i think, of build from 2020. but overall still, we're going to be producing a whole bunch of blades for vestas. they'll remain our largest customer. and we're continuing to work with them on optimizing our footprint, for not only our success but theirs as well.
donovan schafe -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay. great. well, congratulations on the quarter.
operator
and the next question will be from paul coster with jpmorgan.
paul coster -- jpmorgan -- analyst
so china, perhaps you can tell us what happens to the facility and operations in china as the utilization rate falls? do you idle it? or what's the process there?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
paul, this is bill. thanks for the question. yes, we're working on a number of options there, paul. we have two blade facilities and a tooling facility. so -- and the blade facility we built in yangzhou is state of the art. our other facility, although still performing extremely well, is kind of getting to its functional end of life just because the blade sizes have gotten so large. and so we will look at consolidating in china a little bit more than we have. we are looking at some other options for our older facility. but likely it's a consolidation of the operations to reduce the footprint a bit and become a little bit more efficient and cost-effective out of china.
paul coster -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and the business that shifted from china to elsewhere, that there was capacity available to absorb that? you didn't need to build any new facilities or capacity?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. i mean if you think about it, it's possible that some of the capacity we built in india will supplement or will replace what was in china. again, if that volume is going to the u.s., the tariff doesn't exist between india and the u.s., but it does between china. the cost of manufacturing in india is significantly less than in china as well. so we've talked about looking at globalizing and localizing and derisking supply chain. that's part of what we've done, and that's part of what our customers are doing too. so we did add capacity in india clearly and that could be some of the capacity coming out of china.
paul coster -- jpmorgan -- analyst
when i look at the ebitda walk on page 15, which i agree is very helpful by the way, and i look at the demand impact orange bar, is that all china? is it the combination of china in the second half as sort of lower utilization rate? how do i think about that $50 million-plus, $60 million decrement?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. it's not just china, paul. there are clearly -- there's some of that in china. but we've got in a couple of other regions some fourth quarter utilization reductions. some of those will be used for transitions quite frankly. we're still in the planning phase with some of our customers on what we -- what exactly they want going into '22 in a couple of different locations. so it's not strictly china, there's a little bit of volume degradation in a couple of other regions as well.
paul coster -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, final question. as you start up the transportation business, is it going to be more decentralized and co-located, or closer located to this end customer and smaller scale? or is it likely to follow the same pattern as wind, very centralized facilities?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
no. i think it will depend a little bit, paul. but our plan would be depending on what we're actually doing whether we're doing a full-body or if we're doing subcomponents, we're -- quite frankly and even in the case of cabs, we've talked both models where we could be centrally located for certain things and then co-located for others. so i think it will be a little bit of a mixed model. it will be different than the blade model. there will be much more co-location as it relates to the different oems that we're working with. i think eliminating the transportation between a central location and another location is clearly part of the goal. and so co-location is more likely.
operator
the next question comes from chris tsung with webber research.
chris tsung -- webber research -- analyst
so i'm on for greg, and we just have a couple of questions. i wanted to just touch on the transportation pipeline. like i think we noted two of your customers recently announced a cooperation on hydrogen vehicles. and could tpic eventually be a part of that project? and i'm just trying to see how we should think about that pipeline developing.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
so we are working on a number of projects as we said in our prepared remarks, a couple of the development projects in the class eight space. whether those are ultimately fuel cell or battery could be either/or. so again then we're in the delivery vehicle space as you know, working collaboratively with workhorse on their last-mile delivery. and then a couple of passenger automotive ev programs that we can't discuss who they're with, but those are more subcomponents. so yes our plan is to, much like we do with the blade oems, is to collaborate as deeply with those parties as they would like us to. the more collaboration, generally the more value you can add, and the better the end product. so that's our mode going in is to collaborate deeply with these guys, figure out what the best solution is for the problem they're trying to solve. and then -- and that's what our value proposition is. so collaboration is important for us in this space. we don't want to just be a commodity -- a provider of commodity parts. that's not what our model is.
chris tsung -- webber research -- analyst
all right, yes, great. i guess it's a good segue into workhorse. you see the recent news regarding workhorse and the usps deal. how much of the 500 million in transportation revenue that you guys have for the next three to five years is dependent on that deal? like i guess put it another way, how much of it of the workhorse and usps deal is baked into that $500 million? and do you see that time line sliding out a little bit further?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. so we set our 500 million target before workhorse was even a customer at the time. so there was 0 from usps baked into that number. that would have been an upside opportunity for us. clearly in our long-term plans, we do have last-mile delivery in our transportation plans. but as far as the usps and the $500,000, there was nothing for usps in the $500 million.
operator
the next question will come from eric stine with craig-hallum.
eric stine -- craig-hallum -- analyst
so can we just go back to china a little bit? as i think about on the one hand, you'll be down to 50 lines from i believe 53 at the end of the year. but then also your commentary seems quite bullish about 2022. should we think about that as due to you're kind of in the interim where you're trying to figure out what your oem partners want to do? and maybe just what are some of the discussions happening around as those oems try to get away from china or reduce china exposure? what that's looking like in other locations?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. again just to be clear, i don't -- it's not like they're running for the hills. i mean they're just -- they're rebalancing where their capacity is to make sure that it's efficient and to derisk for any potential issues in the future. so again they're not running for the hills by any stretch, but they are derisking. and we think that's a smart thing to do. so it's a -- eric, i almost equate it a little bit to the calm before the storm. i mean there's a lot going on in the energy world right now. everybody is trying to figure out what the eu green deal means, what's it going to mean for western oems with china's goals for decarbonization. we have a new administration in the u.s. clearly, everything is going to be looked at through the lens of climate change, but what exactly does that mean?
so i think 2021, there's a lot of trying to figure out exactly what's going to happen. it's not if, it's when. and so i think that's why there's a little bit of pause throughout stretches of the year. but with all that said, we're still growing our top line 10%. we're still growing ebitda by 30%. this is in a year where we've got utilization that's down a little bit, lower than we would like it to be. so again i see it as a year of transition and don't think of transition as the way we think of a transition. but it's a year of transition in the space, right, and people trying to figure out what all of this very positive potential, whether it's legislation, regulation or just demands of the consumer and decarbonization mean and how that gets implemented into the bigger picture long term.
eric stine -- craig-hallum -- analyst
right. so i mean i guess to put another way, your -- you said near term there's still some uncertainty as to what that looks like. but clearly constructive conversations and relationships you've got with those oems are leading to that pretty bullish outlook for 2022?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
that's correct, absolutely.
eric stine -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay, all right. and maybe just last one just sticking with china. i know you mentioned that you were looking to some maybe work for some chinese oems. and i know historically that's been really not available because that -- they've mostly in-sourced production. so have you seen any changes in the market? or just what are your thoughts about potentially replacing some of that business with some players in china?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
we've always been in discussion, and it's a -- it has been a challenge just making sure that we get to the right financial terms that make sense for us. and we're not going to compromise financially to do that. but it is changing. we've had opportunities with them outside of china as well, which doesn't mean you can't build for them inside of china and export. so again, we're going to continue to work those relationships, continue to look at the opportunities. there is significant demand in china for wind over the next several years. the numbers this year were staggering. i'm not quite sure how to take them, but the numbers are staggering. and so is there enough capacity in china to satisfy the demand from the oems? and we think there's an opportunity there for us to play. there's also an opportunity for the western oems to gain share there, especially as large as that market is. so we'll continue to work with them on opportunities there as well.
operator
and the next question will be from laura sanchez with morgan stanley.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i was wondering if you could comment on the impact to margins from moving those lines out of china. are costs in india and other locations similar, so that in net it wouldn't have an impact on margins? or how should we think about that?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean overall if you look at it, there is an impact right now in the short term, basically due to going from a mature plant to one of the new plants. but over the long term, we believe we'll recover those margins as the lines mature in these other regions. so that's why i mean as bill kind of spoke to as we get the utilization up, hopefully in 2022 as we're seeing, that's where we see some improvement in the margins, with that shift from kind of the smaller blades to the bigger blades with additional margin.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. so is the 12% ebitda margin goal still on the table?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. i think if you look kind of at this bridge and kind of do the math, you can see some different areas of where you can get that and figure out how to achieve those 12% margins. so yes, we're not adjusting that at this time.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, ok, and one more for me. so going back to commentary on vestas, they posted some margin pressure in the fourth quarter. so i was wondering if you could comment on your conversations with customers in regards to pricing dynamics. are you seeing any pressure these days? and how is your ability to negotiate with them in terms of translation -- timing of concessions?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. so laura, we've seen pressure on margins for a long time, and i think we always will, right? that's just the nature of it. but with the nature or with the structure of our contract, we're able to be pretty successful in maintaining the margins or even increasing margins over time, just based on the structure of our contracts. so i think if you look in the -- for our oem customers, they have seen stabilized pricing probably over the last six to eight quarters now. so that has helped quite a bit. but we're going to continue to try to drive cost and drive lcoe down. we'll continue to have pressure from our customers, and we'll continue to pressure our customers to work with us to drive the cost. so i think it's a healthy -- there's healthy -- i guess there's healthy stress in that kind of that relationship where we're pushing them. they're pushing us and together we push costs down, and that benefits both of us. so i don't think that dynamic will change.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. okay, perfect. last one, you had comment -- you had said before that for transportation business, you could see double-digit margins. are you seeing those levels these days? based on kind of conversations or looking at the numbers of some auto companies, that seems a bit high for the auto industry. so how should we think about the competitive dynamics there?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, i think we're not seeing double digits today, laura. obviously, we're investing in that business. we're investing from a development standpoint. some of the development agreements we have are not meant to be significant margin projects. but we do -- as we've looked at modeling, as we've looked at volumes, as we looked at what our costs are and what the ask has been from the customers we've been working with, we think we can get there quite frankly. so again, we're not -- it's not like we're an auto oem or a supplier or a sub-supplier, a little bit different dynamic. but based on what we've modeled to date on some of the projects we've looked at, we do believe that that's attainable. but again, it's still early days on that. and again, more as we get further down the path with production contracts.
operator
the next question will be from graham price with raymond james.
graham price -- raymond james -- analyst
this is graham price on for pavel molchanov. i guess just kind of a broad question on the transportation side. i was wondering if you could speak to the road map for reaching your $500 million long-term revenue target? and also if any recent developments might lead you to believe that, that could be conservative at this point?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. i think the road map is -- it's going to take time to get there. we've focused -- we've kind of -- we've spent some time over the last four to six months to refine our strategy. and we're kind of looking -- we're looking at the cab space, which is class eight cab structures as well as cabs for that last-mile delivery. we look at battery enclosure. if you think about -- that's a key component of any ev as well as in subcomponents for an ev. so all the way from a full-body structure to a subcomponent. and we've got development agreements in each of those segments that we're working on right now with customers. and so again, it's a -- $500 million is over time, over several years. any one development program could take a significant chunk out of that. so we're continuing to work those programs diligently, educating the market as to what the benefits of composites are, and educating them to what the cost of composites can be in volume, that it's not cost-prohibitive. and we're looking at a lot of and developing a lot of innovative technology around that. so again the road map, we haven't put a public road map out there obviously, but we have an internal road map that gets us there over time. and so we're going to continue to focus on execute and keep our heads down and win some projects. so that's as much as i can give you on the road map.
graham price -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. and then i guess quickly for my follow-up, the 2021 guidance for $100 million to $125 million for the nonblade sales next year, i was just wondering if i could get some color on what the breakout is for that portion?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean if you look at kind of the ratio we've had historically with the molds and some of those and then the other category with transportation, so it's probably about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 actually when you look at it.
graham price -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, perfect.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
so again, we're not -- you're forecasting a huge jump in transportation this next year. it will take time to get there, but we still see momentum behind it.
operator
the next question is from joseph osha with jmp securities.
joseph osha -- jmp securities -- analyst
looking at that backlog chart that you showed on page nine and then going back and looking to one from last quarter, subtract the revenue, it looks like you basically didn't have any bookings in the quarter. and a, am i kind of on track with that? b, could we be in an environment now, given the comments you're making about demand dislocations and stuff, where the visibility of the business declines for a while?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
no. i think -- so we didn't add any new lines, joe, but we did extend nordex in turkey. so we would have had a net add there. but we didn't add anything new to the pipeline, so you're right. it's interesting, joe, because as -- when we were early on in this process, we were signing 5-year deals. so we have really -- the visibility was a little bit different. as we get -- as these deals get to their maturity and we are extending them, so you're extending them for one year or two years at a time. so by definition, you have a little bit less visibility from a longer-term perspective, but you might have better visibility in that 2- or 3-year window, if you will as to what we're actually going to do, yes. so i would say we still have very good visibility a year or two out. but as you extend contracts versus sign new contracts, it's for a shorter duration. so that's why it kind of -- you would think you might have less visibility, but from an operational standpoint, we actually have as good or better visibility when we're doing kind of 2-year extensions.
joseph osha -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. so i shouldn't overly focus on that $4.6 billion number and how that changes over time?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, i would not. i mean that's clearly something that we've had out there for a long time. it's -- we are -- we have a lot of focus obviously on making sure we're extending contracts as well as signing new ones. and so we'd clearly like to see that grow, but that's not something that is driving exactly how we're working the business today.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes, i would just add to that, i mean if you look at the overall pipeline and what we're seeing, i mean it's still what, plus over six gigawatts of kind of pipeline there. and so that hasn't changed kind of longer term.
joseph osha -- jmp securities -- analyst
that makes sense. and then just shifting gears a bit, obviously some broad comments about demand. but i mean there are some very different drivers here in the u.s. you've got some of these ptc shifts in china you alluded to just the kind of the crazy numbers. is this just kind of a bunch of things aligning at the same time? or is there some sort of broader global phenomenon here behind the reduced demand that i'm missing?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
behind the reduced demand? again, i think....
joseph osha -- jmp securities -- analyst
behind your cautious comments how the u.s....
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
i'm not sure i understand, joe. can you say that again?
joseph osha -- jmp securities -- analyst
well, just again, you've talked about an environment where you were going to take lower utilization in china. and then you made some more cautious comments about the u.s. my point was just that those are very different things driving those two different markets. so i'm just trying to understand if there's some more unifying theme here, whether it's just that we happen to have some things going wrong in different markets for different reasons at the same time.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, i think it's more -- it's not that demand is down, it's that there's more capacity, right? there's -- a couple of customers have probably some excess capacity today. and so it's trying to optimize that capacity going forward so that the utilization is much higher. and so it's not necessarily that demand is down, it's that demand for our -- demand for what we're building this next year is down a little bit, because of the overcapacity in the industry in key areas in key regions. does that make sense? so it's not necessarily that gigawatts installed are going to go down, it's just from -- there's been enough capacity added, that the demand on our capacity is going to be a little bit less next year. we're only going to sell 126 less next year than we did this year. so it's not like it's a major drop, it's just -- it's -- right? so it's just -- it's less utilization than we would like. and we want -- we want to reoptimize our footprint so that we keep that utilization in the high 80s, low 90s as opposed to the low 80s.
joseph osha -- jmp securities -- analyst
and protect the margin. yes, that makes sense.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
and protect the margin, exactly right.
joseph osha -- jmp securities -- analyst
one final quick comment. i don't know if the question -- if you can comment on this or not. we were pretty excited about some of these city transit bus projects a year or two ago. and hearing less about that, can i assume that maybe we shouldn't be looking for some of those projects to really ramp at this point? or just wondering if you can give me a little color about that.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
on the transit bus stuff, i will tell you, you should probably talk directly to proterra about that. our volumes will actually be up for them in 2021 over 2020 by a fair amount. so our -- we're seeing good volume from them. and we're working closely with them on continuing to drive cost so they can be even more competitive than they already are.
operator
the next question comes from greg lewis with btig.
greg lewis -- btig -- analyst
i kind of had like a general question, like -- thank you for the guidance, super helpful. is there any way to kind of balance or think through this is what utilization is, and this is what our margin is at this utilization. but if we can maybe squeeze whether it's 100 basis points or 200 basis points of incremental utilization, is there any way to think about like would that be additive to margins? any way to kind of think about balancing cost absorption maybe with -- in a world where utilization maybe is a little bit better?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. i think -- i mean if you look at the last couple of quarters and what we've been able to produce, if you think about kind of the 8.8% margins we had this quarter with 92% utilization. and in prior quarter i mean we had 93% utilization and fairly robust margins there too. so i guess that kind of gives you an indication with 10.4% margin on those, and that was with the impact of covid on the those quarters. so that kind of gives you an idea that 80% to 85% and then margin, that's if you don't do any other cost-out initiatives and drive cycle times and other things that we're continuing to work through. but the cost -- or if you just look at utilization alone, that's kind of the margins you can expect to see.
greg lewis -- btig -- analyst
okay. and then just realize we're running a little long here. just as i think about -- and you touched on it [technical issues] as the transportation business goes forward, the numbers that we've heard the capex for 2021. does any of that start to point to co-locations? or is that really all just still for things that we're looking at that are pipe -- or kind of pilot projects at this point?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. at this point, that capex number, the $55 million to $65 million is primarily the transitions and start-up that we've already disclosed, and then some of the retooling and that combining some of the factories. i mean we have some on the transportation side, but not a significant amount that would drive kind of what you're thinking of kind of co-locating in that type of activities at this point in time.

2021-Q1,TPIC,2021-05-06 17:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good afternoon, and welcome to tpi composites first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded, and we have allocated one hour for prepared remarks and q&a. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to christian edin, investor relations for tpi composites. thank you. you may begin.
christian edin -- investor relations
thank you, operator. i'd like to welcome everyone to tpi composites' first quarter 2021 earnings call. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. if any of our key assumptions are incorrect because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call or in our annual report on form 10-k filed with the securities and exchange commission or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our website, tpicomposites.com.
we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the comparable gaap financial measures.
with that, let me turn the call over to bill siwek, tpi composites' president and ceo.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
thanks, christian, and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining our call. in addition to christian, i'm joined today by bryan schumaker, our cfo. i'll briefly review our first quarter results and activities, discuss the current operational status of our manufacturing facilities, including our supply chain, give an update on our global service and transportation businesses, and then a quick update on the wind energy market. bryan will then review our financial results in detail, and then we'll open the call for q&a. please turn to slide five. we had a strong first quarter in which we delivered net sales of $404.7 million, a 13.5% increase over q1 of 2020 and adjusted ebitda of $13.1 million or 3.2% of net sales, an $11.8 million increase over q1 of 2020. we started wind blade production in india for nordex.
we published our second esg report, where we laid out specific goals related to safety, gender and racial ethnicity for our board of directors and leadership teams as well as a pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030, with 100% of our energy being procured from renewable sources. we remain focused on operating our businesses safely while continuing to mitigate the impacts of covid-19 and ensuring that we are prepared to deal with continued resurgences of the virus in any of our global locations. we have and will continue to adapt our operating procedures in order to enable our associates to work safely and continue to meet our customers' demand. turning to slide seven. i'll now give you a quick update of our global operations as well as a market update. during the first quarter, we continued to operate all of our facilities at normal levels. in china, production continued as normal.
we are still working on backfilling the five lines that were taken out of production at the end of last year. stay tuned. in india, production for vestas continued uninterrupted, and we started production on two lines for nordex. the country of india is currently experiencing a significant increase in covid cases, but this is not currently having a material impact on our operations. we will continue to monitor the situation very closely, including the impact on our supply chain and work to protect our associates and their families as we have through the entire pandemic. in turkey, production continued as normal while we continue the transition of three lines during the first quarter. turkey also experienced an increase in covid cases late in q1 and into q2, so we are monitoring the situation very closely and continuing our measures to protect our associates and their families. there's been no disruption to our operation as a result of the spike in cases. in mexico, production also continued at normal levels. we are currently in the midst of a transition of two lines in matamoros, and we plan to have four lines in transition in juarez in q2 with four more lines in transition in mexico during 2021. in the u.s., blade and transportation production has continued uninterrupted.
we have already conducted multiple mass vaccination events for our associates in newton, iowa and are working with state and local authorities in rhode island to offer the same to our associates there. on the service side of the business, we are continuing to build out the team in order to support the growing customer opportunities we have and are securing and now have approximately 250 technicians, an increase of over 30% since the beginning of 2020. our training facility in santa teresa, new mexico was up and operating, and we plan to open another training facility in europe this year to support our european service operations. from a transportation perspective, during the quarter, we continued to deliver parts for multiple passenger electric vehicle manufacturers. we are pleased with the progress and experience that we are gaining with the automated production line in rhode island to demonstrate cycle times, quality, repeatability, scalability and cost for our customers and to expand our product portfolio with these advanced technology solutions.
we are now collaborating with six oems on cabin body structures and with nine oems related to electric vehicle component parts. examples of cabin body structures are buses, class eight cabs and delivery vehicles that enable lightweighting, reduced upfront capital investments and are highly durable structures. examples of electric vehicle components include underbody protection, battery enclosures and body panels parts to enable lighter weight, high durability and thermal resistance. we are continuing to build our transportation team and plan to continue to add leadership with deep automotive experience to accelerate the execution of our strategy. with respect to our supply chain, no issues materially impacted our production in q1, but we have seen cost increases, some availability issues and logistics challenges over the last quarter. in addition to fabrics, which include fiberglass and carbon and consumables, we experienced both price increases and supply constraints related to epoxy resin feedstocks due to the extreme cold weather in texas in february, factory fires, plant closures and unplanned extended maintenance outages in china and europe.
we continue to manage through the congestion in the los angeles area ports and a global container shortage causing increases in logistics costs. bryan will speak to the financial impact in a moment, but as they have demonstrated during the pandemic and prior material challenges, our supply chain team has done a phenomenal job of finding alternative sources, securing enough materials and finding new logistics routes to enable minimal disruptions to our operations and deliveries to our customers. we see early signs of supply constraints easing and expect market pricing to improve beginning in q3. and finally, we are actively engaged in evaluating multiple opportunities to build out and add to our current technologies and capabilities, and are excited about the opportunities we see to accelerate the growth and expand the breadth and strength of our business.
as it relates to the wind market, since our last call, the biden administration has made several significant announcements that could positively impact our business over the long term. first, the proposed infrastructure bill has many components that have the potential to help accelerate the growth of wind installations in the u.s. to highlight a few: first, the energy efficiency and clean electricity standard would aim to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035; second, transmission-targeted investment tax credit that incentivizes the build-out of at least 20 gigawatts of high-voltage capacity lines; and third, a 10-year extension of the production tax credit and potential for direct pay option. separately, senator wyden reintroduced a bill with a technology-neutral framework that would allow power producers to qualify for either a production tax credit or an investment tax credit for facilities with 0 or negative carbon emissions. relating to offshore wind, the biden administration announced a governmentwide goal to install 30 gigawatts of offshore by 2030. finally, as part of the climate summit, the administration announced a new goal for the u.s. to cut its greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 as part of the paris climate agreement.
other countries, including canada, japan, brazil, the u.k. and south korea increased their commitments as well, while the eu parliament and member states pass legislation requiring a 55% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 compared with '19 levels, and that's up from 40%. since our last call, wood mac has increased its onshore u.s. forecast for 2021 through 2025 by approximately 19%, and that includes a 50% increase for 2022 alone. this forecast suggests that the competitiveness and strength of the wind markets continues to improve as we've been discussing for some time. while these policy announcements may not cause the short-term installations to increase, and in some cases, we may see installations pushed out due to additional potential time for developers and other stakeholders to recognize the benefits of incentives such as the ptc, these are clearly very strong positive signals as we look out over the longer-term period. we believe the future for wind energy will continue to strengthen, given the initiatives and goals to promote the acceleration of the energy transition.
our long-term goals, including 18 gigawatts of capacity, 20% market share and $2 billion of wind revenue do not yet reflect the potential impact of the accelerating energy transition. we believe the long-term opportunity for us in wind is significant, and we will update our targets as we develop better clarity through discussions with our customers, developers, utilities and asset owners. finally, we remain focused on the health and safety of our associates while executing on our operating imperatives and esg activities to drive profitable growth and long-term shareholder value.
with that, let me turn the call over to bryan.
bryan r. schumaker -- chief financial officer
thanks, bill. please turn to slide 11. all comparisons made today will be on a year-over-year basis compared to the same period in 2020. for the first quarter ended march 31, 2021, net sales increased by $48 million or 13.5% to $404.7 million. net sales of wind blades increased by 12.7% to $379.2 million. this was primarily driven by an 11% increase in the number of wind blades produced year-over-year and an increase in the average selling price due to the mix of wind blades produced. start-up and transition costs for the quarter increased by $2.3 million to $14.4 million as we continue to ramp our india facility and transition lines to bigger blades in mexico and turkey.
our general and administrative expenses for the quarter decreased by $0.6 million to $8.9 million, and g&a as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points to 2.2% of net sales. this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in travel and training costs due to covid-19 and our continued focus on reducing costs. before share-based compensation, g&a as a percentage of net sales was 1.7% and 1.9% in q1 of 2021 and 2020, respectively. foreign currency loss was $3.7 million in q1 2021 as compared to foreign currency income of $1 million in q1 2020. this increase was primarily due to euro liability exposure against the turkish lira. as a reminder, on a cash flow basis, this exposure is naturally hedged due to our euro-denominated revenue contracts. approximately 22% of our revenue in q1 2021 was denominated in euros. our income tax benefit for the quarter was $7.1 million as compared to $15 million for the prior year period.
this decrease was primarily due to our forecasted jurisdictional mix of income. we are forecasting our cash tax liability to be approximately $20 million to $23 million for 2021. net loss for the quarter was $1.8 million as compared to a net loss of $0.5 million in the same period in 2020. this increase was primarily due to the reasons previously described. net loss per share was $0.05 for the quarter compared to a net loss of $0.01 per share for the same period in 2020. our adjusted ebitda for q1 was $13.1 million or 3.2% of net sales with a utilization rate of 77% for lines installed at quarter end. this compares to adjusted ebitda of $1.3 million or 0.4% of net sales and utilization of 70% in the same period in 2020. we estimate that adjusted ebitda was negatively impacted by $2.4 million associated with covid-19-related costs during q1 2021. moving to slide 12. we ended the quarter with $136.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, net debt of $99 million and have driven down our net debt leverage ratio to less than 1.75 as calculated under our credit agreement.
as you may recall, we amended our credit facility last year to provide us with additional liquidity and increased flexibility with regards to our financial covenants to help manage through the covid-19 pandemic. during the quarter, we terminated the adjustment period a quarter early due to our ability to drive our net leverage ratio down. following the termination of the adjustment period, the adjustments to our total net leverage ratio covenants were removed, interest rates were decreased and the minimum liquidity covenants and mandatory repayment triggers were discontinued. during the quarter, we incurred $18.8 million of capex as we continue to build out our india plant and transition lines in mexico and turkey.
turning to slide 13. for 2021, we are reaffirming full year guidance that we provided in february. this is despite increased commodity prices, specifically resin and inbound freight costs that bill mentioned earlier. the supply constraints and resulting resin price increases are due to a multitude of factors, including the extreme cold weather in texas in february 2021, fires at resin manufacturing facilities in china and unplanned extended maintenance outages at resin manufacturing facilities in europe. capacity is beginning to come back online, and we expect resin prices will begin to decline in q3 2021. when we see rapid increases in raw material costs like we did in late q1 and into q2, it can have a short-term impact on our margins due to the timing of when we contractually reset prices with our customers.
to put this into perspective, prior to any price adjustments with our customers, we saw resin prices increase over 30% from late 2020 to the end of q1 2021. on average, resin makes up approximately 26% of blades bill of material. however, based on our contractual arrangements, we believe that our adjusted ebitda for 2021 will only be impacted by approximately $5 million with the majority of such raw material cost increases being incurred in q2. as we look at our adjusted ebitda forecast for the remainder of 2021, we expect our q2 adjusted ebitda will be slightly higher than q1, and the majority of our adjusted ebitda will be generated in q3 and q4. these numbers could be significantly impacted by covid-19.
with that, i will turn it back over to bill to wrap up, and then we'll take your questions. bill?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
thanks, bryan. turning to slide 15. the health and safety of our associates and their families as well as the communities in which they live remain our #1 priority. we continue to take the necessary steps on the covid-19 front to ensure the safety of our associates and safe working conditions in our facilities. we continue to aggressively work our wind pipeline, and we are pleased with the progress we have made in growing the team and opportunities in the global service space. we continue to build on our momentum in the transportation space with a number of exciting new collaborative development agreements. we remain focused on managing our liquidity to provide financial security and flexibility as we drive through the current environment and execute our strategy to capitalize on the acceleration of the energy transition.
we are excited about the multiple opportunities we are evaluating to build out and add to our current technologies and capabilities to support the growth, breadth and strength of our business. our overall mission to decarbonize and electrify remains unchanged. we will continue to optimize our global footprint while using leverage of our global scale for operating and supply chain efficiencies to continue to drive down costs, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. given the broader wind and electric vehicle industry tailwinds, our position in the market and our relationships with our customers, we remain excited for the future here at tpi. finally, i want to thank our dedicated tpi associates for their commitment and dedication and for their continued resilience, enabling us to deliver on our commitments to our customers in these challenging times. thank you again for your time today.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of eric stine with craig-hallum. please proceed with your question.
aaron michael spychalla -- craig-hallum capital -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon. it's aaron spychalla on for eric. thanks for taking my question.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
you bet. good to talk to you.
aaron michael spychalla -- craig-hallum capital -- analyst
you as well. maybe first on outsourcing. given some of the things we've seen on the supply chain and just other industry dynamics, do you think that that's going to strengthen the trend toward outsourcing here as we look over the next year or so?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. i don't think we've seen anything that would suggest otherwise. so, we still have a pretty robust pipeline with a lot of activity. so yes, we haven't seen anything that would suggest the trend would slow or reverse in any way.
aaron michael spychalla -- craig-hallum capital -- analyst
all right. thanks. and maybe second, on the ev side. thanks for the color on kind of the number of programs. can you just maybe give a little more detail on how those conversations have trended, maybe in recent months, and how many more programs you might look to add as we kind of progress toward that $500 million goal?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. it's hard to tell how many we'll add going forward, clearly, but the conversations have obviously progressed very nicely. we've seen a lot of activity, a lot of interest, which is why we've added a number of development agreements over the last quarter. so, i think it's been extremely active. i think people are starting to understand the true value proposition of a composite structure, whether that'd be a body or a component with the strength and the lightweight nature of it. we're getting down to a place where we're working toward a cost parity model. i think once we get there, then you'll see some more traction.
aaron michael spychalla -- craig-hallum capital -- analyst
all right. sounds good. thanks for taking the questions.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
you bet. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of laura sanchez with morgan stanley. please proceed with your question.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. hi, bill and bryan. thanks for taking my question. adjusted ebitda for the quarter, it came in a little bit above the guided level. and you talked about the impacts from increased raw material costs. and we also hear the oems talk about transportation challenges. so, are there any factors offsetting these challenges that allow you to keep 2021 guidance unchanged?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. i think i'll jump on that one first, and then i'll let bryan speak. but i think we've got some pretty aggressive cost-out goals in a number of areas that we're executing on. i think when we talk about raw material cost increases, and i think most of you remember, we have shared paying gain in our contracts, so there is a bit of a sharing. but i think, more importantly, is our supply chain team just does an amazing job of locking in pricing on virtually all of our commodities with the exception of resin and that kind of adjust quarterly. but almost everything else, we're locking in a year in advance. so, you may see market prices increasing on some of these commodities, but that may not actually impact what our pricing is. so, although we will see a bit of an impact from resin, as bryan suggested, most of the other commodities, we've locked in pricing. so, any increase there is impacting us much less than it might otherwise.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. and a follow-up on that, about the 70-30 sharing mechanism. how often does that get reset? or how does the accounting work?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
well, i'll let bryan handle the accounting. but from a contract standpoint, it varies a bit by customer. so some of our customers, it's two times a year, some of our customers, it's quarterly. and then another customer we have where it's just an annual adjustment, so it does vary across the board. so really, you're -- on one customer, it's one year and everything else is generally quarterly or semiannually, but most of them are quarterly.
bryan r. schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. and then from an accounting standpoint under the 606 that we talked about quite a bit, if you look at that, i mean, it gets smoothed out the margins over the life of the contract, so just keeping that in mind. but again, this piece of it, the $5 million, we believe, will hit in q2, which will be the primary portion of it for the year.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. yes, that's a good reminder. and last one, i mean, and this is more longer term. is there any potential -- do you see any potential in kind of being part of the decarbonization of the shipping industry? if i remember correctly, before you started manufacturing blades, you manufactured sail and power boats, so i'm wondering if the ocean shipping industry would represent another market for you longer term?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
no. we really -- i mean, we've -- interestingly enough, we've been approached on some unique propulsion systems for oceangoing ships as it relates to wind. but as far as the ships themselves, no, that's not something that we're focused on at this point.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. thank you for your time.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
you bet. thank you, laura.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of greg lewis with btig. please proceed with your question.
gregory robert lewis -- btig -- analyst
hi. thank you and good afternoon everybody. i was hoping to get a little bit more color around the other revenue. you maintained the guidance of that, so it looks like that's going to step up just roughly. it looks like on the revenue more of a leg down, transport was flattish. any kind of color around that? knowing that you'd have the component part that probably -- on the transport side, that probably picks up before the chassis body, any kind of way to think about that through the next few quarters?
bryan r. schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean the guidance i gave earlier was about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 of kind of the overall total guidance that i gave. now with that number is in there is the field services. so you'll continue to see, i mean, that increase as we have a bigger focus on that. so that's why we're continuing to focus and continue to drive that and growing it, so you will see that going up over the period of the year.
gregory robert lewis -- btig -- analyst
okay. and so then as i think about transport, realizing that it's still kind of in the incubation phase, when we think -- you mentioned the six oems with bodies and then the parts, any kind of way we should be thinking about the growth of either? i mean are they going to kind of be in parallel? or do we think it could be something where one leads the other? and then as we think about that, should there be any differentiation around margin? or should that kind of be the same?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
so, you're asking whether cab or component will grab fast -- or grow faster and then whether there's a differentiation in margin, is that the question?
gregory robert lewis -- btig -- analyst
yes. yes, exactly.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
you know it -- greg, it really just depends on which grows faster. i mean clearly, we've got opportunities in both. some of the cab stuff takes a little bit longer to develop, as you might imagine, compared to the component, but it might be longer run. so, i think it's a little hard to say. we're obviously focused on both. so, that's the answer as far as what the split may be or the speed of growth for each. and on the margin side, i think, as i mentioned, we're working the cost side pretty hard to bring you down to not only be a benefit because of the lightweight, but also be more to cost parity. but we believe, right now, margins should be relatively consistent across both. and part of it will just depend on volumes and what the capex requirements are from our customers. but at this point, it's a little early to tell which will be a better margin, but we're working to be consistent kind of with where our wind margins have been in the past.
gregory robert lewis -- btig -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yup. thank you, greg.

our next question comes from the line of graham price with raymond james. please proceed with your question.
graham frederick price -- raymond james & associates -- analyst
hi. good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. you spoke a bit last quarter about potentially consolidating your blade facilities in china. just wanted to check in and see if there are any updates on that front, and i guess if the covid situation kind of plays into that in any way?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. so, we're still looking to optimize our china footprint. we've got three facilities there now, and so we are continuing to look at what the optimal situation for us is in china based on not only demand from our existing customers and other western oems, but also, as i think i mentioned in the last call, discussions we're having with some of the chinese oems. so, we're still working on the optimization of the footprint. so that's where i would leave that. and as it relates to covid, i mean, covid, really no impact on what we're doing in china or as it relates to the footprint there. i mean we've had a covid -- hit us in china very first, but it's had the least amount of impact on operations there throughout the whole period. and so really no impact from covid for us there.
graham frederick price -- raymond james & associates -- analyst
got it.thanks. and then for my follow-up, thinking specifically about sourcing balsa wood. any inflation concerns there, i guess, in addition to the epoxy resin?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
no, actually, quite the opposite. we've seen a pretty significant drop in market price for balsa since last year. if you recall last year, we had some challenges at the end of 2019 and into 2020, exacerbated by covid, but we are in very good shape from a balsa standpoint and a balsa market at this point today.

and our next question comes from the line of stephen gengaro with stifel. please proceed with your question.
stephen david gengaro -- stifel, nicolaus -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon gentlemen.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
good afternoon.
stephen david gengaro -- stifel, nicolaus -- analyst
so two things for me. the first, can you help us a little bit with sort of the stair step or the big drivers of the ebitda ramp in the second half versus first half? just some of the -- what are the major components which move us sharply higher in the back half of the year?
bryan r. schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. there's a few things going on, right? you have, one, is the cost that we talked about that will be impacting, which is minimal, but it's about the $0.05 that we referenced from the raw material increase. the other portion, i mean, you have india ramping up, so they'll continue to ramp up. we have seven lines in transition right now across mexico, turkey, and those will be ramping up that back half of the year also. and we see some, i'll say, revenue shift from q2 out to the q3, q4 time frame, so that's another big push that we're seeing. so we feel, i mean -- right now, i mean, it's starting to fill in that back half of the year and kind of where we're coming out to see that utilization going up to achieve those numbers.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. i think that's the key is the utilization. if you look at the utilization numbers going out in q3 and q4, you'll see numbers that are much higher than we experienced here in the first quarter for sure.
stephen david gengaro -- stifel, nicolaus -- analyst
okay. great. thank you. and just as a follow-up, when we think about the opportunity offshore, and i'm thinking probably more u.s. than international with this question. when do you -- what's sort of the lead time on when you start to set up relationships contracts, book work with the oems for the offshore side? just give me a sense for the timing.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes, it's right now. i mean if you think about the time it takes to set up a new facility, secure the land, et cetera, et cetera. so, we were in discussions today and have been for quite some time with oems on opportunities for offshore, specifically on the east coast of the u.s. so that's happening now. we would expect maybe announcements would probably be -- it shifted a little bit to the right, but we're thinking early 2022 right now with production likely in 2024 time frame. so, there's quite a long lead time. there's a lot that has to happen between now and the time we -- by the time turbines get erected in the water, so.
stephen david gengaro -- stifel, nicolaus -- analyst
okay. thank you for the colors now.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
you bet. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of james west with evercore isi. please proceed with your question.
james carlyle west -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey. good afternoon guys. good afternoon. so bill, you laid out the recent policy changes within washington and other places around the world that are kind of -- or accelerating the energy transition. and you guys have a number of lines that are also in transition, and you just talked a minute ago about preparing for offshore. but has this acceleration, this policy-driven acceleration, has it caused you to sort of think about even incremental lines from what you already have planned?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. no. good question, and absolutely. i mean i mentioned we're in discussions and having talks with customers and our customer's customers, et cetera. but absolutely, that's part of what we've been doing through the first quarter and into the second quarter is having long-term planning discussions with customers understanding markets where the growth is, where the needs are, where capacity is today and where it needs to be tomorrow or over the next five to 10 years. so that's an active and ongoing exercise right now. but if you look at -- if the numbers that some people are putting out there come to fruition, i mean, there's going to be more capacity needed in different parts of the world or in our existing locations as well, to certainly meet the demands of the market. i mean there's talk of 3 times the number of -- or the amount of installations just in the u.s. market, right? and then it would need even more than that in europe to hit their targets. so yes, the answer is we will be looking at that footprint over the next six to 12 months and then deciding kind of where the next growth location may or may not be.
james carlyle west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. okay. good to hear. and then just maybe a follow-up on the resin cost issue. i know you expect that to come down in the third quarter. is that -- is the supply already contracted, so you have good visibility on that?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
so, we have supply secured pricing is what can move. so the pricing moves quarterly based on some indices that we've agreed on with a couple of our strategic suppliers, so the price can move. but as you recall, as we reset with our customers, there's a sharing of that price increase or as prices come down, the price decrease, right? so.
james carlyle west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. makes sense. thank you.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
you bet. thank you.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of jeff osborne with cowen. please proceed with your question.
jeffrey david osborne -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey bill, i just had two quick questions on the ev side. so, the six and nine customers that you referenced, are those people you're making -- are those prototypes? or are those contracted volumes? what's the nature of that? so like is proterra in the six and nine or no?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. proterra would be in there, and that's obviously contracted, right? and then there are -- from a cab standpoint, it's more development, if you will. clearly, we've discussed the navistar arrangement we have, so that's in there as well. but most of them are development that would -- that we anticipate will lead to production down the road. and on the component side, there are two of them where it was -- they were production parts for existing vehicles. and then we've got a bunch of stuff that's in, again, development phase with a number of oems. and again, hoping to give you -- i'm sorry, the plan is that that development obviously would lead to production deals.
jeffrey david osborne -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. and i know years ago, you had a doe-funded program with gm, if my memory is right. if something like that for door panels or to take off for, say, the f-150 making roughly one million vehicles a year, what's the capex implications for this sort of broader vision? because it seems like you're getting quite a bit of success in moving the ball forward here, but i wasn't sure is rhode island equipped to do this? or newton, iowa? where would this be done?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. so, we've got the pilot production line in rhode island right now that we are running production parts off of. but no, that -- we couldn't do that type of volume out of rhode island. our thought here is that if we were running components like that, we would likely be co-located either in or near our customers' plant. so, i can't tell you what the capex would be today for one million f-150 doors. i'd like to have the opportunity to figure that out, and we certainly would. but yes, that -- it's too early to tell what that would be. but clearly, that's -- our plan would be to co-locate or locate near where our customers are for those types of volumes for sure.
jeffrey david osborne -- cowen and company -- analyst
makes sense. and the last question, it's probably been a year since you talked about it, but i think you were working on with your customers' segmented blades in terms of larger form factors. is that something that you're still working on? or can you give us an update on blades that would be assembled on site at the location of deployment?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. we are producing segmented blades today.

gregory adrian wasikowski -- webber research & -- analyst
i'll start with transportation. just a quick one. i'm curious if there's any overlap between those cab oems and the ev parts oems, or if they're all individual.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
there is some overlap. so, we're looking at cabs as well as certain components for a couple of them, for sure.
gregory adrian wasikowski -- webber research & -- analyst
got it. okay. and then how should we think about the timeline for growth in this segment? i know we've talked about longer-term plans and targets over the next few years. but as you start to add more relationships and build your backlog, how should we think about that conversion period? when we see you add additional oems in the mix for collaboration agreements or partnerships, generally speaking, should we automatically be thinking 12 or more months before seeing any translation to the p&l? or could it be sooner than that?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
it's -- i would just say patience. and the reason i say that is it -- these development programs do take a little bit longer to get to production than i think maybe was originally anticipated. so your point that 12 months, i'd probably say, in sum, it could be 12, it's probably more like 24 months from -- as you get through a development process, 24 to 36 before you get to production, especially if you're going through testing phases and what have you with the cab structure specifically. so it is a long cycle for these development projects. and so again, it's probably that 24 to 36 months before you start seeing meaningful revenue from a production deal out of a development project we're working on today.
gregory adrian wasikowski -- webber research & -- analyst
got it. okay. and then one more, if i could. just on labor. i'm curious if you've seen any labor constraints, either at tpi or somewhere within your supply chain or your customer base? i'm thinking particularly, in the u.s., just as a result of stimulus checks and kind of favorable unemployment benefits. just wondering if you've seen anything there at all.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
you know, in the u.s., it has -- it's -- early on, in the early part of the pandemic, we had a few challenges in iowa, but we've actually been in pretty good shape. now we're always looking for skilled workers. but the answer -- short answer is no, we're not seeing significant or impactful labor challenges, whether it'd be because of the unemployment checks or just because of the overall market. we're in pretty good shape at this point.
gregory adrian wasikowski -- webber research & -- analyst
okay. thanks so much guys.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
okay. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of william grippin with ubs. please proceed with your question.
william spencer grippin -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
great. good afternoon. thank you. so, i just wanted to dive into the second half ebitda ramp implied in the guidance a little bit of color earlier. i appreciate that you gave a little bit of color earlier. but just -- i think last quarter, you were talking about the second quarter, third quarter being strong, and then a little bit of a step down in 4q. this new guidance seems to imply like a pretty significant shift out of 2q and then into the second half of ebitda. so, you quantified the $5 million from higher costs. but as far as like the seven lines transitioning, india ramping, that stuff i would think you would have known when you gave guidance last quarter. so, just help us understand if you can quantify or just help us -- any additional color you can give to help us understand what's going on here that would help.
bryan r. schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. for the most part, again, q2, that pushed off into q3 into q4. some of the demand is also filling up in q3 and q4 that we spoke about maybe being a little softer before, so that's also helping us out the back half of the year. some of the key things that are kind of driving that from a utilization standpoint in the factories to give us that confidence. but for q2 and why that's down, again, part of it is the raw material input cost we talked about. part of it is this demand slipping. so, that's part of the two main factors there.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
well, it's a demand push to the right, right? so does that make sense? well, so when we -- on the fourth quarter call, we talked about back half of 2021, being a little -- still filling up, being a little bit soft. well, that's firming up. and so that's why q4 looks better. and then some of the volume from q2 that we anticipated is getting pushed into q3, customer request.
william spencer grippin -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
right. i get that. do you think utilization in the second quarter will be lower sequentially?
bryan r. schumaker -- chief financial officer
not necessarily lower sequentially. it will be higher because you have more of india coming online. so that's why, i mean, overall adjusted ebitda goes up a little bit. we just try to give you that kind of thermometer to tell you how it's progressing throughout the year.
william spencer grippin -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
okay. thank you so much.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
thanks will.
operator
our next question comes from the line of phil shen with roth. please proceed with your question.
philip shen -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for taking my question.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
hey philip.
philip shen -- roth capital partners -- analyst
so bryan, i think when you're talking about the guidance and the sequence of ebitda, you said the majority would be in q3 and q4. i know we've talked a bunch about that. but you also did say these numbers could be significantly impacted by covid. so i wanted to explore that a little bit more. and specifically with india's covid situation, can you talk more head on about how are you guys preparing for that? or what do you think could happen in the case of a possible shutdown of parts of the countries? is there a shutdown for tamil nadu, for example, being contemplated, which i believe is where chennai is the capital. so just maybe talk through india and what the risks might be to that back half guidance as well. thanks.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. phil, this is bill. just -- it's a typical caveat risk factor, right, when you've got a global pandemic. so if something happens, you never know. so -- but specific to india, right now, we're ok. there is not -- although there are curfews and there are shutdowns both in tamil nadu and throughout india, industry has continued to be open. there's no restrictions between districts like there was early in the pandemic, so we're fine there. and actually, the oxygen situation where we're at is actually easing up a bit. but nonetheless, it's still very serious, and we're watching it very closely. we're monitoring our supply chain there as well. so the risk is that we have either an outbreak, which we're doing everything we can to prevent that. and we have to slow down production. but at this point, we have not had an impact on production nor do we anticipate it unless something changes significantly here over the next few weeks.
bryan r. schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. the only thing i'll add is in our prior call, we talked about kind of $5 million a quarter covid impact being through q2. with our run rate, we kind of gave about the $2.4 million in q1. we believe $10 million will go through the full year, and that's because of what we're seeing in india and turkey. so that's why we're still confident in those numbers we gave about the $10 million that just will go through the whole year now instead of just the first half.
philip shen -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that, bryan. thank you, bill. i think we talked through resin earlier. can you talk about the logistics outlook? do you also see an improvement in q3 there? or is that just resin? and if not, what is the visibility on the improvement for logistics pricing?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. i think the further down the road you get past the pandemic, not that we're past it, we're still in the middle of it, but that's a tougher one, phil. i think i rely on our supply chain team, and they've done a phenomenal job of finding alternative routes and modes and methods to get materials where they need to go. i don't have a crystal ball on this one. i see it remaining tight through the balance of the year, but we'll continue to manage just the way we have over the last 12 to 18 months.
philip shen -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay. great. and i know that impacts the entire economy, so it's not isolated to you guys. bill, in terms of the passenger ev that was slated for possible serial production, you guys were looking for -- and we were looking for some time in q4 last year and then q1 this year. can you talk about what the status is of that converting to actual live production? and what is the roadblock? perhaps you can just talk through some color on that one.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
yes. so we have two different programs. the one that was the earlier program, probably will not go to serial production on this particular part. we're still working with the oem, and we've got options on other parts. but that particular part that we had spoke about will likely not go to serial production under -- with tpi. the other program we're working on, it's a tens of thousands of parts that we will be delivering between now and kind of the end of q3, early q4. and we'll see from there whether that goes to full serial production or whether it's just a pilot as well. so the first one, again, still dealing with the oem on other options. but for that particular part, we didn't go serial. and now we're working on another one that -- we'll see, but it's high volume. it's a high-profile customer and so we're excited about the opportunity, and we're executing on that right now.
philip shen -- roth capital partners -- analyst
can you explain what the root cause was for the first program?
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
the oem went a different direction, i think the part turned out to not need to be as structurally significant as we originally anticipated it to be. and so as a result, our cost was fine if the part would have remained as is, and then they needed that structural integrity. but it turns out they didn't need something as structurally significant as what they originally believed. so they went with a different technology that was cheaper.
philip shen -- roth capital partners -- analyst
got it. okay. well, thanks for all the details. i;'ll pass it on.
william e. siwek -- president, and chief executive officer
you bet. thanks phil.

operator
good afternoon, and welcome to tpi composites second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to christian edin, investor relations for tpi composites. thank you. you may begin.
christian edin -- investor relations
thank you, operator. i'd like to welcome everyone to tpi composites second quarter 2021 earnings call. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our website, tpicomposites.com. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the comparable gaap financial measures.
with that, let me turn the call over to bill siwek, tpi composites' president and chief executive officer.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, christian, and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining our call. in addition to christian, i am joined today by bryan schumaker, our chief financial officer. i'll briefly review our second quarter results and global operations and then give an update on our global service and transportation businesses, supply chain and the wind energy market. bryan will then review our financial results in detail, and then we will open up the call for q-and-a.
please turn to slide five. we had a solid second quarter in which we delivered net sales of $458.8 million, a 22.7% increase over q2 of 2020, and adjusted ebitda of $17.4 million or 3.8% of net sales, a $14.1 million increase over q2 of 2020. we hired jerry lavine as president of transportation. jerry brings nearly 30 years of experience working with tier one suppliers and major manufacturers in the automotive industry. jerry served as vice president, product development of magna international; and executive vice president, chief program officer of dura automotive systems; and also served in senior engineering and technical roles at ford motor company for over 15 years. we announced an expansion of our relationship with nordex. in july 2021, we took over the production of wind blades for nordex in matamoros, mexico. the wind blades are being produced on four production lines for an initial term of three years. we executed a two-year contract extension through 2024 with proterra to continue the production of composite bus bodies for their electric bus line. the addition of the nordex lines and the extension of the proterra contract added approximately $460 million of potential future revenue under contract. we remain focused on operating our business safely while continuing to mitigate the impacts of covid-19 and ensuring that we are prepared to deal with continued resurgences of the virus in any of our global locations. we have and will continue to adapt our operating procedures in order to enable our associates to work safely and continue to meet our customers' demand.
turning to slide seven. i'll now give you a quick update of our global operations as well as market update. during the second quarter, we continued to operate all of our facilities at normal levels, and we did not experience any significant production issues from covid, including any material production stoppages. we continue to evaluate our global footprint to ensure it is optimized for our customers and the market. we are planning to consolidate our chinese operations to reduce costs, streamline activities and rightsize our operations to profitably serve our customers. our yangzhou facility is world class, and we have the ability to add more lines and handle both onshore and offshore blades. this prime location is the ideal place to consolidate our operations and efficiently serve our customers. as we discussed in our press release from july 22, our supply agreements with sgre expire at the end of 2021. so we are currently planning to end manufacturing wind blades for sgre on four production lines in juarez, mexico. due to the current financial performance of these lines, we expect the exploration will be accretive to our margins in 2022. we are actively seeking to backfill these production lines with one or more customers over time as we believe these operations will continue to be one of the best low-cost options for blade supply into the u.s. and mexico in the future.
as for iowa, we are still in discussions with our customer regarding future production and are, therefore, evaluating our options for this site. we are also exploring new geographies with our customers for onshore, offshore and combined. as we have discussed and i'll touch on again in a minute, the global wind market is expected to be significantly larger over time. and we are preparing now so that we can move quickly and be ready for this expected inflection point. on the service side of the business, during the second quarter, we completed our first offshore project in china. we continue to add new associates to facilitate our growth globally, and our business development team has been very successful in securing new work from oems as well as asset owners. to accelerate our growth in europe, we are planning to open a european training center in spain during the fourth quarter. this will complement our americas training center located in new mexico.
on the transportation front, we are delivering production parts for a passenger electric vehicle manufacturer, while continuing the collaboration with multiple oems on cabin body structures along with other ev components. the addition of jerry lavine adds the automotive depth and leadership that we believe we need to take our transportation business to the next level. his deep technical operations and commercial experience, along with the contacts and relationships he has developed over his 30-year automotive career, will enable us to refine and refocus our offerings to accelerate our growth in this business. as we shared in our press release a couple of weeks ago, our supply chain, like virtually every other supply chain, has been challenged during covid. we have seen increased raw material costs, mainly relating to resin and carbon fiber as well as increased logistics costs. while we are able to pass on a majority and in some cases, 100% of the cost increases to our customers, the portion we are not able to pass on has had a material impact on our margins, and we expect that impact to continue through the balance of 2021. expectations are that we will begin to see market pricing improving by the end of q4 of this year as the start of a slow and gradual downward trend as the market returns to balance. an early indicator of that is that the price of liquid epoxy resin stabilized from june to july, and this was after nine consecutive months of increases that drove epoxy resin to record highs. as always, our supply chain team is hard at work with existing suppliers and alternative suppliers, along with identifying alternative logistics solutions to minimize the impact of increased costs as soon as possible.
turning to the wind market. since our last call, the internal revenue service published guidance that extends the placed in-service safe harbor to six years for facilities that began construction in 2016 through 2019 and extends the placed in-service safe harbor to five years for facilities that began construction in 2020 and provides taxpayers more lenient standards to meet the requirements to obtain the production tax credit. president biden and a bipartisan group announced an agreement on the details of a once-in-a-generation investment in u.s. infrastructure. in total, the deal includes $550 billion in new federal investment in america's infrastructure that will help the u.s. tackle climate change by making the largest investment in clean energy transmission and electric vehicle infrastructure in history, electrifying thousands of school and transit buses across the country, and creating a new grid deployment authority to build a clean 21st century electric grid. although the current deal does not include an extension of the production tax credit or any new tax credits for battery storage, conservation or transmission or any federal investment in clean energy manufacturing or supply chain or a clean energy mandate, many believe those elements will be addressed through reconciliation or a larger spending package later this year.
the international energy agency has released a road map for the global energy sector to reach net zero emissions by 2050. according to iea, wind energy is expected to be the single largest generator of electricity by 2050, making up 35% of total generation and with over 8,000 gigawatts installed compared to approximately 740 gigawatts in 2020. this more than 10 times increase in installations is a huge opportunity for the wind industry and tpi. on the path to zero, the iea expects that by 2030, 390 gigawatts of wind will be installed annually or about four times more than the record set in 2020. the next decade is both critical and a great opportunity for tpi in the wind industry. as we shared with you a couple of weeks ago, we expect decreased demand for our wind blades from our customers during the remainder of 2021, in particular the fourth quarter. we believe this is short term and due to the continued global renewable energy regulatory and policy uncertainty as well as raw material cost increases. we believe that general optimism around the potential to extend the u.s. ptc on a long-term basis is causing developers to reevaluate project time lines in anticipation of being able to build projects at higher ptc levels and lower costs once the expected extensions are in place. and therefore, developers are not purchasing blades or turbines to satisfy current ptc safe harbor requirements. longer term, we believe the future for wind will strengthen significantly given the necessity to decarbonize and electrify to combat climate change.
therefore, we believe the opportunity for us in wind is significant, and we will update our long-term strategy and targets as we develop better clarity once the uncertainties around policy and legislation are resolved. before i turn it over to bryan, we remain very focused on the health and safety of our associates while executing on our operating imperatives and primary esg goals, which include safety, increasing the diversity of our associates and board, becoming a more inclusive company, and driving to become carbon neutral by 2030. we are pleased to see the improvements from our esg efforts, including year-over-year improvements in our esg scores across the major sustainability raters. finally, we have been working with local authorities at all of our facilities to help our associates become vaccinated, including setting up vaccination drives directly at the facilities and local clinics.
with that, let me turn the call over to bryan.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
thanks, bill. please turn to slide 11. all comparisons made today will be on a year-over-year basis compared to the same period in 2020. for the second quarter ended june 30, 2021, net sales increased by $85 million or 22.7% to $458.8 million. net sales of wind blades increased by 20.3% to $418.7 million. this was primarily driven by a 7% increase in the number of wind blades produced year-over-year and an increase in the average selling price due to the mix of wind blades produced. q2 2021 asp was approximately $164,000, an increase of 17% year-over-year. start-up and transition costs for the quarter decreased by $0.8 million to $10.1 million as we continue to ramp our india facility and transition lines to longer and modular blades in mexico. our general and administrative expenses for the quarter decreased by $0.2 million to $6.7 million, and g-and-a as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 1.5% of net sales.
foreign currency loss was $6.5 million in q2 2021, as compared to foreign currency loss of $1.9 million in q2 2020. this increase was primarily due to net euro liability exposure against the turkish lira. the liability exposure continues to be naturally hedged on a cash flow basis due to the euro-denominated revenue contracts. approximately 22% of our revenue in q2 2021 was denominated in euros. our income tax provision for the quarter was $28.9 million as compared to $49.3 million for the prior year period. we are forecasting our cash tax liability to be approximately $20 million to $25 million for 2021. net loss for the quarter was $39.8 million as compared to a net loss of $66.1 million in the same period in 2020. this decrease was primarily due to the reasons previously described. net loss per share was $1.08 for the quarter compared to net loss of $1.87 per share for the same period in 2020. our adjusted ebitda for q2 was $17.4 million or 3.8% of net sales with a utilization rate of 82% for the lines installed at quarter end. this compares to adjusted ebitda of $3.3 million or 0.9% of net sales and utilization of 70% in the same period in 2020.
moving to slide 12. we ended the quarter with $123.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, net debt of $114 million and leverage ratio well below our two times target. for q2, we continue to prioritize capital expenditures that focus on the health and safety of our associates and that will help us achieve our long-term goals. turning to slide 13. for 2021, our full year guidance is revenue of between $1.75 billion and $1.8 billion. this reflects the decrease in demand offset by the additional four nordex lines that we began production in july 2021. adjusted ebitda of between $70 million and $85 million. we expect our adjusted ebitda to be impacted primarily by two items: first, approximately $28 million associated with the decreased demand for our wind blades from our customers during the remainder of 2021; second, approximately $20 million due to the increased raw material costs, mainly relating to resin and carbon fiber as well as logistic costs, which continue to remain at elevated levels and beyond our and our customers' initial expectations. we are forecasting q3 adjusted ebitda to be approximately 40% of the full year adjusted ebitda guidance.
we updated dedicated manufacturing lines to 54 and wind blade sets capacity to 4,260 due to the additional four nordex lines, utilization of approximately 80%. asp of between $165,000 to $170,000. this forecasted increase in asp reflects the increase in raw material costs passed on to our customers. non-blade sales of between $115 million and $125 million; capex of between $55 million and $65 million; start-up costs of between $11 million and $13 million. this increase is due to the start-up of a facility for nordex in matamoros, mexico. we're forecasting to incur a total of between $22 million and $37 million of restructuring charges associated with our global footprint alignment in 2021 and 2022, with $15 million to $22 million forecasted to be incurred in 2021. 20% to 30% of the restructuring charges will be noncash. these restructuring charges considers the actions bill mentioned earlier.
with that, i will turn it back over to bill to wrap up, and then we'll take your questions. bill?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, bryan. turning to slide 15. the health and safety of our associates and their families remain our number one priority. we continue to take the necessary steps on the covid-19 front to ensure the safety of our associates and safe working conditions in our facilities, while working to get all of our associates access to vaccines. we continue to aggressively work our wind pipeline, and we are pleased with the level of activity and how it has picked up over the last couple of quarters. the significant progress we have made in growing our global service team and new service opportunities validates our commitment and investment in this space.
with the addition of jerry lavine, we will continue to build on our momentum in the transportation space and drive toward our long-term revenue and profitability goals. we remain focused on managing our liquidity to provide financial security and flexibility as we drive through the current environment and execute our strategy to capitalize on the acceleration of the energy transition. we continue to explore multiple opportunities to build out and add to our current technologies and capabilities to support the growth, expanding breadth and strength of our business. our overall mission to decarbonize and electrify remains unchanged. we will continue to optimize our global footprint while using the leverage our global scale provides for operating and supply chain efficiencies to continue to drive down or maintain costs all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. given the broader wind and electric vehicle industry tailwinds, our position in the market and our relationship with our customers, we remain excited for the future here at tpi. finally, i want to thank all of our tpi associates for their commitment and dedication during these challenging times. thank you again for your time today.
and with that, operator, please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from laura sanchez with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everyone. can you hear me ok?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
hear you just fine, laura. thanks.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
hi, laura.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. hi. thank you for your time. so i understand that there is uncertainty around the ptc extension in the u.s. and that that's impacting volumes in 2021. could you please comment on what has changed for 2022 in regards to the wind market dynamics? i believe you had mentioned previously that 2022 was looking very strong but now you expect the market to be flat in 2022. so any comments there would be very helpful.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. laura, thanks for the question. i think we did comment on first quarter that volumes looked pretty good for us early on as it relates to 2022. that has not changed. i take our -- those comments about the market being flat, mostly from comments and discussions with our customers and our customers' customers. i think we've been pretty consistent with what the bulk of the market or the rest of the market has talked about for 2022 and potentially 2023 as being relatively flat compared to 2020, which was a big year. and then once some of the uncertainty around long-term policy, whether that be in the u.s. or how it's implemented in the eu is clarified, then i think we see some significant changes in volumes.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. and just to clarify, flat versus 2021, that would be right, not 2020?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. i'm sorry. i misspoke. that's correct.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, ok. and then on the dedicated manufacturing lines, i see that now you have 54 lines for the end of the year versus 50 in the prior guidance. can you help us understand a little bit the moving pieces? i know you have the four lines with siemens gamesa going away and four lines with nordex being added. so what's causing that increase?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. so it's a little bit of a technicality here. it is technically 54 at the end of the period. and so that would be at the end of the year and then because the contracts that expire, expire on 12/31 at the end of the year. so there are a number of contracts that are expiring at the end of this year. so going into 2022, we will have fewer than 54 lines under contract. we don't have a final number as of this point yet, but it will be less than 54.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. understood. and last question, if i may. the average selling price is going up for the year. wondering if this is purely driven by the new lines with nordex or that in a combination of you being able to raise prices given supply chain constraints?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
no. the primary driver of that is the raw material input costs going up. so that's causing the increase in the asp just based on how our contracts operate. and then yes, a portion of it is the nordex lines, but the larger piece is the raw material.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thank you so much. that's all in my end.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
thank you.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, laura.
operator
our next question will come from philip shen with roth capital partners. please go ahead.
donovan -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hi, guys. this is donovan [phonetic] on for phil. my first question is with the infrastructure bill and the potential reconciliation bill that would come at the end of the year, are you guys seeing anything -- when we talk about infrastructure, we tend to think about things like roads and bridges and railroads. but i also think -- it occurred to me that buses could be a direct spend. it's a huge part of -- i think it's actually the biggest source of public transportation. and so is there -- are you aware of any money or anything that was flagged or could be flagged just for municipalities or governments to purchase buses and it actually benefits the second quarter?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. there's a pretty significant amount of it that was aimed at transit and school buses in the bipartisan deal. so that -- and that's outlined in the deal. so there's a fair amount for that. from our -- that's great news for us and for our customers, clearly. but the biggest part of the infrastructure bill from a wind standpoint is transmission. and there is upwards of -- depending on how you score it, anywhere from $60 billion to $70 billion that has been allocated for some -- or for grid enhancement over a period of time. so we're pretty excited about the fact that infrastructure does take a -- or transmission takes a front seat here because again, we need to get the electrons to where people are from where it's generated and transmission is key to that.
donovan -- roth capital partners -- analyst
absolutely. that's great. so another question on proterra and nordex. you -- in the deck, you gave $460 million between proterra and nordex for the incremental for the contracts that you have. can you give us just a sense of the split between the two and over what time frame you're contemplating?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
no, we can't give you the direct split between the two, but the nordex deal is a three-year deal. the proterra deal is a two-year deal, a two-year extension.
donovan -- roth capital partners -- analyst
right. and then last -- just last question, one more, if i can. we're tracking through all the companies that we follow what's going on in terms of shipping and logistics. and it just occurs to me that you guys -- at least i know your customers are the ones who pay for the blade to ship them, but that will impact their level of demand and so on and so forth. so if we're looking at shipping costs and freight generally and trying to follow those trends, looking at indexes and such, is that a good proxy for moving a blade? or is -- are moving blades something meaningfully different where there could be a lag with other freight indexes or will this generally go with container shipment cost bottlenecks?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. very different from a blade standpoint. so there are specialized ships, and then there's obviously specialized rail fixtures as well as specialized truck fixtures. so it's really hard to compare it to a container. however, with that said, i mean we are impacted by container pricing as well, right, as we bring raw materials from different parts of the world to our manufacturing facilities. that gets added into the overall cost of the product, and a portion of that passed on to our customers just like the raw material price it would -- itself would be. so yes, i mean, if you look at the overall impact, logistics is a smaller piece of the overall increase that we're seeing this year, but it is meaningful as it relates to raw materials as opposed to blade.
donovan -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay. great. thank you. i'll pass the line. thank you.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes.
operator
our next question comes from eric stine with craig-hallum. please go ahead.
eric stine -- craig-hallum -- analyst
hi, everyone. jumped on late, so i hope i don't force you to repeat anything. but maybe just on the raw materials, can you remind us when -- or how the contracts are set up when they maybe reset based on price. and then i know you've kind of got the shared pain/gain setup that you've talked about. maybe just talk about the current situation in that context.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. so we have -- one of our customers is 100% responsible for raw material price increases. so that -- 100% of that goes to the customer. that just happens real time. as pricing goes up -- or as raw material input costs go up, price goes up. with our other 50% of our customers, if you will, it varies, but our average is 70-30. so 70% of that cost would get passed to our customer. we would absorb 30% of that generally. most of our contracts today reset quarterly. so you could have inter-quarter price increases, and then they would get passed. you would reset at the end of a quarter. in one instance, we had set -- we set price at the beginning of the year. so we happen -- in that case, we happen to absorb 100% of the raw material increase. so that's kind of across the board. so some of it, 100% of our customer absorbs it, other at 70-30 and that's reset quarterly. and in one case, it's a -- we absorb 100% of that on an annual basis.
eric stine -- craig-hallum -- analyst
and i guess, i mean this has been such an extreme situation. i mean it seems like the model you've got in place works when things are ""normal,"" but this is obviously not normal.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, i guess i would suggest it works in both situations, right? if we're in a situation where commodity prices are going down, we benefit and our customer benefits from that reduction in price. if prices are going up, like with a couple of commodities right now, we also share in that pain. so it's -- us taking 30% of it is better than taking a 100% of it. so we do limit our upside by limiting -- by reducing our downside. and that's kind of the nature of the contract and the relationship we have with our customers.
eric stine -- craig-hallum -- analyst
yes. no, that's fair. okay. maybe last one from me. just on the launch in china, i know working to fill those. and this has kind of been a question ongoing for some time, but any traction -- well, first of all, just traction in potentially filling those, but then secondly, traction with some of the local oems in china. i mean is there any interest or any possibility that they might sell some of those lines?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. we're -- i mean, we're still actively working those lines, if you will. it's a little bit tougher with the chinese oems from a cost standpoint. we have had many conversations with them, and those continue. nothing to report as of today. and then with our other -- with the western oems, we're still working on different scenarios with them in different combinations in our facility. so nothing specific to report but continuing to work it.
eric stine -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay, thank you.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question today will come from stephen gengaro with stifel. please go ahead.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, everybody. two things from me. the first being when -- you referenced your expectations for the market in 2022, just curious, when you think about your business, your contracts, your market position, should you kind of mimic the market? and maybe alongside of that, given what's gone on this year, can you expand margins in a flattish market next year?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. it's a good question. i think in response to laura's question earlier about lines under contract. so we'll have fewer lines under contract next year. we expect to have better utilization next year. so even though we expect a relatively flat year, we do expect better utilization. and with better utilization generally comes better margins. along those lines, we've been working really hard over the last few years on reducing our overheads, reducing -- making more cost variable than fixed. and so a combination of better utilization and continuing to drive cost and lean out our organization should begin to pay dividends next year.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you. and then just quickly on the non-wind blade side, you had a pretty sharp rise in transportation sales sequentially. it looks like that's kind of a seasonal thing or a timing thing because last year, the second quarter was similar. is there -- can you just kind of speak to the trend there on the non-wind blade side? and how -- because i see your full year guidance, but i was just trying to think about how it progresses throughout the year.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes. as you think about the non-wind blade sales, it's made up of, one, the transportation side, the field service side and some other revenue in there. so all of those are kind of contributing. i mean -- so you do have some seasonality with field services as we continue to ramp, especially you'll see some of that. so that's all going into those numbers right now.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
okay. thanks. and maybe just one final one. and you did talk about the changes in wind blade average selling prices and with raw materials being a big piece of that. but the underlying trend there, given blade length, etc., that should still continue to sort of trend higher over the next couple of years, just driven by blade design and larger blades, correct?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yes.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. longer blades, more importantly, heavier blades, right, and then also the content of the blades. so as more blades go to carbon from pure glass, you'll see an increase in the asp as well.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you, gentlemen.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. thank you.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from tom curran with seaport research partners. please go ahead.
tom curran -- seaport research partners -- analyst
good afternoon.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
hi, tom. how are you doing?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
hi, tom.
tom curran -- seaport research partners -- analyst
bryan, when it comes to the measures you've been taking to create a more resilient, flexible supply chain, could you give us an update on localization? where are you at now in terms of what you've achieved? and then what do you still aspire to do when it comes to that initiative?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
hi, tom. this is bill. i'll take that one. it continues to be a very important initiative for us for a whole number of reasons. i mean going through covid, us having localized a number of suppliers the way we had prior to that certainly benefited us during that period. and we will continue -- i can't give you a specific number as to the percentage that's local versus not. but i can tell you four key commodities. we're continuing to work on more and more localization or regionalization for the very reasons, it's security of supply as well as price. so we're going to continue to focus on that. i can't give you a specific number on that one at this point. but suffice it to say, that continues to be a priority for our team.
tom curran -- seaport research partners -- analyst
that's fair. thanks, bill. and then when it comes to the four lines in juarez that we'll be getting relinquished by sgre, at this point, just based on your current oem conversations and indications, would you expect those to most likely be absorbed by an existing customer or a new one?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
i would say probably an existing one given that we've got the top five outside of china. i don't see a chinese oem coming in there. so i think it's more likely that it's one of our existing customers.
tom curran -- seaport research partners -- analyst
right. just wanted to see if there was any one that potentially new on the horizon looking to move into the u.s. and then last one from me, for field service, inspection and repair services, could you just update us on what your current customer mix is between turbine oems and then wind farm owners and operators and whether or not there's any notable changes occurring within that mix?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
i would say it's probably 90-10, maybe 85-15, oem versus asset owner. we're having -- we continue to have a lot of discussions, and it depends on the region, quite frankly. in the u.s., it's primarily oems; in mexico, might be more asset owner; china, asset owner to some extent. so it just -- it varies by region, but it's still predominantly oem.
tom curran -- seaport research partners -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my questions.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
with that, thank you.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
thanks.

[operator instructions] our next question today will come from pavel molchanov with raymond james. please go ahead.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i jumped on late. so i apologize if you covered this already, but in the context of what's happened with covid in india, specifically in the last 100 days or so, can you give an update on the status of your operations there and the personnel?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. actually, we managed through that very well, pavel. thanks for the question. it did impact us slightly from a production standpoint, more so from raw material availability because of suppliers, but again, managed it very well. we have a significant portion of our associates there are now vaccinated. and so it did not impact us material in any way at this point.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
good to hear. and across your global manufacturing footprint, all five countries, are there any operations where there is capacity constraint on either a regulatory basis or due to agreement with the union?
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
because of covid?
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. in the context of -- yes.
william e. siwek -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. no, we -- no union constraints. and again, as you know, we're unionized in turkey and in matamoros, no constraints there. and i will tell you in china, and this is very recent, we were on a voluntary shutdown in one of our plants in china for a number of reasons. it's likely we'll be shut down an extra week there because of what china would call an outbreak. there's like 32 -- 128 cases in yangzhou city, so relatively small for the numbers we're used to in the u.s. and elsewhere, but they tend to shut things down pretty quickly there with their zero tolerance. so i would expect we'll be shut down for an additional week unplanned but will not impact our overall volume for the quarter or for the year.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
perfect. good to hear it. thank you very much.

operator
greetings. welcome to the tpi composites third quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions]
i will now turn the call over to your host, christian edin, investor relations at tpi composites. you may begin.
christian edin -- investor relations
thank you, operator. i'd like to welcome everyone to tpi composites' third quarter 2021 earnings call. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call, based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements, if any of our key assumptions are incorrect because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our website, tpicomposites.com. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation, for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the comparable gaap financial measures.
with that, let me turn the call over to bill siwek, tpi composites' president, and ceo.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
thanks christian, and good afternoon everyone. thank you for joining our call. in addition to christian, i'm joined today by bryan schumaker, our cfo. i will briefly review our third-quarter results, including the strategic financing transaction announced today. i will also cover our global operations, including our supply chain and the wind energy market more broadly. bryan will then review our financial results and financing activities in more detail, and then we'll open the call for q&a.
please turn to slide 5. today we announced that we signed a contract with vestas to add three additional lines in yangzhou starting production in 2022, and we extended a two-line contract with nordex in turkey. these deals added approximately $150 million potential future revenue under contract. i am also pleased to announce today that we have entered into a stock purchase agreement to issue and sell $400 million of series a preferred stock to investment funds managed by oaktree capital management. under the terms of the agreement, tpi will issue and sell $350 million of series a to oaktree, subject to customary closing conditions. tpi also may elect at its option to require oaktree to purchase an additional $50 million of series a, upon the same terms and conditions as the initial issuance of series a, during the two-year period following the closing of the initial issuance.
subject to the mutual agreement of tpi and oaktree, oaktree may invest an additional $200 million for follow-on capital. oaktree is an experienced investor across the power and energy value chains and today's announcement is a strong endorsement of our strategy and growth prospects. oaktree's investment will strengthen our balance sheet significantly and positions tpi to navigate a rapidly evolving market and operating environment in the near term while providing the flexibility to take advantage of longer-term growth opportunities. we will discuss the terms of the oaktree investment in more detail later in the call.
before i jump into our results and operations, it's important to note that we remain focused on operating our business safely, while continuing to mitigate the impacts of covid-19 and ensuring that we are prepared to deal with continued resurgences of the virus in any of our global locations. we have and will continue to adapt our operating procedures in order to enable our associates to work safely and continue to meet our customers' demands.
to summarize, q3 was clearly disappointing from a financial perspective as market conditions continue to deteriorate, as most of our customers have already discussed publicly. so although we delivered net sales of $479.6 million, a slight increase over q3 of 2020, we ended the quarter with breakeven adjusted ebitda. the takeover of the nordex facility in matamoros has not gone as planned and we have experienced significant delays in production, while needing to upgrade the team. we are in the process of transforming the operations into a world-class facility, like the facility, we operate across the street [phonetic], but it's taking more time and resources than originally anticipated. this was one of the primary factors for our poor financial results during q3, and it will carry over into q4 as well. however, we expect to have the operation stabilized by the end of the year and plan to have a much more successful 2022 in this location.
in juarez, mexico, we are in the middle of a transition to an innovative blade, and with the innovation sometimes comes challenges. in addition to delays moving from design to prototype and finally, to production, we encountered multiple delays related to specialized equipment and component parts. as a result, our volume for the quarter was negatively impacted as our full-year volumes. as with our new operations in matamoros, we expect these challenges to be behind us, by the end of the year and anticipate reaching full production volume in that factory during 2022.
in china, our yangzhou factory was shut down for three weeks due to a small covid outbreak in yangzhou city. we lost 10 sets in the quarter, but we expect to make those up in q4. supply chain and logistics challenges continue to plague the industry and we were not immune from them in q3. certain customer-directed raw materials were in short supply, which caused production slowdowns in multiple plants. lost volume related to these shortages was nearly 80 sets in q3, and will be just over 150 sets for the full year.
furthermore, raw material and logistics costs remained at elevated levels and had an overall impact in the quarter of approximately $20 million and an estimated full-year impact of nearly $30 million. with the announced suspension of production in our iowa plant at the end of 2021, volumes at that plant were reduced to minimize production risk, as we wrap up our current customer commitment in that location.
with these challenges and those facing the industry over the next year or so, our focus has been on managing our liquidity and raising additional capital to strengthen our balance sheet and to prepare for the next wave of significant growth in the industry. our announcement today of the strategic investment by oaktree will provide us with the additional flexibility to manage our business through these near-term headwinds.
turning to slide 6; i'll now give you a quick update of our global operations, as well as a market update. during the third quarter, we did not have any lost volume at any of our facilities related to covid-19 outbreaks or government mandates, except for the short interruption in yangzhou. however, we did experience material, unexpected production delays in turkey, mexico and china, because of shortages of customer-directed and supplied raw materials. we continue to evaluate our global footprint, to ensure it is optimized for us, our customers, and the market. as we discussed last quarter, we are planning to consolidate our chinese operations into yangzhou, to reduce costs, streamline activities and meet the expected future demand of our customers. our yangzhou facility is world-class and can handle, both onshore and offshore blades. this prime location is the ideal place to consolidate our china operations and efficiently serve our customers.
with respect to the facility in juarez, that will become available in 2022, we are actively seeking to backfill the four production lines with one or more customers, as we believe these operations will continue to be one of the best low-cost options for blade supply into the u.s. and mexico in the future. interest for this capacity is high, but timing is dependent on the u.s. market recovery and the final provisions of the build back better plan, if passed. we are not anticipating any production in this facility during 2022.
due primarily to continued uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment and the expected impact on u.s. demand over the next couple of years, we do not currently have any planned volume for our newton, iowa facility in 2022. as a result, we are in the unfortunate position of needing to suspend manufacturing at the facility at the end of december 2021. we have extended the facility lease through 2022, to give us and our current customer or others time to evaluate the final provisions of the proposed build back better plan, to determine if the facility can be economically viable in the future.
with respect to our global service business, during the third quarter, we continued to focus on profitable global growth. our team has been successful in securing new work from oems as well as asset owners. to accelerate our growth in europe, our plan is to open a training center in spain in the fourth quarter, to complement our americas training center. we expect to have 3x topline growth during 2021 and expect another doubling in 2022, all on an organic basis.
on the transportation front, our pilot production program for a production passenger electric vehicle manufacturer, has been extended, as we have demonstrated the ability to scale our production in a cost-effective manner on our high-volume composite production line. this has also led to another pilot program with the same oem, that will kick off in q4 of 2021. additionally, we are continuing to collaborate with multiple oems on cabin body structures, along with other critical ev components.
as i mentioned earlier, our supply chain, like every other supply chain is continuing to face challenges. as discussed on the last call, we have seen increased costs relating to resin, carbon, fiber, and logistics. while we can pass on a majority and in some cases 100% of the cost increases to our customers, the portion we are not able to pass on, has had a material impact on our margins and we expect that impact to continue through the balance of 2021 and through 2022. after increasing by almost 80% globally year-over-year, resin prices were flat in the third quarter, but we did see a slight tick-up in october, with a continued focus on margin expansion by our supply base. we do however expect pricing to continue to be relatively flat in the first half of 2022, before beginning to drop in the second half.
capacity constraints continued for carbon fiber, with pricing up over 20% year-over-year. with demand exceeding supply in multiple industries, we expect pricing to increase in 2022, virtually, all of which we can contractually pass on to our customers. overall, we expect to be able to hold the average bill of material costs, for customers for which we control the supply chain, to a less than 2% increase over 2021 levels, and expect to see commodity pricing begin to normalize in the second half of 2022 for many commodities. logistics costs are also expected to remain high throughout most of 2022.
so turning to the overall wind market in slide 7, since our last call, the build back better plan was introduced and includes a 10-year ptc extension with prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. importantly, the bill includes a 10-year direct pay provision, although it requires certain domestic content requirements to be met to obtain 100% direct pay. the bbb also includes an advanced manufacturing production credit of $0.02 per watt from 2022 through 2026 on u.s. manufactured wind blades, and then it is phased down through 2029. so as an example, the blades for a 4-megawatt turbine would receive an estimated $80,000 tax credit. as with the ptc, direct pay would be available.
other aspects of the bill that may help grow the wind market, include storage and transmission tax credits and grants, loans, and tax credits for hydrogen made from renewable energy. in addition, there are significant grants, rebates, and tax credits to drive the acceleration of the decarbonization of the vehicle fleet, for both electric passenger and commercial vehicles, and charging the infrastructure, which we believe could help accelerate the growth of our transportation business.
finally, the now passed infrastructure investment and jobs act includes $550 billion in new federal investment and u.s. infrastructure to help tackle climate change, by making investments in clean energy transmission and electric vehicle infrastructure, electrifying thousands of school and transit buses, and creating a new grid deployment authority to support upgrading the electric grid. this should be a further catalyst for renewables and ev growth in the u.s.
notwithstanding the positive long-term impact in the u.s. of the build back better plan and the infrastructure investment and jobs act, we expect decreased demand during the remainder of 2021, and expect volumes and therefore blade revenue and adjusted ebitda on a billings basis to be flat or slightly down in 2022, due to less than optimal capacity utilization, due to uncertainty in the u.s. market and elevated raw material and logistics costs globally.
longer-term, we believe the future for wind energy will strengthen significantly, given the necessity to decarbonize and electrify to meet the aggressive goals set by nations around the world, to combat climate change. in its roadmap to zero emissions by 2050, the international energy agency expects that by 2030, 390 gigawatts of wind will be installed annually, or about four times more than the global record set in 2020. we believe that we are uniquely positioned with our global footprint in key strategic geographies to grow our market share with the industry-leading turbine oems through this expected period of rapid growth. the next decade is both critical and a terrific opportunity for tpi.
before i turn it over to bryan, i would like to reiterate that we remain focused on the health and safety of our associates, while executing on our operating imperatives and esg goals, which include safety, diversity inclusion, and driving to become carbon-neutral by 2030.
with that let me turn the call over to bryan. thanks bill. please turn to slide 11. all comparisons made today will be on a year-over-year basis compared to the same period in 2020. for the third quarter ended september 30th, 2021, net sales increased by $5.5 million or 1.2% to $479.6 million. net sales of wind blades were relatively flat at $450.7 million. net sales were positively impacted by an increase in the average selling price due to the mix of wind blade models produced, offset by a 20% decrease in the number of wind blades produced primarily due to the reduction in manufacturing lines under contract in china. q3 was also impacted by the transition to an innovative blade in juarez, mexico. the impact on our production due to a shortage of raw material supplied by our customers and a temporary shutdown of our yangzhou manufacturing facility due to covid-19 outbreak in yangzhou city. q3 2021 asp was approximately $172,000, an increase of 19% year-over-year. startup and transition costs for the quarter increased $6 million to $14.5 million, as we continue to transition lines to longer and innovative blades in mexico, and ramp up production at the facility we took over from nordex in matamoros. our general and administrative expenses for the quarter decreased by $1.1 million to $8.2 million and g&a as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 1.7% of net sales. foreign currency income was $4 million in q3 2021, as compared to a foreign currency loss of $17.1 million in q3 2020. this change was primarily due to net euro liability exposure against the turkish lira. the liability exposure continues to be naturally hedged on a cash flow basis, due to our euro-denominated revenue contracts. approximately 23% of our revenue in q3 2021 was denominated in euros. our income tax provision for the quarter was $8.2 million as compared to a tax benefit of $32.3 million for the prior-year period. we are forecasting our cash tax liability to be $22 million to $25 million for 2021. net loss for the quarter was $30.7 million as compared to net income of $42.4 million in the same period in 2020. the decrease in net income was primarily due to the reasons previously described. net loss per share was $0.83 for the quarter, compared to diluted net income per share of $1.13 for the same period in 2020. our adjusted ebitda for q3 was breakeven, with the utilization rate of 76% for lines installed at quarter-end. this compares to an adjusted ebitda of $49.1 million or 10.4% of net sales and utilization of 93% in the same period in 2020. q3 was significantly lower than we forecasted. it was impacted by approximately $10 million due to the challenges in the nordex facility we took over in matamoros, $6.3 million related to the transition to the innovative blade in juarez, mexico, and $2 million associated with a three-week production shutdown of our facility in yangzhou, china. in addition, there was approximately $16 million net impact related to asc 606. the net impact was the result of three main components; first, a change in estimates for raw material costs in 2020. for example, in q2 we expected certain raw material costs like resin to start declining in q4 of 2021. now, we are forecasting resin costs to stay constant throughout 2022 in our asc 606 models. second, we are contractually entitled to liquidate damage from our customers, due to supply or shortages of customer-controlled raw material. however, under the percentage of completion accounting for these contracts required under 606, there was limited recognition of the liquidated damages in the quarter. finally, we are negatively impacted under asc 606 for new lines contracted and existing lines extended, that bill referenced earlier, as the profitability assumptions built into our prior forecast, were impacted by adding the new lines and extending the old lines. moving to slide 12; we ended the quarter with $119 million of cash and cash equivalents, and net debt of $143.8 million. since quarter-end, our liquidity has been significantly impacted by the slow production ramp in our matamoros facility, the transition challenges we were facing in our juarez facility, shortages of customer directed and supplied raw materials, and forecasted reductions of demand -- reduction due to reduced customer demand in q4 2021 and 2022. our leverage ratio was 2.98 times in q3 or more than our maximum allowed ratio of 2.75. we have obtained a 30-day waiver from the bank group, which we believe will allow us time to close the oaktree funding. the commitment from oaktree will strengthen our balance sheet significantly during our rapidly evolving market. the proceeds will be raised from a series a preferred stock financing, will be used to repay in full, the amounts outstanding under our credit agreement. turning to slide 13; for 2021, our full-year guidance is revenue of between $1.72 billion and $1.74 billion. adjusted ebitda of between $30 million and $40 million. our adjusted ebitda guidance for the year relative to the guidance we provided during the second quarter results, relates to three main items we have highlighted on slide 14. first, as bill walked through, we have experienced greater than expected delays and cost related to our matamoros facility. these account for approximately $15 million adjusted ebitda impact in 2021. the second key item relates to our juarez facility and greater than expected cost and delays. this accounts for approximately $16 million of our adjusted ebitda impact in 2021. lastly, approximately $16 million of our 2021 adjusted ebitda guidance change relates to a non-cash accounting impact related to asc 606. we don't expect any changes to our dedicated manufacturing lines and wind blade set capacity versus what we disclosed during the second quarter earnings call. utilization of approximately 76%, asp of approximately $165,000. we saw strong asp in q3 of approximately $172,000, but the annual asp is being impacted by the decrease in the number of blades produced in q3 and the mix forecasted to be produced in q4. non-blade sales of between $120 million and $125 million, an increase of the low-end of $5 million compared to our previous guidance. capex of between $40 million and $45 million, a decrease to our previous guidance. startup costs of between $17 million and $20 million, this increase is due to the production ramp of the facility for nordex in matamoros, as well as the transition in juarez. and finally, we are now forecasting to incur a total of approximately $45 million of restructuring charges associated with global footprint alignment in 2021 and 2022, with approximately $30 million forecast to be incurred in 2021. approximately 15% of the restructuring charges will be non-cash. i will now turn it back to bill, to go into a little more detail on our capital raising activities. thanks bryan. turning to slide 16, given ongoing and near-term headwinds facing the industry, we have been focused on enhancing balance sheet strength, and the best position of the company to manage through a difficult operating environment and set us up for the long term. as i noted earlier, we have entered into an agreement to initially sell $350 million of series a preferred stock to oaktree, and we may also elect at our option to require oaktree to purchase an additional $50 million of series a upon the same terms and conditions as the initial issuance of the series a during the two-year period following the effective date of the agreement. the outstanding series a will have an 11% dividend, which may be payable in kind for the first two years. oaktree will also be receiving approximately 4.7 million warrants with a five-year term issued at a per-share exercise price of $0.01 per share. in addition to the $400 million upfront commitment, oaktree may invest an additional capital of $200 million based on terms to be mutually agreed to. turning to slide 17 through 19, please; the oaktree investment will significantly improve our balance sheet position, reducing net leverage from 2.98 times to a net cash position on a pro forma basis as of september 30, 2021, with pro forma total liquidity of $251 million, including $201 million of unrestricted cash. this liquidity provides additional flexibility to manage our business through near-term industry headwinds. available liquidity and access to the potential incremental $200 million of capital from oaktree, can also provide us with the flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, including by leveraging oaktree's global relationships resources and expertise. we view this investment by oaktree as a strong endorsement of tpi strategy, and long-term prospects. with that, operator, please open the call for questions.

thank you. we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] your first question comes from philip shen with roth capital partners. please go ahead.
philip shen -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hi everyone, thanks for taking my questions. the first one is on the oaktree deal. in terms of the shares, can you talk through how many were issued and at what price?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah. so it will be three -- initially phil it will be $350 million of series a preferred and $4.7 million warrants to purchase common shares at a $0.01 a piece.
philip shen -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay, got it.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes.
philip shen -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thanks for that will. shifting over to the outlook for 2022, i know you haven't provided official guidance, but i was wondering if you could talk through how you expect revenue or volumes to trend, and then how margins might trend as well, as we get through the year?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah. i think phil, we said that blade revenue would be relatively flat year-over-year and ebitda on a billings basis would be relatively flat on a billings basis if you will, volumes are down a bit from a sets perspective. we expect them to be down a bit in 2022 and that's a number of things, right? the iowa facility and our -- one of our facilities in juarez which we'll finish production for our customer there in the middle of the month, and then just overall softening of u.s. demand out of our other plans.
philip shen -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thanks bill. and then from a quarterly basis, do you expect the cadence to be for trough metrics to maybe be in q1., and then things to improve sequentially, as we get through q4 '22 or do you expect either some sense of -- some degree of seasonality or some other factors that might perhaps make it not sequentially growing like that or improving? thanks.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah it's -- we're not prepared to speak specific quarter-to-quarter quite yet. but i mean if you look at the last couple of years, q4 has historically been a little bit low, part of that has been either ptc push, you get things delivered by september 30, so they can get installed by q4, but then there is -- they take a breather in q4, as far as production. so i would expect to see similar cadence, at least in q4.
philip shen -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay, great. thanks bill. i'll pass it on.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
thanks phil.

next question. james west with evercore isi.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good afternoon guys.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
hey james.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
curious also on the capital raise here, particularly the incremental $200 million that's available, that i think bill you highlighted kind of for opportunities or opportunistically deployment. are there are certain opportunities that are unfolding, that you may be able to act on near-term, or is this more of a -- let's line it up, so something does comes through?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah hi, thanks for the question, james. i would say there certainly are opportunities that are out there, with the dislocation in the industry over the next year or two, there could be more interesting opportunities. so it's really not earmarked for any particular transaction. it's more from an opportunistic standpoint. so hopefully that answers your question.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
that makes sense. and then, as we think about a little bit longer-term, '23 to '25 should see a nice ramp-up in the wind industry. how are you guys thinking about capacity for that period and beyond? would you add more capacity in '22, even though the market itself would be flattish, would you need contracts to add capacity, i mean, how -- i guess, can you help us think about, how you guys are viewing that opportunity set?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, no, -- i see -- unless there is a very specific situation, adding capacity in a market where there is currently overcapacity, doesn't sound like a very good move from our perspective, but to your point, as we get into '24 and beyond, if the projections of iea and others are even half right, there is going to be a significant increase in installation and build. and so clearly, we're going to use this period, where we think it's relatively flat, especially in the u.s. to put ourselves in the right position geographically, to make sure that we can capture more than our share of the market, if you will, with our current and potential customers.
so again, i wouldn't expect anything in the very near term, just given the market and the amount of capacity in the market today. quite frankly, i'd love to get our plants back into the 90s, right from the high 70s. so to me, it's still our existing capacity, because we are in great locations, geographically. we cover the world very, very cost-effectively. so our goal is fill our existing capacity, and then we will think about future capacity.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, thanks. got it, bill. thanks.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. thank you.

next question adhok bellurkar with bank of america.
adhok bellurkar -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, good evening. thank you so much for taking the question. just wanted to quickly follow up on the points you've made about ebitda, as you see for fy '22. when you say, you see it mostly being flat on a billing basis. just wanted to understand, if that meant the $55 million with or without the asc 606 impact?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, that is without it right now, because of the volatility that we're seeing right now with raw material costs and other things, it's just not worth forecasting at this point. so that's why we just gave the indication on a billings basis. we think that makes more sense. that's how we look at it. that's how oaktree is going to look at it going forward. so it just makes more sense to do it that way, rather than trying to manage the volatility we're seeing in the asc 606.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's -- that's a better reflection of cash generation, adhok, from our perspective, and being able to predict what our customers might do with volume or not and where raw material pricing is going, makes it very difficult to accurately forecast 606 the way it works, especially pinned with the nature of our contracts.
adhok bellurkar -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then with respect to the new lines that you added with vestas and two with nordex, what's the duration of that $150 million contract? is it through fy '22 or beyond?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, so for the lines with vestas, it's beyond '22 and with nordex it's through 2022.
adhok bellurkar -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. and then one last one for me and i'll pass it on. i was curious about just any progress on the offshore front? i know one of your customers announced winning offshore work in the u.s. and deciding to work with their supply chain partners in the u.s. so, i know it's in '24-'25 timeframe, but anything for what it means for you in that timeframe?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. we're working hard adhok. i mean it's complicated on the east coast, as i know you're well aware, but that every, every state wants a blade plant, and then a cell plant, and a tower plant, and picking the right place, and of course having a customer to do that with, is important. so we have, we're spending a significant amount of time and energy on it, but that's about as much as i can tell you at this point.
adhok bellurkar -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.

next question, eric stine with craig-hallum.
eric stine -- craig-hallum -- analyst
hi everyone.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
hey, eric? how are you?
eric stine -- craig-hallum -- analyst
i am doing well. thanks. so just on the iowa plant and for obvious reasons, given the uncertainty, your expectations are pretty low for 2022. but in the -- unlikely event that an oem decided whether it's ge or another one, decided that they wanted to bring on production there, i mean maybe a rough idea of how long that would take, to bring up a line, and whether it's different if it's the one that is ending at the end of the year, versus a new one?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. clearly, if it's -- if there is a pause if you will, and it's the same blade, the challenges are associates. obviously, we want to provide them with an opportunity, to find other work if there is uncertainty, with whether it goes forward, but, and that's what we're going to do. but as far as the ramp-up, if it's the existing line, it's really about being able to hire for the existing lines. it's really being about -- being able to hire associates to ramp it. so, if you think about having to hire a workforce if -- again, if there is a pause and our existing workforce finds other work, then it's probably a six-month process to do that.
eric stine -- craig-hallum -- analyst
got it. okay. and then maybe just -- i mean with ge, i know you've got the co-development agreement for advanced blades. just any thoughts on maybe where the overall relationship stands, that agreement stands, in light of what's going on in iowa?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah. so as you know, we also manufacture blades for them in two facilities in mexico and we are producing an innovative blade in one of those plants. so the relationship is still -- is very strong. we continue to collaborate with them on that aspect, and continue to build blades for them and plan to build blades for them for a very long time. so, i would say the relationship remains very strong, as it has been for a long time and we aim to keep it that way.
eric stine -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay. thank you.

next question, laura sanchez with morgan stanley.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. thank you for your time. i want to follow up on the ebitda question. i think it was after second q earnings, you had quantified what was the material benefit to ebitda margin from the siemens gamesa lines going away in mexico, and from the ge lines at that time potentially going away in the u.s.? and now that we know that those contracts with ge are rolling off, can you tell us a little bit about the dynamics eating that benefit on improvement in 2022?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, i think. thanks for the question, laura. nice to talk you. so it is true, it's accretive to our overall earnings, with the shutdown of the plant in mexico, as well as iowa. i will tell you though, our iowa plant is a fantastic plant. it's just -- we're in a high-cost area, which makes it difficult to be competitive. we will see under this advanced manufacturing production credit, whether that gives us some life there. we would like to have that happen clearly. but i think laura, it's really -- it's commodity costs that we didn't expect to linger this long. it's the logistics challenges that we expect to carry through 2022, and quite frankly, its demand and volume. so you might have heard me earlier on an answer, talking about the volume because of the softness in the u.s. market, and it's really when we're at lower utilization levels, that we expect in 2022, that can eat up that gain fairly quickly.
now, we're working on making our business more variable, to be able to better manage through some of the demand swings that we've been seeing more frequently. i will tell you, since i've been around, i've never seen as many demand swings quarter-to-quarter as we've seen over the last year -- last year and a half. so i think our business has become a little bit tougher to forecast, because of our customer's needs in their end-demand, and just the uncertainty in the market. and so that's probably -- that is the main reason for not seeing as much benefit in what we think our 2022 ebitda will be, as a result of those closures.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood, thank you, bill, for the color. and on the matamoros in the juarez facilities that are seeing challenges this quarter, i guess what gives you confidence, and that those issues will go away by the end of the year?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah. so in matamoros, we've replaced the entire management team there, that we inherited. we are going to move between 150 and 200 associates from juarez to matamoros when we finish production in the plant that's closing down, that should be literally in a week. we have a very experienced and talented global team, that is residing in matamoros right now, to get it turned around. we've seen significant progress over the last several weeks from a cycle time stamp put and a throughput stamp put. and so with the additional troops coming, if you will, from juarez, as well as the team we have in place there now, as well as support from just our overall infrastructure in matamoros, we're very confident that we get this thing turned around by the end of the quarter, and going into next year, we're ready to rock and roll at full production. i mean, are customers expecting it? we are going to run flat out there all year, and so we're confident and we're devoting the resources.
as it relates to the juarez challenge, again this is an innovative new blade that went from design to prototype to production. you tend to have challenges when you have a new innovative blade like this. we continue to work side-by-side with our customer there. we've figured out where the challenges are, from a production standpoint. we've got a solution for that, and that solution should be implemented toward the middle half or end of q4, which gives us a lot of confidence, start rolling into 2022, we will be able to hit the volumes that our customers are asking us for.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it, got it. and the last one on my end, you've talked about flat [phonetic] wind revenues in 2022, and i think you gave a reference on the service side of the business, that could double in 2022. any commentary on the transportation and the position or the other revenues, non-wind-related?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah. so yeah, on the transportation side, we're still -- i think we've made a lot of progress over the last couple of quarters, with jerry lavine coming onboard as our president of transportation, refocusing the group, really kind of reevaluating and focusing our strategy, and what our target markets are, and we've already seen some success from that. from the additional pilot production with the existing ev passenger manufacturer that we are producing for, to some really neat and interesting opportunities related to battery components -- battery box components, if you will, as well as other structural cabs or components, whether they be cabs or other aspects.
so we're looking at some -- we have got a joint development agreement on some very unique composite technology, that we think is going to be significantly more cost-effective to do what we do, and provide a higher quality and easier to assemble vehicle. so we would remain bullish on what the opportunity is there. albeit it is taking longer than we had originally anticipated, the traction we've gained over the last several quarters has been really significant.
so again, the revenue numbers aren't going to be huge yet. we do expect next year to continue to be another investment year, but at much lower levels than we've seen over the last couple of years. and then rolling into '23, we expect to be profitable.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst

next question, stephen gengaro with stifel.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
hi stephen.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
hi. so can you give us a sense from what you're seeing, i know you have mentioned ebitda, but when you look at 2022, how do you think about the different parts of free cash flow generation, or cash flow in general? or how should we be thinking about sort of the puts and takes and given the transaction you announced tonight. i was just curious how you're thinking about 2022 cash flow?
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer
yeah. so if you look at the announcements that we've had around the restructuring and the charges we're taking, the majority of that is all cash outflow, 85% of it. so we see that hitting us kind of late q4 and into q1. so that's where we see the significant need of cash right now, as kind of that timeframe is over the next six months.
as far as kind of the overall picture of next year. i mean working capital and that, we don't see big drags on that throughout the remainder of the year. we're really focusing on limiting capex, as we're not growing. so we're trying to focus on a lot of that, but it's this next six months in the liquidity drain that we saw kind of from these other plants, and then overall, how long does this shortfall come throughout 2022, and make sure we're positioning ourselves for the future.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah. and i guess just to pile on a little bit, i think we talked about volume likely to be down next year from an asset standpoint and lower than desired capacity utilization. so when you have that in a business that is relatively -- there is a fair amount of fixed costs related to that. you'll see some -- you're not going to see that significant free cash flow that we would like to see. so i think until we get back, our capacity utilization up to the levels that we would like to see and volumes become more stable quarter-to-quarter, that's when you'll start to see us generating that free cash flow, that we all would like to see.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
great, thanks. and just as a follow-up, i think to another question, what are you seeing on the labor side? are you -- how has that been -- how difficult has that been to manage and kind of how you're thinking about the labor side going forward?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, we, you know -- it's a great question and it really varies a bit by geography. i would tell you though for technical talent, there is a war. i mean, there is a war for talent out there, and engineering talent, technical talent, we have a very good technical team. we have some of the best minds in the business and the best folks to build blades in the business. and so, they are in high demand. so we -- it's tough, it's tough to replace if we lose. so the key is to not lose them, right. so we focus a lot on our people programs, a lot on engagement and how do we make sure we keep our associates engaged, understand what their needs are, and so that's the name of the game for us. i mean we've dropped turnover year-over-year in the last few years by significant amounts, which quite frankly, saves us a significant amount of money. but it's all about engagement and how we're dealing with them, and giving them the right career path. so i will tell you, for technical talent, it's very competitive. generally, at the more direct labor position, i don't think we see -- iowa was a bit of a challenge from a workforce standpoint, just because the workforce is a bit smaller. but most of our locations, we don't really have a problem from that standpoint at this time.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst

pearce hammond -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah, thank you for taking my questions. just curious, with the setup that you now have with oaktree, and the potential for $600 million worth of investment, as you steer out into next year. and thanks for the helpful info on next year. do you think this takes care of you, kind of in all scenarios from a liquidity standpoint for next year?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, i would tell you, we think that the investment by oaktree gives us significant -- sufficient capital to weather the near-term challenges or the headwinds that i've said probably three or four times in my prepared remarks. but absolutely we think we have more -- we have some cushion as well, but certainly, enough for the near-term challenges, and that cushion is, to the extent, the downturn extends longer than most think it will. so we've spent a lot of time on what our working capital needs are, what our outlook looks like for '22. anticipating a relatively flat '23, just from a planning standpoint and that's how we kind of size the deal, and made sure that we have adequate liquidity to carry us through kind of this challenging period, specifically in the u.s. market over the next couple of years, and positions us very well for opportunistic growth, once the market turns.
pearce hammond -- piper sandler -- analyst
excellent. thank you for the helpful answer. and then my follow-up, if you can provide any color as to how the deal came about with oaktree specifically versus other alternatives, obviously oaktree is a very well respected marquee type investor. but just curious, so you can provide some color about how it all came about?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, we spent a fair amount of time with our financial advisor. we use lazard, a little plug [phonetic] for them. but yes, we spend a bunch of time with lazard evaluating what our options were, and i will tell you, the folks at oaktree get us, they get our industry. they get renewables. they're excited about the energy transition. they've done a lot of investing in kind of an adjacent space, with array and schulz [phonetic] and the like. so they really understand kind of what our challenges are, what the industry challenges are, but also with the industry opportunity is. and so, i don't think we could have picked a better partner. we're really excited about the people we're working with and in the skills they bring. and so, that's it. i mean it's experience in the industry, understanding our story, understanding our strategy, and then the people, right, i mean peoples' important here and we're going to have to work closely with them for a long time and they brought a great team to the table.

next question, pavel molchanov with raymond james.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. given your global operating footprint and even more global sales mix, you've often talked about being able to kind of reroute blades to different geographies, just depending on where the demand comes from. so given the softness you referred to in the united states, can you give some examples of places where demand is perhaps better than expected, kind of an upside surprise?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, i would tell you, turkey, next year is -- we expect it to be flat out and being asked for more. so i think that's good. india remains pretty strong for us. with the new -- obviously new lines in china with vestas is important. so we expect to have a good year there. so yeah, i mean -- and then our plants that are really u.s. centric, which would be the ones along the border in juarez. now matamoros, we're pretty close to a port, so they can export from matamoros, if they choose to. but most of what we build today, comes into the u.s. market. so those are the plants where -- with the exception of the nordex plant, the volumes are a little bit -- we expect the volumes to be down a little bit next year, just because of the u.s. market.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and the strength in turkey and india, is that domestic in turkey and india, or are these export opportunities for example, going to u.k., germany, etc?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, i would say, the vast majority of what we're producing in turkey, is being exported. now we do have lines for very strong players in turkey, which helps. so there is a fair amount of domestic demand. but i will tell you the vast majority does get exported out, and i would say the bulk of that is to europe. europe is our second-largest market behind the u.s.

next question, mark strouse with j.p. morgan.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, thanks very much for taking my questions. bill, to the extent that your customers are sharing this with you, can you just kind of talk about the -- i hate to use this phrase, the kind of shovel-ready projects that are out there, just kind of waiting for some visibility from build back better, could they immediately kind of start construction then, or do we kind of -- is that the beginning of what would be kind of a more normal project cycle?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, i'd tell you, mark. i don't have really good visibility on specific -- now i do on a few, and those are the ones that we're pushing hard this year, to get delivered to a couple of different customers out of mexico, clearly. but it's -- we usually don't know exactly where the blades are going, so i don't -- again i have general data, but not very specific data with respect to the shovel-ready deal. so i apologize, i'm probably not the best person to answer that question.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
sure. yeah, understood. and then just a follow-up kind of technical question. the $0.02 per watt domestic blade manufacturing credit, if that passes. can you just talk about how that gets layered into your existing contracts? would that be a complete upside to tpi, would be shared with your customers? would it require some kind of rewriting of your existing contracts?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
it's great question. technically, it goes to the manufacturer, which would be tpi, and i think that would factor in to -- again trying to -- trying to make the u.s. plants economically viable. so if we got the credit, our customer could have a lower price, which would make it competitive with a blade brought from another geography, if you will, right, or if our customer got it for some reason, then they could afford to pay us more for the blade and still have the margin. so the way i understand it right now and again, it's still pretty fluid, but it would come to us as the manufacturer, and then obviously, if we want to keep those plants open, we've got to figure out what the right split is, to make that -- the blade cost if you will, competitive with imports, such that, a customer, whether it'd be ge or another customer would want to produce in the u.s. does that make sense? did i answer your question?
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah it does. that's very helpful. thanks bill.

hey good afternoon guys. thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to start with the follow-on amount, $200 million for the oaktree deal. you guys already touched on this, i just wanted to put a finer point on it. is that mostly baked in for additional runway, if needed, or is it maybe like an and/or type of situation? thinking about capex opportunities for you guys, whether that be on the offshore side or maybe something in transportation, just put a finer point?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah. so as i mentioned earlier, we think what we've pulled down today, is adequate to kind of get us through this rough patch in the u.s. market, and so the $200 million is really not -- it really is -- we're pulling $350 million of the $400 million and that $50 million is kind of the cushion, where if the downturn is prolonged, we've got access to that at our option. the $200 million is different, right. the $200 million is -- i mean i think it shows a commitment from oaktree to the industry and specifically to tpi and what our strategic intent is, and so i think if we -- if there is an opportunity, then that's what the $200 million is for, it's more for future opportunity, whether it'd be growth or otherwise, and again it's -- let's be clear, it would be on different terms than the terms we have today, mutually agreed-upon terms. so it would be, really not as a safety net for what we've got, because we're confident and the number of we've got is what we need. it's really for growth opportunities.
greg rostkowski -- weber research -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thanks for the clarification there. and then on that point is there -- thinking about future growth opportunities, is there maybe an intention or a focus on one area and other, whether that's offshore is kind of the leading opportunity there, or is it -- we think that transportation is maybe an equal sort of opportunity, whether that be in terms of additional capacity or potential jvs m&a etc?
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, i think clearly there could be some opportunities in the transportation space. i think offshore to your point, not in m&a, but more of a newbuild. i think that's obvious use of capital as well, and it's a significant use of capital. i also think, we've done all of our service -- where all of our service growth has been organic. so that's an area that we would like to grow. i think there are -- there is a lot of activity in that space. today, we service blades. the question is, could we expand our offering to include more up-tower work and in the cell itself. so i think there are a lot of interesting opportunities to vertically integrate a little bit more, as well as over time, the horizontal is an interesting thing too, if you think about the entire value chain, within the renewable space.
greg rostkowski -- weber research -- analyst
okay, very helpful. i'll take the rest offline. thanks guys.
william e. siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
great. thank you.
bryan schumaker -- chief financial officer

2021-Q4,TPIC,2022-02-24 17:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good afternoon, and welcome to tpi composites' fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded. we have allocated one hour for prepared remarks and q&a. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to christian edin, investor relations for tpi composites.
thank you. you may begin.
christian edin -- investor relations
thank you, operator. i'd like to welcome everyone to tpi composites' fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. a detailed discussion of applicable risks is included in our latest report and filings with the securities and exchange commission, which can be found on our website, tpicomposites.com.
today's presentation will include references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the comparable gaap financial measures. with that, let me turn the call over to bill siwek, tpi composites' president and ceo. 
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, christian, and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining our call. in addition to christian, i am joined by adan gossar, our interim cfo and chief accounting officer. i will briefly review our fourth quarter and full year results, cover our global operations, including our supply chain and the wind industry market more broadly.
adan and i will then review our financial results before we discuss the 2022 outlook and open the call for q&a. please turn to slide 5. for the full year 2021, we delivered net sales of $1.7 billion, a 3.7% increase over 2020, and adjusted ebitda of $2.3 million, while delivering approximately 13 gigawatts of wind blades. our results of operations for 2021 and the fourth quarter were adversely impacted by approximately $52 million and $40 million, respectively, primarily due to the deferral of revenue relating to extensions of customer contracts and estimates of cost to complete our contracts under asc 606.
however, these factors did not have an impact on our 2021 billings, which exceeded expectations for 2021 and the fourth quarter. we manage our business on a billings basis as it reflects our actual cash flow and working capital requirements. now, for a summary of 2021 highlights. during the year, we started wind blade production on two lines in our chennai, india facility for nordex and added four lines for them in matamoros, mexico.
we also added four new lines in vestas in yangzhou, china, with production plan to start in the first half of 2022, and extended three lines with them in turkey. with these new lines and extensions, we now have a potential contract value of up to $3.5 billion through 2024, with a minimum contract value under our supply agreements of $2.2 billion. we grew our global service organization to almost 400 technicians and delivered revenue growth of more than two times compared to 2020. during the fourth quarter, to accelerate growth in europe, we opened a training center in spain.
we expect further growth in our service business in 2022. we continue to experience strong traction in the transportation side of our business. our customers, and several of whom are new to tpi, are seeing the benefit of our capabilities and ability to collaborate to develop innovative composite solutions at an accelerated pace. in the fourth quarter, we won our first program commitment of meaningful size per passenger ev platform, a major milestone for tpi.
we have also entered into several new development agreements with multiple customers, which we expect will turn into longer-term production agreements in the future. during 2021, we successfully launched our automated compression molding line and delivered nearly 30,000 parts to an electric vehicle manufacturer, and anticipate manufacturing an additional 25,000 parts in the first half of 2022. we continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities and have been awarded programs to deliver approximately 450,000 parts this year, and a million-plus parts in 2023 for the same customer. our innovative composite solutions enable our customers to achieve faster time to market, require lower upfront investment, and provide enhanced thermal protection and weight reductions.
we closed a $400 million financing with oaktree and have $200 million potential follow-on investment committed. the financing enabled us to shore up our balance sheet and position ourselves for additional growth when market demand recovers. turning to slide 7. i'll now give you a quick update of our global operations, supply chain, as well as a market update.
during the fourth quarter, we turned around the performance in our nordex, matamoros operation. i'm happy to report that we are delivering blades on plan and meeting the expectations of our customer for safety, quality, and delivery. however, we still have work to do on cost and pricing to realize the returns we expect from this facility. with respect to the challenges we experienced during the transition to a new innovative multipiece blade, we made significant progress during the quarter, met our delivery requirements, and are on track to drive productivity in 2022 to levels we and our customer expect.
we currently plan to have transitions or start-ups in four locations during 2022. turkey, mexico, and india will go through a total of five-line transitions, and we will start up four new lines in china. the turkey transition of one line is already complete and is a great example of a well-planned transition with minimal interruption and no impact to our annual output. moving on to the supply chain.
the aftereffects of the pandemic continue to evolve and affect our supply chain and the underlying cost assumptions in unpredictable ways, specifically with unprecedented volatility in commodity and logistic sector. during 2021, there were both significant price increases and supply constraints with respect to epoxy resin and carbon fiber, key raw materials that we use to manufacture our products, as well as increases in inbound logistics costs. we expect carbon fiber and related products supply to remain constrained as demand for carbon we use continues to outpace capacity additions. production of carbon products is also very energy-intensive, and continued rising energy costs could adversely impact the cost of carbon materials after already seeing price increases of up to 50% for certain carbon feedstocks during 2021.
epoxy resin prices were approximately 150% higher in the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. and high resin prices in europe and north america continue to be supported by bullish demand from industries like automotive, infrastructure, construction, and new containership builds. while competitive resin suppliers are available in asia, the current unreliable logistics environment and associated costs often offset any potential savings on price. we expect that the price of carbon fiber and resin will remain at elevated levels in 2022.
more than 50% of the resin and resin systems and more than 90% of the carbon fiber we use is purchased under contracts either controlled or borne by our customers, and therefore these customers receive or bear 100% of any decrease or increase in price. with respect to our other customer supply agreements, our customers typically receive or bear 70% of any raw material price decrease or increase. now, withstanding the challenging cost environment, we still expect to be able to hold the average bill of material cost for customers for which we control the supply chain relatively flat compared to 2021 levels. we remain focused on localizing and regionalizing our supply chain to reduce the impact of high logistics costs, provide security of supply, and build long-term strategic partnerships with key suppliers to ensure the best pricing in the short, medium, and long term.
as you've heard from some of our customers in recent weeks, there continue to be headwinds in the u.s. related to the stalled build back better plan, the expiration of the ptc at the end of 2021 in addition to supply chain costs and constraints, which decreased demand for our wind blades in 2021 compared to 2020, and is causing uncertainty and demand in the near term. while we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory policy proposals to extend and/or expand tax credits in the united states and in other parts of the world, we believe that notwithstanding current challenges, demand for wind energy will strengthen over the next few years, given the necessity to decarbonize and electrify to meet the aggressive goals set by states, regions, and countries to combat climate change. and we believe that we are uniquely positioned with our global footprint, located in key strategic geographies, to grow our market share with industry-leading oems, as the demand for wind begins to accelerate again, and we see the growth that has been forecast during the decade and beyond.
our relationships with our customers remain strong and we continue to jointly develop strategic plans to address the current environment, competitiveness, and future opportunities. for 2022, execution is our primary focus. we have also identified multiple strategic initiatives to enable tpi to capitalize on the expected long-term growth in the wind market, including expanding our global service offerings and leveraging our expertise and blade design, while expanding our capabilities around logistics and recycling. these initiatives are underway and will be advanced in 2022.
i would also like to confirm that we remain focused on the health and safety of our associates while executing our operating initiatives and esg goals, which include safety, diversity, inclusion, and driving to become carbon-neutral by 2030. from a covid-19 standpoint, we continue to operate all our facilities at normal levels, and we remain focused on operating our business safely and ensuring that we are prepared to deal with any resurgences of the virus. with that, let me turn the call over to adan to review our financial results.
adan gossar -- interim chief financial officer and accounting officer
thanks, bill. please turn to slide 9. all comparisons met today will be on a year-over-year basis compared to the same period in 2020. for the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2021, net sales were 389.5 million, while net sales of wind blades were 362.3 million.
the decrease in wind blade sales was primarily driven by a decline in the number of wind blades produced due to the transition in juarez, mexico, the impact on our production due to shortages of raw material, supplied by our customers, and foreign currency fluctuations offset by an increase in the average sales price per blade. our general and administrative expenses for the quarter decreased by 2.4 million to 5.4 million. foreign currency loss was 117.4 million in q4 2021, as compared to 1.9 million in q4 2020. this change was primarily due to net euro liability exposure against the turkish lira.
the euro exposure continues to be naturally hedged on a cash flow basis due to our euro-denominated revenue contracts. net loss attributable to stocks -- to common stockholders for the quarter was 93.3 as compared to net income of 5.2 million in the same period in 2020. this decrease in net income was primarily due to the impact of the transition in juarez, the ramp in matamoros, shortages of customer-supplied raw materials, noncash foreign exchange losses, restructuring costs, and the deferral of revenue related to contract extension and contract cost estimates under asc 606. moving on to slide 10.
for the full year 2021, net sales increased to 1.73 billion and net sales of wind blades totaled 1.61 billion. the increase in wind blade sales was driven by an increase in the average sales price of a blade, offset by a reduction in wind blade sets produced. net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year was 165.6 million, as compared to 19.0 million in 2020. the increase in our net loss was primarily due to raw material and logistics inflation, the impact of transition in juarez, the ramp in matamoros, shortages of customer-supplied raw materials, noncash foreign exchange losses, restructuring costs, and the deferral of revenue related to contract extensions and contract cost estimates under asc 606.
bill?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
our adjusted ebitda for q4 was a loss of 28.3 million. and for the full year, our adjusted ebitda was 2.4 million. in q4 2021, our revenue and adjusted ebitda was adversely impacted by approximately $40 million, primarily due to extensions of customer contracts and estimates of cost to complete our customer contracts because the impact under asc 606 was to defer certain revenue over the extended terms of these amended customer contracts and not recognized revenue as it is built per contractual agreements. by the way, contract extensions and modifications in the third and fourth quarter resulted in us adding almost 300 million of additional contract value over the extended terms.
we enter into these extensions even though they may impact current period results under asc 606 because they improve our long-term revenue and earnings potential and do not negatively impact cash flow. moving to slide 11. for the full year, we exceeded profitability expectations by 3.6 million through improved operational execution during the fourth quarter. however, the deferral of revenue and changes in estimates of cost to complete contracts under asc 606 reduced our reported adjusted ebitda by approximately 52 million to 2.4 million but had no impact on our cash flow.
as a reminder, we manage our business on a billings basis as it reflects the actual cash flow and working capital requirements of our business. on to slide 12. finally, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet, including 242.2 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and no net debt. turning to slide 13.
for 2022, we are not providing revenue or adjusted ebitda guidance, given current market volatility, potential impacts under asc 606 related to future contract modifications or extensions, and corresponding changes to our long-term volume, which we cannot forecast with certainty in this environment. we will, however, provide guidance on some key operational metrics as follows: 43 dedicated manufacturing lines, total wind blade set capacity of 3,710 for the lines we have under contract, utilization of between 80% and 85%, average sales price per blade of between $170,000 and $180,000, and capex of between 25 million and 30 million. i'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is from justin clare with roth capital partners. please proceed.
justin clare -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hi, everyone, thanks for taking our questions. so i guess just first off on the guidance that you provided. you know, you provided utilization, dedicated lines, and asps. so just based on those metrics, it looks like net sales could be flat to slightly down, which i think is what you had alluded to on the q3 call.
so is that still a reasonable expectation for this year? can you just talk through that and the level of uncertainty there with the -- with sales going forward?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. justin, nice to talk to you. i would say, again, you know, a lot of market volatility here and uncertainty, especially in the u.s. market.
given what we know today, i think that statement that we made in q3 is still accurate.
justin clare -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok, sounds good. and then turning to margins, you know, you indicated that you could hold the bill of materials flat year over year in 2022, or at least that's the goal here. and then if i look at your asps, it looks like they could increase, you know, 4% or so for the year based on your guide. so that would indicate that you could expand margins here.
but just wanted to see, you know, what visibility do you have to expanding margins? and if you could talk through the cadence as to how you expect margins to trend, that'd be helpful.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think margins will continue to be a bit compressed, justin, in 2022. i think you've heard that from a number of our customers over the last several weeks, the margin pressure on the hardware side, no different for us. we'll continue to see compressed margins. we have made significant progress in many areas, but we still have some challenging areas to focus on.
so i would say, you know, expect still to see some compressed margins through 2022.
justin clare -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. and then maybe just one more for me in -- so given this environment, just want to know, you know -- or check in on how you're thinking about the balance sheet here. obviously, you raised the 400 million from oaktree, but you have the option to do another 200 million here. you know, what are your thoughts on, you know, looking to add that 200 million of capital? you know, what would lead you to, you know, make that decision to move forward with that?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so of the 400, if you remember, we only drew 350 of that. and we feel very confident and comfortable with that level at this point in time. the 200 in addition to the 400 was really marked for future growth opportunities.
so, you know, we wouldn't -- we don't expect or anticipate having to tap that for anything, but growth opportunities as we move forward.
justin clare -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok, great. that does it for me. i'll pass it on.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
great. thanks.
operator
our next question is from james west with evercore isi. please proceed.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, bill.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
hey, james, how are you?
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
i'm doing well. yourself?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
doing great. thanks.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
good, good. well, congratulations on the big transportation award. you guys are seeing good progress there. how should we think about -- i mean, you gave the units that you expect to ship next year in 2023.
but what should we think about that in terms of kind of dollar amount or size of award, if you can provide me with some, maybe it could be above the big round number, but i'm trying to kind of scale that with the size of your wind business?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's -- i would tell you there the price per part is relatively low, just based on the nature of the part.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right, right.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, however, you know, the margins on them are very good. and i can't disclose exactly what that price per part is at this point in time. 
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
but we're pleased with it, and it will be margin positive for us, both in 2022 and in 2023.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok, ok, fair enough. well, i think, we could sort of get back into it. the other question i had on offshore wind in the u.s. i mean, you made some positive comments about it.
we would have the -- this build back better has stalled here. but we're going forward with the new york auction right now. so kind of how do you guys see this playing out? if we start, you know, awarding the acreage, do you start to then get awarded the blades? and you start to -- i mean, i'm sure you're already sourcing and you're talking to states and working on manufacturing capacity near the acreage. i mean, how does this all kind of play out in your mind?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so again, we have to work through our customers for that.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
and you can be sure that, you know, the conversations are ongoing with customers for opportunities on the -- both on the east coast, as well as in other regions of the world. so, you know, we've been -- we've talked about this, you know, for quite some time, and those discussions are robust and continue.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. that's it for me. thanks, bill.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
great. thanks, james. good talking to you.
operator
our next question is from joseph osha with guggenheim. please proceed.
hilary cauley -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hello, this is actually hilary on for joe. first question. you already kind of touched on the supply chain and efforts there to localize it. and i just kind of wondering if you could provide any context for, you know, how much progress has been made so far versus further room for improvement there?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, hilary, good to talk to you. we've actually made quite a bit of progress. you know, we've started first in mexico and we've done a pretty nice job of localizing both in juarez and in matamoros, some of the key suppliers, and we're working on some additional opportunities there.
india, you know, we're a relative -- recent entrant to their -- entrant into the india market. and a lot of the wind suppliers, if you will, were up in the northeast, whereas -- sorry, the northwest and we're down in the southeast. but making progress on that as well, that's a focus for us. and i think, suffice it to say, our team there, as well as our global team, has done a nice job of introducing some of our suppliers to that area.
and i look -- i expect that we'll make significant progress in 2022 on that.
hilary cauley -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
ok, great. and then i believe you said it was matamoros, in your prepared remarks, where it seems like they're kind of up and running more smoothly, but still a little bit of room for cost improvements. if you could just kind of provide timeline for where we see that come in a bit and kind of what has to happen to get you there. thank you.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, you bet. so that was the one that we were challenged with. you know, last year, we talked a bit about it. and as i said in our prepared remarks, we've made, you know, a significant amount of progress, but not without, you know, throwing some additional resources at it.
so, you know, as of today, as i mentioned, we are delivering product on time, high-quality product to our customer. and now it's time to, you know, as we drive cycle time down and throughput down, it's to work on the cost side of that as well. so, you know, through the balance of this quarter and into second quarter, we are very focused on driving that cost side of it. so, you know, i would expect by the end of q2, we'll be in a much better position down there.
hilary cauley -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
great. thank you. that's all for me.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, hilary.
operator
our next question is from laura sanchez with morgan stanley. please proceed.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, bill, thank you for your time. can you hear me, ok?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
i hear you loud and clear, laura. 
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
good to talk to you.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you, likewise. so on the volume side, where are volumes today relative to the minimum volume commitments? i'm wondering if oem -- those mvos, the idea there is to provide some instability. so i'm wondering if oem can continue to push volumes further out, or if doing so would incur costs on their end?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, laura, it varies a little bit by region and by customer, but we are above what the mvos would require in the contract for sure. i -- yeah, so i guess i'm not sure what else to say other than, yeah, we're above the mvos. then it been -- in some cases, we're, you know, over 100% capacity, and in other places, we're lower.
but overall, over the mvo amounts. and to your question, if they did go below the mvo, yes, there would be a cost to the customer.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. ok. and in terms of the -- on the ebitda side, the incremental 606 charge relative to the guidance provided last year, you were talking about that being related to a delay in revenues, given the extensions in some of the contracts. the revenues for the year were in line the guidance range.
so were there any revenue offsets, or maybe could you discuss just the moving pieces there and the extended terms of the contracts, like how further out does that take you?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so we extended a number of lines by a year. oh, a year, right, yeah. so i think all of them were extended by a year.
and yes, there was a corresponding revenue impact as well. so we had to defer a certain amount of revenue, and that's what impacted ebitda
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and were there some revenue offsets on the revenue side that even with that change allowed you to remain within the guided range?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
there were puts and takes from a volume standpoint, but i don't think -- nothing that i can recall significant -- significantly different. we had a fairly wide range on the revenue side, so --
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. ok. understood. thank you.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yep. thanks, laura.
operator
our next question is from eric stine with craig-hallum capital group. please proceed.
aaron spychalla -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hi, it's aaron spychalla on for eric. thanks for taking the questions.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
hey, aaron.
aaron spychalla -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hi. maybe first on china. can you just give us an update there on kind of merging the facilities and replacing those lines? i know we have four with vestas that are kind of starting up, but maybe talk about the timeline there. and then just thoughts on potentially entering that market going forward.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, you know, it's never easy when you have to consolidate factories and there's a human side of it. our team in china did a phenomenal job of managing that. and we've effectively now merged our-- both of our blade operations into one into yangzhou.
so we have seven lines operating there now. so we have, you know, three lines that were already there. and then we're starting four new lines this year. we'll have those, you know, up in operating by the end of q2.
so seven lines total. but the integration went very smooth. we will continue, aaron, to look at opportunities to, you know, continue to expand our production in yangzhou with our existing customers. you know, breaking into the china market for china with the chinese oem has always been a very difficult task from a cost standpoint.
we've had a number of discussions or a number of opportunities but we're going to make sure if we do that, we can do that profitably. and at this point, we haven't found that right opportunity yet. so we'll continue to work with our existing customer base on filling the balance of the capacity that we have in yangzhou.
aaron spychalla -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
understood. and then, you know, any more color you can share on -- you kind of mentioned recycling. just what that might entail? any kind of capex or any contribution? just anything else there would be helpful.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's a little bit early. you know, there's a lot of discussion in the industry about it. we're working on two or three different end solutions.
and actually, the capex is not as expensive as you might think. now, if you get to -- once you increase the volume of blades that are coming down tower, that need to be recycled, obviously, you've got to scale. but capex is not crazy at this point. you know, you could -- you know, for about $1 million, you can handle a lot of blades from a pure capex standpoint.
now, the challenge is transport and everything else because that becomes expensive, but it's not capex intensive. but we are working on a couple of interesting solutions for that that we hope to be able to talk about more as we get to the back half of 2022.
aaron spychalla -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
all right. we'll stay tuned there. i'll hop back in the queue. thanks.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
great. thanks, aaron.
operator
our next question is from mark strouse with j.p. morgan. please proceed.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon. thanks for taking our questions. bill, you gave some color on the blade business, kind of directionally speaking how we should be thinking about that in 2022.
just curious if you can give us any directional color on the nonblade business revenue this year?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, again, transportation, you know, we're going to grow that over where we were this year. i think you'll see pretty good growth, quite frankly. it's still be a very small part of our overall business, but we're building up.
you know, we're winning some production contracts and we'll add to that. so it'll be more than we did this year by a factor of probably 1.5 times, i would say. on the service business, we're going to continue to aggressively grow that. we grew up by two times top line this year.
probably, you know, go up by another 50% on top of that for this year, conservatively. but that's kind of a directionally where we're headed.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and then just lastly, i think in the past, you've targeted a kind of a low double-digit ebitda margin. has there been anything over the last year or so in the industry that has led to a structural change that you think that that number is no longer appropriate?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
you know, i would tell you, mark, given the uncertainty as we sit here today, with everything that's going on, whether it be build back better stalled, what's happening from a geopolitical standpoint in europe, i think, if you listen to our customers, there needs to be a fundamental change in how wind is priced. so i do think there are some structural changes that need to happen. i think we're starting to see that with some of the -- so the price per megawatt of turbines over the last couple of quarters starting to go back up. and that's not just because of input costs, but -- so the answer is yes.
long answer to your question is yes. i think there do need to be some structural changes, and we're working on that with our customers as we speak.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thank you, bill.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
you bet. thanks, mark.
operator
our next question is from pavel molchanov with raymond james. please proceed.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. a minute ago, you referenced the geopolitical context and -- specifically in europe. remind please, how much of your revenue comes out of the european markets and i guess, specifically, from the turkish facility?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so good to talk to you, pavel. we -- turkey, probably, is less than 10% stays in turkey of what we built. you know, most of it does leave turkey and go around the world, a lot of that to emea.
in europe, it's about 30% of our, you know, blades end up in europe that are built. so it's in that neighborhood.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. when we think about the european wind market, you know, obviously, offshore gets maybe disproportionate attention most of the new builds are in fact still on land. do you envision as seemed logical for $25 in ncf natural gas, most expensive natural gas in the history of the world, to drive adoption of more wind in the electricity mix, both on land and offshore?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i would hope so, pavel. i mean, the -- windeurope just put out a report today that between now and 2030, of the new installs they're anticipating, you know, 76% of them are going to be onshore. so you're right, offshore gets a lot of the press, but there's still a significant amount of onshore activity in europe. i do -- the challenge in europe remains permitting and citing.
and so if the governments can work with the industry and figure out how to speed up that process, then the pace of installs in europe should and could increase significantly. right now, they estimate like 17 gigawatts a year between now and 2030. it needs to be twice that much to hit their 40% renewable target by 2030. so long answer to your question, but the answer is absolutely yes.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
and then lastly, maybe just clarify the light-duty vehicle contract that you referenced, that will be basically a smaller version of the buck bodies that you're supplying to proterra, correct?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
no, i didn't mention a light-body vehicle. it was -- it's a structural component for an ev passenger platform. so it's not a body and weight or a body -- it's a structural component that is underbody for the most part.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. ok. that's clear. thank you very much.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, pavel.
operator
our next question is from jeff osborne with cowen and company. please proceed.
jeff osborne -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon, bill. a couple of questions on my side. i was wondering on the evps if there's any notable capex that would be needed to produce a million units in 2023?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
no.
jeff osborne -- cowen and company -- analyst
and then a secondary question about it is could you disclose if it's a start-up, or maybe those goals are ambitious versus an established oem?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
first of all, no incremental capex, jeff. and secondly, it's an established platform.
jeff osborne -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. and will that be produced in rhode island or somewhere else?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
it -- a portion of its produced in rhode island and a portion of it is produced with -- in another location that we partner with a supplier.
jeff osborne -- cowen and company -- analyst
i got it. and then i had a question on the transitions that you guided for the year. are any of those associated with the segmented blade or multipiece blade that you had challenges within mexico? i'm just curious if they are. you know, what level of learnings you experienced there and how quickly you could port that knowledge to other locations?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, fair question. but no, the answer is they're not related to the multipiece blade. they're single-piece blade as we would call them. the good news is that two of the transitions, one in mexico and one in turkey, it's the -- we're transitioning to the same blade.
and so that's helpful. and we're ahead of schedule on both of those as we speak right now. so very optimistic that we'll complete those in very efficient fashion as we did the first one in turkey at the beginning of the year.
jeff osborne -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. thank you. that's all i have.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
great. thanks, jeff.
operator
our next question is from tom curran with seaport. please proceed.
tom curran -- seaport global holdings -- analyst
hello?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
hey, tom, how are you?
tom curran -- seaport global holdings -- analyst
just a follow -- good, good. a follow-up on the topic of transitions. i know you've had several initiatives underway to try to improve the efficiency of transitions when you do them from what i understand, both in moving from one customer to another and then intermodal transitions with the same customer. could you update us on where you think those initiations -- those initiatives are at and how much more improvement we might see?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
well, i'll give you an example. so in turkey, it was for an existing customer, and we did transition a line. we've already upped our production estimate for 2022 to north of what our contractual amount is. that will just give you an example of how efficient that transition was.
so transitioning a line and not losing any volume for the year is about as if -- and in fact, getting more volume is about as efficient as you can do it. i would say we've made -- i'm going to pull the covid card for a second. so, you know, in 2020 and 2021, our transitions were a little bit challenged because of covid, whether it was, you know, the ability of people to get to a certain country, getting some of the experts on the equipment in-country, etc., created some challenges. but what was really under our control, we executed pretty well.
so again, i'm pressing the guys every day to continue to get better. our schedules are much more aggressive. i think our collaboration with our customers has gotten better. we are holding them more accountable for what their part of the transition is with consequences if those deliverables aren't met.
so the answer is i feel very confident in the transitions this year. we've made significant progress, and i expect to continue to make progress as we go through the balance of the year. 
tom curran -- seaport global holdings -- analyst
that all sounds encouraging. and then, in terms of the remaining cost savings, you might be able to wring out of facility consolidation, perhaps line idling. just wondering what more we might see you do with iowa over the course this year? and then whether or not there's additional, you know, shutdown or mothballing steps you could take with the four lines in juarez that had been relinquished by fcra?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so iowa, i think as we talked about before, we've extended that lease through 2022. the reason we did that was to, number one, if build back better came in, would there be provisions in there to possibly provide for the reopening of that plant, where it made economic sense? would build back better stalled that -- at least from a regulatory or a legislative standpoint, it's less likely at this point. but we've minimized costs there to really -- the lease, as well as just kind of the normal maintenance that we need to do there.
so there's not much more we can do from a cost savings, from a mothball there this year. but if nothing happens there, then, you know, we'll obviously eliminate that cost for 2023. in juarez, there's interest in that facility. we're utilizing it for some other work right now as well.
so it's not going unutilized completely. but again, i think when we get a little bit more certainty about the u.s. market, you know, whether we have a build back better, whether we have tax extenders at the end of the year, or a new clean energy, you know, bipartisan plan early next year, i think we'll have a better feel for exactly what the long-term play is there. but i remain optimistic that, you know, once we have certainty from a policy standpoint in the u.s., that space will get scooped up pretty quickly.
tom curran -- seaport global holdings -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
you bet. thank you.

[operator instructions] our next question is from stephen gengaro with stifel. please proceed.
stephen gengaro -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, gentlemen.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon.
stephen gengaro -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
i apologize. i got disconnected earlier. so hopefully, this was not asked, but can you talk a little bit more about what you're hearing from your wind blade customers? i mean, obviously, you kind of talked about this in the press release a bit about the near-term uncertainty. but are you -- can you give a sense for kind of what's going to kind of restart things and kind of what they're looking forward to kind of be maybe more aggressive on the waterfront and a ramp again?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and again, just, you know, from what they are saying publicly, it's, you know, not about chasing market share, it's about chasing profitable business. so i think --  and we may have seen some of that in q4 with some of the order volumes. i think with them having the discipline to price so that they can be profitable, certainly, will help us as well.
so what i'm hearing from our customers is just more discipline on the pricing side, not chasing share just to chase share, being diligent in how they're contracting. and again, just not chasing business to chase business, but really chasing profitable business.
stephen gengaro -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. thank you. and then the second one i have, just some sort of a bigger picture perspective.
can -- and i know your crystal balls is cloudy, as we speak, as all of us are. but when you think about the sort of the ebitda in 2022 and you're kind of when you get -- when you turn positive into the how that just got, like how are you sort of thinking about that over the next several quarters?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think from a sequencing standpoint, steve, and i would say, you know, q1 will be a down quarter for us just because all of our transitions and our start-up -- a couple of our start-ups will happen in the quarter. and so will -- that'll be a down quarter, and then you'll see a build in q2. q3 will likely be our best quarter, which is fairly typical. and then q4, we'll see it dip a little bit, and that's primarily because of holidays and what have you.
but that's how i would kind of sequence the ebitda over the quarter -- or over the year, sorry.
stephen gengaro -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. thanks for the color.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
you bet. thank you.

kashy harrison -- piper sandler -- analyst
good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
you bet.
kashy harrison -- piper sandler -- analyst
just one quick one for me, and apologies if this was answered in some form or fashion a little bit earlier. but just simplistically, how should we think directionally about the, you know, start-up in transition cost line in 2022 for the full year? are you thinking flattish, slightly down, slightly up? just some directional indicator would be great. thank you.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would -- you know, given the number of transitions and start-ups, and recognizing that for the start-ups are in china, and our team in china does a really, really good job of either transitions or start-ups. and the fact that, you know, i think 2021 was probably impacted a bit more by, you know, the challenges we had in juarez, as well as matamoros, i would say directionally, it will be down year over year.
kashy harrison -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. that's all i needed. thank you.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
you bet. thanks, kashy.
operator
and our next question is from adhok bellurkar with bank of america. please proceed.
adhok bellurkar -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you so much. good evening. thank you for taking my question. i guess the first question i had was at a higher level, you know, we've heard discussions of some of the chinese wind turbine oems looking to expand outside of china into europe mainland, for example.
so as you think about potentially expanding beyond your current customer base, you know, does that look like an interesting opportunity of partnership with tpi to pursue an, you know, does that fit into the equation?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
thanks for the question. as i mentioned earlier, it is -- you know, we've had discussions for years with the chinese oems, the terms that they require or request, and the pricing is extremely aggressive, from our perspective. so i mean, china is the largest wind market in the world, and they are making some headway outside of china. so i will never say never.
it is certainly an opportunity. but it's a bit of a long putt for us right now from that perspective, as i look at it today, just from a pure cost standpoint, yeah.
adhok bellurkar -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. and then for raw materials, your commentary around epoxy resin and carbon fiber was extremely helpful. i was wondering if you could help us, you know, complete the puzzle in terms of understanding how balsa wood fiberglass or that, you know, they're creating, whether they are tailwind or status quo versus 2021, how should we think about it?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i would tell you that for some of the reasons that we're seeing increasing costs from carbon, we're seeing some challenges with pet. pet is a capacity issue, to some extent, as well as -- acrylonitrile is a feedstock for both pet and carbon, and we're seeing some capacity constraints there as well. so that's a bit of a challenge.
but, you know, we see that capacity to challenge a little bit. but from a pricing standpoint, we're in pretty good shape based on our contracts for next year, or for this year. glass fiber, i think we expect, you know, probably a 2% to 3% increase year over year from 2021 to 2022. and that -- you know, there remain a few supply constraints there, but nothing that we can't manage through.
adhok bellurkar -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood. thank you. and then i guess the last one would be, you know, i know you have touched upon the new ev order from multiple angles. i guess the only question i had was just the, you know, current backlog number that you have shared, 2.5 billion, does that capture the full 50,000 parts this year and then 1 million parts for '20? and then what's the room to expand within these contracts from where they are right now? and in terms of just linking it to the 500 million long-term target that you have for the second half?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so those contracts today are not included in the backlog number or the contract value number. and the ability to expand -- i mean, the first, you know, production -- or the first part we made for the customer, we did very successfully, which is -- which led to this opportunity. i think there's the opportunity to expand the relationship geographically.
so that is certainly an option. but, you know, if we continue to demonstrate our ability to be nimble, innovative, work fast, and reduce upfront tooling costs for these customers, i think our opportunity to expand that is right in front of us.
adhok bellurkar -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. thank you so much.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

2022-Q1,TPIC,2022-05-05 17:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good afternoon, and welcome to tpi composites first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded. [operator instructions] at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to christian edin, investor relations for tpi composites. thank you, sir.
you may begin.
christian edin -- investor relations
thank you, operator. i would like to welcome everyone to tpi composites first quarter 2022 earnings call. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. a detailed discussion of applicable risk is included in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, which can be found on our website, tpicomposites.com.
today's presentation will include references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the comparable gaap financial measures. with that, let me turn the call over to bill siwek, tpi composites' president and ceo.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
thanks, christian, and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining our call. in addition to christian, i'm joined today by adan gossar, our interim cfo and chief accounting officer. i will briefly review our first quarter results, cover our global operations, including our service and transportation businesses, then cover our supply chain and the wind energy market more broadly.
adan will then review our financial results in detail, and then we'll open the call for q&a. please turn to slide 5. we delivered net sales of $384.9 million during the quarter and adjusted ebitda of $6.1 million. although adjusted ebitda on a billings basis was a loss of $5.3 million, it was better than planned as a result of tight cost controls and cost reductions globally, excellent execution, including on multiple transitions, which enabled us to deliver additional blade volume during the quarter.
we signed a number of new development agreements in our transportation segment, and we also published our 2021 esg report during the quarter. please turn to slide 6 for highlights from the report. we made significant progress toward our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality by reducing our overall co2 intensity by 9% and expanded on-site renewable energy generation. we achieved our waste-reduction targets by meeting tpi's process waste reduction goal of 5% during the year.
we increased transparency throughout tpi's value chain by initiating scope 3 emissions reporting. we reduced our already best-in-class recordable incident rate by 38% and lost time incident rate by 32%, driven by our behavior-based safety program. we improved our overall diversity, equity and inclusion survey score by 6%, and i signed the ceo pledge for action as part of tpi's commitment to d&i. going forward, we will refer to our initiative as idea, inclusion, diversity, equity and awareness diversity without inclusion is not our goal.
the goal, first and foremost, is to create an inclusive culture. and finally, we obtained third-party assurance from dnv for scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as select gri and sasb topics. turning to slide 7. we've reiterated our long-term esg goals to promote a zero-harm culture focused on eliminating unsafe behaviors to achieve 33% female and 33% racial and ethnically diverse persons on our board of directors by 2023 to achieve 25% female representation on our global leadership team by 2025, achieve 25% racial and ethnically diverse persons on our u.s.
leadership team by 2025 and become carbon neutral by 2030 with 100% of our energy being procured from renewable sources. turning to slide 9. i'll now give you a quick update of our global operations supply chain, as well as the wind market. during the first quarter, we did not experience any significant production issues from covid, including any material production stoppages.
although there have been no production impacts to us so far from the senseless invasion of ukraine by russia, we will continue to monitor the impact of the war on our supply chain and take proactive measures to minimize potential risks. in china, covid cases have increased significantly, and as a result, shanghai entered phased lockdowns in late march. domestic logistics have been impacted, but thanks to the efforts of our local and global supply chain teams, we met our q1 production targets and continue to deliver blades on time from yangzhou, as well as export the raw materials that we still source in china on a timely basis. we will continue to monitor the situation closely and execute our contingency plans to minimize the impact on our local production and raw material supply pipeline.
we are continuing to diversify and derisk our supply chain by qualifying sources in the regions in which we manufacture products. other than our production in china, which primarily relies on chinese suppliers, we have reduced our exposure in china for tpi-controlled spend to just 6%, down from over 20% in 2019. during the quarter, we made excellent progress on the speed of our start-ups and transitions that we have in four locations during 2022, china, turkey, mexico and india. we have completed five lines, two each in china and india and one in turkey, and they were all completed ahead of schedule, and as a result, will enable us to deliver additional volume to our customers during 2022.
from a service perspective, we had another solid quarter of growth. our expansion in europe is going as planned, including the opening of a new training center in spain, the establishment of a new entity in the u.k. and the signing of several new significant agreements. we expect to grow the service business by approximately 40% to 50% in 2022.
on the transportation front, we had another good quarter. we are pleased with our operational execution on the passenger ev parts and our customer extended the initial pilot production program for another quarter. now, it goes through quarter three. we successfully launched a new program with the same customer and we plan to exceed the original estimate of 450,000 units we discussed during our fourth quarter call.
we also kicked off development programs with multiple leading oems for class 8 cap structures and last mile delivery vehicles. our pipeline continues to strengthen in the commercial vehicle segment and for unique components on passenger evs. we now expect our transportation revenue on a billings basis to grow by over 70% in 2022. this is up from the 40% to 50% growth we discussed on our q4 call.
moving on to supply chain. the situation continues to be challenging with higher energy prices, as well as the covid lockdowns in china. during 2021, there were both significant price increases and supply constraints with respect to epoxy resin and carbon fiber, as well as increases in inbound logistics costs. we expect carbon fiber and related product supply to remain constrained as demand for carbon continues to outpace capacity additions.
production of carbon products is also very energy intensive, and continued rising energy cost is adversely impacting the cost of carbon materials after already seeing price increases of up to 50% for certain feedstocks during 2021. epoxy resin prices continue to see pressure with constrained feedstocks and high energy costs, and higher resin prices in europe and north america continue to be supported by bullish demand from industries like automotive, infrastructure and construction. while competitive resin suppliers are available in asia, the current unreliable logistics environment and associated costs often offset any potential savings on price. as of today, we believe we have secured adequate raw materials for all planned production in 2022, including the raw material that is controlled by our customers.
although we expect that the price of carbon fiber and resin will remain at elevated levels in 2022, approximately 60% of the resin and resin systems and approximately 90% of carbon fiber we use is purchased under contracts either controlled or borne by our customers, and therefore, these customers receive or bear 100% of any increase or decrease in price. notwithstanding the challenging cost environment, we now expect to be able to hold the average bill of material cost for customers for which we control the supply chain to a less than 5% increase compared to 2021 levels. as i noted earlier, we remain focused on localizing and regionalizing our supply chain to reduce the impact of high logistics costs, provide security of supply and build long-term strategic partners with key suppliers to ensure the best pricing and availability in the short, medium and long term. since our last earnings call, the war in ukraine has brought to the forefront the need for energy security and independence, not only in europe but across the globe.
to accelerate the eu's fit for 55 energy transition plan, the repower eu program has been proposed. it is intended to cut europe's reliance on imported energy, speed up the permitting process throughout europe and should help accelerate the growth in wind installations. we are pleased to see europe increasing its commitments as this is an important market for tpi with over 30% of our blades going into the region. in addition, germany has announced plans to increase its 2030 clean energy target by 15% to 80%.
this means that germany would have to install more than 10 gigawatts of wind every year starting in 2025 or five times what was installed during 2021. in the u.s., discussions regarding extending the ptc as part of the more comprehensive energy transition strategy have gained some traction in recent weeks. with that said, uncertainty around the timing and magnitude of any legislation, along with increased costs, is still putting a damper on u.s. demand in the near term.
we believe that notwithstanding current challenges faced by the wind industry, demand for wind energy will strengthen over the long term, given the focus on energy security and independence globally and the necessity to decarbonize and electrify to meet the aggressive goal set to combat climate change. we believe that we are uniquely positioned with our global footprint in key strategic geographies, along with collaborative relationships with our suppliers to grow our market share with industry-leading turbine oems as the demand for wind begins to accelerate again. while execution remains our primary focus, we are moving forward with multiple strategic initiatives to enable tpi to capitalize on the expected long-term growth in the wind market, including expanding our global service offerings and leveraging our expertise in blade design while expanding our capabilities around logistics and recycling. with that, let me turn the call over to adan to review our financial results.
adan gossar -- interim chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
thanks, bill. please turn to slide 11. all comparisons made today will be on a year-over-year basis compared to the same period in 2021. for the first quarter ended march 31, 2022, net sales were $384.9 million, while net sales of wind blades were $354.6 million.
the decrease in wind sales was primarily driven by a decline in the number of wind blades produced due to the reduction in manufacturing lines year over year and foreign currency fluctuations, offset by an increase in the average sales price per blade. net loss attributable to common stockholders for the quarter was $29.9 million as compared to net loss of $1.8 million in the same period in 2021. this increase in net loss was primarily due to preferred stock dividend and accretion, a decrease in the number of wind blades produced, cost challenges in our nordex matamoros facility, restructuring costs and approximately $7.1 million in nonrestructuring-related operating costs that were associated with certain manufacturing facilities where production has stopped. our adjusted ebitda for q1 was $6.1 million or 1.6% of sales compared to $13.1 million or 3.2% of sales in the same period in 2021.
moving to slide 12. we ended the quarter with $131 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalent and no net debt. the net change in cash for the quarter of approximately $111 million was in line with our forecast. net cash used in operating activities was approximately $81 million, primarily due to an increase of accounts receivable of $31 million, the majority of which was to one customer, a decrease in our accounts payable of $19 million and an increase in contract assets, which was the result of increased procurement of customer-specific materials to minimize the risk of potential production disruptions that may occur given the recent covid-19 impacts in china and geopolitical uncertainties, including the ongoing war in ukraine.
we expect a small cash ban in q2 before we begin generating free cash flow in q3 and q4. back to you, bill.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
thanks, don. turning to slide 13. as we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect q2 sales and adjusted ebitda on a billings basis to be much higher than q1 of 2022 and expect adjusted ebitda on a billings basis to be flat compared to q2 of 2021. we are also reiterating our full year billings targets for sales and adjusted ebitda to be flat compared to 2021.
our formal guidance for 2022 has not changed. and once again, we will not provide gaap revenue or adjusted ebitda guidance given current market volatility, potential impacts under asc 606 related to future contract modifications or extensions and corresponding changes to our long-term volume, which cannot be forecast with certainty at this time. please turn to slide 15. to close, we remain focused on managing our business through near-term challenges in the industry in our efforts to position tpi as the preferred global solution provider to our customers and their customers to enable profitable execution and growth in the future.
i want to thank all of our tpi associates once again for their commitment, dedication and loyalty to tpi and our mission to decarbonize and electrify. i'll now turn it back to the operator to open the call for questions.

laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. hi, bill and adan. thank you so much for your time here. bill, you just talked a little bit about the seasonality on ebitda.
can you talk a little bit more on the revenue side? i'm wondering about kind of the trends that you're seeing, the lockdowns in china, transitions, start-ups for the rest of the year, etc. how should we think about the cadence for the next three quarters?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. laura, good to talk to you. i think the way we've got the cadence now, and we talked a little bit about in the fourth quarter is q2 will clearly be a better revenue quarter than q1. q3, i think, is probably at or a little bit above q2, then q4 comes down a little bit as we normally see toward the end of the year.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
are you seeing -- you mentioned no impacts from the lockdowns in china in the first quarter. any trends that you're seeing in the second quarter? or is that fully, i would say, mitigated.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
i would like to say it's fully mitigated. obviously, there's still lockdowns happening. so that will still remain a challenge, i think, into the -- through the second quarter. i will tell you that even though the lockdowns in shanghai didn't happen until late march, we were experiencing them through the quarter in various parts of china already.
and so, we've kind of been dealing with that through the whole quarter. but again, i think we're in pretty good shape today. our team has worked the situation pretty effectively. so i still don't anticipate any issues.
we have taken some additional inventory on in the event that we do have some minor delays so that we don't stop production. but right now, we're in pretty good shape.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. good to hear. and last one on my end on the asps. it seems like you're well ahead of the guide that you gave for the year.
is there some timing issue that's making first q particularly strong? or should we use this level for the remainder of the year?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. it's a little bit of a timing issue because we had -- with some start-ups of transitions, we had early blades at a higher price as we ramp up the production. laura?
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. got it. and that reminds me on the first question, was there anything on the revenue side that we should take into account for transitions and start-ups for the rest of the year?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
so we are largely through the transitions at this point. we have two lines still being transitioned in mexico, and we have a couple in china yet. but no, i don't think anything of any material difference from what we saw in the first quarter.
laura sanchez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. thank you so much.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah. thanks, laura.

our next question comes from the line of joseph osha with guggenheim partners. please proceed with your question.
hilary cauley -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hello. this is actually hilary on for joe. i first wanted to touch on the transportation side of the business. a lot of exciting moving parts there.
and i know you highlighted the 70% growth for this year. but i was kind of wondering if you could provide updated thoughts on how we should be thinking about that over the next couple of years and when we might see that generating a more meaningful amount of revenue.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. hilary, this is good to speak with you again. yes, we've made some really nice traction over the last several quarters, including the first quarter. i think the quality of our partners in the development agreements should result in some meaningful movement over the next couple of years for sure.
clearly, the program we have working with the ev passenger vehicle is going to drive significantly more volume next year than we have in the plan for this year as well. but i think the conversion of a number of those development projects that we've entered into actual production contracts. we should start to see that toward the end of this year or early next year. so we should start to see that impact in 2023 and beyond.
hilary cauley -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
great. and last one for me. just on the cost initiative, if you could kind of give us an update on how that's progressing against targets for this year or ongoing.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
i'm sorry, hilary. i couldn't understand what you asked. on cost out, did you say?
hilary cauley -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
yes. just the various cost-out initiatives that you've been working on, if you could just give us update on progress there.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes, going really well. we talked about taking a significant amount out last year, the year before. we have some pretty ambitious goals for this year. we were ahead of our cost out plan for the first quarter.
so they're going very well. just very diligent on every dollar we spend, as well as taking cost out of the process as well. so it's -- we're ahead of schedule, and we plan to stay ahead of schedule.
hilary cauley -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of justin clare with roth capital partners. please proceed with your question.
justin clare -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking our questions.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
you bet.
adan gossar -- interim chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
hey, justin.
justin clare -- roth capital partners -- analyst
so first off, just considering the cost inflation that we've seen since march, wondering if you've seen any impact on order volume or customer demand. it sounds like you're maintaining your revenue expectations. so maybe there hasn't been a meaningful impact here, but just wanted to see any impact to customer demand at this point.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
at this point, no, we've been very successful in our transitions. we've got the ability to provide some additional volume this year. there's some interest in that in certain geographies. so i would say we haven't seen a decrease.
we could see a little bit of a pickup just because of our -- the speed of our transitions and demands in certain other regions. but at this point, justin, we haven't seen any decline in demand from a cost standpoint.
justin clare -- roth capital partners -- analyst
got it. ok. and then in q1, you produced more sets than you had planned, and i know a part of that is the transitions. but is there anything else in q1? were some plants performing ahead of expectations or anything else that enabled you to kind of exceed expectations there?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. actually, from an operational standpoint, all of our plants are operating really nicely this year. no major operational hiccups or issues. we did produce more than expected out of mexico.
that was planned from our standpoint based on what our customers' needs, where they accelerated a little bit. so other than that, just very good execution with a little bit of build ahead in mexico.
justin clare -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. and just one more, if i may. you said you secured all the raw materials for your planned production in 2022.
can you share when you were able to do that? was this potentially ahead of the most recent increase in costs? and what is typical? like is this proactive action that you had taken, given the expectations here for inflation?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. it really varies by commodity. lead times vary. but in this environment, we were proactive as we have been through the whole of covid, you'd probably remember us talking about building inventory levels in the covid time frame as well.
so the key here was making sure that where we are reliant on our customer to contract for the material that we worked proactively -- more proactively, i would say, this year than in the past with our customer supplier as well to make sure that we had the proper allocation and volumes at the right time. so i think it was proactivity on the part of our supply chain, as well as better collaboration with our customers that control their supply chains. so it's a combination of things.
justin clare -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah. thanks, justin.

aaron spychalla -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah. hi. good afternoon. it's aaron spychalla on for eric.
thanks for taking the questions.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
hey, aaron.
aaron spychalla -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
maybe first on the service business. good to see the eu expansion and kind of the growth targets that you laid out. can you just kind of give a little more color on kind of the growth profile, the margin profile there and how you think about that business over the next couple of years?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. so we'll grow it. we grew it 50% last year. we'll grow at another 40% to 50% this year.
that's assuming it's all organic. margins are better this year, better utilization of our personnel, better allocation of talent around the globe, as well as some better pricing on some of the deals that we've cut with our customers. so it's a combination of just very robust market in the service business, a need for very high-quality blade technicians, which we have a bunch of them around the globe. obviously, we build them.
we should be able to repair them and service them and just focusing on higher dollar and higher volume and higher margin work. it's a combination of all those.
aaron spychalla -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
all right. and then, just maybe on offshore, kind of seeing folks talking about a reprioritization there. can you just kind of talk about how that might impact you and just how you are thinking about the opportunity offshore here in the near term?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. so we're continuing to work a number of different opportunities in the offshore space. it's a complicated space. there's a lot of risk involved.
you saw -- you might have seen vestas talked a little bit about it during their earnings release earlier this week. so we're proceeding very cautiously and carefully and making sure we dot is and cross ts. but we do see it as a nice opportunity going forward. and we're continuing to pursue it with vigor.
aaron spychalla -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
all right. sounds good. thanks for taking the questions, bill.

and our next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin-smith with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
alex virgo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, guys.  it's alex virgo on for julien. thanks for taking our questions here. i wanted to ask specifically a little bit more on the raw material side of things. i know you guys mentioned carbon fiber, as well as epoxy resin earlier in the call.
but i'm wondering if you can expand a little bit more on some of the other inputs here, whether balsa wood, pet, i mean, particularly as we go into this rather inflationary backdrop on oil and whatnot. what are you seeing there? and kind of what's your outlook, i guess, throughout '22 into 2023?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes, you bet. so our -- obviously, carbon and epoxy resins we've talked about. our other big inputs are glass -- fiberglass and core, which would include balsa and pet, as you mentioned. glass market trend is up a bit.
our actual trend is pretty flat from 2021. again, that's just relationships, volumes, etc. so we've been able to keep that relatively flat. but the market trend has been up a bit in '22 from '21.
from a core perspective, balsa is actually flat or trending down. there's a lot more demand for pet. capacity hasn't come online as quickly as most would like. so we do see in the market a bit of a price increase from a pet standpoint.
but from a tpi standpoint, we've again been able to secure volumes at prices that are flat to last year or down. and then other than that, you've got coatings, which are the kind of the paint that we use on the blade. again, market price is up a bit, but we're flat year over year or down on that as well. so we're tending to trend a little bit better than market, at least the spot prices in the market, but we do see a challenging -- remainder of 2022 from a commodity standpoint.
alex virgo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. i appreciate that. and then, just a quick follow-up. i'm wondering if you guys can characterize sort of the cadence you expect on utilization throughout the year versus where you are in q1 to your full year '22 guide, which obviously you're maintaining.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
you bet. so for q1, we are right around that 65% level. expect to be in the mid-80s in q2. mid- to low 90s in q3 and q4 both.
so utilization picks up pretty nicely as we get through transitions.
alex virgo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys.

alec scheibelhoffer -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. thank you for taking my question here.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
you bet. good to talk to you.
alec scheibelhoffer -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah. likewise. so just looking at the strong increase you had in an average selling price per blade. i was wondering if you could give some color on what's driving that and maybe some outlook moving forward and how we should be thinking about that?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. i think as we mentioned a little bit earlier, part of that is, as we go through a transition, early blades produced once we start production are generally priced at a higher asp until we get to a certain number and then it kind of levels off to a normal price. so that's part of it. part of it is just blade mix, the mix of blades produced in q1.
we do expect that to kind of level out and come back down to kind of where our guide range was as we get further into the year. some of the transition blades that we are doing, especially in china, are smaller blades. so asp on those is a little bit lower. so as those come on, full steam, we'll start to see that asp come kind of back down into the range that we originally guided to.
alec scheibelhoffer -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
excellent. thank you for the color.

luke tilkens -- piper sandler -- analyst
i'd like to talk about the cash flow statement a little bit. obviously, you guys called out that there was a little bit of a headwind with accounts receivable and timing of payments. but i'm just wondering if you can give some color on the cadence of working capital over the course of the year and your level of comfort with where cash is at right now.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. so yes, i think as we mentioned, we expected a pretty big burn in q1 for a number of reasons as we were getting through some of the cost challenges in mexico, some buildup of ap at the end of the year, some capex carryover and what have you. so it's -- we're right on target with where we thought we would be at the end of the quarter for the balance of the year. as we mentioned, we'll have a bit of a burn in q2 before we turn to free cash flow positive in q3 and q4, ending the year in pretty -- what we think is very good shape.
we've got $107 million of availability under borrowings that are not outstanding today. so we feel very good from a liquidity standpoint through the balance of 2022 for sure.

and our next question comes from the line of tom curran with seaport research partners. please proceed with your question.
tom curran -- seaport research partners -- analyst
good afternoon.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
good afternoon. what you got for us?
tom curran -- seaport research partners -- analyst
just two. you've repeatedly emphasized that your primary focus for 2022 is execution. and it sounds as if the company is off to a promising start with that priority when it comes to transitions. could you elaborate on the transitions that occurred in china and india in 1q? were these transitions between customers or intra-customer transitions between molds? and what are some of the tactics that prove successful or lessons learned that you should be able to apply to future transitions, wherever they might be?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
no, great question. so in india, same customer, just going to a larger blade and in india -- that was in india, sorry. in china, same customer, two new blades. so multiple blade transitions in china plus a blade transition to a larger blade, both in india and in mexico for the same customer.
just as an example, now this is -- this one is a little bit unique because it's a blade we built in another factory in china. but from start of production until we got to our desired cycle time of 24 hours was five weeks. that is blazing speed to anybody in the blade industry. so -- and the reason why -- part of it was we had prior experience on the blade.
but the main reason is, is we've known about these transitions for a long-enough period of time that we were able to better collaborate and plan with our customer and hold our customer accountable for the portion of the transition that they need to participate in, whether it's approvals of molds being installed or cut up blades, various things. so it was really -- the lessons learned are just enough time to do truly detailed planning and do that planning with the participation of our customer and our suppliers for equipment and what have you. and then, execute that plan and hold all parties accountable. and i think that's the biggest lesson learned for us.
the other thing i will mention is we did -- we have a dedicated team now that is responsible for the transitions. so we have a dedicated team of unbelievable talented people that travel the globe and assist our local sites with the transitions and having them involved early often on the ground when we need them, that's been a big help as well.
tom curran -- seaport research partners -- analyst
and bill, how long have you had that team?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
we've had -- we haven't -- well, really just since last year is when we formed it, and we're able to carve out resources from our teams around the globe and just put this as one cohesive team. and we don't pull from that team for other projects, they are fully dedicated to transitions and start-ups. and so, just having a dedicated team that that is their focus. and we've had teams that have done transitions in the past, but not to the extent we do now, where they're 100% dedicated to a transition and to the start-ups.
they're a cohesive unit. i kind of -- i like to call them the go team. they pick up -- their bags are packed and they go when we have a transition and they camp out in the plant until we have it right. so -- but that's just been about over the last year is when we really started utilizing a fully dedicated team.
tom curran -- seaport research partners -- analyst
interesting. and then in mexico, you highlighted that production came in -- it sounds like a bit better than expected for 1q. could you clarify how juarez and matamoros performed, respectively? and then for matamoros, where you're at with getting the nordex facility up to where you want it to be?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. so juarez performed very well. that's where we had the kind of the build ahead. so for both blades that we're building for our customer there operationally went very well.
as you might recall, we had some challenges last year with the multi-piece blade when we started that out, but we've ironed those kinks out. we've worked very collaboratively with our customer, and we are on track to deliver the volumes they need this year. in matamoros, our plant for vestas there operated -- continues to operate very well. and with respect to nordex matamoros, operationally, we're in very good shape today.
we have -- we produce the volumes that we needed to produce in q1 after hitting our production in q4 as well. we are in the middle of a transition there. so -- and that is going as planned. so i would say, from a pure operational standpoint, we've turned the corner there.
the plant itself is now getting to a place that -- to become a world-class blade plant, which is what we like to operate. so we're very close to that. we still have some cost challenges there that we're working on. some of that is qualifying new material, locally sourced versus from china to avoid the logistics cost.
so we're working through those for the balance of the year. but operationally, from a production standpoint, we're in very good shape.
tom curran -- seaport research partners -- analyst
great. thanks for filling in our questions.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director

and our next question comes from the line of pavel molchanov with raymond james. please proceed with your question.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i dialed in a little late, so sorry if you covered this already. since the start of the war, i'm curious if, specifically from the european onshore market, you've encountered or your blade customers specifically have encountered any increase in incoming appetite from developers. in other words, natural gas, $20 in mcf, tremendous focus on disentangling from russian supply.
obviously, you're well positioned with your facility in turkey. is there anything like that that you can point to?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
i think there's certainly a lot of talk, pavel, about increasing installs over the foreseeable future. have we seen an increase in demand for the balance of '22 specifically related to that? i would say no. now, it's possible that blades that we are producing are now being diverted to europe that might have had been earmarked somewhere else. don't know that today.
i will tell you that about 37% of our blades in q1 went to europe compared to 30% last year. so whether that was already planned or that's -- there's some correlation, it's probably too early to tell. but we do expect, obviously, for the longer term for there to be really strong demand in the european market. but whether we're seeing it today just yet, i think it's still a bit early for that.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. and on the nonblade sales, $30 million this quarter, pretty solid growth versus a year ago. and i think your second-highest quarterly number ever in that category. is that still all from proterra?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
no. no, we've got proterra. clearly, it's still in the mix and then our ev customer that we're building parts for. that's clearly a big part of that as well.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
any sense of when you might be able to disclose some additional detail on who that is?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
my guess is we won't be able to disclose it. we'd love to be able to, but at this point, that's not there -- their policy is to not disclose their suppliers.
pavel molchanov -- raymond james -- analyst
understood. well, good to see the growth anyway.

our next question is a follow-up from julien dumoulin-smith with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good afternoon team. thanks for your time and patience. appreciate it. i just wanted to follow up here and talk a little bit, bill.
i wanted to follow up and talk a little bigger picture here and step back and certainly considering some of the comments from nextera out there about sort of the fungibility between solar and wind. what are you seeing out there in terms of early days on the back of ad/cvd, any effective pivots out there? again, i get that there's a lot of other dynamics here, but would love to hear how this might be fomenting potential demand, when that might materialize? and how much the bbb, yay or nay, might be holding customers back at the same time?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
yes. i think the uncertainty around long-term policy is probably overwriting any impact of the anti-circumvention stuff and maybe some -- i know nextera talked about a pivot or a shift from solar to more wind this year. we haven't seen a meaningful uptick as a result of the challenges in the solar market yet. but again, it's still a little bit early to see that demand shift.
there's -- it's not easy to just turn on and turn off these deals. so i will tell you that it is certainly possible that we start to see some of that manifest itself in the back end of the year. but at this point, i would say we haven't seen anything material.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and then, just when you think about the time line there for seeing some of that uptick, i mean, is it -- as you say, like by the end of the year, we get tax extenders or what have you, i mean, at least pencils down. hopefully, you see something of an uptick in u.s. origination just with that ""certainty"" at that point either way?
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
julien, yes, i think if something happens sooner rather than later and we get certainty then, clearly, that helps the market. when we see that manifest and a tick up in demand, i think it's still a little bit hard to tell. there are some that are saying, if we get something here before the midterms, which most don't think that's likely at this point. we still probably don't see any real impact until best case back half of 2023 from a major swing.
so again, i think it's a little hard to pin it down. i wish i could. but with the uncertainty there, as well as just the continued challenges from a supply chain and a cost standpoint, i think that's impacting some of the decision-making in the wait and see as well. so my best guess would be best case, it's a back half of '23, but more likely into '24.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. yeah. i gotcha. i appreciate that.
anyway, good luck. we'll -- we'll speak soon.
bill siwek -- president and chief executive officer, director
