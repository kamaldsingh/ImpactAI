as you know, i'll call you to sol global chinese and obtaining aip in singapore ip's is an important milestone for our international growth strategy. we will keep getting more licenses across some major regions. once these licenses are in place with our advanced trading platform and focus on user experience, we will be able to rapidly expand our user base and generate more revenue. although all of these developments will help us expanding into international markets. since this is our first earning call, i will like to take this opportunity to reiterate our vision and strategy.
moving now to the high (ph) trade four years ago, we sought to use cutting edge of technology to enable our user to trade it all over the world. we are more responsible to the needs of our customers than traditional brokers. and are reaping (ph) heavily to continue developing our proprietary infrastructure. we are now over treating customers in the usa, hong kong, uk and asia through tigr programs and also a truly diverse range of securities to our customers.
our ipo in late march of this year was a great milestone for the company. we look forward to leveraging our increased brand recognition and are committed to investing in technology and talent. we aim to create a comprehensive financial services in ecosystem for both the individual and the institutional investors as well as our corporate partners. we are confident we can deliver long term value to our shareholders.
i will now conclude my remarks and hand the call over to mr. john zeng, our cfo. thank you.
john zeng -- chief financial officer
all right. thank you, tianhua. let me just quickly go through the financials. our total revenue in the first quarter were $9.6 million well of which $6.4 million came from trading commissions. net revenue over $9.4 million after interest expense. financing service fee in the first quarter were $2.1 million or 22% of the revenue. this increase was attributed increasing the margin trade balance.
interest income was $0.5 million or 5% of the revenue. the interest income represents the interest fee, we derived from the marginal balance of this consolidated accounts as well as portion of the interest from their cash balance. other revenue were $0.6 million up 6.8% from the same quarter last year primarily derived from the fees we gathered for ipo subscription service and esop promotional services we provide for two corporate clients.
now on the cost, total cost were $40 million, up 36.4% over the same quarter last year. the increase was due to the much larger size of operating mostly came from our headcount increase compared to one year ago.
employees compensation and benefits were $7.8 million for this quarter up 61% from first quarter last year. this is due to the rapid growth of our headcount in 2018, which almost doubled from last year. much of the increase came from our investment in r&d, finance and compliance personnels as well as share based compensation.
occupancy, depreciation and amortization was $0.6 million, up 14.5% from the same quarter last year. as we are expanding onshore and offshore, which result in office space. communication and market data costs was $1.2 million, up 87% from the same quarter last year. the increase is due to -- we offer more market data to our customers and our platform. marketing and branding cost was $1.9 million, down 28% from the same quarter last year. as we are optimizing our operating to decrease referral payments to third-party platform and marketing partners.
sg&a was $2.2 million up 39% from the same quarter last year, mostly due to increased the consulting expense and preservation of fees, we paid out in the same company. execution (ph) and carrying costs were $0.3 million, this increase was reflecting the increased number of consolidated outcomes.
net loss attributable to ordinary shareholder in the quarter was $2.9 million compared to a loss of the $2.2 million in the same quarter of last year. net loss per ads was $0.6 compared to a loss of $0.7 per ads during the same quarter of last year. as of march 31st, our company had a very strong balance sheet with the cash and cash equivalent balance of $144 million. our ipos closed on march 20, so we are comfortable in our ability to continue investing our business.

ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (operator instructions) your first question comes from the line of edward du from deutsche bank. you may now ask the question.
edward du -- deutsche bank -- analyst
(foreign language)
(foreign language) now, let me just transfer to english mode. i have two question. my first question is that you know, share some color on your oversea license application progress and what's your expectation on a contribution to your business. once you successfully acquired those license and my second question follows that, can you sure the impact, what's your expectation on the impact from the xiaomi acquisition of the digital banking license, especially in the cost saving angle and any potential contribution to your revenue? thank you.
john zeng -- chief financial officer
(foreign language) okay. so let -- me let me just quickly translate answer to your first question, eddy. so in terms of licensing, you know, our goal is to be able to serve the global chinese population. so having more licensing enables us to you know conduct more business in the other region of china. so the aip, we got in singapore is a good example of executing our global expansion strategy. so another type of licenses, which will enable us to increase our revenue and decrease our cost, when we reach certain scales. but this is something we are working on, based on our current operating and hopefully one day we will be able to, you know, extract more revenue out of our operations.
unidentified speaker
(foreign language) it's just a quick summary. so we do it now. we know that xiaomi other than digital banking license. as you know xiaomi is our long term shareholder. they are the investors in the first one. so we have already a good relationship with xiaomi. now to be candid in the short term, we don't think this will have a meaningful difference to our business based on what the digital banking license can operate under the current hong kong regulating. but we do think going forward, if you look at long-term this will definitely help us with our account conversions especially with the transformation in technology in the banking system. we do hope, you know, a long two years down the road. this kind of digital license will help our operation.
operator
(operator instructions) your next question comes from the line of jiaxing zhou (ph) from cicc. please go ahead. you can now ask question.
jiaxing zhou -- cicc -- analyst
(foreign language) thank you management. congratulations again on our successful listing. i have two questions. first, we observed tigr has already participated in many eye-catching ipo subscription in the us stock market such as tme and zoom, which is really popular and value added service for our organization. so should we expect tigr will continue expanding us ipo subscription service in the next few years and how can we get more proportions of market shares in those ipos. and secondly, and our compensation and benefits increased significantly in this quarter and so what's the outlook for our recruitment playing and how should we project this expense in our forecast? thank you.
unidentified speaker
(foreign language). right. so a quick summary. at philadelphia or not all of you know the us ipo process is different from hong kong and asia. so in the us, the tipping point is, there is no retail tranche. most of this retail came from dsp, which means now you have to know the management -- or part of the employee program to be able to participate.
so tigr, you know, a broker way -- pioneer of this kind of ipo subscription service for the retail investors a year ago. and we want to just you know pass the benefits of to buying the high gross us companies such type of benefits to the retail investors. and also now -- this kind of service is actually a good way for us to also get closer either with corporate issuers, we can you know supply with retail demands also institutional events. we can also provide ir, pr services to those proper issuers, which is a good way for us to help them to you know build it a public image.
i think that if -- as mr. wu just mention that, i think that if retail investors they do see the value of tigr broker provides to see it's differentiated from other brokers in this kind of industry. so that's why they do want to you know, joining us you know, use our platform to be able to subscribe for us ipos.
jiaxing zhou -- cicc -- analyst
(foreign language)
unidentified speaker
in terms of employee compensation and headcount. so as you can see from 2018 or 2017, we have been increasing our -- in terms of to attract talents. most of the increase came from r&d. we think this is something sets us apart from other traditional brokers. yes, we do see technology can transform, you know, brokerage business. so we will keep investing but headcount increase won't as be as dramatic as last year given we know our headcount is almost doubled from last year. we look selectively keep recruiting key talents to make sure, we stay on top of this kind of industry. thank you.
jiaxing zhou -- cicc -- analyst
thank you.
operator
(operator instructions) your next question comes from the line of daphne poon from citibank. you may now ask the question.
daphne poon -- citibank -- analyst
hi. good evening, management. thanks for taking my question. so my first question is about the esop management scheme, that we understand that you launched that quite recently in late 2018. so i would like to understand, while how is your progress here, for example in terms of the number of corporates that you have signed up so far. and also how is that expected to contribute in terms of your longer term, like current growth and also the ipo revenue growth.
and secondly, i would like to check on your progress in terms of the migration of current accounts from the fully disclosed account model to the consolidated account model. like so far what percentage of the, kind of, current account has been migrated. and how is the client's acceptance level to that change and you see any major pushback from your clients.
and lastly, the first question is regarding the outlook on your commission income or maybe your trading volume of the rest of the year. so we see q1 is a little bit slow, as you are expecting, is due to the weaker current sentiment. but actually in q1, we see the us and hong kong market both performed quite well while going into q2 and now we have this like favorable concern and market become more volatile. so how do you see that trading volume or kind activity trending into q2 or into rest of the year. thank you.
unidentified speaker
(foreign language) hi, let me translate the esop question. so esop, you know, just frankly say where we started relative in may, but we have been making a really good progress. so right now, those -- esop clients haven't really reflecting to our revenue that we believe in the next 6 months to 12 months, when the ipo is completed. they will be able to be our high calibre customers for the next several quarters.
so also -- how we are approaching esop service, is now we don't just treat it as a single product. we do think it's a company package, we will offer to proper issuers. that we mentioned earlier, no matter it's a ipo subscription or pr you know ir services. so we do think you know, by mixing it with a company package especially now in our reputation in the us market, we do think it's offer us a competitive edge over our competitors in this current us ipo and esop services.
and to answer your second question, i would just -- as your segments for now. so what do you know one migration back in february -- five people consulted their accounts. so far you know the transaction has been pretty smooth. we don't see much pushback from the investors and we think, you know, this may consolidate account do give us more flexibility to better serve our customers in terms of some other value added services. for example, like ipo subscription services.
for your third question on outlook of the transaction volume. so you are right that the transaction value, if you just look at the market you know the january especially second half of january. the marketing hong kong and us do pick up. for our transaction volumes, it's a little bit slower to pick up. i think there is a lagging effect, plus there is a chinese holiday in february. so that's why our net commission revenue was a little bit nice decrease or slow versus the last quarter.
by looking forward the trade was so far we think just by looking at the management account or some numbers. we think it's going ok that transaction volume and also the incomes of tradition and it's commissions but we don't know like you, of course, you can start a huge swing in the market volatility -- it will definitely impact our business. but so far i think we are on the right track.
operator
(operator instructions) your next question comes from the line of edward du from deutsche bank. you may now ask the question.
edward du -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi. thanks, management. i just have some follow-up question for the financial data for your first quarter and may i have the color or the gross rate or is the -- that number above your margin finance and the trading amounts. and my second questions is about that, can i have the gross commission breakdown in fourth quarter, preferably into like hong kong stocks, us stock, us futures, us options and other products. and in the meanwhile i have also the share trading volume for example share units in the above mentioned products and the total trading amount by dollar -- us dollar or hong kong dollar by above mentioned product and that's all my question. thank you.
unidentified speaker
okay, eddy. i will answer your questions. so in terms of trading volumes, i think it's on par with our numbers last year, ok. the same quarter last year the trading mix in terms of the mix of the different products is -- us equities, it's about like -- sorry -- in terms of the revenue mix the us equities is probably close to 50% of our revenue. the hong kong equities -- in terms of revenue is probably high -- close to 20%. then we also have fortune (ph) is about like 20% of our revenue futures comes for like high single digits of our revenue.
in terms of transaction volume mix, it's about like us accounts for close to 30%, the hong kong about like it's maybe over 10%. future is about like 40s, option is about like high single digits. that's the mix of the transaction volume and the revenue. in terms of the marginal balance, also it's on par slightly above our first quarter last year. so that's why you see our financial service fee may increase from last year. we do see more people adding on margins, starting from late first quarter and we're thinking, you know, so far the train machine on here, so far it is still on the right track. so hopefully -- for the next quarter, we can report more financing income from margin balance.

it is my pleasure to now introduce our chairman and chief executive officer mr. wu. mr. wu will make remarks in chinese, which will be followed by an english translation.
mr. wu, please go ahead with your remarks. 
wu tianhua -- chairman and chief executive officer
[foreign language] good day, everyone and i appreciate your attendance in tiger brokers' fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. in the fourth quarter, our operating and financial metrics exhibited solid improvement due to a surge in new clients, as well as enhancements to our platform and services. in the fourth quarter, total revenue was $47.2 million, 2.4 times compared to that of the same period last year and a new all-time high. tiger's operating efficiency and profitability continue to improve.
non-gaap net income was $10.3 million in the fourth quarter, nearly 30 times the non-gaap net income in the same quarter last year. in addition, i am pleased to report that we added 44,000 new funded accounts this quarter nearly quadruple the number from the same period last year. total funded accounts reached 259,000 by the end of 2020 more than double that of 2019. growth in client assets was outstanding.
total account balance reached $16 billion more than triple that of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 46.2% higher than the third quarter of 2020. overall, for 2020, total revenue was $138 million more than double versus 2019. we were profitable for the first time on a yearly basis. non-gaap net income was $22.3 million in 2020, a big improvement from a non-gaap loss of $1.8 million in 2019.
i would now like to take this opportunity to comment on three notable milestones in our development. first and foremost, our internationalization strategy continues to progress nicely. tiger brokers now have subsidiaries and offices in the u.s., australia, singapore and new zealand that possess a wide range of licenses that spanned brokerage, investment banking and asset managements, among others. in the fourth quarter, i am pleased to report that our expansion in the aforementioned overseas markets accelerated.
international clients represented 40% of newly funded accounts. we expect that in 2021 we will add more than 350,000 funded accounts. international clients will comprise more than 50% of the new funded accounts. moving on, our investment banking esop services continue to lead the market.
we're committed to our growth strategy of leveraging tiger's core brokerage business to generate synergies among esop, investment banking, and internationalization. in 2020, in total, we participated in 26 chinese adr ipos in the u.s. and in q4 we participated in eight listings, such as 17 in technology, ihuman inc. and yatsen holding limited.
recently, we also underwrote the secondary listings of bilibili and autohome in hong kong. i would like to express my appreciation to all of these companies for their trust at such an important time reflecting on the development of our investment banking business. in just two years, we have become the number one underwriter globally in terms of deal counts for chinese adr issuance. esop, our system for managing employee stock options, continues to grow at a rapid pace.
in the past year, of the chinese adr issuers that listed in the u.s., over half chose to adopt our esop system, including popular issuers like li auto, kingsoft cloud, and yatsen holding limited, among others. the growth and adoption of our esop system accelerated as we added 35 clients in the fourth quarter for a cumulative total of 124 clients. we expect our esop system to maintain its leading position and foresee further increases in market share. finally, we continue to invest in developing our self-clearing capabilities.
in july of 2019, when we acquired marsco, a u.s. broker dealer with over 30 years of self clearing experience. we also acquired their clearing licenses. our investment to transition to self-clearing remains a key milestone in our firm's developing.
we now have the technological and operational prowess to control every aspect of our brokerage system from the front end to the back end. self clearing has also created a competitive barrier for our firm due to its extensive technical compliance and operational requirements. the percentage of clients having their u.s. cash equities trades, self-cleared by marsco, continues to increase and at the end of the fourth quarter reached over 20%.
in addition, marsco is conducting clearing for all new clients on-boarding in the u.s. as i conclude my prepared remarks, i would like to thank the investors who participated in our convertible bond issuance for their support of our firm. in february 2021, we in total issued $65 million of convertible bonds. this capital will accelerate our international expansion, as well as support further investments in our research and development capabilities.
i would now like to invite our cfo, john to summarize our financial performance.
john zeng -- chief financial officer
hello, everyone. thanks for joining the call. so let me go through our financial performance for the fourth quarter. all numbers are in usd.
total revenues were $47.2 million this quarter, increased 137% from the same quarter of last year. the increase was due to bigger user base as more people entrust us with their assets and a more active market backdrop. within the total revenue, commission increased 245% from last year to reach $25.2 million. interest-related income, which combines financial service fee and interest income, was $13.3 million, an increase of 53% from last year.
other revenue, mostly revenue from our investment banking business, increased 118% from last year to $8.7 million. interest expense increased to $4.3 million from $1.5 million last year as we have more consolidated account customers. net revenue after interest expense was $43 million, an increase of 135% from the same quarter last year. now on the cost, execution and clearing expense were $4.2 million increased to 363% year over year due to increase in user base and more engaged trading activities.
the increase in user base also increased communication and market data expense by 103% to $3.9 million. employee compensation increased 47% to $15.5 million as we keep adding headcount, especially in r&d and product to support our global expansion. as a result of headcount increase, our occupancy expense increased 12% to $1.3 million. sg&a also increased 70% to $4.8 million year over year.
marketing expense were $6.5 million this quarter, an increase of 277% from same quarter last year. we will keep spending in branding and customer acquisition to accompany our internationalization. total operating costs were $36.3 million, an increase of 90% from same quarter last year. as a result, our net income was $8.5 million this quarter.
non-gaap net income, which excludes share-based compensation, was $10.3 million this quarter, 30 times the non-gaap net income in the same quarter of last year. now i have concluded our presentation. operator, please open the line for q&a. thanks.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from jacky zuo from china renaissance. please ask your question.
jacky zuo -- china renaissance -- analyst
hi, management, thanks for taking my questions. i have two questions. number one is about our guidance. i heard we expect 350,000 new paying users for this year, just want to understand the drivers behind this guidance, what is trend in the first quarter this year? and we also mentioned 50% of it will come from overseas markets, so can give us more details in terms of breakdown of like singapore, u.s.
and other countries? and second question is about our singapore business, i saw that [inaudible] actually entered singapore in march. do we expect some impact from this in terms of our growth and how do we deal with intensifying competition in singapore? thank you.
wu tianhua -- chairman and chief executive officer
[foreign language] thanks, jacky. so let me quickly translate tianhua's answer for your first question. so let me put it this way. so traditionally, tiger's users mostly are onshore chinese.
so starting from last year, we started to onboard singapore clients so far is showing good results. so this year, we will expand in the u.s. and australia. so on a high level, more geographic expansion and our experience in singapore give us the confidence to acquire more users this year.
so we understand investors are getting nervous recently about the market this year. so the 350,000 guidance is not based on our high growth in 2020, instead we used 2019 data when market activity was much lower as our base case. so in 2019, each quarter we add up 42,000 customer accounts. so assuming u.s.
and australia, we will gradually reach their number this year, combining with singapore, we feel pretty comfortable each quarter we will have at least 100,000 new customer accounts from offshore investors. and based on our experience, offshore clients have much higher customer accounts to fund their account conversion, typically loss of 60%, so this translates to around 60,000 funded accounts each quarter from offshore. and we are confident onshore clients and esop also add another 20,000 to 30,000 funded accounts each quarter. so combining that, we feel pretty confident we can reach our guidance of 350,000 funded accounts this year.
ok, so regarding singapore, so there will be some competition, but we don't think it's a zero-sum game, because we feel the tam in singapore is still very big for us to grab. so if you look at singapore's existing market, based on cdp data, there are about 1.3 million accounts that trade singapore local stocks and most of them still prefer to place order by phone. and this is a market we haven't really penetrated yet. so currently, tiger, our focus is on the incremental market, the younger generation, the younger singaporeans similar to our chinese users, who is more interested in u.s.
or hong kong stock and this incremental market is showing good momentum. so we will tap into the existing market by adding more local products on our platform such as [inaudible] and giving singapore [inaudible] so we can provide better service and acquire more users from both market segments. thanks.

thank you. our next question comes from hui han from cicc. please ask the question.
hui han -- cicc -- analyst
hi, management, thanks for taking my questions. i am hui han from cicc. and firstly, congratulate on the exciting results we have achieved. and i have two questions here.
the first one is about our growing customers. we see a total of 44,000 funded accounts added in this quarter and the total pay on customers has reached nearly 260,000 by 2020, but we also see the world of higher market environments gratefully. i am wondering first it will be â if it's the bear market since the second quarter then what measures will you take on customer acquisition and how to increase the customer activeness? and on the second question is regarding on our corporate business, in this quarter, we see a record growth of new esop clients, with 35 newly added and existing â most of our major competitors, which is management's share more with us that's why we have grown so rapidly on the esop in the recent years and what are our unique advantages? thank you.
wu tianhua -- chairman and chief executive officer
[foreign language] ok, so thanks for your questions. to answer your first one, so since our inception seven years ago, we have experienced quite a few market volatility. so we have experienced on that. so in general for our business, especially for the online broker business, we tend to have higher retention, so quarterly retention rates around 98% through our operating history like how do we increase user activities and keep the retention.
so for the past year, we actually have been spending quite a resource to optimize our online community operation. so far, we have seen positive results. for example, our content consumer or content creators, in general, their retention rate will be 20% higher than rest of the users. good content can also help users to make decision and increase trading activities.
on average, content users' trading activity will more than double. if you log on to tiger community, you can see when our offshore clients, they are actually more engaging in our community, we have seen more and more english posts in our community, which is it's a good progress we think may we will keep investing. and also for brokers business, volatility in certain extent is good for us. so for example, in first quarter last year, even doing big corrections, user engagements were still pretty high.
we are thinking about throughout this year given the media coverage and also the transparency of information, we think the market volatility will continue. in the worst case scenario, i'd say if it's a bear market, we also have more wealth management product for our users. for example, we are adding mutual fund automatic investment plan, we also have cash management product and cash costs. so i think, those wealth management product will help our users to manage their investment during bear markets.
ok, so regarding esop, we think actually, it's pretty high, and you need to know how to be able to be a good esop provider. so first of all given all of our esop clients, they are international company, now they have subsidiaries or employees from different countries, different regions. so i think as a service provider ourselves needs to be a global company to have the global platform to service their different reach in employees. so tiger, we have licensing in singapore, u.s., australia, so we feel we are more capable to be customized and tailored to the different needs of our each esop clients.
so that's the first point. the second -- obviously, the second growth driver for our esop business is as you can see from our past reports, so far we have been generating good synergy between esop and our investment banking business. so we not only help company to get invested to raise funds, we also help them from the very beginning to help them to manage the plan to satisfy with the local regulations and also to help them go through the ipo process and to manage their plans when the stock options are listed. so the combination or i would say the bound-over service between our esop perhaps has been showing really good results.
and the way we're confident going forward, this strategy will keep working and provide the best service for our clients. lastly is now esop is a pretty, i would say, complex business and we are investing heavily in research and development and also acquire, recruit talent to be the one-stop solution provider combining hr, tax, legal, compliance and accounting expertise to make the esop management more efficient and user friendly for our corporate users. thank you.

ok, let me thank you for my questions. i have three questions. the first one is regarding on the hong kong license, you mentioned the share of the progress of our hong kong build its license application? second question is about our international business. so you mentioned the increase of the marketing expense was primarily due to global expansion.
could you share the customization costs per paying client in china, hong kong overseas market and how we should look at the revenue contribution from the overseas market after 25 years? and my third question is on commission rate, in my calculation our commission would increase sequentially during the quarter, any color for that would be helpful? thank you.
wu tianhua -- chairman and chief executive officer
[foreign language] so to answer your question on internationalization, so we're very committed and are optimistic about our global expansion strategy, because first of all it's my â we see the global expansion strategy is a good way for us to increase the funded accounts, our customer account to funded account conversion. like we mentioned earlier, a lot of those regions, the conversion rate can't be more than 50% and i am 60%, 70%. so in this way, this will give us big tailwinds once we generate good customers offshore and build a good momentum, you can't help us to reach over 1 million funded account customers in the near future. so our goal is to become a one stop investment platform for global investors, no matter where they are based.
so we are very committed to internationalization. and in addition to the operating data growth by internationalization, we feel by acquiring more investors offshore we will also help us to generate better financial results for the company and for the shareholders. so that's your question on internationalization. so on marketing, the customer acquisition, so if you look at our 2020 data, our customer acquisition cost is like $100 per person, ok? so this actually has come down from earlier and i say 2019, our customer acquisition costs about was about like $200 to $300.
so the reason of the decrease is due to of course we already have a better branding now and it's more natural traffic and also we are providing more comprehensive services to the users. so there are more users coming to our platform. going forward, when we expand offshore, we think the customer acquisition costs will go up, because first of all, there might be other players we will be competing for the â competing for the users. second thing is if you go to new markets, it will take us some time to build up our brand.
so at the very beginning, we will spend more to do more branding to increase our brand awareness, but through our past experience, we think all those â my marketing expense are well worth it, because if you look at our customer-payback period actually came down to just maybe one quarter. so if we go to more market, we will just mimic the same strategy to keep spending to acquire users. so in the short run, i think, opening data will build a bigger user base is more important for us. so we will keep spending once we get into the new markets.
and for your take rates, yes, so the commission rate, if you just calculate commission rates go up a little bit versus last quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but eventually, we haven't done any pricing change. ok, so our pricing stay the same for u.s. it's about like $0.01 per share, minimum to $2.99 and for hong kong it's 2.9 bps for hong kong securities trading. and to answer your question on the hong kong license, so we have resubmitted our application to acquire hong kong stock broker earlier last month.
so we believe the application contains all the information required by sfc. as a result of the discussion, we initiate with them to confirm what was required. so the regulator may require further information for us although we believe we have given them a very comprehensive material. so so far we have â they have not asked for any follow-up information, they may do so in due course, but so far, they haven't done there yet.
so typically, the application will take six to 12 weeks to process. obviously, we cannot guarantee the outcome or timing, but we are as confident as we can be that we have filed everything the regulator reasonably needs to consider application. thanks.
hanyang wang -- 86research -- analyst
i have a question on the tax benefits, what costs are tax benefits during the quarter?
john zeng -- chief financial officer
yes. so we just breakeven for this year, right. so as every start-up, when they breakeven, before they were breakeven, they have huge losses before. so we have a cumulative amount of tax benefit.
so once we started to breakeven, we would be able to utilize those tax benefits for this quarter.
hanyang wang -- 86research -- analyst

hello, everyone, and welcome to tiger brokers 2021 first-quarter earnings conference call.
tianhua wu -- investor relations

unknown speaker
substantial investments in our platform and services, coupled with strong growth in new clients, led to notable increases across our core operating and financial indicators. in the first quarter, total revenue reached an all-time high of us$81.3 million, 3.6 times that of the first quarter of last year. the profit growth and operating efficiency of our firm continue to accelerate. we reported non-gaap profit of us$23.5 million, which was not only 22 times higher than that of the same period last year but also a sum that exceeded the total for fiscal year 2020.
another notable achievement was our addition of 117,000 funded accounts, a new record high for a single quarter. clients continue to allocate more capital to our platform and total client assets reached $21 billion, 3.9 times higher than the same period last year.
tianhua wu -- investor relations
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
i would now like to take this opportunity to provide investors with an update on three key business initiatives at our company.
tianhua wu -- investor relations
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
first, i am pleased to report that our internationalization strategy is progressing well. tiger brokers has established offices and licensed subsidiaries in the u.s., australia, singapore, new zealand, as well as other countries and regions, and our group possesses licenses pertaining to brokerage, investment banking, and asset management, among others. recall what i said during our 2020 third-quarter earnings, that our goal was to have offshore clients account for more than 50% of our quarterly newly funded accounts within the next six to 12 months. i am proud to announce that we have already achieved that objective.
in the first quarter of newly funded accounts, over 50% of came from outside of china. internationalization not only helps us fuel user growth. it also equips us with the know-how for dealing with regulatory bodies across multiple jurisdictions, which boost our capability to meet the global investing needs of both individual investors and corporate clients alike.
tianhua wu -- investor relations
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
second, as our firm scales, we expect our core businesses, namely, brokerage, investment banking, esop, as well as our internationalization strategy to contribute to each other's respective growth. our investment banking business continues to be highly active. in the first quarter, we participated in 14 ipos, of which we underwrote eight, such as quhuo and kopin group others. we continue to remain appreciative of the trust issuers place in our firm.
we started this business just a little over two years ago. but in that short time, we have already become the no. 1 underwriter by deal count for chinese adr issuance. moving on, growth in our esop business remains very impressive.
in the first quarter, we added 41 new esop clients for a grand total of 165 clients. we are thankful of the trust corporate clients have conferred on our firm. and i'm happy to report that in the last year, of the chinese issuers that have pursued a u.s. listing, approximately 50% of issuers chose tiger to provide esop service.
tianhua wu -- investor relations
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
finally, i would like to provide an update on our self-clearing capabilities. in july of 2019, when we acquired marsco, a broker-dealer with over 30 years' experience in self-clearing, we also acquired their self-clearing license. this acquisition is a landmark in our firm's history as we now exert control over every aspect of our brokerage system. while implementing self-clearing has, of course, raised new technical compliance and operational requirements, it has also created a new moat around our business.
i am pleased to report that as of the first quarter of 2021, over 30% of our clients were having their u.s. cash equities self cleared by marsco. in addition, since the fourth quarter of 2020, all new clients on board in the u.s. were having their trades self cleared by marsco.
furthermore, all new chinese clients are having their u.s. cash equities trades, self cleared by marsco. we project that by the end of this year, we will be self-clearing over 70% of our clients. finally, we are grateful to the consortium of leading institutional investors who participated in our convertible bond issuances in february and april of this year.
we, in total, raised $155 million, which we will employ to advance our international expansion, as well as make further investments in our research and development capabilities. i would now like to invite our cfo, john, to review our financial results.
john zeng -- chief financial officer
thanks, tianhua, and clark. let me go through our first-quarter financial performance. all numbers are in u.s. dollar.
as tianhua mentioned earlier, all of our business units, including both retail and corporate services, have performed very well this quarter. our internationalization is also progressing rapidly that enable us to acquire more user, increase customer to fund the account conversion, and bring in more client assets. as a result, total revenue were $81.3 million for this quarter, an increase of 256% from the same quarter of last year. within total revenue, commission were $53 million, an increase of 277% year over year as our user base is much bigger versus a year ago.
and our users have been active with favorable market backdrop in the first quarter. interest-related income, which combines financing service fee and interest income, increased 179% year over year to reach $17.9 million this quarter, also due to bigger user base and the increased market activities. other revenue, mostly revenue from our investment banking business, increased 331% year over year to $10.5 million. our underwriting pipeline is very strong.
and we maintained the no. 1 position in terms of deal counts for chinese adr underwriting. now on the cost. interest expense increased 480% year over year to $5.5 million this quarter, in line with our user growth and increase in margin activities.
execution and clearing expense were $8.2 million this quarter, increased 366% year over year and 97% quarter over quarter. as we have more consolidated account customers and starting to record more clearing expense on our book. thanks to our gradual ramp-up of self-clearing, our clearing cost as percent of commission actually came down quarter over quarter from 16.5% in the fourth quarter last year to 15.5% this quarter, even when we had a huge increase in consolidated account customer this quarter. we expect clearing costs to further come down when we self-clear for more clients.
employee compensation increased 58% year over year to $16.5 million as we keep adding headcounts, especially in r&d and product to support global expansion. along with headcount increase, occupancy expense increased slightly to $1.2 million this quarter. sg&a increased 78% year over year to $4.1 million this quarter. marketing expenses were $12.8 million this quarter, an increase of 371% from the same quarter last year as first-quarter market sentiment was favorable toward investors, and we took this opportunity for client acquisition.
we will keep spending in branding and customer acquisition to accompany our global expansion. as a result of rapid user growth, communication and data usage also increased 116% year over year to $4 million this quarter. after taking all the expense, our net income was $21.1 million this quarter versus a net loss of $0.2 million in the same quarter last year. non-gaap net income which excludes share-based compensation, impairment loss from equity investment, and fair value change from convertible bonds, was $23.5 million this quarter, increased 21 times from the same quarter of last year.
now i have concluded our presentation. operator, please open the line for q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of han pu of cicc. please go ahead.
han pu -- cicc research department -- analyst
[foreign language] this is han pu from cicc, and many congrats on such a strong quarter. i have two questions. the first one is about the esop business. we see the strong growth in the number of clients this quarter.
could you please give us more comments on the growth momentum and taking advantages and potential synergies of this business? this is my first question. and my second question is about the competitive landscape of the singapore market and our potential market share considering more online brokers have joined the market aggressively. thanks.
tianhua wu -- investor relations
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
ok. let me translate the first question. so first of all, esop is becoming a standard to new economy companies. and we think, you know, there are a lot more new economy company coming to the market, which esop has a huge potential.
so tiger esop is not only a saas software. it offers actually comprehensive service ranging from benefit consulting trust service, covers the whole spectrum of stock option management. also with tiger's global licenses, we can service different -- we can service companies with global footprints to satisfy their stock option needs. our esop service is getting very good brand recognition, especially for chinese adr offerings.
in the past year, over 50% of the chinese adr issuers choose us as esop writer. in addition to service u.s. and hong kong-listed companies, now we can also provide esop service to a-share listed or potential a-share ipo companies. we see a-share esop market with huge potential and confident we can grab big market share in the a-share space as well.
tianhua wu -- investor relations
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
first of all, we always work on competition. competition is good for investors and for the industry. it's also a driving force for us to keep innovate and offer a differentiated product and services. we feel very confident to maintain our market-leading position in singapore.
we offer more trading products versus our competitors. in addition to u.s., hong kong, singapore equities, we also offer dlc trading at fund mall, which is our digital wealth management platform. we also started to offer u.s. ipo subscription service to qualify the singapore investors.
this is not a service offered by existing brokers and can only do so by leveraging tiger's market-leading u.s. ipo underwriting capability. furthermore, we are in the process to apply sgx clearing license. once we have the scx clearing license, we can offer more competitive pricing for low-cost stock trading and penetrate deeper into the existing singapore investment market.
one more point i want to highlight is our collaboration with singapore local companies. for example, last month, we started co-promotion with grab. so far, we have received good response from both grab and tiger users. we will roll out more partnership like this to offer localized service to singapore investors.
thanks.
han pu -- cicc research department -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. [foreign language]
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jacky zuo of china renaissance. your line is open. please go ahead.
jacky zuo -- china renaissance -- analyst
[foreign language] so, thanks management, and congrats for the decent results. i have two questions. number one is about our u.s. stock self-clearing progress.
as john mentioned, our clearing fees as a percentage of our commission revenue start to decrease q on q. and 30% of our existing customers start to switch to marsco self-clearing. so just i want to understand from stock trading volume perspective, when can we achieve 100% of clearing? and what is the p&l implication? and second question is about the dream product. so do we plan to launch cryptocurrency trading in the future? thank you.
tianhua wu -- investor relations
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
ok. let me translate. so by end of last quarter, all u.s.-based investors are using marsco to clear u.s. cash equities.
as of march 31, about 30% of tiger's users are using marsco for clearing. in the third quarter -- second quarter, we just started using marsco for new accounts from china region. we expect by end of this year, more than 70% of our users will be clearing through marsco. in terms of trading volume, we think by early next year, we will have all the trading volume for cash equities cleared by marsco.
we've already seen clearing costs came down due to self-clearing on a quarter-over-quarter basis. we expect clearing costs to further come down once we have more clients trading through marsco. just roughly estimate, if we use the 2020 clearing expense as a proxy, i think if we clear everything by ourselves, the clearing expense can save for us$30 million. thanks.
tianhua wu -- investor relations
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
so we know this cryptocurrency, for example, bitcoin, has becoming more acceptable by mainstream investors since last year and is emerging as an asset class. tiger's mission is to making investing more efficient and enjoyable for investors. so crypto is definitely a product in our pipeline. given crypto is the new asset class and many regulations are still work in progress, at tiger, we will take a very prudent approach.
first of all, we will only offer crypto trading to offshore clients. we are now going to offer such service to chinese nationals. in addition, the tiger subsidiary offering crypto trading needs to apply local license and be compliant with local regulation. for example, in the u.s., brokers need money service license to offer crypto trading, in singapore, it is psa license.
we are in the process to apply those licenses. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of julia zhang of citigroup. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
[foreign language] i will first translate my question. thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to ask questions. this is julia from citi. i have one question.
we have seen the market experience some level of pullback lately. could management please give us guidance in terms of the impact of the business? thank you.
tianhua wu -- investor relations
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
we do see some moderating market sentiment activities in the second quarter, but our key priority, user acquisition, has been going very well due to our value-added service and more geographic expansion. we see that inflow coming out to our platform, even when market is more choppy lately. and from a broker's perspective, relative volatility is actually good for our business sentiment. some investors may wonder whether market pullback will affect tiger's underwriting business.
in the short term, market pullback has delayed quite a few offerings, semi impact to tiger and other investment bank. but on the other hand, when market is not very good, we can actually better differentiate tiger's service and capabilities versus traditional banks. and we actually have acquired more mandates mainly as the lead bank. our pipeline is very strong, and we look forward to more revenue from our underwriting business later this year.
thanks.

mr. wu, please go ahead with your remarks. 
tianhua wu -- chairman and chief executive officer
hello, everyone, and welcome to tiger brokers 2021 second-quarter earnings conference call. although market sentiment was weaker in the second quarter, we still achieved substantial growth, thanks to internationalization and the strength of our comprehensive product and service offerings. total revenue in the second quarter was $60.2 million representing 98.7% growth year over year. this quarter, we also increased investment in user acquisition, self-clearing and talent recruitment.
we are confident such investments will bolster our market-leading position and fuel future expansion in our business. factor in the $13.7 million fair value change to convertible bonds we issued earlier this year, non-gaap loss is $4.4 million for this quarter. total customer accounts increased by 249,000 in the second quarter to 1.649 million, which is two times the total number of accounts in the same period of last year. we added 153,000 funded accounts this quarter, 4.5 times that of the quarterly addition last year and a 30.4% increase quarter over quarter.
number of total funded accounts rose to 529,000. of the 153,000 new additions this quarter, over 60% came from offshore, exhibiting the growing momentum of our internationalization strategy. total newly funded accounts in the first half of 2021 reached 270,000, surpassing the total number of funded accounts acquired since our platform went online in 2015 through 2020. even with a weaker market backdrop, we still see healthy asset inflows.
total aum reached $23.9 billion this quarter, up nearly three times year over year and 11.8% quarter over quarter. i would now like to take this opportunity to provide investors an update on three key business initiatives at our company. tiger brokers is continually expanding. our global reach and our network of subsidiaries covers the u.s., australia, singapore and other countries.
our subsidiaries were licensed to conduct a wide range of securities businesses, including investment banking, asset management and brokerage. our internationalization continues to accelerate. more than 60% of newly funded accounts this quarter came from offshore markets. and as of june 30, 40% of our total funded accounts were from international users.
we only started executing on our internationalization strategy just over a year ago. but our progress thus far is a testament to the value proposition of our platform in foreign markets. we see vast latent demand for our services across a wide range of countries and regions and expect that internationalization will not only slow growth in new accounts but also raise the ceiling for the future size of our client base. as we expand to new countries and add products and markets to our trading platform, our firm gains new experience and knowledge for engaging with regulatory bodies, enabling us to further enhance the client experience.
i am pleased to report that as of today, we already have over 200,000 funded accounts in singapore. we firmly believe internationalization will drive further growth. although the market has been weak since the second quarter, we are confident to achieve our guidance of 350,000 new funded accounts this year. 2b services, today, our growth strategy and envisions simultaneously developing our expertise in investment banking, esop and brokerage to augment our capabilities to meet our clients' global financial services needs.
the rapid expansion of our esop business continues to exceed our expectations. in the second quarter, we added 51 new esop clients for a grand total of 216 clients. we serve not only u.s. and hong kong listed companies, but we also help asia companies manage their employee options.
in the second quarter, we participated in 17 ipos and follow-on offerings in the u.s. market and also served as an underwriter for 14, including boss, aihuishou international, and dingdong, among others. in light of the recent concerns over adr ipos, i would like to highlight for our investors and stakeholders, that we possess extensive capability to act as an underwriter in hong kong. in the past year, we participated in many popular listings in hong kong, such as those of netease, xpeng, bilibili, harbour biomed and antengene among others.
finally, i would like to run an update on our self-clearing capability. in july of 2019, we acquired tradeup securities, inc., formerly marsco, a broker-dealer with over 30 years experience in self-clearing and its own self-clearing license, because we wanted to establish the technical, operational and compliance capability to manage our own proprietary brokerage system. i am pleased to report that as of the second-quarter 2021, more than 50% of our clients were having their u.s. cash equities self-cleared by tradeup.
we project that by the end of this year, we will be self-clearing over 70% of our clients.
john zeng -- chief financial officer
hello. thanks, tianhua and clark. let me walk through our first quarter financial performance. all numbers are in usd.
total revenue was $60.2 million this quarter, up 99% year over year. commission were $31 million, up 64% year over year, but down 41% from the first quarter of this year. the drop in commission was due to weaker market sentiment in the second quarter, as total trading volume dropped 18% quarter over quarter, plus the proportion of higher unit economic products, for example, cash equity dropped from 50% of the trading volume in the first quarter to 40% of trading volume in the second quarter. the decrease in commission also resulted in a lower blended take rate of three bps in the second quarter versus 4.3 bps in the first quarter of this year.
but in reality, the fee rate remains the same for both quarters. interest-related income, which combines financing service fee and interest income was $19 million, an increase of 115% year over year and 7% quarter over quarter. the increase was due to higher marketing and securities lending balance and a gradual ramp-up in self-clearing. other revenue was $10.2 million, up 300% year over year, primarily due to more equity underwriting ir/pr services and currency exchange services.
now switching to cost. interest expense increased 154% year over year to $4.8 million this quarter, in line with our user growth as increase in margin activities. execution and clearing expense were $6.6 million this quarter, increased 131% year over year, as we have more funded our current customers and higher trading volume. employee compensation increased 82% year over year to $20.6 million, as we keep adding headcounts in r&d, self-clearing, to support our global growth.
along with head count increase, this quarter occupancy expense increased 32% year over year to $1.5 million. sg&a increased 84% year over year to $5.1 million. marketing expense had the most uptake with the opex, increased more than 700% year over year to $24 million. we are fully committed to internationalization.
and in the second quarter, we increased marketing offshore mostly in singapore through both online and offline channel to drive brand awareness and the user acquisition. we firmly believe grabbing more market share right now will help develop -- deliver better financial performance down the road. as a result of rapid user growth, communication and the data usage also increased 143% year over year to $5 million this quarter. with the increased spending to drive growth and our fair value change of $13.7 million on the convertible bonds we issued earlier this year, our net loss for second quarter was $21.5 million.
taking all the fair value change and other non-gaap items, our non-gaap loss for this quarter was $4.4 million. now we have concluded our presentation. operator, please open the line for q&a. thanks.
",":
operator
certainly. [operator instructions] we have the first question, this is coming from the line of han pu from cicc. please go ahead. 
han pu -- cicc -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks for taking my question. this is han from cicc. i have two questions. the first one is about the guidance of the q3.
we see the strong growth of users in q2. could you give us more color on the number of clients and also current assets, and the cost of clearing it in the coming quarters. the second question is about the clearing fee rate. we are wondering why the execution and the clearing fee rate to our commission wasn't moving up in q2, while we see the continuous increase in the self-clearing.
thanks. 
john zeng -- chief financial officer
so i will answer your two questions. first is on the guidance for the second -- for the third quarter. so looking at all this data, we see higher like ue products like cash equity option, volume went up versus the second quarter. so we feel if market stays like this and we expect commission to have a moderate increase in the third quarter.
but adr underwriting is on hold due to the current policy from china and the u.s. regulators. so short term, this could have a lingering impact on our revenue. but the impact should be manageable as adr underwriting only accounted for less than 10% of our revenue.
so we think the adr equity offering will resume once regulators gives more clarity. and in the meantime, as tianhua mentioned earlier, we are already active in hong kong ipos as an international underwriter. and we already underwrote bilibili, xpeng, those popular ipos. so this could offset some short-term impact from the holding in u.s.
equity underwriting. in terms of customer acquisition. so the big is opex, is sales and marketing. we expect the third quarter market to -- our marketing expense to be nice or less than second quarter, as we don't offer any offline events in singapore.
but we will be very opportunistic to acquire users when we see -- when we see fit. in terms of aum per users. so in july and august, we still see very healthy net inflows for both months. but due to market sentiments, average aum is down around 10% to 15% by end of august versus may -- end of june.
and your first -- second question regarding the clearing, the clearing expense went up. so the main reason of the increase in clearing expense is we have a lot more singapore clients and we offer singapore stock trading. based on local regulation, if the client is trading singapore stock, the client's asset needs to be hold at sgx clearing member. our singapore subsidiary is not a sgx member yet, so we paid third-party custodian fee for each clients open account with us.
given we have over 200,000 sg -- singapore clients already, we paid close to $2 million custodian fee the second quarter which counted as our clearing expense. as you might know, our singapore subsidiaries already received [ aic ] from sgx to become a clearing member. so once we officially become the sgx clearing member, we can greatly reduce the custodian fee. i believe we can see some reduction in custody fee starting in the first quarter.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we have the next question, which is coming from the line of judy zhang from citi. please go ahead. 
judy zhang -- citi -- analyst
[foreign language]
tianhua wu -- chairman and chief executive officer
so the funding of clients profile, so we used -- users were acquired last year say second quarter of 2020 as a cohort sample. initial deposit among that group is around $6,000 to $7,000. one year later, by end of second quarter this year, average client assets is around $30,000. since second quarter of last year, each quarter this cohort group has net asset inflow, which means they are keeping deposit money into their account and aum growth is now only due to equity value appreciation.
if you look at new customer we acquired this quarter, second quarter of 2021, their average initial deposit is around $5000, slightly below the initial deposit of the second quarter of 2020 clients. we don't think this is due to a deterioration of client quality. we feel it's more like -- i mean it's more due to the less attractive market backdrops. we feel similar to the clients that we acquired last year after several quarters, they will keep depositing money to trade on tiger platform.
so on customer acquisition costs and payback, we still use the second quarter of 2020 as a cohort sample. back then, customer acquisition costs was about $130. and back, the market was more active. so if we only count that commission, excluding interest, the payback was around two quarter for that cohort group.
looking at nearly acquired user in the second quarter of this year, due to more competition the customer acquisition cost went up to around $160 per person. and their commission also dropped due to a weaker market drop. still we feel it's still going to be attractive for us to acquire those users, even though the payback increased to four to six quarter, because our users are relatively young. as long as we can get them payback in a relatively short period, there is still more -- a lot of upside for us to monetize.
thank you, judy. 
operator
thank you. we have the next question. this is coming from the line of eric lu from china renaissance. please go ahead. 
eric lu -- china renaissance -- analyst
[foreign language] hello. so my first question is, you saw the trading volume decreased quarter over quarter in second quarter, but the net interest income and margin financing dollars both increased, especially the margin financing dollar. so can i ask the rationale behind it? so for the second question, we noted, our number of new paying clients acquired from mainland china was more than our competitor. so can i ask what's the current -- what's our current customer acquisition strategy in mainland china and the cost of it?
john zeng -- chief financial officer
sure. eric, so i will answer your two questions. so the first one was on the net interest income. so the main reason of the net interest income increased while the trading volume came down is, we're starting to prep our self-clearing capability.
so once we started, given we have more and more trading volume and asset hold in our own clearing firm, we are starting to use some of clients idle cash, which gives us cheaper funding and also gives us more flexibility in terms of the cap we can then to each customers. and also becoming a self-clearing firm enables us to become a direct counterparty for securities lending business, which is pretty lucrative on the street. so we can generate more interest, we start sharing with other intermediaries. so that's the main reason, our interest -- net interest income increased in the second quarter, while the trading volume came down.
and of course, you know the margin balance, if you look at our balance sheet, also increased versus the first quarter, but the $1 billion margin balance on our balance sheet includes hong kong ipo. so take out ipo, which is not that profitable for us -- for the hong kong ipo margin basis. taking out that part, our margin loan balance is about $450 million, while in the first quarter was about $400 million. so those two are the main reasons why net interest income went up in the second quarter.
and in terms of the customer acquisition for onshore customers. so in the second quarter, we have been actually working with more channels or intermediaries to target chinese investors who already have assets offshore. so this is showing -- so far showing good results. and of course, our esop is also a pretty good user acquisition too for us to tap into those chinese users.
in terms of customer acquisition cost, it's pretty much in line with our previous customer acquisition cost for chinese users. the major increase of our customer acquisition cost actually came from singapore, as we mentioned earlier.
operator
we have the next question. this is coming from the line of yan zeng from th capital.
unknown speaker
this is zella from th capital. i have one question. i was hoping management could shed some light on the trading asset distribution. given the previous experience and regulations on chinese adr in terms of your customer transaction behavior, do you see any shift to hong kong securities? and can i think this intensive competition was partly due to some kind of transaction has been achieved? that's my question.
john zeng -- chief financial officer
sure. i -- you were a little bit breaking up. so you mean the trading volume shifting to hong kong and do we see more strong competition from the existing players?
unknown speaker
yes. exactly.
john zeng -- chief financial officer
ok. so in terms of -- so the thing is, right now, if you look at all the chinese adrs coming back to hong kong, we think this will likely be a trend. as we mentioned earlier, we have been very active in hong kong as a international underwriter for chinese adr secondary listing in hong kong. so i think that part, we feel pretty confident we can keep getting more corporate clients and also use these opportunities to acquire more retail clients.
and then in terms of trading capabilities, traditionally, our strength was under -- in the u.s. market. but recently, we have developed a lot more resource to develop our hong kong trading capabilities. for example, you know, the hong kong level 2 data, i think we are one of the few firms to offer it for free.
and you know the hong kong options, we are one of the first firm to offer to investors. so we think the trading, no matter it's from the primary market or the secondary market, we are much more capable versus where we were one or two years ago. so i think the trend, we will still benefit, once we develop more resources into the hong kong trading capability and r&d. 
unknown speaker
very clear. thank you.

hello, everyone and welcome to the tiger brokers' third quarter 2021 earnings conference call.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director

clark s. soucy -- vice president, strategy and investor relations
our global expansion is progressing well. we added 82,900 new accounts in the third quarter, of which over 80% came from outside mainland china. total new funded accounts for the first three quarters of this year numbered 353,300, already surpassing our 350,000 annual guidance. total customer accounts at the end of the third quarter increased by 118,000 and totaled 1.77 million, almost double year over year.
total funded accounts stood at 612,000, triple that of the same period of last year.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
clark s. soucy -- vice president, strategy and investor relations
total revenue for the third quarter was $60.8 million, an increase of 60% year over year. non-gaap net income was $5.3 million, an improvement from the loss in the second quarter. total client assets were $20.6 billion, up 88% year over year, but a drop of 14% from the second quarter of this year. the quarter-over-quarter decline in total client assets is primarily due to the drop in client position values caused by subdued market conditions.
the firm continued to see healthy net asset inflows from both new and existing clients.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director

clark s. soucy -- vice president, strategy and investor relations
an important milestone for tiger brokers is that we've obtained a hong kong broker-dealer license last month. this license will have a big impact on tiger's business going forward. for example, we may start acquiring users in hong kong. hong kong is a true global financial center with a substantial number of high-quality investors, both retail and institutional.
with the hk license, we will be able to generate more income from margin loans, hong kong ipos and commissions, among others, to improve revenue per user. we may also further improve the user trading experience for hong kong securities, as trade execution and clearing will be integrated into tiger's system.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
clark s. soucy -- vice president, strategy and investor relations
in addition to hong kong, the company was admitted to the securities association of singapore. we also reached a notable landmark in singapore. tiger brokers singapore became the first online broker to be admitted as a trading member of singapore exchange securities trading, singapore exchange derivatives trading limited and a clearing member of the central depository. in total, tiger brokers has obtained 46 licenses and qualifications in 36 categories in hong kong, singapore, new zealand, the united states and australia.
we also decided to set up a global dual headquarters in singapore to expedite our international expansion.

i would now like to take this opportunity to give updates on four other key business initiatives.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
clark s. soucy -- vice president, strategy and investor relations
tiger brokers presently has offices and holds licenses pertaining to brokerage, investment banking and asset management in the united states, australia, singapore, new zealand and hong kong. as previously stated, our firm is rapidly internationalizing. and in the third quarter, 80% of our accounts came from outside mainland china. tiger brokers has only been executing on our internationalization strategy for a little over a year.
being able to acquire so many international users in such a short period of time validates our capability to compete in global markets. we remain confident in our internationalization strategy. we already exceeded our 350,000 annual guidance for new funded accounts in 2021. and we expect that next year, we will exceed the 1 million mark for total funded accounts.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
clark s. soucy -- vice president, strategy and investor relations
with regards to corporate and institutional services, we continue to invest in scaling our investment banking and esop business, which augments our brokerage business.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
clark s. soucy -- vice president, strategy and investor relations
esop remains in a rapid state of expansion. in the third quarter, we added 46 new clients, of which five were a-share companies and 41 were hong kong and us listed companies as well as unlisted companies. the scale of our esop business has more than doubled in the last year and the cumulative number of corporate clients added in the first three quarters of this year was 266.7% higher than the same period last year. our enterprise account service in the tiger community, which corporates use to directly connect with investors and build their brands, also added 53 new accounts in the third quarter.
on the investment banking side, we participated in four us ipos, three of which were spacs and one of which was a local american company. we were also grateful to serve xpeng as an underwriter for its dual primary listing in hong kong.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director

clark s. soucy -- vice president, strategy and investor relations
all new clients are having their us cash equity trades cleared by tradeup, formerly known as marsco, a self-clearing broker we acquired in 2019. as of the end of the third quarter, 70% of our clients were using tradeup to self-clear us cash equities.

as previously communicated, we are applying for cryptocurrency trading licenses in the us and singapore, so we may provide local residents with crypto access. i am pleased to announce us tiger securities just received approval as a money transmitter from the state of new jersey, which enables us to provide crypto trading from new jersey residents. we look forward to obtaining more crypto licenses in the future. i would now like to invite our cfo, john, to go over our financials.
john zeng -- chief financial officer
hello, everyone. thanks, tianhua and clark. so let me walk you through tiger's financial performance for the third quarter. all numbers are in us dollar.
commission for the third quarter was $33.5 million, increased 72% year over year, in line with the year-over-year increase in trading volume. we saw slightly lower trading volume in the third quarter versus the second quarter, but we still managed to grow commission by 8% quarter over quarter with more derivatives trading such as us options and more volume from hong kong. take rate also increased from 3 bps in the second quarter to 3.6 bps in the third quarter. interest-related income, which combines financing service fee and interest income, was $20.1 million, an increase of 105% year over year and 5% quarter over quarter.
the year-over-year increase was in line with higher margin and security lending balance. the quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily due to a more efficient self-clearing margin operation given lower margin balance in the third quarter versus the second quarter. other revenue, mostly our underwriting revenue, was $7.2 million, down 19% year over year and 30% quarter over quarter due to a weaker ipo market, especially in the chinese adr listing in the third quarter. the drop in underwriting revenue partially offset the growth in commission and interest-related income.
as a result, total revenue was $60.8 million in the third quarter, increased 60% year over year and flat quarter over quarter. now, on the cost. so interest expense increased 44% year over year to $4.2 million, in line with user growth and increase in margin balance. execution and clearing expense were $9.5 million this quarter, increased 145% year over year and 45% quarter over quarter.
the increase is primarily due to more custodian fees in singapore. before tiger became a sgx trading and clearing member in october, we used an external custodian to custody client assets and the custodian expense grows in line with user growth. we expect such custodian expense to gradually go down as we will self-custody more assets in singapore. employee compensation increased 71% year over year to $21.8 million, as we keep adding headcount in r&d self-clearing to support our global expansion.
along with headcount increase, this quarter, occupancy expense increased 39% year over year to $1.66 million. sg&a increased 30% year over year to $5 million. communication and data usage also increased 116% year over year to $5.3 million this quarter as a result of rapid user growth. marketing expense was $11.2 million in the third quarter, up 200% year over year, but down 53% quarter over quarter.
given the choppy market backdrop in the third quarter, we scaled back our marketing to be prudent with customer acquisition costs. that being said, we will increase marketing spending when we see the right window. so net income for third quarter was $20.5 million. and adjusted for fair market value change on private cb and other non-gaap items, our non-gaap income for this quarter was $5.3 million.
now, i have concluded our presentation. operator, please open the line for q&a.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of han pu from cicc. please ask your question.
han pu -- cicc -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks for taking our question. this is han pu of cicc and i have two questions. firstly, could management give us more color on the current regulatory environment and the potential impact to our business? secondly, could you give us some update on the operation of q4? have we already seen some impact on the user acquisition during previous regulation-related use? thanks.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
john zeng -- chief financial officer
ok. so let me just quickly translate what tianhua just mentioned regarding the latest regulatory deals and those news in the media. so basically, our business model is no different than overseas broker servicing domestic investors. we follow the same kyc, aml procedures and regulated by relevant security regulators in different regions.
so our innovation is not on business model but more on r&d, which brings some parallel user experience so we can bring more customers. we have always attached great importance to business compliance since our first inception and we have conducted several rounds of self-examination of our business units and business lines with the support from external experts to ensure we are in compliance. if there will be policy coming out from the regulators, tiger, as one of the leading players in the industry, definitely we will develop the resource to make sure we are in compliance. and we definitely will keep monitoring the situation and make sure we can -- we will be in compliance when such policies put into effect.
and regarding the personal information protection law, so the law went into effect on november 1. and actually before the law, we, as an international brokerage, we already formulated and implemented serious policies and procedures on personal information protection and data security with high standards in accordance with applicable laws and industry requirements. and besides, we did a lot of preparation in advance before this new law. we hired top industry experts and lawyers to self-exam all the operations involving personal information and have reflected the rules under this new law into our current process, policies and user agreement to ensure users' benefits are maximized.
and of course, going forward, we will pay close attention to the development of this new law and making sure we can properly adjust when there is new guidance from the regulator. [foreign language] so we saw some net outflow following the news, very small scale and now it's already back to normal. for non-chinese users, we keep seeing that asset inflow. and actually, since october, the average first-timer deposits from our singapore users actually, around $5,000 or above.
it's actually even more than an average initial deposit of $4,000 we saw for new users acquired in the second and third quarter, which shows our brand service is still attracting high-quality international users. thank you.
han pu -- cicc -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks.
operator
the next question comes from alan kwong from citi. please ask your question.
unknown speaker
[foreign language] hi, management. this is julia from citi research. thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise the questions. i have two questions here.
first, it's encouraging to see that the new funded customer number in the first nine months has already surpassed the full year guidance of 350,000. could you also share guidance about the key regions of focus in terms of customer acquisition and the mutual growth target? also, could you give us more color in terms of the fourth quarter operational plan, including the customer assets and trading volume? thank you.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
john zeng -- chief financial officer
ok. so in the third quarter, we added 82,900 funded accounts, of which over 80% came from outside of china, which shows our international strategy is progressing really well. going forward, our focus right now, of course, will be in singapore and hong kong. so in singapore, we just obtained a self-clearing depository license from sgx.
these qualifications will help us better service singapore local clients. we just got a license in hong kong. so hong kong is definitely another key area we will focus. now we are developing -- devoting more resource to ramp up our trading infrastructure in hong kong.
in the us, we haven't really launched a big marketing yet. focus now is still on the infrastructure self-clearing. we believe this will give us some more competitive advantage over our peers in the us market. and of course, as tianhua mentioned earlier, we just got the crypto trading -- the money transmitter license in new jersey.
we feel this could be another tool for us to tap into the us market when we officially launch our marketing in the states. and of course, outside of those areas, we are also evaluating other markets. we will do a comprehensive analysis before entering new market. we will review its tam, competitive landscape, what value we can bring and what kind of ue we can generate.
based on our experience in singapore, we are confident our user experience r&d capability will give us an edge when entering new markets and we are optimistic of our internationalization growth outlook. [foreign language] so regarding fourth quarter outlook, so right now we still monitor the market condition to decide how much marketing, we will spend on user acquisition. when we evaluate our user acquisition strategy, we will of course monitor the cse, monitor the payback. so as of right now, given the market backdrop, we are still relatively scaled back and waiting for a right opportunity to ramp up our marketing.
and trading volumes, so far, is similar to third quarter. total volume might be smaller than q3 given more holidays in the fourth quarter, but higher ue product cash equity options, we see similar volume versus q3. and for q4, our focus is on r&d. so we will spend more resources in r&d to beef up our infrastructure in hong kong and singapore to make sure we can provide better trading experience for our users.
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of hanyang wang from 86research. please ask your question.
hanyang wang -- 86research -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks, management for taking my questions. so i have two questions. the first one is regarding on the business expansion in hong kong. the company obtained the hong kong broker license to acquiring ocean joy securities this quarter.
so we know the competition is quite intense in hong kong. so what will be the strategy for your user acquisition in hong kong? and how shall we expect the incremental new users come from hong kong going forward? second question is about the ipo-related business. so we observed that the tech ipo started to resume in hong kong this quarter, so while the listing of the chinese adr still faced uncertainties. so what's your view on the development of the underwriting business? thank you.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
john zeng -- chief financial officer
yeah, let me translate first. ok, so first of all, as everybody know, hong kong license is very important to us. so with the hong kong license on the one side, we have -- we can tap into the hong kong local residents, which we're missing out from the tiger's user base before. and on the other hand, we will be able to increase arpu from our user base.
so our plan for hong kong basically will be three steps. first of all, on the institutional business, no matter it's for serving the institutional investors or esop or hong kong ipo underwriting. so with the hong kong license, we'll definitely be more aggressive and more active in the institutional space. the second step will be gradually to move from ib clearing for hong kong securities to our own self-clearing hong kong.
as a lot of you know, traditionally, we use ib to clear hong kong trades and the clearing expense is very expensive. so our ue for hong kong product was really low before. but this will be gradually changed once we switching from ib clearing in hong kong to our own clearing in hong kong. the third step will be launching our retail marketing in hong kong.
we know we have a lot of peers in hong kong and we give them a lot of credit for what they have done, very good companies and apps. but we feel tiger has our own competitive advantage. and especially, a lot of hong kong product, for example, like hong kong ipo subscription, naturally, will give us a chance to tap into more users. so we feel pretty confident we can grab good market share in hong kong.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
john zeng -- chief financial officer
ok, so let me quickly translate. so from a financial perspective, yes, given the recent sino-u.s. relationship, we do see a drop in underwriting revenue for third quarter. we don't know when the chinese adr ipo will resume, but we do believe both sides could reach an agreement.
and hopefully, by sometime next year, we will see more chinese adr back to the market. but in the meantime, given now we have hong kong license, we can be more active in hong kong ipo underwriting to drive underwriting revenue to compensate the potential loss from the us underwriting market. i just want to reiterate how we see the tiger investment banking business. so our underwriting business is different from traditional investment bank.
underwriting fee, of course, is important. but more important to us is the synergy generated by underwriting business with esop and brokerage business, so we can provide more value-added service to our corporate and retail clients and the increased user stickiness and arpu. so in short, we understand, in the short term, there may be some headwind for our underwriting business, but we are committed to putting into resource into tiger underwriting business to make sure we can employ more synergy to our other business units and provide more values to our corporate and retail users. thank you.
hanyang wang -- 86research -- analyst
[foreign language] thank you. very helpful.

wu tianhua
hello everyone, and thank you for joining the tiger brokers fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. despite the difficult macroeconomic and market backdrop during the two previous two quarters, by focusing on executing on our international expansion, tiger brokers was able to achieve notable progress during the fourth quarter. in the fourth quarter, total revenue was $62.2 million, an increase of 31.7% over the same period last year. the company is committed to further leveraging internationalization to drive growth.
and in the fourth quarter, the company added 61,400 accounts, of which more than 90% from overseas markets. total customer assets were $17.1 billion in the fourth quarter. net customer asset inflows remained healthy and exceeded $2 billion in the quarter. however, since some of our institutional clients experienced losses on their holdings of hong kong listed equities and chinese adr during the fourth quarter, total client assets declined sequentially from the third quarter.
in 2021, tiger brokers in total added 415,000 funded accounts exceeding our 350,000 account annual guidance. the total number of funded accounts reached 673,000. half are from singapore or other overseas markets. demonstrating the firm's internationalization strategy is yielding solid results for the full year 2021.
total revenues were 26.264.5 million usd, an increase of 91% on the previous year. non-gaap net profit attributable to us fintech holding ltd was $24.5 million for the year. in october 2021, we acquired a hong kong broker dealer license. setting the stage for our firm to not only increase the future profitability of our hong kong securities business, but also to eventually onboard hong kong local residents.
including hong kong, our firm now holds 50 licenses and qualifications that span the united states, australia, singapore, new zealand and other jurisdictions. holding such a rich range of licenses and qualifications sets the stage for the firm's long term international growth. i would now like to provide investors updates on two key business initiatives that our company internationalization is progressing well. as stated in the fourth quarter, over 90% of our accounts were derived from overseas markets, demonstrating the appeal of our next generation fintech platform and its value proposition in competitive international markets.
in the past year, singapore, by both, the total number of new accounts and the total number of accounts became our company's largest market. in 2022, we are confident that we can achieve similar success in other global markets, as we did in singapore. in the first quarter of this year, we officially entered the australian market. with the australia, as having certain similar competitive dynamics in singapore, namely that high commission traditional brokers have a substantial market share.
even though we face competition from many respectable online brokers in australia. we are confident that the distinctive features of our app, such as our interactive social media community, comprehensive financial and market data, as well as our rich range of securities trading features will distinguish us from the pack. corporate and institutional services continue, perform well and attract new clients. esup continues to expand at a fast rate, and in the fourth quarter we added 51 new companies for a grand total of 313.
investment banking also performed well, and we participated in 22 ipos in hong kong and the us, of which we underwrote 18. it's important to note that our firm possesses extensive capabilities to serve both new issuers, as well as listed companies across multiple markets, following the acquisition of our hong kong broker dealer license. in the fourth quarter we underwrote the listings of a series of famous companies including netease cloud music, sensetime and beijing airdoc. we do appreciate the trust of these issuers in our firm.

in the fourth quarter, commission were $29.9 million increase 18% year over year, but down 11% from the third quarter. the quarter over quarter drop in commission was primarily due to lower trading volume where is less trading days in the first quarter and a weaker adr in hong kong market. also, our margin and securities lending balance was lower than the third quarter due to the weaker market backdrop. we were able to generate more interest income through our self clearing capabilities.
interest related income which combines financing service fee and the interest income was $22.5 million in the first quarter, increased 70% year over year and a 12% quarter over quarter. factoring interest expense, net interest income increased 110% year over year and 18% quarter over quarter. other revenue increased 12% from the same period last year to $9.8 million. now on to the cost, execution and clearing expense were $6.9 million increased 65% year over year due to rapid user growth in 2021, but a down 28% quarter over quarter as more trades were created through self clearing.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from han pu with cicc. your line is open. 
han pu -- cicc -- analyst
i want to thank the management for taking my question. this is the icc and the congress on strong performance during such a volatile market? i have two questions. firstly, how to receive influence of the policy signals for a lot. there was this up fintech conference, so i would be and then you will see the talk include the last quarter over quarter, what is intended and behind that and how about the zero quantity in fourth quarter? and how do we see the chained up with their cost income concern? thanks.
wu tianhua
so let me quickly discuss the first question. so first of all, the timing of the financial stability and development committee meeting is very crucial at the comments made by was premier, video shows senior policymakers aware of the risks on having capital markets and as they are ready to take action to reinstall market confidence. this is an encouraging first step. hopefully there will be more favorable concrete policy now in the near future to stabilize the market and to stimulate growth.
at the meeting mentioned there was good progress on pclb issue. government will support qualified chinese company to use offshore, so both will benefit tiger's esup and investment banking business and the to future user and eum course our focus at this stage is still internationalization. we already do headquartered in singapore simba singapore clients already account for more than 50% of our user base. we look forward to expand to other region to replicate our success in singapore.
i will go for a second, go and feel the social and how are you able to do it in the um we're always here infringing safety something defensively also action on juju and shop or someone who is on parole wanting to find you location. so, market sentiment was still relatively weak in the first quarter, which makes it harder to acquire users, we think uptick in csc where you long wondered just kind of market sentiments. that being said, we have been very cautious with marketing spending since the third quarter of last year. we pay close attention to key metrics such as payback, build customer quality retention to make sure our marketing spending is efficient and cost effective.
so even since we had a soft decline in the fourth quarter, the quality of funded accounts actual was pretty good fortune, the whole retail kind of quality in the fourth quarter. the average initial deposit is close to 7,000 usd higher than the average initial deposit in the third quarter. for each cohort of singapore clients acquired during a particular quarter. we see letter asking inflow every quarter since their acquisition.
sure clients are wanting to allocate more assets to pay go careful with high user stickiness.
han pu -- cicc -- analyst
thanks. that's very helpful.
wu tianhua
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from cristina chang with citigroup global markets. your line is open. 
cristina chang -- citigroup global markets -- analyst
so first of all, thank you management for giving me this opportunity to ask question. just two questions for me. first, we noticed that the client asked the good client, if you want to come out and give us some guidance in terms of the first quarter, quarter to date operational data, in terms of the client asset trading volume velocity as well as customer growth. and the second question is that we noticed parker had just entered the australian market.
just wondering if management can share your thoughts on the room for growth and competitive landscape in australia and what type of key work strategy there? thank you.
wu tianhua
as we mentioned earlier, in the first quarter we had inflow over 2 billion usd. the quarter over quarter drop in total sg&a is primarily due to mark to market loss of some of our institutional users, the mark to market loss also these to a quarter over quarter drop in margin balance as some clients neutral paid off work. so as we talk year to date, we saw small in trading volume and the total eum is border index. we have been prudently marketing spending.
we likely will see smaller number of funded account in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. but the average initial deposit, that asset inflow will be similar to fourth quarter. so we entered australian market not sparse, although there are already several on my property in australia. we feel tiger's comprehensive offering will set us apart from competition.
based on the latest data, only one week after we launched in australia, our ranking in terms of google play download has jumped to a nice place from below 100. we look forward to more australian clients and the more open with unparalleled trading experience. we feel very confident we can replicate our success in singapore to other regions like australia. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question, a follow up from han pu with cicc. your line is open. 
han pu -- cicc -- analyst
i have a follow up question on our self-care and progress in the us market. thanks.
wu tianhua
thanks for question, han. so in terms of self care in over 80% of of us cash equity ourself to repay first quarter up in the first quarter. so south korean also improve our capital utilization as we were able to generate more interest income quarter over quarter, we saw margin balance. so this year, we will still use ip to clear a small portion of trades as our customer has positions like our call, which requires both auction of cash equity very tighter.
we already has option clearing basis in the us and started to self clear options. so during the transition period we will use both tiger and ip for of different options strategies.
han pu -- cicc -- analyst
can the new paying clients guidance intended to need to?
wu tianhua
right now, the market has been very volatile. so it's moving higher plus to give accurate estimates, given the market backdrop is now stabilized. and in addition, we just enter a new market. so we want to, you know, let it run for a couple of months.
so we get a feel and i hope we can give a better guidance to the investors next.
han pu -- cicc -- analyst
fantastic. thanks. 
operator
our next question comes from xinwei wang with china renaissance. your line is open. 
xinwei wang -- china renaissance -- analyst
i was in a financial trouble once. so i think you have already obtained a broker dealer license in hong kong in october last year. what is the current process and the strategy you are going to adopt that we see in hong kong? thank you.
wu tianhua
so as i mentioned in hong kong has been really important for us traditionally. and if you have a hong kong license. so our unit per user was some lack behind our competitors in local hong kong so in our nations without a license back in october last year, there are three steps we plan to enter hong kong. first of all, is to be more active in hong kong ipo.
as we mentioned earlier, we have been very active in hong kong ipo in the first quarter for lots of chinese adr, secondary listing at hong kong local listings. for second and third step, which is to replace ip to clear hong kong streets and also to go all hong kong retail in our customer acquisition. so we have building in the infrastructure and system, but we unfortunately, due to the covid situation in hong kong, are hiring system development and testing all have been somewhat delayed. so we hope the covid situation will get better soon so we can work on the system integration for our plan 2 and plan 3 which is clearing, self care hong kong equity trading channels of all our hong kong marketing.

macro environment was more difficult in the first quarter versus a year ago, which leads to a slowdown in trading commission and underwriting revenue. total revenue in the first quarter was $52.6 million, decreased 35.2% year over year. but interest income stayed flat thanks to the gradual buildup of self-clearing for u.s. securities.
on a quarter-over-quarter basis, total trading volume increased 6% from fourth quarter last year with moderate increase in trading commissions.

wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
now i would like to invite our cfo, john, to go over our financials.
john zeng -- chief financial officer
thanks, tianhua and [inaudible]. let me go through our financial performance for the first quarter. all numbers are in u.s. dollars.
total revenue were $52.6 million, down 35% year over year as weaker market backdrop in the first quarter slowed down commission and underwriting revenue. in [inaudible] market sentiment, margin and securities lending balance also decreased but we managed to increase net interest-related income by 80% year over year by lowering interest expense and generate more security spending revenue through self-clearing. as we mentioned in the earnings release, starting from this quarter, we will report our derivatives trading, mostly u.s. option and u.s.
futures using a number of contracts. cash equities will be reported on a stand-alone basis using trading volume. this change will allow effect previously disclosed operating data. the goal is to help investors better understand our operation.
so for this quarter, commission from cash equities were $22 million, account for 72% of total commission. the other 28% are mostly commissions from derivatives trading. based on 34.7 billion equity trading volume this quarter, take rate is 6.3 bps for cash equities. in the first quarter of last year, cash equity accounted for 76% of total commission and the derivatives accounted for 24%.
cash equity take rate was 6.6 bps in this first quarter last year. now on the cost. execution and carrying expense were $4.5 million, decreased 45% year over year and 34% quarter over quarter primarily due to more self-clearing of u.s. equities.
employee compensation increased 67% year over year to $27.5 million. as last year, we kept adding headcounts across region to support our global expansion. in line with the headcount increase, occupancy expense increased 69% to $2 million. sg&a increased 12% to $4.5 million year over year.
marketing expense for $10 million in the first quarter decreased 22% year over year. we are very prudent with our marketing spending because we feel now is not the best market window to attract high-quality users. we will keep a close eye on cac and payback to adjust our marketing strategy. communication and market data expense were $6.4 million, an increase of 61% from a year ago due to rapid user growth.
total operating costs were $55 million, increased 17.6% from the same quarter last year. non-gaap net loss, which excludes share-based compensation and impairment loss from the long-term investment was $1.9 million this quarter. now i have concluded my remarks. operator, please open the line for q&a.
thanks.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of han pu from cicc. please ask your question.
han pu -- cicc -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks for taking my questions. this is han from cicc. i have two questions. first of all, could you please help break down the new repaying clients in region for the first quarter? and how about the mix of our full year guidance? secondly, we see the operation cost per paying client went up a lot in the first quarter.
what would be the reason? and how do we see the trend in the coming quarters. thanks.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
john zeng -- chief financial officer
let me translate. ok. so pu han, so to your first question, ok. so in the first quarter, about 15% of the funded accounts came from mainland china, including esop clients.
80% came from singapore and the rest 5% from australia and new zealand and the u.s. in total, 85% of the funding account this quarter is from outside of china. so our target is to acquire at least 100,000 newly funded accounts this year, we expect the distribution will be around 15% from mainland china, 60% from singapore, and the rest 25% from countries regions like hong kong, australia, and the u.s.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
john zeng -- chief financial officer
ok. so in general, the market sentiment is weak, investors prefer to stay on the sideline. so customer account to funding account conversion rate will be lower, thus the cac tends to be higher versus when market is more active. in addition to the market effect, we launched our service in australia in the first quarter.
when we enter a new market, similar to what we have done in singapore, we will spend more on branding to promote our company. branding accounted for around 25% of our marketing expenses in the first quarter, and we expect branding remains a big portion of our marketing for the next few quarters. so branding expenses plus trying out various marketing strategies also leads to a higher cac when we just entered a new market. so in short, we are very prudent with the marketing spending.
so you can see our total marketing expense decreased year over year and quarter over quarter. we keep a very close eye on cac and pay back to make sure we can have a very healthy like unique [inaudible] model, and we will just be very dynamic to adjust our marketing strategy. thank you.
han pu -- cicc -- analyst
thanks. that's very helpful.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of julia cheung from citi. please ask your question.
julia cheung -- citi -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks for taking my question. this is julia cheung from citi research. i have two questions here. first, could you give more color on the [inaudible] progress for u.s., hong kong, and singapore as well as the target pace in the near to midterm and the expected earnings contribution? and second, could you share the update on hong kong business especially the time lines for acquiring retail customers and the sales and marketing budget like the land customer accident cost per head in hong kong versus other markets? thank you.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
john zeng -- chief financial officer
ok. so to answer your question regarding hong kong. so as communicated before, our hong kong strategy will be three stage. first stage is be more active in hong kong ipo.
right now is -- we are very active in hong kong ipo underwritings. in the first quarter, we worked on multiple deals. and today the mega genomics, which just notch book building today, tiger is also an underwriter. so we will keep expanding our hong kong underwriting business.
and the second step will be to use hong kong to clear our hong kong securities tradings. so this step was a little bit delayed due to covid earlier this year. now we have completed several rounds of testing with hong kong exchange and is upgrading the training system to handle more volume. with tiger use -- with tiger, we use tiger hong kong to execute on clear hong kong trading in the next couple of quarters.
the third stage, which is the retail marketing. so in addition to upgrading our trading infrastructures, we are also fine-tuning our product experience and formulary marketing strategies. our goal is to leverage our global operations experience to help us to expand in hong kong. our aim is to start retail marketing toward later this year.
in terms of customer acquisition costs in hong kong. so right now, given we haven't launched, we don't have a firm grasp, but we understand the acquisition cost in hong kong among our peers is pretty high. so what we're going to do is to leverage their experience and the low house and also the strategies in other regions to apply to hong kong. hopefully, by then, when we launch, we can find a sustainable in the cac and payback model.
regarding self-clearing, i will just answer that in english. so overall, our self-clearing progress is according to schedule. by end of first quarter, we self-clear over 90% of u.s. cash equities and over 70% of u.s.
options. the clearing expense for both products actually have decreased from close to 20% of commission from first quarter last year to single digits this quarter. so clearing expense varies based on trading volume and product mix. use this quarter's clearing expense as an example.
within the $4.5 million clearing expense, about $2.1 million are expense repaid to interactive broker primarily for hong kong securities and u.s. option clearing. about $1.5 million are singapore local clearing at a custodian expense. we expect the clearing expense to further go down as we started self-clearing singapore equities in april.
and we can -- we will clear more u.s. options through u.s. tiger and u.s. tiger broker hong kong for hong kong execution once we finish the system upgrades.
thank you.
julia cheung -- citi -- analyst
thank you, management.
operator
the next question comes from cindy wang from china renaissance. please go ahead.
cindy wang -- china renaissance securities -- analyst
[foreign language] ok. i will translate my question. so the first question is regarding to the singapore market. can management share some color on the customer acquisition and also the customer assets in singapore for the first quarter and also the second quarter as well as the competitive landscape in singapore? the second question is for the australian market.
since tiger brokers enter into australia market in march this year, can management share some of the customer acquisition costs as well as the new customers' numbers, etc., in the australia market? thank you.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
john zeng -- chief financial officer
ok. so first of all, australia, we launched our australian business after chinese new year. so far, our app ranks ahead of our competitors in local app store. last year at a very early stage, we are training our different marketing strategies.
for example, we sponsored a local rocket team to build our brand and want to be more localized. so far, cac looks very high, given branding expense and a small number of funded accounts. but i understand, as we already mentioned earlier, when we entered new market at very beginning, the cac is look relatively higher. so hopefully, in the next couple of quarters, we can improve unique economics with better understanding of the local markets.
singapore, so we have a leading position in singapore. so far, it's our biggest market and home base. over 80% of the newly funded account is from singapore this quarter. client asset quality remains very good.
even with weak market sentiment in the first quarter, we saw a very healthy debt asset inflow from singapore users. average deposit for new users in the first quarter is around $7,500 improved from average first deposit of $6,500 in the fourth quarter. users are also really sneaky. users we acquired in the first quarter last year as a cohort.
for the past five quarters, we saw that as inflow from this cohort every quarter. net asset inflow this quarter for the company's $3.5 billion, of which $2.6 billion came from singapore region.
cindy wang -- china renaissance securities -- analyst
[foreign language] sorry, i have one more question from singapore market. can i then talk about the cac in the singapore market as well as the competitive expense landscape? thank you.
wu tianhua -- chief executive officer and director
[foreign language]
john zeng -- chief financial officer
ok. so first of all, in singapore right now, based on a new survey, we accounted for the already registered in singapore account for 19% of the population above h'20. so we think, first of all, we are appeal to the younger generation. and also based on the percentage stage, we feel there is still a lot of room to grow.
so we still have a lot of market to tap into. compared with our peers, we feel we are still in a very leading market position this -- in singapore. as you can see this quarter, over 80% of the funding account came from singapore, which shows a -- which still have a very strong graph in the local market. in terms of cac, so the average cac for singapore, it did increase a little bit for the past couple of quarters due to the weaker market backdrop.
so the cac for singapore user is about a -- slightly above $250 -- sorry, $250 for the past quarter. so compared to the group's average, cac is actually lower, means our marketing strategy is more effective in singapore and our branding is stronger in singapore. thank you.
cindy wang -- china renaissance securities -- analyst
[foreign language] thank you.
