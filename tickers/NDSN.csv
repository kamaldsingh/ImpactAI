ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the nordson corporation third quarter fiscal year 2020 conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to ms. lara mahoney. please go ahead.
lara mahoney -- vice president, investor relations and corporate communications
thank you.
good morning. this is lara mahoney, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. i'm here with sundaram nagarajan, our president and ceo; and joseph kelly, executive vice president and cfo. we welcome you to our conference call today, thursday, august 20, 2020, to report nordson's fiscal year 2020 third quarter results. our conference call is being broadcast live on our audio webpage at nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. there will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until september 3, 2020.
during this conference call, references to non-gaap financial metrics will be made. a complete reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable gaap metric has been provided in the press release issued yesterday. additionally, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance. these statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission that could cause actual results to differ. after our remarks on the quarter, we will be happy to take your questions.
with that, i'll turn the call over to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining nordson's fiscal 2020 third quarter conference call.
with me today is joe kelly, the new chief financial officer of nordson. i'm pleased to welcome joe to the call this morning. joe joined nordson on july 6 and brings over 25 years of financial and operational expertise to nordson, most recently serving as chief financial officer of materion, a global advanced materials company. i'm very excited to have him on board. he is already bringing great energy and perspective to our leadership team.
first, i want to thank our nordson employees for their continued flexibility, resilience and commitment as we have navigated 2020. we remain focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and responding to the needs of our customers.
nordson products serve a very diverse set of end markets including medical, electronics, consumer non-durables and general industrial. this diversity has helped drive the relative stability of our results to this point in the year. by maintaining new safety measures, our team has risen to the challenge and continue to meet the needs of our customers who depend on us to help them drive efficiencies, enhance innovation and continuously supply aftermarket parts and consumables that keep their manufacturing lines running smoothly.
while we remain focused on managing this dynamic environment, the nordson leadership team and i are equally committed to making progress toward our strategic priorities of accelerating organic growth, diversifying through acquisitions, leveraging the nordson business system and building winning teams. on june 1, we announced the acquisition of fluortek, a precision plastic extrusion manufacturer for the medical device industry. fluortek brings highly differentiated ptfe medical tubing expertise which is complementary to our current value-added component offering for minimally invasive therapies such as heart valve replacement. growing our nordson medical business continues to be a priority of our capital deployment strategy. we're pleased to have the fluortek employees as part of the nordson team.
also during the quarter, we continued to develop the next generation of the nordson business system, which we're calling nbs next, nordson's growth framework. our new segment realignment, which unleashes an owner mindset at the division level, allows our teams to make decisions as close to the customer as possible. using critical insights created by segmentation tools and nbs next, our divisional leaders were empowered to prioritize investments and simplify non-value-added tasks to deliver best in class product quality and delivery.
staying invested in what makes nordson strong, our customer-centric business model and precision technologies will position us to accelerate profitable growth when the economy recovers. i'll speak more about the business in a few moments, but first, i'll turn the call over to joe to introduce himself and provide a more detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, naga, and good morning to everyone.
i am very pleased to join nordson which has a long established reputation as a high-quality company that consistently delivers top tier financial results. i look forward to partnering with naga and the leadership team to drive the next chapter of profitable growth for nordson. we have an extremely solid and rich foundation on which to build, and i am honored to be part of the team.
with that in mind, let's turn our attention to the fiscal third quarter financial results. third quarter 2020 sales decreased 4% compared to the prior year third quarter. the decrease was primarily related to organic volume as unfavorable currency effects were offset by the benefits from the fluortek acquisition. the company's diverse end market and geographic exposure as well as broad product applications contributed to the relatively strong commercial performance in these challenging times. our combined asia region led the way by delivering 3% growth in the quarter.
gross margins totaled $281 million or 52% of sales in the quarter compared to $303 million and 54% of sales in the prior year. the 200 basis point decrease in margins is attributable to $1.2 million of inventory step-up amortization related to the fluortek acquisition; unfavorable sales mix; and covid-19 manufacturing inefficiencies, as our factories addressed employees' safety needs in this challenging time with precautionary quarantining of employees, implementing social distancing, rotational staffing, etc. the combination of these three factors contributed to the lower gross margin percentage in the quarter. we anticipate the majority of these headwinds to be temporary in nature and forecast returning to our historical gross profit margin levels.
operating profit in the quarter was $112 million or 21% of sales. excluding non-recurring items in the quarter related to cost reduction actions and the acquired inventory step-up amortization, adjusted operating profit totaled $120 million, a 9% decrease from the prior year adjusted operating profit. ebitda for the third quarter was $148 million or 28% of sales, which is 7% below the prior year ebitda of $159 million.
looking at non-operating expense, net interest expense decreased $4 million or 37% from the prior year levels, associated primarily with the lower effective borrowing rate. other net expense increased $10 million associated with an unfavorable $5 million year-over-year swing in currency gains and losses and a $5 million increase in pension cost. $3 million of the pension increase was related to a non-cash pension settlement charge associated with the prior ceo. tax expense in the quarter totaled $9 million or an effective tax rate of 9% in the quarter. the rate was driven lower by a $12 million discrete tax benefit associated primarily with non-recurring levels of stock option exercises and deferred equity compensation. excluding these discrete items within the quarter, the effective rate would more closely reflect the company's long-term tax rate of 20% to 22%.
net income in the quarter totaled $87 million or $1.49 per share. excluding non-recurring adjustments to operating profit, the non-cash pension settlement charge and discrete tax benefits, adjusted earnings were $83 million or $1.42 per share. this represents a 12% decrease from the prior year adjusted earnings, reflective of the 4% decrease in sales volumes.
cost reduction actions taken in the quarter to structurally lower the ongoing cost profile of the company totaled $6 million and primarily related to severance payments. these actions are forecasted to deliver annualized savings of approximately $11 million to $12 million.
looking at the segment performance. industrial precision solutions sales decreased 6% compared to the prior year third quarter. stable demand from product lines serving consumers in non-durable end markets were offset by weakness in sales of product lines serving industrial markets. asian markets appear to be recovering from the lower covid-19 demand levels. operating profit for the quarter was $75 million or 26% of sales. excluding $3 million in structural cost reduction and simplification actions, ebitda was $86 million or 30% of sales, a decrease of 200 basis points compared to the prior year third quarter. lower sales volume, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing inefficiencies tied to the pandemic safety measures drove the lower profit levels.
advanced technology solutions' sales decreased approximately 2% compared to the prior year third quarter. this change included a decrease in organic sales volume of 3% and an increase of approximately 2% related to the fluortek acquisition. currency impact was minimal. sales volumes' increases in test and inspection product lines, serving electronics end markets, and stable demand in medical product lines were offset by weakness in fluid dispense product lines serving industrial end markets. the stable demand in medical is reflective of strength in some product lines, offset by meaningful softness in other product lines more closely tied to elective surgery. it's important to note that the definition of elective surgery has been broadened during the early months of this pandemic, particularly in the us. however, we are starting to see market signs that elective medical procedures are beginning to ramp back up.
within the advanced technology solutions segment, reported operating profit was $50 million or 20% of sales in the quarter. excluding one-time charges associated with the cost reduction actions and inventory step-up amortization, ebitda was $71 million or 29% of sales, in line with prior year profits despite the 2% decrease in sales.
finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and plenty of available borrowing capacity. cash totaled $222 million, and net debt was $1 billion, ending the quarter with a 1.8 times leverage ratio based on the trailing 12 months' ebitda. free cash flow in the quarter was $82 million, which brings the year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate on net income to 119%.
investing activity in the quarter totaled $135 million, driven by the $125 million acquisition of fluortek. dividend payments were $22 million in the quarter, and the company's board approved a 3% increase in the annual dividends, effective in the fourth quarter of 2020. this marks the 57th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend. we remain very confident in the cash flows of the company and are committed to returning a portion of the cash to shareholders in the form of a consistently increasing dividend.
in summary, our top line has held up well, considering the challenging macroeconomic environment. while we benefit from the diversity of the end markets we serve, the team has responded in a great way in supporting our customers and delivered solid performance while controlling costs in the quarter. we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, with sufficient liquidity to allow us to stay focused on long-term strategic initiatives to drive organic and inorganic growth.
i'll now turn the call back to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, joe.
i'm pleased with the performance the team delivered in a very challenging environment. i'd like to make note a few areas. first, i appreciate the strong performance of our teams in asia pacific and japan. they successfully managed through the challenges of covid-19 earlier this year. through it all, they remained focused on serving the customer. as a result, they delivered growth in the quarter. revenue in the asia-pac region increased 3% compared to prior year. we had a very productive virtual review of our asian businesses several weeks ago. taking our executive team on a virtual tour of the facilities and new product pipeline, it is clear that the regional team is making meaningful progress in broadening in-country new product application and service expertise and resources to serve our customers in the region.
second, i'd like to acknowledge the strong results of our test and inspection product lines, which are up double digits year-over-year. test and inspection has been a focus area of our acquisition strategy, and we've built a robust offering of t&i product lines, including x-ray, acoustic imaging, bond testing and automated optical inspection capability. as advanced electronic components and semiconductor technology for 5g, ai and memory applications are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the need for t&i equipment is growing.
nordson's diverse portfolio of solutions and technical expertise is making us a go-to partner for global customers. in fact, our matrix in-line automated x-ray, offline dage x-ray and bond testing and sonoscan acoustic imaging product lines had directed sales in the fiscal third quarter.
as i mentioned earlier, i'm encouraged that our teams are beginning to use a data driven approach with the nbs next segmentation tool to prioritize investments to position their businesses for profitable growth when the recovery begins. in july, i participated in a progress review of the four pilot businesses who are currently deploying nbs next. i'm pleased with the curiosity and experimentation in how our teams are beginning to apply data-centered insights to enhance customer service levels.
nordson's geographic and end market diversity is one of our greatest strengths. in this period, our test and inspection, consumer non-durable and medical end markets are helping balance the weakness of industrial end markets that are still under pressure. our recurring revenue of aftermarket parts and consumables contributes to our relatively stable performance in these dynamic times.
looking at the fourth quarter, our order entry rate has come off of the lows experienced earlier in the quarter. the trailing four week order entry as we entered the fourth quarter is approximately 93% compared to prior year levels and the 12 week order entry is approximately 90% compared to the same period last year. backlog has decreased approximately 3% compared to the prior year. based on these data points, we expect our fiscal fourth quarter revenue to be comparable to slightly better than the third quarter 2020 revenue. we also expect low single-digit sequential growth in earnings.
i want to thank our colleagues around the world for their incredible commitment to our customers. this is an uncertain time for many, and the team's strong execution is commendable. as always, i want to thank our customers, employees and shareholders for their continued support.
with that, i'll pause and take the questions.

[operator instructions] first question comes from matt summerville with d.a. davidson.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
thanks. a couple of questions. first, on the medical side of the business, can you talk about how much of that is being driven by what is now being defined as elective versus non-elective? i guess i was under the impression that the elective portion was pretty minimal.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, matt. as we entered the quarter, the definition of what is elective and what is selective, as you know, continued to broaden. and so because of that, we did have some impact in our businesses. but if you look at our medical portfolio of product offerings, we have a fairly broad and diverse offering that not only serves the minimally invasive surgeries and -- such as heart replacement or stent placement. we also have a number of surgical as well as fluid management product offerings. so what we saw really was a surge in demand for our fluid management product offerings, pulmonary treatments, and so it's certainly helped us come in flat to last year in the medical business -- less than what we have experienced historically, 4% to 5% growth. so it was lower than that, but it was flat to last year.
and probably put it in context, what i'll tell you is, if you take a look at medical device manufacturers, many of them in this environment are down mid-teens. and so we are really -- we're really pleased and -- it is slightly lower than our expectation, but very pleased that the team was able to come in on a flat year-over-year basis for the medical business.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
got it. thank you for that color. and then just as a follow-up, can you maybe provide an update on what you're seeing in fluid dispense as it pertains to more to consumer electronics, 5g project activity and kind of what the outlook is there? thank you.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. what we see really is early stages of -- we had a good quarter last quarter, if you remember, on the fluid dispense side for our electronic businesses, and what we see is continued project activity. what you do find is, in the electronic side, we're finding a lot of applications for these new complex components that go into ai applications, go into a number of the advanced 5g related products, be it auto electronics or as well as in mobiles that you have increased antenna requirements, you have increased camera modules, you have increased number of gyros as well as microspeakers and such, so a lot of advanced components, that we are seeing a lot of project activity on that. but primarily on the electronic side, where we see strength and had a really strong quarter was in our test and inspection which is more geared toward the semiconductor side of the business rather than on the component side.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
got it. thanks, naga.
lara mahoney -- vice president, investor relations and corporate communications
next question?
operator
next question comes from jeff hammond with keybanc capital markets.
jeffrey david hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, jeff.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
jeffrey david hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
just want to really understand kind of the order trend through the quarter. and you kind of gave some different numbers, 12 week trend, four week trend. to just kind of really get a better sense of kind of what the true trend is in terms of things getting sequentially better and maybe where particularly you're seeing things get sequentially better. thanks.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. no. thank you, jeff. and so what -- what we try to do is probably talk to you a little bit about how we entered the quarter, by the end of the quarter, and we provided probably for the first time we've talked about order entry rates in the way we're talking about it now. and i want to provide you some context for that.
we feel, given the dynamic environment, it was important for us to provide you with more color than we normally do. so that was the intent. and so, as we entered the third quarter, if you looked at the 12 week order rate, we think of the 12 week order rate as a little more longer-term and suddenly [phonetic] [0:35:31] stabilizes near-term environment. but given the current dynamics, we felt it was important for us to look at something shorter-term so that we can see what is happening. so that's why last quarter we provided you six week guidance. that's because six weeks was the time period that covid had really hit in our quarter. so going forward, what we're thinking about is, giving you a 12 week and four week guidance around how we are seeing till we get out of this dynamic environment.
so with that context, what i will tell you is that the best way to think about the current environment is to think about it more sequentially, and we begin to see as we navigated through the third quarter, sequentially, the order trends for the total company was starting to improve, right. so we entered the quarter i would say six week order trends were more in the range of 11% -- the short-term was around 11% down. and as we exit the quarter, we begin to see that order trend is more like down 7%. so that's sort of -- go ahead.
jeffrey david hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. that was helpful. where do you think you -- where are you seeing the best sequential improvement?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. so i think i answered one part of your question. and now let's go to the next part of the question and probably take it in two chunks, jeff, is that first give you some color around the regions and then give you some color around the trends we are seeing by end market.
so if you think about the geographies, sequentially, our order entries are such that from a geography perspective, in the us the order trends are stabilizing albeit at a little bit lower level that we talked about. americas, which is sort of latin america and mexico, still remains challenged, given all that is going on in mexico and brazil, still remains challenged. but it's a very small part of our company. in terms of europe, what we do see is a meaningful pickup and a trend-up sequentially when compared to third quarter. and then in asia, as you've seen in our third quarter numbers, we have reported a growth in asia when compared to last year and what we find there in asia is sequentially that remains flat. it is not accelerating any further than that, but it is remaining flat. so that's the regional picture.
and if we look at about end markets, what i would tell you is that some of the industrial end markets remain challenged, right. so businesses that have industrial exposure like our ics business or our fluid dispensing in efd, they remain challenged. our medical business continues to be flat. order entry rates are flat and we seem to feel good about it. our fluid dispensing in -- consumer non-durables is flat to slightly up. and our plastic processing is flat to slightly up. and our electronic business, as we talked about, in test and inspection had a strong quarter and we find that we are flat there.
so hopefully that gives you -- it's a range of scenarios is what we are seeing in terms of trends for the various end markets. but essentially, it's a very dynamic environment, and what we find ourselves is managing to that dynamic environment. we're seeing some areas where sequentially things are stabilizing and maybe some improvement, but the industrial parts continue to remain challenged for the company.
jeffrey david hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. great. that's good color, naga. just on fluortek, can you give us what kind of the annual revenue contribution, what that business has been growing at, kind of how the margin profile looks versus the medical business overall or at least the advanced tech segment and just really where -- what's the incremental kind of new product or market that this gives you that you didn't have before?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i think -- let me give you some strategic color and maybe give you some update around how things are panning out in the first couple of months here and then joe can sort of provide you a little bit color around contribution and such. so, it's a great little business. it's a niche business for us. it brings to the company ptfe tubing. so this is the inner lubricious layer of the -- think about trying to place a stent. you have to thread it through a tube that's in the patient, and what you really find is, you have a lubricious tubing layer which is inside that tube, and that's really what this is, right.
so that is their major product line -- is the inner lubricious layer of those tubing that is used to place stents or heart valves and things like that. so it's a very niche product. it's a great complementary addition to our delivery mechanism, core component offering that we have, right. through vention, we were able to bring on a very strong position in core components that helped us in this minimally invasive therapies and we find this as a real nice add to it.
in terms of the integration, we really like the business. the technology is really solid. as we have spent time within the business, it reaffirms our strategic thought about adding this. so we really like it. we like the people. operations are coming along really nicely. let me maybe turn this a little bit. joe can add some color around financials. overall, it's a value-added business, a differentiated business. it adds to the company, doesn't take away. so...
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, jeff, just to give a little more color, the annual revenue on this business is approximately, let's say $20 million, and from a margin profile standpoint, is comparable to our current ats business.
jeffrey david hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. thanks a lot, guys.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

next question comes from christopher glynn with oppenheimer.
christopher d. glynn -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thank you. good morning. just wanted to go into the medical piece for a little bit. i'm curious about how you're thinking about maybe pent-up demand for elective products. it's obviously a pretty important business to you where you've had great success over the past. i'm wondering how you're thinking about the prospects for kind of pent-up demand, assuming it's not too late for some people in search of elective procedures.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. chris, it's a great question. and i think that is as difficult as it sounds. but that is really what -- what people are dealing with is that, surgeries that are needed are getting postponed, and we are hopeful -- but look, we do fundamentally, to answer your question, fundamentally believe there is a pent-up demand that we would enjoy as surgeries come up. we're beginning to see early signs of hospitals opening up and certainly trying to increase the number of surgeries that is -- it'll be a slow ramp-up.
this environment, as all of us know and experience, is very dynamic. things are up and down a bit, but in general, we are very convinced that -- remember also that these are specced-in products in that these -- they have a great amount of stickiness to the sales orders because we are specced in through fda approvals for medical devices in our customers. so quite frankly, we feel very strongly about the growth drivers around medical are solid, they've not changed. and in the short term, we would enjoy some meaningful pickup as the surgeries come back. but we -- our expectations are, this is going to be a slow ramp, not a very fast ramp.
as you can imagine, we, till we get past this next season of flu and get past to some level of normalcy, this is going to be a little bit up and down, but even with those postponement, what i really want to emphasize here is that the team came in with a flat revenue year-on-year which is very strong performance and that's because we have -- our product offering is pretty strong in fluid management as well as pulmonary therapies, which we've really not talked about a lot, but there are pulmonary therapies where our cannulas get used. and so, we really like medical. we continue to invest here. we still see opportunities. so hopefully that provides you some color.
christopher d. glynn -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
yes, it does. great. appreciate that. and then my follow-up is kind of update on what you're seeing in terms of momentum. you touched on kind of the handset features and things like that. but for 5g, both for infrastructure and for handsets, kind of compare/contrast and you expect that ecosystem around 5g is likely your most robust factor in fiscal '21 at this early juncture?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, the 5g -- 5g activity -- the activity remains strong. project activity remains strong. we get invited to lots of different projects where we're working on. but it is, at least for the moment, it has got a lot of promise, as we've talked about in the last couple of quarters, lots of promise, a big secular driver for this business, but not a needle mover at the moment for us.
but why we're excited about 5g is, not only just the handset. we really want to think about 5g in a broader terms around the base station infrastructure build-out, which is sorely behind. you really find there is a lot of advertisement and marketing around 5g. really, the usefulness of any of that only depends on if you are near the cell tower. remember, these are fairly weak signal, so you've got to really be almost on top of one of these things to experience this awesome technology that is coming. but eventually it will happen. so we are excited about the base station opportunity. it's slow to roll out.
as you know, there are a number of geopolitical competitive things going on around that that certainly strains it. we certainly like all the advanced components that are getting developed. so we really like that. auto electronics will be a big player of 5g because they are going to get incorporated. iot devices are going to be another big area where 5g is going to get incorporated. so lots of different nuances to 5g beyond just the handset. but the handset is probably what takes up most of the press time. so overall good activity; still continuing to participate in projects; just not a big needle mover at the moment for our company.
christopher d. glynn -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
yeah. we know it's not now, but it sounds like the timing visibility is kind of quixotic, i guess?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, yeah, a good word to use.
christopher d. glynn -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thank you.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, chris.

next question comes from mike halloran with baird.
michael patrick halloran -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, mike.
michael patrick halloran -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
a couple of -- a couple of margin questions here. so on the ats, if you think about the sequential margins going into the -- into the fiscal fourth quarter, same mix pressures -- that appears to be the assumption, but the same mix pressures that were there in the fiscal third quarter probably than just for the fiscal fourth quarter?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so i think similar -- in ats, the mix pressure will be there, as assumed to be there, in the fourth quarter that was there in the third quarter based on some of the end market demand that naga just reviewed.
michael patrick halloran -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
that makes sense. and then the inefficiencies you referenced for the industrial precision business. maybe some context on those and how long do you think they linger?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so as our factories initially responded during the covid crisis and our efforts to keep employees safe but continue to meet customer needs, we had significant factories -- while they remained open, we were precautionary quarantining several people. when you think about some of our clean rooms, we also had to put in social distancing and so our -- some of our manufacturing processes weren't as efficient from a direct labor standpoint. and so we've been working through that, getting the proper pp&e, the proper staffing and people coming back from quarantine. and so we're kind of working through those kinks. we've made progress, i would tell you, in the quarter -- from earlier in the quarter as it relates to manufacturing efficiencies and conversion cost rates. and so we anticipate as we get used to the new normal, to continue to improve as we go throughout q4 here.
michael patrick halloran -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
thanks for that. and then last one, the fluortek piece -- obviously you said that you were able to getting that -- some m&a done. but maybe just thoughts on the pipeline as it looks from here and what the, basically, the ability to convert some of that pipeline looks like as we sit here today.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
mike. great question. as you think about m&a, we've really talked about what is our focus. our focus really is two big areas. scaling up medical, scaling up t&i are the two areas that we're very focused on. and if we find things that are very complementary very next to our core, we would make some add-ons. but it's really important for us to emphasize the context and our strategic rationale for anything we do will start with what makes nordson strong, right. precision technologies, customer-centric business model, two things that we look for.
so as you look at the pipeline, our pipeline has a number of opportunities that we continue to stay in touch. but given the environment, think about great companies that we would like to add to the portfolio. this is not particularly the time that they want to sort of transact, meaning, given sort of reduction in their own outlooks and stuff, they're not particularly interested in acting on any of those and sort of take the wait and see approach. so meaningfully, these opportunities are still existing. we are still sort of cultivating them is probably the best way to put it. should some of them happen to come to the market, as we have been able to do with fluortek, we will certainly act on them. but you can expect us to stay disciplined to what we feel are most important adds to the company in the areas we're interested in.
michael patrick halloran -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
great. thanks a lot, naga. appreciate the time.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer

[operator instructions] next question comes from andrew buscaglia with berenberg.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
good morning, guys.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
i had a question -- good morning. i had a question on -- so in industrial precision, yeah, i was way off on modeling there and my expectations for there because we got some tougher markets within there with auto exposure, a&d exposure, you got some energy exposure. so i'm curious why -- did this -- did the trends in those specific businesses surprise you or is there resiliency in that -- in the tougher areas? can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there, i guess, and your outlook for the more difficult pieces?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so maybe let's first take the ones that are doing well. so this is -- ips traditionally has this adhesive business that we have always deemed a very strong part of the company history and a legacy part of the company and a core part of the company. strong market leader. serve a number of recession-resilient end markets: food and beverage packaging, nonwovens and things of that sort.
so if we really think about that business, it has a very strong aftermarket component to it, about 50% of the market. so really think about that piece of ips as being very resilient. it has done well. it had some slight downtick, but in general has done really well, up to our expectations. certainly, early in the quarter, definitely helped by nonwovens in terms of masks -- mask production, so some of our customers shifting from paper production to mask production was a great example. so we benefited from some of our customers making those turns and in some cases even added more mask manufacturing capacity. we benefited from it. in that same -- in ips, we also have our industrial end market facing businesses and those remain challenged. like our -- like any other pure industrial businesses, as you think about capex deferrals, significant shutdown in the automotive industry, all of that certainly has impacted those businesses. those remain challenged. but the diversity of end markets and diversity even within the segment certainly helped us performed fairly well.
did i sort of give you what you're looking for there, andrew?
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
yeah. no, that's really helpful. and like kind of like along those lines, i mean, it seems the resiliency is there. but i guess in a post covid world, are you guys thinking about any of these businesses differently? or is there any sort of pruning opportunities you can make to some of your areas that maybe your view has changed? [indecipherable]
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think you're asking a question around portfolio. and so really our approach to portfolio management is a consistent review of all product lines on a yearly basis, and we really look at it through two lenses. one is, take a look at it from a growth potential business. we're very focused on profitable growth, growth potential being an important lens, and second lens really being, what is the degree of differentiation, really what is the profitability of the businesses. so as you consider those, we make decisions, and if you kind of look back at the history of the company, when things didn't add up to our expectations in those areas, we did act on some product lines. and so it's an annual assessment and something that we do on a regular basis.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
got it. okay. thank you.
operator
next question comes from walter liptak with seaport.
walter liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys. good morning.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, walt.
walter liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
hey. i wanted to ask a little bit more about the industrial. and i wonder if you could help us understand any of the -- the trends around -- we saw maybe things getting better in may and june i think. and i wonder if with the virus cases going up again recently, if some of the caution that you're talking about around industrials because you see things weaken again?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
i think probably, walt, the best way to think about it is, we don't seem to find industrial strengthening much. it is just -- it seems to have stabilized at a lower level than our other businesses, right. so when we say it remains challenged, we're not saying it is going down further. we're saying it has gone down sort of in line with other industrial capex businesses but has not gotten back up. it continues still today -- it remains challenged is probably the better way to put it.
walter liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
okay. and that's fair. i wonder is it down because the customers are just cautious on their capex spending? because i thought there was a high roi or is there a difficulty getting out with sales engineers into the field to sell and spec out systems? i guess is it slower because of this virtual world that we live in now and not being able to get out to customers to sell new systems?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think it is really the larger capex spend where people are trying to sort of -- so think about our powder system businesses, right. it's a good example. powder system businesses, these are fairly significant capital outlays. and so if you are an industrial manufacturer and you have some demand issue, this is probably not the time that you're going to sort of put out a capital outlay for a large system. so that's kind of where we are seeing.
but what we find ourselves is that when somebody has a need like our mask manufacturing, which is not industrial but more consumer non-durable, in that particular case, even in this virtual world, we are able to work with our customers, able to understand their spaces, able to spec in what they need. certain customers have some pretty stringent requirements early on for actual person visit.
but that is all changing. we're all learning how to work in this new world. so some of this -- a lot of the communication with engineers and such has actually picked up. just think about you have engineers and design folks that have projects that need to complete, but now are at home and are virtually working, they have plenty of time to spend time with their salespeople. so quite frankly, the interaction with our customers have changed and actually have increased from an engineer to salesperson conversations, which in the past, somebody is in a meeting or somebody is doing something else, but now you find yourself having greater touch points with your customers. so hopefully that provides you a color of how we are operating in this environment, say.
walter liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
okay. yeah, it does. thank you for that. and then, i wonder, just a couple of things on supply chain. we've heard about some parts shortages. you didn't mention anything about that, but i wonder how you feel about your supply chain or made any changes there. and then -- and then also in nbs, you mentioned that four plants are doing the segmentation work as sort of a pilot project. i wonder if you could give us some -- a little bit better understanding of which segments that might be in, which factories and what we should expect over, say, the next six, nine months in terms of any profit improvement.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
so, maybe two questions there. so let me first...
walter liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
yeah [speech overlap]
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
so let me first take the question around supply chain. we didn't mention it because we had no issues. but frankly, we have a very strong robust supply chain team and process, and we have a great risk mitigation plan. all of that really played out the way we have anticipated, and so really did not have any issues. early in march, we may have had few hiccups here and there, but they were all more ended up with higher freight costs than anything else. but in the past quarter really is a non-issue for us. and so supply chain, no issues, things running. so everything is good.
so in terms of nbs next, probably what is -- what is important to sort of provide you some context is that, we look at nbs next as a growth framework. and really our pilot businesses, there are four them, and it's equally spread among both the segments. and our expectation is, we'll roll them out to really strong businesses and not roll them out to our weaker businesses. really, the total company is pretty strong. so among the strong, we took our best businesses because we believe that looking at this from a growth lens is more important than anything else.
and so -- so what these businesses are really looking at is, they're using -- at the heart of nbs next is really a data-centric, data-based segmentation process, and that's what the teams are working on. we are -- the way i would characterize it, we have a proficiency model. we look at it within the company, and we think of them as learn to lead and coach. and i would say our pilot businesses are in the learning mode, starting to do, and our expectation is this would play out here over the next 12 to 18 months.
and our goals really are not about how do we increase the profit margin as much as how do we have the best customers-facing metrics around products, quality and delivery so that we are able to accelerate growth when the recovery happens, so really positioning business to capture growth and have a crystal clear view of what are the top tier growth opportunities for the company and how do we disproportionately invest in those areas. and with growth, we would have incremental margin improvements. that could come, but the exercise is not about taking out cost as much as it is really centered around growth.
walter liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
okay. great. yeah. good luck with the project. it sounds very promising. if i can just get one last one in. how are you thinking about pricing in this environment? when do you typically do annual price increases and are there any businesses where you can -- where you can get price, even with this slowness going on in the economy?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
we typically look at annual price increases. as you can expect, there are input cost increases for the company, just given the environment we're in and maybe the inflationary -- potential inflationary environment that we might enter in. so we have -- in most of our businesses, as you know, our margin profile -- our gross margin profiles are pretty strong, and that is really because we add a lot of value, we create a lot of value and we get paid for the value. but we are also mindful of the position where we are. we have significant premium for the value we are creating. and so you would expect us to be thoughtful. we're focused around growth. we are focused around creating value and getting paid for it. so pricing is not the biggest growth driver for us as much as making sure that we are participating in the growth as it comes, and then adjust for inflationary costs should we -- should be encounter any of them.
walter liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
okay. great. thank you very much.
operator
and at this time, i will turn the call over to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. while the near-term demand conditions stabilize at a reduced level, i remain excited about the future of nordson. we have a solid foundation, fortified by the diversity of our business and our strong customer-centric business model. we'll continue to monitor this dynamic environment to ensure we are taking appropriate action to manage the business while staying focused on our long-term objective of making a strong nordson even stronger by accelerating organic growth, diversifying through acquisitions, leveraging the nbs next growth framework, unleashing owner mindset and focus on building winning teams. again, thank you for your time and attention on today's call.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the nordson corporation fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, lara mahoney. please go ahead.
lara mahoney -- vice president, investor relations & corporate communications
thank you. good morning. this is lara mahoney, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. i'm here with sundaram nagarajan, our president and ceo; and joseph kelly, executive vice president and cfo.
we welcome you to our conference call today, wednesday, december 16, 2020 to report nordson's fiscal year 2020 fourth quarter and full year results. you can find both our press release as well as our new webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at nordson.com/investor. this conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 14 days. there will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until december 30, 2020. during this conference call, references to non-gaap financial metrics will be made. a complete reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable gaap metric has been provided in the press release issued yesterday.
before we begin, please refer to slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon nordson's current expectations. these statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, as discussed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission that could cause actual results to differ.
moving to today's agenda on slide 3, naga will discuss fourth quarter and full year highlights. he will then turn the call over to joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the two business segment. joe also will talk about the year end balance sheet and cash flow. naga will conclude with high level commentary about our enterprise performance as well as our fiscal 2021 first quarter guidance. we will then be happy to take your questions.
with that, i will turn to slide 4 and hand the call over to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining nordson's fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and full year conference call. in this unprecedented fiscal year, we did not just weather a challenging macro environment, we advanced our long-term strategy and achieved solid financial results.
first, i want to thank our nordson employees for their flexibility, resilience and commitment as we navigated fiscal 2020. from the beginning of this pandemic, our leadership team has worked together to protect the health and safety of our employees and respond to the needs of our customers. representatives from our global teams came together to share best practices and lessons learned as covid-19 span the globe. we implemented new protocols of social distancing and face coverage as well as regular cleaning and temperature checks, all of which continues to this day.
by protecting our employees, we were able to offer uninterrupted service to our customers, many of whom were deemed to support critical infrastructure. nordson products are a very diverse set of end markets, including medical, electronics, consumer non-durables and general industrial. this diversity helped us drive the relative stability of our results. we have also stayed invested in our direct sales application and service model, and committed to the innovation in our precision technologies.
for the full year, sales decreased only 3% compared to prior year, which is commendable in this environment. simultaneously, we made meaningful progress on our long-term objectives. we built and started to deploy the next generation of nordson business system, which we are calling nbs next, our growth framework. using critical insights generated by nbs next segmentation tools, our divisional leaders are prioritizing investments in our best growth opportunities and simplifying non-value-added tasks in operations to deliver best-in-class product quality and delivery.
use of this data-driven growth framework led us to take actions that could strategically position our portfolio for sustainable long-term profitable growth. in september, we announced the technology acquisition of vivamos, which designs, develops and fabricates high end image sensors that would further differentiate our x-ray inspection product offering.
earlier this year, we acquired fluortek, a precision plastic extrusion manufacturer in medical device industry. fluortek brings highly differentiated ptfe medical tubing expertise, which is complementary to our current value-added component offering for minimally invasive therapies, such as heart valve replacement. scaling up our highly differentiated test and inspection and medical product lines will continue to be a priority of our capital deployment strategy.
we also took actions to simplify our portfolio in less differentiated areas. on december 3, we announced the divestiture of our screws and barrels product line from our polymer processing systems division to altair investments. while this business is a respected leader in the plastic industry, it does not meet nordson's long-term profitable growth objectives. we believe it will be better positioned with altair. by directing this business, we will focus our resources on growing more differentiated profitable product lines that will deliver on our long-term growth objectives. we believe our remaining pps division has the right degree of differentiation and related technical competitive advantages to deliver nordson-like growth and returns.
i'll speak more about the business in a few moments, but first, i'll turn the call over to joe to provide more detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, naga, and good morning to everyone. as lara mentioned, we have provided slides to complement the narrative during today's earnings call. on slide number 5, you see fourth quarter 2020 sales were $559 million, a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter sales of $585 million. the decrease was primarily related to organic volume, offset by favorable currency and benefits from the fluortek and vivamos acquisitions. test and inspection product lines were solid again this quarter, and we continue to see growth in our product lines serving medical end markets. sales decline in the quarter was largely driven by weakness in the industrial and automotive end markets.
gross profit totaled $297 million or 53% of sales in the quarter compared to $319 million or 54% of sales in the prior year. the 100 basis point decrease in gross margins primarily relates to the $1.3 million in amortization of acquired inventory step up from the fiscal 2020 acquisitions. looking sequentially, gross margins improved 100 basis points as the manufacturing inefficiencies related to our response to the covid-19 pandemic and unfavorable product sales mix experienced in the third quarter of 2020 were primarily temporary in nature.
operating profit was $37 million in the quarter. this included an $87 million non-cash impairment charge related to classifying the screw and barrel product line within the ips segment as assets held for sale. this classification aligns with the company's strategic decision to divest this product line to improve the ongoing earnings and overall profitable growth profile of the business. excluding this item, plus cost reduction actions and the amortization of acquired inventory step up, adjusted operating profit totaled $130 million or 23% of sales. ebitda for the fourth quarter was $159 million or 29% of sales, which is 5% below the prior year ebitda of $168 million.
looking at non-operating expense, net interest expense decreased $4 million or 37% from the prior year levels associated with lower effective borrowing rate. other net expense increased $2 million, driven primarily by a $1 million increase in pension costs. tax expense in the quarter totaled $8 million or an effective tax rate of 30% in the quarter. excluding the tax impact and non-recurring items and the $2 million discrete tax benefit associated primarily with stock option exercises, the fourth quarter and full year normalized tax rate is approximately 21%.
net income in the quarter totaled $18 million or $0.31 per share. adjusted net income and earnings were $93 million or $1.59 per share. this represents an 11% decrease from the prior year adjusted earnings, reflective primarily of a 5% year-over-year decrease in sales.
turning to slide number 6. i'll now share a few comments on our full year results. sales for the full year 2020 were $2.1 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to the prior year. this change in sales included a decrease in organic volumes of 4%, offset by growth related to acquisitions. the full year impact of currency translation differences was not significant. excluding the non-cash impairment charge, cost reduction initiatives, acquired inventory step up amortization and the discrete tax benefits, adjusted operating profit was $454 million and diluted earnings per share were $5.48, a 7% decrease from the prior year adjusted earnings of $5.87. ebitda for the full year was $567 million or 27% of sales, which is in line with our prior year ebitda margin percent of sales.
now let's turn to slide 7 and 8 to review the fourth quarter 2020 segment performance. industrial precision solutions sales of $308 million decreased 8% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. this decline was driven in part by weaker demand in industrial and automotive end markets where we had record sales in the prior year fourth quarter. currency was favorable 2%, primarily driven by the strengthening of the euro, offset by an organic volume decrease of 10%.
adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $92 million or 30% of sales, which excludes the $87 million non-cash impairment charge and $4 million in structural cost reduction actions. despite the decrease in sales volume, cost control measures and sales mix improvements enabled the segment to deliver the same 30% operating margin as the prior year fourth quarter. structural cost reductions taken in the fourth quarter were primarily related to early retirement incentives offered to employees in the industrial coatings systems division. these actions will generate $3 million to $4 million in annualized savings starting in fiscal 2021.
advanced technology solutions sales of $250 million increased approximately 1% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. this change included a decrease in organic sales volume of 3%, an increase of approximately 2% related to acquisitions, and a 1% increase related to currency. continued sales volume growth in test and inspection product lines serving electronics end markets and steady demand in medical product lines were offset by weakness in fluid dispense product lines serving industrial and automotive end markets.
reported operating profit for the segment was $51 million. excluding one-time charges associated with the amortization of acquired inventory step up, adjusted operating profit was $52 million or 21% of sales. the year-over-year decrease of 100 basis points in operating margin in the fourth quarter and the full year was driven by unfavorable product sales mix within the segment.
finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on page 9. we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and plenty of available borrowing capacity. cash totaled $208 million and net debt was $898 million, ending the quarter with a 1.6 time leverage ratio based on the trailing 12 months ebitda. free cash flow in the quarter was $178 million. this brings the full year 2020 free cash flow total to $452 million, a conversion rate on adjusted net income of 141% as working capital liquidation and lower cash taxes paid contributed favorably to free cash flow in 2020. for modeling purposes, in fiscal 2021, assume an estimated effective tax rate of 21% and capital expenditures of $50 million to $55 million.
in summary, our top-line has held up well considering the unique challenges of fiscal 2020. the team has taken constructive actions to manage cost, while also aligning our resources and product portfolio with the best profitable growth opportunities. we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with sufficient liquidity to allow us to stay focused on long-term strategic initiatives to drive profitable, organic and inorganic growth.
i will now turn the call back to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, joe. let's turn to slide 10. we are well positioned going into fiscal 2021. we have been operating safely and efficiently in this pandemic environment. we also have found creative ways to connect with our customers, whether it is virtual training and tech support or safely distance on-site product implementations.
for example, our adhesives team recently participated in the annual tactics show, which is the largest north american packaging trade show. they rose to the challenge of this virtual event, showcasing our recent innovation through virtual demonstrations and videos. no matter the environment, nordson employees remain focused on innovation and delivering on the needs of our customers.
i'm also pleased with the engagement of the team in adapting our nbs next growth framework. this is truly about making a strong nordson even stronger. fundamental to this framework is to select and invest in the best profitable growth opportunities. this data-driven, customer and product segmentation approach, which we refer to as strategic discipline, identifies where we create the greatest value for our customers. it is the new capability that our team is learning.
using a data-driven segmentation approach in a consistent and disciplined way, division leaders across the nordson have been working to define their strategic business priorities. this framework empowers our division leaders to take action on the data and focus on the areas where we win.
our decision to divest the screws and barrels product line was based on critical insight gained from this data-driven segmentation approach. realigning our portfolio is another step forward in positioning nordson for long-term profitable growth. this divestiture will improve earnings on a go-forward basis. it also gives our pps leaders more time and energy to focus their resources on their differentiated and profitable product lines. this action exemplified the power of nbs next, identify our businesses' goal, simplify the areas that distract you from focusing and growing with your core strength.
the consistent deployment of our data-driven growth framework will complement nordson's great strength of innovation, customer passion and culture and plans. we will continue to strengthen our newer capability by unleashing an entrepreneurial mindset at the division level, while also building deep and diverse winning teams.
we are excited to announce that we will be hosting a virtual investor day on march 30, 2021. at this event, we will share more details about our long-term strategy, our differentiated product portfolio and our growth objectives. we will be sharing more information about the details of this event in january, but please save the date in your calendars for the morning of march 30.
now for the outlook on slide 11. as i previously mentioned, we are well positioned entering 2021. during the challenging year of 2020, we remained invested in what makes nordson strong, the direct sales model and our innovative precision technology portfolio. additionally, we were successful in advancing several aspects of our long-term growth strategy. as we begin fiscal 2021, backlog has increased approximately 5% compared to the same period a year ago, and the trailing 12-week order entry is 5% above prior year level.
that said, it remains a dynamic environment and our business conditions are changing frequently as the world responds to the challenges of resurging covid-19 virus. given these factors, we're not providing annual guidance at this time. however, we have a good line of sight to the fiscal 2021 first quarter. based on current order entry trends, backlog amounts and the correlation to sales timing, we expect the first quarter of 2021 sales growth to be approximately 2% to 3% with adjusted earnings growth in the range of 15% to 20% as compared to fiscal 2020 first quarter. as always, i want to thank our customers, employees and shareholders for your continued support.
with that, we will pause and take your questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of allison poliniak with wells fargo. allison, your line is open.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great, thanks. good morning, guys. within the 5% order rate for this past couple of weeks, is there a noted vertical that's driving that or is it fairly broad-based here?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. allison, good morning. thank you for your question. let's just maybe talk in terms of specific end markets, that's probably the better way to answer that question. so if you think about our consumer non-durable business, what you're really finding is, this is a recession-resilient end market for us, food and beverage packaging. adhesives have been trending slightly up. and so our expectations are, this is a better growth than what we have seen in some time.
in the medical business, order rates remained stable. it still remains a dynamic environment. remember that parts of our metal business that is certainly impacted by elective surgeries or selective surgeries, but we also have little bit component parts of our business that has been serving biopharma end markets. and so -- and disposable, single-use plastics as well. so that part of it is doing really well.
so overall, medical is stable, still continuing to grow. in electronics, i would tell you the test and inspection business is really doing extremely well. they are driven by advanced components in semiconductors, camera modules. in the quarter, we experienced double-digit growth. i would -- my expectations would be slightly lesser than that, but certainly high-single-digits is where this is trending.
our industrial business, i would tell you, is challenged, but things are starting to look up. we expect some recovery in the first quarter. our oem businesses are moderating and automotive is a small part of the company. so it's not one single vertical, but differing rates of growth and trends that are trending up based on the end markets.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then just touching on the divestiture, i know your comment about it not necessarily being quarter nordson longer term. is there somewhat of an impact -- mix impact that you guys are thinking about when looking at these businesses as well in terms of the long-term profitability of the company or is that sort of just an insight at this point?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
joe, you want to take this one?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so when you think about the divestiture, as naga mentioned in his script, this divestiture which we hope to conclude i would say at the end of q1 or early q2, it will improve the ongoing earnings of nordson. and specifically, i guess to your question, the ips segment and will also improve therefore the profitability profile. but i would tell you, no different than naga mentioned in his script, the most important i think impactful is the prioritization and the allocation of resources to those more attractive growth opportunities. and so that's what really came through the nbs next portfolio analysis and driving that focus in terms of a growth framework going forward.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of matt summerville with d.a. davidson. matt, your line is open.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
thanks. couple of questions. maybe just to follow-up on the last point, just internal review process that led to this divestiture announcement. have you fully concluded that at this point? and should we expect any additional portfolio shaping actions here in the more immediate term?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. matt, thank you for your question. on nbs next, portfolio analysis is a core part of nbs next, which is really what we call strategic discipline. it is based on product segmentation and customer segmentation. it is an ongoing process. so based on what we looked at today with our pps business, our decision was this part of the business doesn't really fit the kind of long-term differentiation as well as the growth potential that we are looking to have in a business. so that's sort of what it is. but there are parts of our pps business in this analysis, we figured out that it has some pretty strong differentiation characteristics, some technical advantages, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow this business with the nordson-like profitability.
so for the rest of the businesses, this is an ongoing process. and there's not so much about what you're not going to do, it is as much as what you're going to do more up, right? so as you think about our businesses, each of our divisions are going through portfolio analysis. and they figure out what are the best growth opportunities, what will create the greatest value, how we'll win and focus disproportionately our resources and investments in that part of the company. so it's an ongoing process, and hopefully that you'll see some color.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
yes. thank you. and then as a follow-up. when you look at kind of your implied organic guidance for the first quarter, probably flat to maybe down slightly because you'll have some fx tailwind and then some acquisition tailwind. can you maybe talk about, square that up a little bit with respect to your trailing order entry being up mid-single-digits? and you mentioned some things may be around that correlation with timing, etc., can you maybe expand on that a little bit, naga?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i guess, let me expand on [technical issue] maybe naga, you can expand on the trend that you're seeing in the orders. but you are correct, i mean, if you look at our q1 guidance as it relates to the revenue, we assume there fx rate similar to what we had experienced in q4. and so, therefore, when you look at the q1 guidance, the fx and the acquisition will be favorable to about the same degree they were in our q4 performance, which to your point, implies organic growth relatively flat on a year-over-year basis.
now, i'll point now that that organic growth of relatively flat is a significant improvement from the 7% decrease that we saw organically in q4 and the 4% organic decrease in the full year 2020. also, i would add, if you look at what the revenue forecast implies for q1 2021, not only is it up 2% to 3% over 2020 q1, but it's also up over q1 2019. so said differently, from a run rate standpoint, we're starting out the year north of 2019 levels.
and then one other comment i would make is, and your observation, 5% on the order entry and the 5% on the backlog. that 5% is calculated on a constant dollar basis. so that's really what's driving our optimism and our attitudes and our positive outlook as we enter q1 2021. now, that being said, you could clearly see there is a difference between timing and lead times in terms of shipments and order entry and backlog. and so that all have to be taken into consideration when we give the q1 guidance. but when we look at that backlog and that order entry trend, that's what provides us that optimism heading into 2021.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
matt, what i would add to that is really -- that timing really depends on various different businesses, right? there are several businesses, like our medical business is pretty much not a backlog kind of business, it's more a book and ship kind of business. but if you contrast that within ics business, that is more backlog-oriented. you get the order, then you have a large system that you have to put together. and then our aftermarket parts revenues are pretty much book and ship, and in our adhesive business is somewhere in between. it is more standard products that you're customizing or configuring to sell. so depending on a business, depending on where it is, there is a correlation of timing that we talk about.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
thank you, guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of jeff hammond with keybanc. jeff, your line is open.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, jeff.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, jeff.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
maybe just give us a 5g update, we're seeing new phones get rolled out with 5g. just what are you seeing in terms of a capex cycle and on the mobile side as well as 5g infrastructure?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me talk about that broadly, jeff. what we are seeing in the business is 5g-related, but more broadly, digital acceleration is really driving the electronics supply chain within our businesses. and most prominently, where we are seeing this kind of activity and digital acceleration is in the semiconductor side of the business. so in the semicon business, we're seeing some incredible, a really nice demand patterns that are emerging for our test and inspection business, and that is really what you're seeing the strength of.
in terms of 5g, some of the semicon are related to 5g, but not entirely, right? this is really mostly because of a contact-free economy that is beginning to emerge; virtual conferences, virtual investor discussions, how you order your christmas gifts, how you order grocery. all of this is really an example of how this contact-free economy and digital acceleration that is really driving the growth of semiconductor. so you want to think about our electronic business not so much with the mobile revolution how you thought about our business then -- in the last decade where mobile revolution was really the biggest growth driver for us. but going forward, you want to think about our electronic business more in terms of digital acceleration. so that would mean, two to three times gdp kind of growth over the long cycle.
and on infrastructure, it is still slow. we are continuing to get orders, we're continuing to work on those things, but it is not at the same rate as one you would expect. so 5g in our mind is still an emerging opportunity.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then medical, you characterized as stable. i guess, i think this business is historically kind of a high-single-digit, low-double-digit grower, and maybe i'm just assuming stable means a little bit of growth. but i'm just trying to understand how you think the growth rate shapes up for medical and kind of these puts and takes around elective surgeries, maybe coming back as we get vaccine distribution versus kind of comps from ppe equipment, etc.?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i think that's a great question, jeff. in terms of our medical business, there are really two parts to the medical business that sort of allow us to have flat-to-low single-digits, but you got to remember the context. context really is, our med device customers are down 10%, 15%. so that's the context. and so why are we doing better than in that context, it's really because we have a fluid component business which is really serving the biopharma end markets as well as fluid components for covid-type therapies, right?
so what you're finding is our fluid component business is doing incredibly well, which is muting some of the declines we're seeing in our interventional component business, which is directly correlated to the selective surgeries and elective surgeries. so big picture, if you think about our elective-selective surgery kind of related component business, it's down a little bit, down a bit.
in the long-term, all of the drivers; aging population, single-use component, outsourcing our med device component, all of those are intact. as things normalize, we will return to mid-to-high single-digit kind of growth of this business, and that's our expectation. and right now in this transition, if you think about elective surgeries, in july, they were down about 75%. they were 75% up pre-covid levels, elective surgeries were. and our expectation was they were going to improve, but they have not. so as you know, as these elective surgeries improve, what you're going to find is that we will benefit from it and we will return to our mid-single-digits, high-single-digits kind of growth in the medical business. so let me stop there. if you have any follow-up, i certainly will be happy to.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
no, that's great. just maybe last one. i understand the uncertainty. just give us a sense of what you need to see or i don't know if it's just a couple more quarters before you kind of flip to a more full year kind of outlook? thanks.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. joe, you want to take that?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. our hope is that our visibility will improve or i should say our confidence as it relates to the volatile time that we're in with the pandemic here in q1 and q2. and so our hope is that by the time we have our investor day that naga referenced, we will resume annual guidance at that time.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. thanks so much everyone.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of andrew buscaglia with berenberg. andrew, your line is open.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
guys, i wanted to ask on -- digging a little deeper in that electronics component within ats. so there's a -- last year, there was a lot of optimism brewing into 2020, and obviously, there is a lot of things that navigate, you're dealing with trade and then the pandemic. so i guess, into this year, i guess, how do you view things on a relative basis versus historical cycles for that segment? and so as the year progresses, i guess, what are some of the times we should be look out forward, seeing how that business shapes up?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. andrew, thank you. the electronic business -- what has happened with our electronic business is something that we've been talking about a lot. if you think about historical, go back a decade ago, over the last decade, nordson benefited by this incredible mobile revolution where you went from 30 million phones to about 1.5 billion phones worldwide. it was an incredible time of change, incredible amount of things changing in the mobile technology. nordson played, contributed incredible technology and value to our customers, benefited from it, and that's what we saw.
as you think about the next decade, and that's sort of what we have in right now, that mobile revolution is a once in a lifetime kind of event. and what you're going to see is a much more normal kind of growth, still pretty strong growth, two to three times gdp. and so the way we plan and think about our businesses, we think about two to three times growth across the electronic supply chain. not just mobile, but really in our view as we work with our customers and what we see in our businesses. what we find the greater drivers are digital acceleration, which we've talked about. that contact-free economy, virtual conferences, virtual way of doing business, virtual way of buying grocery, virtual way of ordering christmas gifts. many different ways you think about this virtual economy, this contact-free economy is continuing to grow, which is leading to digital acceleration on infrastructure in capabilities. certainly all of this adds to supply improvement and order trends that are across the supply chain. and nordson has done a really nice job over the last decade to diversify from just one particular product category to multiple semiconductors, components, end products, pcbs.
so we're diversified across the electronic supply chain. and so we will benefit from that. and we're diversified into test and inspection. and so what you really see is this digital acceleration, all of this leading to complex devices, complex components leading to 100% inspection, in line inspection in some cases, all leading to our test and inspection business doing really well. so our expectation is two to three times. and it is a different kind of growth when compared to what you experienced in the last decade.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yeah, ok. with this nbs next, using data to kind of understand your business a bit better. you obviously found a divestment in there, but what about -- is this influencing any change potentially on the acquisition side as to maybe another adjacent sub-segment that you'd like to be in or is the focus going to remain on test and inspection and medical?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
so as you think about it, we didn't talk about this when we clarified our focus is going to be on test and inspection and medical, but really, that is what was behind. we did not -- at that time, did not publicly talk about nbs next because we were still in the process of building it. but really what drove our focus to focus on test and inspection and medical is really a concerted view inside the company on how the portfolio was and where was the greatest growth opportunities, what was the most differentiated parts of the company which had the greatest growth potential is sort of what it led us to this focus around test and inspection and medical.
we have opportunities scale up both these businesses and have a meaningful impact on growth of the company. should we ever get in a place where we run out of ideas in scaling up these two businesses, we have a innovation team within the company that is always looking for new market spaces that have characteristics that are very similar to nordson. do we like the company, do like the market, what is the growth potential, what is the level of differentiation. so should we ever run out of ideas, we don't rule out the opportunity to expand into a newer space should that need to happen.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of saree boroditsky with jefferies. saree, your line is open.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you, and good morning.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, saree.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
as part of the nbs next portfolio analysis, was there any businesses or product lines that you thought were being underfunded that you want to focus on growing organically going forward?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's a great question. that is one of the things that we're really laser focused on is this decision also -- there are two ways to think about this. one, it's a consistent disciplined way of looking at opportunities in the company. but more importantly, that analysis and that decision making now happens at our division level. at the company level, it is great to understand where you want to be. but it is even more powerful when you look at the businesses and you look at sub-segments within the business where the greatest opportunities are.
and as our division leaders have set their strategic growth priorities, what we are finding is that our leaders are making those decisions. the company has done a really nice job of staying invested in customer passion and staying invested in innovation. so i wouldn't say there is a complete switch. but are we discovering opportunities? yes. and i think i am more excited about the fact that now these decisions are made much closer to the customer, much closer to action and knowledge, and i think that's probably the shift that we are making.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. and then lastly, as we think about the backdrop for industrial spending next year, what are you hearing from customers as far as appetite for capital spending?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
as we talked a little bit about our industrial business, it remains challenged. but we are starting to -- from the middle of the year to now, sequentially, the orders have continued to improve and continued to grow, and we see some of that in our industrial businesses. so as we think about it, it remains a dynamic environment, but our expectations are that it is trending up and we expect some recovery in the first quarter.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks so much for answering my questions.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
saree, i would just -- so i would just add to your comment on the nbs next. if you look at our sg&a, we did take several actions during the back half, particularly of 2020, to lower our structural cost. that said, those actions were very strategic, focused on business as identified and areas identified through the nbs next framework. at the same time, it also allowed us areas where we want to invest, as naga mentioned. so if you look at our product development cost on the full year and in the quarter, it was actually flat for the full year, up in the quarter. so there are areas where we continue to invest and there are areas where we are taking the strategic, i would say, structural cost reduction actions.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of mike halloran with baird. mike, your line is open.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, mike.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
so some thoughts on the margin profile as you look through fiscal '21. maybe just help us some puts and takes, how you think about incremental margins? what some of these structural cost improvement initiatives can provide as a tailwind mix? any other puts and takes when you think about, obviously, the divestitures is coming up that will help with the mix. but beyond that, how should we think about advancing the key buckets in the fiscal '21?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
okay. mike, i think in general, let me give you a broad -- broadly how we think about this, and then joe can walk you through the puts and takes and all of that, right? so in general, the expectation for us is that as our revenues grow, our expectation of incremental should be north of 45%. that's sort of how we are thinking about it in the business. so that allows us with a 54% gross margins and ability to invest back in the business to continue to grow.
so with that, why don't i give joe to talk to you about the details of the various puts and takes.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so when you think about the incremental margins, i mean, our guidance here in q1 i think our high incremental margin sequentially and i should say on a year-over-year basis, because that is where you're seeing the benefits of some of those structural cost reduction actions in the q1 numbers. but i will go back to q4 and i'd just point out, i mean, quite pleased with the ips, 30% op as a percent of sales and that was nice sequential incremental margins there when we look at it compared to q3.
and so just it highlights that that particular business, some modest growth can really drops nice incremental margins north of 50%. and so that 30% goes back to the q4 2019 level, but also even if you look at q2, q3 back in '19 when that business is north of $300 million due in 29%, 30% margins is something it can do. so it was nice to see that bounce back from a q3, which was a little bit depressed. some of those items being viewed as temporary. it was nice to see that they were temporary in nature.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
and then on the capital deployment side on the external, obviously internal is the priority, but what does the acquisition side look like? how are you thinking about buybacks, anything like that? and what the prioritization looks like in '21 as well as what the opportunity side how realistic would be to move the needle on the acquisition side?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so from a priority standpoint, as you mentioned, organic generally generates best return at the lowest risk. and so we continue to organically invest in business. that being said, it's relatively capital light and doesn't demand a lot from our free cash -- of our cash flow from operations, which are quite strong. and so we are committed dividend payer, as you know, and dividend increaser. we would like to do share buybacks to offset dilution. but beyond that, we are really focused on the acquisition side.
and it's been a challenging 2020 and the m&a market. that being said, quite pleased that we are able to make progress with the fluortek, with vivamos and then the announced divesture as well. i will tell you that we are no different than the factories who are learning how to operate and produce products safely in this environment. the m&a community is also figuring out how to do deals in this environment. and so the market for m&a, i would tell you, our activity level is improving. and so we do remain active. we are very strategically focused based on the nbs next framework that naga has reviewed with you and where our growth opportunities are. so we are actively, i would say, mike, actively working to deploy capital through the acquisitions. and the pipeline is growing, as i would characterize it.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
appreciate the time and the color. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of christopher glynn with oppenheimer. christopher, your line is open.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i had a question about the -- just want to kind of go through high level, revisited the t&i momentum and review the compounding dynamics you have there. i am really curious about what you are driving in terms of succession pattern of new capabilities versus adoption of the iterations, the technology iterations you've introduced over the past year plus, and how those two factors converge toward this idea of 100% online testing capabilities.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, and i think it's a great question, chris, and it's an area that we are doing a lot of work in and it is an area that has a lot of promise for the company. just sort of if you step back a bit, if you think about our test and inspection business today, it has two major -- maybe three major product technologies. first is x-ray inspection. second one is acoustic imaging. third one is mechanical testing where we do some wire bond testing. we do optical inspection as well, but it is a smaller part of the company. so major product lines really be are x-ray imaging, think about acoustic imaging and then think about mechanical testing.
we fundamentally believe that the acoustic imaging and x-ray imaging are going to continue to grow for us as these devices get more complex and a couple of applications. so if you take a little bit one more step deeper into the product application. so if you think about a complex semiconductor package that is being manufactured. in the past, they were sampled and you ensured that the manufacturing process was stable and the product quality was really good. but as these devices get a lot more complex, now you're really interested in because these devices now have greater functionality, the risk of failure and the potential impact on the customer's experience is so high that these semiconductor packages are now getting inspected 100%. so that's sort of a need.
in terms of what is it that customers are looking for. the customers that are really looking for not only whether the bonds were made, but they are more looking for all the things that they need? is it in there? is it in the right size? so now all of a sudden, 3d metrology with x-ray inspection becomes a lot more greater and real and online rather than what was a good feature to have.
so as it translates to the company what it really means is, do we have the resolution, which we've always been really good at? do we have the speed? and do we have the lowest signal noise level, right? so those three things really now matter. as you think about the new acquisition we made, it was a technology acquisition that's cmos sensor, image sensor, and it provides all of those things. it provides a unique combination of higher speed, higher resolution and lower noise.
and so as we build out our inspection capability, you're going to find those and technologies that allow us to help our customers inspect things more in real time and at a faster rate, higher resolution and lower noise level. and we're going to add capability that allows us to do more 3d metrology than we have done in the past. so that's another one that's coming about.
and i would say the third is today our business is very focused on electronics. we do and we're beginning early stages of diversifying that exposure into adjacent end markets. and this vivamos acquisition allows us to now think about, is it possible for us to become a component supplier. it allows us to sell our image sensors and allows us to sell our tubes into end markets to other oems in end markets that we don't have a right to play in, but we have a right to be a component supplier because we have the best resolution in the market. we have the best lowest noise level on the market. we have highest speed. so it's an exciting time in the test and inspection business. it's an area where we will continue to invest in.
one that we did not talk about is some early days here is this defect classification is another big thing, right? i talked to you about image, speed, low noise, but also defect classification is important because that allows our customers again to identify whether it's a good chip package or a bad chip package. so a lot of details there, but hopefully that gives you how we're thinking about the business, where it is headed. it clearly has some good opportunities for organic growth and opportunities for us to acquire.
again, we'll be really thoughtful as always around what we acquire, how we acquire. we're going to be disciplined around acquiring things that makes nordson stronger. we're not going to acquire for growth sake, we're not going to acquire undifferentiated commoditized products in test and inspection. we're going to be very focused around what makes nordson strong, which is precision technologies, customer intimacy, really customer critical applications and how we add value and create value. and so that's where we're going to be focused on.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
that's great detail and great bang for the buck on the question. thanks. just a little housekeeping to close-up. d&a and bias on working capital through the cash flow statement for fiscal '21, any comment there, joe?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so quite pleased with our progress on working capital liquidation there in 2020, particularly the strength in q4. we improved, i would say, our efficiency around the ar side. and so when you look at the cash flow statement, you'll see it was on the ar and it's not just selling 3% or 5% less than we did in q4, i should say. it was really improving the dsi. as we implement nbs next and see that rollout, i think going forward, there's an opportunity on the inventory side. so really anxious as we go into 2021 to continue to focus on the cash flow, and do feel that there's some opportunities from an inventory efficiency side there.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
thanks. do you have a d&a figure for fiscal '21?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
d&a, i don't have a figure yet, it's going to depend on the timing of this [indecipherable] or i should say, the screw and barrel divestiture.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
okay, thanks.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

operator
your final question comes from the line of chris dankert with longbow research. chris, your line is open.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for fitting me in here. ran over this quickly, but just want to make sure i'm understanding the dynamic when we're looking at the ats business specifically, as you characterize medical stable, test and inspection up double-digits, high singles, that really does kind of give the sense that dispense was extremely weak in the quarter kind of despite some of the other strength going on in pcbs and semis. am i thinking about that, right? and i guess, just what was the key driver of the weakness in the quarter on that core dispense business and advanced technology?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think it's a good question, chris. our dispense business, as you think about it, benefited in the last decade from this mobile revolution, this incredible investment on mobile revolution. and so we are benefiting from some projects that are related to semiconductor in that business, certainly benefiting from some projects in some newer features, but not to the same extent as we've benefited in the past. so you had a competition there for that business that we're working our way through.
in general, our expectation for that business is as this competitions get worked out, what you're going to find is, it's going to be a nice 2% to 3% grower. it's not going to be the same kind of grower that it was, but the company was very thoughtful in diversifying into test and inspection. and so test and inspection, all of a sudden, is a really nice growth engine for us in the semiconductor side, and we'll benefit from it. and hopefully, that gives you how we're thinking about it internally.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
that's fair. that's fair. thanks, naga. and then i guess, just lastly from me. when we look back at the other half the business, dispensing i guess the coatings business versus hot melt, my assumption is that coatings is down pretty substantially, even really driving the weakness in the fourth quarter here and hot melt was much more stable. is that correct? again, just kind of thoughts going forward.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yes, yes. i think -- but you want to remember our coatings business was one of those businesses that had order substantial amount of orders slipped from third quarter of '19 to fourth quarter of '19. so if you think about fourth quarter by itself, yes, the coatings business had a significant headwind. but if you look at it from second half perspective for the coatings business, it was about mid-teens. still pretty high and was essentially one of the things. so there is a comp issue and there is an industrial exposure issue. and you're right about being in a much better place.
joe, do you want to add some color to it?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i will just add one thing. your two questions there, the fluid dispense within ats and then the ics business within ips -- sorry, sequentially, we are seeing some nice improvements there. those are the businesses that have the heavier industrial exposure. and so when you talk about naga's comments as we went through the back half of '20, we saw that steady improvement in order rate. so while it's down year-over-year, from a trend standpoint, those businesses are seeing some improvements sequentially.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
got it. that's all very helpful color. thanks so much guys, and best of luck in the '21 here.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the nordson corporation first quarter fiscal year 2021 conference call.. [operator instructions].
i would now like to hand the conference over to lara mahoney, thank you. please go ahead.
lara mahoney -- vice president, investor relations & corporate communications
thank you. good morning. this is lara mahoney, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. i am here with sundaram nagarajan, our president and ceo and joseph kelley, executive vice president and cfo. we welcome you to our conference call today, tuesday, february 23, 2021, to report nordson's fiscal 2021 first quarter results.
you can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at www.nordson.com/investor. this conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 14 days. there will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until tuesday, march 2nd.
during this conference call, references to non-gaap financial metrics will be made. a complete reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable gaap metric was provided in the press release issued yesterday.
before we begin, please refer to slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon nordson's current expectation. these statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission that could cause actual results to differ.
moving to today's agenda on slide 3. naga will discuss first quarter highlights. he will then turn the call over to joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the 2 business segment. joe also will talk about the balance sheet and cash flow. naga will conclude with high level commentary about our enterprise performance as well as our fiscal 2021 full-year guidance. we will then be happy to take your questions. with that, i'll turn to slide 4 and hand the call over to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining nordson's fiscal 2021 first quarter conference call. nordson was well positioned as we entered fiscal 2021. our covid-19 safety measures and protocols have ensured we continue to operate safely in this environment. this has allowed us to be agile and responsive to the needs of our customers who serve a very diverse set of end markets including consumer non-durable, medical, electronics and general industrial. during 2020, we remained invested in what makes nordson strong, the direct sales model and our innovative precision technology portfolio. additionally, we were successful in advancing several aspects of our long-term growth strategy. using the nbs next growth framework, our employees have been investing their resources in our best opportunities for profitable growth. while this remains a dynamic macroeconomic environment, our team has delivered a very solid first quarter on both the top and bottom line. it is noteworthy that our first quarter sales and profits are about both fiscal ' 20 and fiscal 2019 comparisons. in particular, our industrial precision solutions team delivered strong year-over-year growth benefiting from improvements in consumer non-durable and industrial end markets. they also achieved profit margin expansion as volume leverage, improved sales mix, and manufacturing efficiency gains all combined within the quarter. in the advanced technology solutions segment, our test and inspection product lines continue to grow. advancements in technology are causing electronics customers to shift from sampling to 100% inspection and we are benefiting from this trend. and our medical fluid components product line delivered double-digit organic growth, largely driven by biopharmaceutical application such as tamper proof packaging for vaccine delivery.
as the first quarter progressed, we were encouraged by the order entry momentum that we are starting to see in the product lines serving the broader medical and electronics end markets. we are particularly pleased to see the profit margin expansion ats delivered on modest growth as the strategic actions taken throughout 2020 to right-size the cost structure of several businesses within this segment delivered the desired results. i will speak more about the business in a few moments, but first, i'll turn the call over to joe to provide a more detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, naga and good morning to everyone. on slide number 5, you see first quarter 2021 sales were $527 million, an increase of 6% over prior year's first quarter sales of $495 million. the increase was primarily related to organic volume and favorable currency with additional benefits from the fluortek and vivamos acquisitions. the organic growth was driven by strength in consumer non-durable and industrial end markets, plus particular strength in the asia region. gross profit totaled $290 million or 55% of sales in the quarter compared to $263 million or 53% of sales in the prior year. this 190 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by the combination of volume leverage, improved sales mix, and benefits from structural cost reduction measures taken in fiscal 2020. it is noteworthy that 55% is the highest quarterly gross margin since the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2018.
operating profit in the quarter was $109 million or 21% of sales, a 39% increase from the prior year adjusted operating profit of $78 million. it is here in the operating profit growth rate that you see additional benefits from the fiscal 2020 cost reduction efforts as sg&a decreased 4% from the prior year first quarter level of $188 million. ebitda for the quarter was $135 million or 26% of sales which is 26% higher than the prior year ebitda of $107 million. looking at non-operating expense, net interest expense decreased $3 million or 28% from the prior-year level associated with reduced debt levels and the lower effective borrowing rate. other expenses increased $2 million largely driven by currency translation losses associated with the weakening of the us dollar. tax expense in the quarter totaled $20 million or an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter. net income in the quarter increased year-over-year 49% to $78 million or a $1.32 per share. this significant growth is reflective of a 6% increase in sales as well as benefits from cost-control measures and efficiencies driven by the nbs next growth framework. additionally, the first quarter of 2020 included a pre-pandemic cost structure and therefore profitability was lower.
now, let's turn to slide 6 and 7 to review the first quarter 2021 segment performance. industrial precision solutions sales of $288 million increased 9% compared to the prior year first quarter. the organic volume increase of 6% was driven by strong demand and flexible packaging and nonwovens product lines, as well as industrial end markets. a strengthening euro and rmb also contributed to 3% in currency benefits during the quarter. operating profit in the segment was $83 million or 29% of sales compared to $57 million of adjusted operating profit in the prior year period. this 47% percent profit growth was driven by sales volume leverage, favorable sales mix, improved manufacturing efficiency and lower year-over-year sg&a including reduced travel expense. advanced technology solutions sales of $238 million increased approximately 3% compared to the prior year first quarter. this change included an increase of approximately 2% related to acquisitions as well as currency gains of 2%. these benefits were offset by a decrease in organic sales volume of 1%. the lower organic sales volume was a mixture of increased demand for test and inspection, medical fluid component, and fluid dispense product lines offset by continued softness in the medical interventional solutions and certain electronic dispense application. it is particularly encouraging to see the return to growth in our fluid dispense product lines serving industrial and automotive end markets.
first quarter 2021 operating profit for the segment was $47 million or 20% percent of sales. this increase of 450 basis points over prior year adjusted operating margin of $35 million or 15% of sales was driven by favorable sales mix and the realization of benefits from cost control measures taken in fiscal 2020.
finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on page 8. we again end the quarter with a very strong balance sheet and significant available borrowing capacity. cash totaled $226 million and net debt was $794 million, ending the quarter with a 1.3 times leverage ratio based on trailing 12 months ebitda. free cash flow in the quarter was strong at $135 million, a 32% increase above the prior year free cash flow for a conversion rate on net income of 175%. higher net income and working capital liquidation contributed favorably to the free cash flow in the quarter.
i will now turn the call back to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, joe. let's turn to slide 9.
first, i want to thank the team for delivering a very strong first quarter. over the past 2 months, joe and i have been actively engaged in business reviews and virtual facility tours around the world. i'm very excited about the energy within our divisions and the steady deployment of the nbs next growth framework whether that is in how teams are organizing data to fuel decision making or the prioritization of best products in the manufacturing processes. we're also seeing the strategic analysis of product lines to identify the best growth opportunities and filling the sales funnel with these targeted accounts. one tangible results from the strategic discipline element of nbs next was seen on february 1, 2021 as we successfully closed the divestiture of our screws and barrels product line. our decision to divest this product line was based on critical insights gained from the nbs next data driven segmentation approach. while this business is a respected leader in the plastics industry, it did not fit nordson's profitable growth objectives. by divesting this business, we will focus our resources on growing more profitable product lines that will deliver on our long-term objectives. we believe our remaining pps division as the right degree of differentiation and related technical competitive advantages to deliver over time nordson like growth and returns.
i would like to take a moment to recognize recent changes to our board of directors. at the end of november, we welcome dr. john deford, the executive vice president and chief technology officer of becton dickinson and company and jennifer parmentier, vice president and president of the motion systems group of parker hannifin to our board of directors. john's technical and regulatory experience in the medical device end market will enrich the strategic perspective of our board as we continue to grow in this attractive market. jenny brings strong operational, industrial, and m&a experience to the board, which will be important as we continue to deploy our nbs next growth framework. john and jenny's appointments follow the retirement joe keithley, randy carson, and lee banks. i would like to thank joe, randy, and lee for their many insights and contributions throughout their time on the board. our board now stands at 9 directors, 56% of whom are diverse, the average tenure is now 7 years. i would also like to remind you of our upcoming virtual investor day, the morning of march 30th. we will share more about the ongoing deployment of nbs next as well as our long-term strategic priorities and financial goals. we will also use this time to give investors a better understanding of our strong competitive advantage differentiated product portfolio and diversified end markets and growth drivers. please visit our website to register.
now, for the outlook on slide 10. as we exit the fiscal first quarter, backlog was approximately $495 million, an increase of 7% compared to the same period a year ago. trailing 12 week order entry is above prior year levels across the majority of our product lines and geographic regions. these very positive indicators suggest continued year-over-year sales growth despite the divestiture of the screw and barrels product line. for full year fiscal 2021, we expect sales growth to be approximately 4% to 6% over fiscal year 2020. excluding the 3% headwind from the revenue the divested screws and barrels product line in the prior year, our forecasted full-year sales growth would be approximately 7% to 9% our forecasted sales growth combined with strategic actions taken around efficiency and cost this forecast is to deliver earnings in the range of $6.30 to $6.70 per diluted share. the midpoint of this guidance reflects 19% earnings growth compared to prior year. while it remains a dynamic environment and business conditions are changing frequently as the world responds to the challenges of covid-19 virus and its variants, we are confident in the diversity of our end markets and the strength of our backlog. nordson is well positioned to deliver on the needs of our customers.
as always, i want to thank our customers, employees, and shareholders for your continued support. with that, we will pause and take your questions.

[operator instructions] your first question is from saree boroditsky with jefferies. your line is open.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. so, sales guidance [phonetic] implies 5% growth for the remainder of the year, which is slightly below 1 quarter despite having some easier comparables, so could you just talk about if there is anything that you're seeing in the market to make more cautious on improving growth rates.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
joe, you want to take them.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so when you think about our sales guidance saree for the remainder of the year, you have to consider that we have the divestiture of the screw and barrel business. so excluding the divestiture of the screw and barrel business, it suggests a 7% to 9% growth rate when you look at our guidance. now, i will remind you that is comparable to our q1 growth rate excluding the screw and barrels business which was over 7% and entering the q2 our backlog is approximately $500 million, which is approximately 7% above when we entered q2 last year. now a little bit further color we mentioned q1 was strong, particularly in asia. when you look at the timing of chinese new year, it is important to understand that chinese new year fell into q1 in the prior year whereas this year it falls into q2. so that will be a little bit of a headwind in q2. when you look at our guidance, the range from an incremental margin standpoint, it would suggest that the remainder of fiscal '21 would be in the incremental margins from the mid-40s to about 55% that is lower incremental margin than the 97% that we delivered in q1, but when you think about it going forward in '21 there is a couple of issues that make the comparisons more challenging. one is we started taking cost out in 2020 throughout the year and so from a cost structure standpoint, the q1 was a much easier comparison than q2 and q3 as we took those actions throughout the year last year. the other issue i would tell you is incentive comp, which naturally behaves variable and last year, particularly in q2, the incentive comp, our sg&a included a reversal of the long-term incentive comp that had been accrued, so that'll be a particular headwind in q1 -- i'm sorry in q2 to the incremental margins. and then the other thing, as volumes continue to recover, travel expense should come back as we continue to be invested in our direct sales model and so that will near closer to historical levels. so these headwinds, i would tell you going forward is what has the incremental margins dropping from the 97, we just saw in q1, down to about the mid '40s to 55 is what the guidance would suggest and so these headwinds are being offset clearly by the divestiture of the screw and barrel business, which will improve margins and the continued benefits as we deploy nbs next throughout the organization.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. that's a lot of great color. and then more of a high-level question, there's been a lot of semiconductor capacity announcements out there. can you talk about how you could benefit from this expansion activity and you've seen any of this flow through your order rates. thank you.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. saree that's a great question. as we have talked about semiconductor devices and the opportunities for nordson, this is an area of particular strength for the company. clearly we see advantages for us in the test and inspection, as well as our dispense business. what you find is that are 2 things going on here, with semiconductor device demand increases, you're going to get capacity additions. those capacity additions will take the form of both dispense product lines as well as test and inspection product lines, but in the shorter term, you're going to find more test and inspection because our customers, it takes a little bit of time to bring on new capacity, but what they are really spending a lot of time is using test and inspection to improve yields that will help them meet some of the accelerating demand. so very excited about this, this is a great opportunity for the company, well positioned to win here ourselves. if you have any additional questions, i would be happy to answer.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
i guess one more then, you talked about renewed growth in the auto end market, could you just talk about where you're seeing that space and how nordson can benefit from increase in capex and facilities for evs and thank you.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. on the ev side, clearly we're, this is an emerging market for us and an emerging opportunity where we find the greatest opportunities are in the battery manufacturing. so you could think about batteries that put together, many different ways. one of the ways, as you know you're combining multiple [phonetic]cells, so we have a lot of opportunity in manufacturing of the battery, that is one way. the second is that you could think about our test and inspection. test and inspection business definitely benefits from power electronic components like igbts which are increasing demand, becoming more complex and hence we have an opportunity here both to benefit in battery as well as in electronic components.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
that is great color. thanks for taking my questions today.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer

your next question is from matt summerville with d.a. davidson. your line is open.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
thanks. couple of questions. maybe just back to test and inspection. now, i guess you were to use a baseball analogy in terms of how much in line testing is being performed and how much runway is in front of that business, what do you, i mean, would you say we're in with what you're seeing in t&i right now.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
t&i 100% inspection is early in it, so you see that a lot in auto electronics, you're beginning to see some of that in semiconductor, but clearly early in it.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
and then just maybe one on corporate expense, in the fiscal first quarter, i think it was some $8 million above the prior year, that seemed unusually high. can you talk about what drove that variance and what sort of quarterly run rate we should be utilizing going forward. thank you.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
hey, joe. you want to take that.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. the increase, when you look year-over-year as i mentioned in some of my comment is from incentive comp and so while that was a tailwind last year, it's a headwind this year, and so from a year-over-year standpoint, that's what you see in the drive in some of the corporate expense increase when you think about it from a full-year run rate historically that fluctuate between $50 million on an annualized basis and call it $65 million depending on performance.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
got it. thank you.

your next question is from allison poliniak-cusic with wells fargo. your line is open.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi guys, good morning.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
just going back to the semi challenges that are happening right now. i know you talked specifically to that market, but are you hearing or any sort of project delays related to maybe your other electronics end market auto comes to mind just given some of the plant closures that have been happening lately. any color there.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure, allison. no, we have not really heard a lot in terms of, if you remember we are more involved in setting up the line and in -- in platform launches. we are not really in the direct production line, which is sort of where you are seeing some of the delays. so no, we do not anticipate any delays, have not noticed, but what we are seeing is pickup in expectations from specifically auto electronic customers who are looking to the ramp up capacity by increasing yield and so you see that in test and inspection growth.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that's helpful. and then just looking at leverage -- obviously a very healthy range for you. as we're sort of hopefully getting out of this covid -- the covid
challenges, any thoughts or changes to how, what you would view as an optimal leverage range for nordson going forward here.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
joe?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so we ended the quarter at approximately 1.3 times leverage. we continue to be very comfortable at leverage ratios higher than that. and when you think about 2 times to 3 times leverage, we would be comfortable, we have the capacity to go up based on our current debt structure to 3.75 times. but as we look at it and look at the opportunities, we do continue to prioritize m&a and would be looking to take the leverage ratio up closer to the 2 to 2.5 range to support.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great, thank you. i'll pass it along.
operator
your next question is from chris dankert with longbow research. your line is open.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. i guess joe, definitely appreciate the comments around incremental and how guidance moves forward from here, but i guess to dig in a little bit on an ips specifically 1q typically the low watermark for ips margin 29% is quite impressive i guess, is that level of margin execution repeatable, do we build from here as the rest of the year, is flat, good performance, if any, if you could put that 29% margin number in context that would be really helpful.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, part of what we see going on here is this acceleration of demand in q1, i think makes some of our normal seasonality a little bit in question, perhaps this acceleration overrides the normal seasonality we would see throughout the year. but specifically related to that 29%, they had a very, very favorable mix, particularly parts volumes were up and there was nice leverage going on, it was in that business, where we did take some cost out. if you recall the cost action there in q4, which was delivering benefits here in q1 to cost structure. but when you think about that segment going forward, the divestiture of the screw and barrel business will provide further margin improvements to that. so when you think about it going forward the margins there should expand off of this what you referenced as a very high watermark here in q1.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
got it. and not to press my luck too much here, but i guess, are you willing to break out what the impact of mix was on the quarter.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i would not, i mean you referenced of 29% was a very high watermark, we haven't seen that since back in 2019. and so we're pleased with the profitability levels back there at this lower range. a lot of it is coming from the improvement in the mix within the business. so if you think about nbs next and as we focus on our most profitable opportunities, really that has allowed us not just to take cost out, but also to drive an improvement in the sales mix. and so that's what you see in that 29%.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
got it. i got it.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
chris, one more of that i would add is that if you think about the volume, the volume leverage in this business is really good and so we had a pretty strong volume growth that helped us deliver some pretty nice incrementals, so you're, you've got an accelerated recovery that is helping us. and as you go into the out quarters that volume is going to come down a bit, but we're comfortable with the current margin rates. but i think it's important to remember the volume play here as well.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
got it, yeah., thank you for that color. really appreciate it. and i guess one last one from me what is the fx benefit assumed in guidance, when historically fx swings can be fairly significant, just any comment on fx and kind of what you're baking in here to be great yeah.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, fx in the quarter proved to be more favorable than we had originally anticipated. and so for our forecast we are assuming the current exchange rates maintained throughout the remainder of the year. and so that had or that benefit should continue, it starts to moderate a little bit on a year-over-year basis in q4.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
but i should still be and not to pin it down but about 2% to 3% benefit for the full year at current rates, correct.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you are correct.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
got it. thanks so much. yeah.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

your next question is from christopher glynn with oppenheimer. your line is open.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
thank you, good morning guys.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
i was curious. couple of questions on ips, wondering if any markets production processes that you serve are currently showing any nice shift to adhesive centeric assembly from stitch or fasteners.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
chris, couple of things. first and foremost the adhesive business is pretty strong, one of the areas that we are beginning to see some really nice pick up is in electric vehicles and in battery manufacturing, it is an area that we continue to benefit from. ongoing automation across a wide variety of application is also beneficial to this business. so, think about adhesive dispensing allowing our customers to automate their manufacturing processes so we see a lot of benefit there, not any particular one end market than the other, but i would say a broad set of end markets, clearly consumer electronics, interestingly enough, as you have some wearables and other new consumer opportunities. so if you think about our adhesive business really is dependent -- it has grown mainly through new applications at big lever and that is pretty strong and we continue to benefit from automation, so the 2 things i would tell you on a big driver would be battery and number 2, automation.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
okay, thank you for that. and wondering relative to the 2 segments within your organic outlook. do you see ats kind of following up so where ips started the year and kind of coupling the type of organic growth we expect for the balance of the year.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, what we are really, let me give you some end market trend. and then, joe, can add some color about how we are thinking about the actual growth rates. yes, what we expect is in the back half. there are 2 things here. one is, if you know, our medical business as covid eases and as elective surgeries come back, we said, we expect our medical business to get back to the high-single digit rates in the back half of the year. so that's one big driver for us. second is you begin to see some very strong electronic orders in our business today, that will show up in the second half as a growth driver for us. in terms -- so those 2 will certainly help -- help our ats business. one thing that we have not talked about is that our medical fluid component business, which is primarily driven biopharma applications, has a solid growth in the quarter, we expect that to continue that continued strength in the out quarters. it's a big -- it's a small business today, but we are very excited about this opportunity. this is really because of all of the single-use components.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
sounds great. thanks. just a last one if i can sneak it in. the fx impact on the top line, does that still sort of drop-through as a 2 to 3 times multiplier to the earnings impact.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so the fx to the bottom line our cost structure aligns i would say with our sales structure quite well. in terms of the fx, euro denominated and gbp denominated cost as well as revenue, so that does flow through. there is a little bit of a margin expansion within our ips business when you see the dollar weaken against the euro and the gdp.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
thanks for the color.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question is from andrew buscaglia with berenberg. your line is open. morning, guys.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
i just want to touch on the ats. so i thought -- i thought we would do that turning to growth just given a difficult -- given that we're [phonetic]lapping some easier comps and yeah, your overall guidance really for organic growth is not quite that high if you exclude fx, it doesn't really include -- it doesn't really seem to be assuming much of a snap back in ats in the back half. i'm just trying to figure out, you just being conservative or just like it hasn't quite grown. what do you say, can grow 2 to 3 times gdp in 3 years now. so what can or can you give some investors some confidence that is growth is coming or is it just conservatism.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so i guess when you think about the growth rate of 4% to 6% and going forward, it's important that excluding the divestiture again at 7% to 9%. and so if you think about fx, that would suggest 3 -- or sorry 4% to 6% organic in that range. so just -- so we're clearly i guess [speech overlap] components.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
and one of the things that i would add to is that on the ats side as covid eases our medical business today is primarily flat because covid declined -- covid related surgery decline putting a damper on our component business, but offset by very strong growth in biopharma ok. but as covid eases in the back half we do expect this business to get back to high single digits in the back half. so the -- so the ats, what we have baked in, is we are expecting medical to come back. we certainly on the electronic side, it is important for you to remember that broadly nordson plays in high-precision application. what we are really good at test and inspection is growing nicely for us. so that is baked in to our outlook as we have forecasted it today. test and inspection continues to grow and if you think about electronic dispense business, we are seeing some pretty nice order entry that is starting to grow in the second half. maybe level set here on the electronics dispense side of our business, if you think about our electronics dispense business, what we're really good at is high precision reliable dispense at very high speeds, that's what we are good at, and this has greater application across a broad category of electronic end markets, not specifically one particular product category like a smart phone or other things like that. what we are finding is that the demand is pretty high for this level of position driven by all of this digital acceleration that you're seeing driven by automotive electronics and so what we really like here is that we have a new team in place. that is looking -- that is using nbs next and looking at opportunities, clearly what we are seeing is that mobile phone manufacturing has matured, it has matured and hence these applications don't require that level of precision that is needed and so we've got a new team looking at, we're looking at this opportunity, but more focused around semiconductor package -- more focus on the digital acceleration across a broad spectrum of end markets and we are confident that this business gets back to mid single digits growth and you'll start to see some of that in the second half of the year. [speech overlap].
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
when you think about our growth rate organic of, let's call it 4% to 6%, don't forget that in 2020, our sales only dropped about 3% to 4%, so the drop-off from 19 wasn't as significant as others. so therefore the bounce back opportunity is not as significant.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yeah. and i think, yeah you sound like china had a good as expected, was pretty strong q2, it going to be a little dampened over there, but yeah, i guess, exiting the year in the second half presumably, all 3 regions china, europe and us yeah, it sounds like those. i'll have to be -- or what you're assuming those are growing in tandem exiting '21, just based on easy comps and the pandemic lifting. is there any other like regional i guess regional color you can provide, you know that would
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, andrew, i think kind of if anything, what i would tell you is that asia is strong today. europe is flat organically. we do expect that to change. us is starting to strengthen. but right now, it's slightly low in the first quarter but i wouldn't add anything more than what you've already captured.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst

your final question is from walter liptak with seaport. your line is open.
walter s. liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
hi, good morning guys.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
walter s. liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
i wanted to ask about the nbs next and can you maybe elaborate a little bit about the cost savings that you got benefited this quarter versus the benefits from nbs next, is it possible to differentiate one from the other.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
no, i mean, it's really not, because when you say on the cost savings that we referenced. i think at several points when you step back and think about our cost actions. it was all driven by the strategic discipline within our nbs next growth framework and so as we focus on the best growth opportunities we stayed invested in those opportunities so that we could capitalize on that and then where there weren't the best growth opportunities that is where we took action to rightsize i would say our cost footprint or the example of the screw and barrel divestiture -- improve our profitability there. so at the heart of it, walt, i would tell you the margin expansion when we referenced sales mix improvement within ips when we reference benefiting from the cost structure reduction actions all of that is rooted in the nbs next strategic discipline growth framework and so it's really when i look at it, when we look at the incremental margins of 97% we say that's a lot of nbs next delivering the benefit.
walter s. liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
okay. okay. and let me, let me try this way, as you look at your sg&a overall for the remainder of the year. is there like a dollar level or percentage of sales, so you can help us with, so we can, we can think about that -- the cost benefits and some of these costs coming back into nordson.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i guess let me just give a little color commentary specifically on costs. last year we had several actions that referenced incremental annualized cost savings some of them were 10 million, one was 5 million and some of those started at different points throughout 2020. and so those are hitting at the full, i would say, benefit run rate here in q1, so that you see that -- that should be maintained going forward. i will tell you also on the cost side, we are benefiting on a year-over-year basis of about $6 million for lower t&e expense as q1 last year did not have the pandemic cost structure of no travel, and so as that starts to come back going forward, there is a potential of another $6 million. i don't think it all come back right away, but as you think about it from this run rate, it is about 6 million on the t&e that we benefited in q1 so and the other thing i referenced is that q1 typically is our heavy sg&a quarter, if you look, last year and the prior year for different employee benefit reasons. and so that trend should continue as we go forward throughout 2021.
walter s. liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
okay, ok thanks for that color. and then maybe just the last one for me about, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, the vaccine packaging. i wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about that, is there a revenue size or these orders that came in last year, that, that shift is there more orders that will -- will benefit or come through sales and second quarter or second half.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
sure. you know, this is a really strong growth driver for us and one that we have been working on for some number of years, walter, and starting to show up in the marketplace right now. this is single use plastic components, which are used in the manufacture of biopharma and in this particular case vaccines as well and we saw some pretty strong growth in the quarter, we expect that growth to continue in the out quarters and maybe even further out. and the biggest reason we are able to have a sort of a flat medical revenue when compared to our customers being down 15% is mainly because of this biopharma growth driver. and so it is more of our single-use plastic components that are used in critical biopharma manufacturing steps.
walter s. liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
okay got it, all right, thank you.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the nordson corporation's second quarter fiscal 2021. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over lara mahoney.
lara mahoney -- vice president, investor relations & corporate communications
thank you. good morning. this is lara mahoney, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. i'm here with sundaram nagarajan, our president and ceo; and joseph kelly, executive vice president and cfo.
we welcome you to our conference call today, tuesday, may 25, 2021 to report nordson's fiscal 2021 second quarter results. you can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at www.nordson.com/investors. this conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 14-day. there will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until tuesday, june 1.
during this conference call, references to non-gaap financial metrics will be made. a complete reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable gaap metric was provided in the press release issued yesterday.
before we begin, please refer to slide 2 of our presentation where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon nordson's current expectations. these statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, as discussed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission, that could cause actual results to differ.
moving to today's agenda on slide 3. naga will discuss second quarter highlights. he will then turn the call over to joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the two business segments. joe also will talk about the balance sheet and cash flow. naga will conclude with high level commentary about our enterprise performance as well as our updated fiscal 2021 full year guidance. we will then be happy to take your questions.
with that, i'll turn to slide 4 and hand the call over to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining nordson's fiscal 2021 second quarter conference call. throughout fiscal 2020, we remain invested in what makes nordson strong; our direct sales model and innovative position technology portfolio. we also advanced our new nbs next growth framework, which ensures we focus our resources on the best opportunities for profitable growth. this strategy has positioned us well last year. and as the recovery continues to accelerate in 2021, it has put us in an excellent position to respond to our customers and deliver record sales, gross margin, operating profit and ebitda during the fiscal 2021 second quarter.
as per quarter progressed, end market demand accelerated faster and to a greater degree than we originally anticipated, particularly in medical, electronics and industrial end markets. nordson's dispense applications in the industrial precision solutions segment, benefited from the pickup in industrial end markets as well as a sustained demand for food and beverage packaging. in the advanced technology solutions segment, a data-centric economy where increasing demand for semiconductors and complex electronic devices drove the need for our test and inspection and fluid dispense products.
we have also started to see recovery in our medical intervention solution product lines as the out-patient surgeries are beginning to increase following the covid-19-related slowdown. our medical businesses continues to benefit from accelerated growth of single-use plastic fluid components for biopharmaceutical applications. i want to congratulate and thank the nordson global team for achieving this record second quarter. i'm also proud of our teams' dedication to meet this accelerating demand while maintaining covid-19 safety protocols and effectively managing supply chain and capacity constraints.
i'll speak more about the business in few moments, but first, i'll turn the call over to joe to provide more detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, naga, and good morning to everyone. on slide number 5, you see second quarter 2021 sales were $590 million, an increase of 11% over prior year's second quarter sales of $529 million. this double-digit growth is more than a bounce back. in fact, as naga noted, this is a quarterly record for the company, breaking the previous record established in q3 of 2017.
the sales increase was primarily related to 10% organic volume growth off of a relatively strong q2 2020 performance, favorable foreign currency and a net negative impact from acquisitions and divestitures. the benefits from the fluortek and vivamos acquisitions were more than offset by the negative headwind from the divestiture of the screws and barrels product line.
when excluding the divested product line in the prior year for comparability purposes, sales growth would have been 15% in the current year second quarter. robust growth in electronics and consumer non-durable end markets as well as strengthening medical and industrial end markets were the primary drivers of this performance. from a geographic perspective, growth was strong in all regions, except japan, which has been more heavily impacted by shutdowns related to the pandemic.
gross profit totaled $338 million or 57% of sales in the quarter compared to $290 million or 55% of sales in the prior year. this 260 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by the combination of improved sales mix, volume leverage and benefits from structural cost reduction measures taken in fiscal 2020. the divested screws and barrels product line at the beginning of the fiscal second quarter was a significant contributor to the improved sales mix. it is noteworthy that a gross margin of 57% is a new quarterly company record.
also records in the quarter were operating profit of $166 million or 28% of sales, a 33% increase from the prior year adjusted operating profit of $125 million, and ebitda of $192 million or 33% of sales, which is 26% higher than the prior year ebitda of $152 million. the incremental ebitda margins were 65% in the quarter. investors are starting to see the power of the nbs next growth framework as it drives double-digit organic sales volume growth, improved sales mix, enhances manufacturing efficiency resulting in strong profitable growth.
looking at non-operating expenses, net interest expense decreased $1 million or 17% from the prior year levels associated with reduced debt levels and a lower effective borrowing rate. other net expense increased $3 million, largely driven by currency translation gains in the prior year that did not repeat in the current year. tax expense totaled $32 million or an effective tax rate of 20% in the quarter. net income in the quarter increased year-over-year 35% to $124 million or $2.12 per share, yet another quarterly company record. this significant growth is reflective of volume leverage driven by the 11% increase in sales as well as benefits from cost control measures and improved efficiencies.
now let's turn to slide 6 and 7 to review the second quarter 2021 segment performance. industrial precision solutions sales of $299 million increased 6% compared to the prior year second quarter. the organic volume increase of 8% was driven by strong demand and flexible packaging and industrial coating product line. a strengthening euro and rmb also contributed to a 5% in currency benefit during the quarter. the divested screws and barrels product line was a negative 7% impact on the year-over-year sales growth. it's important to note that the segment sales are north of 2020 and 2019 levels when prior year balances are adjusted for the divested screws and barrels product line.
operating profit in the segment was $104 million or 35% of sales compared to $77 million of adjusted operating profit in the prior year period. this 36% profit growth was driven by sales volume leverage associated with the 8% organic growth, favorable sales mix, improved manufacturing efficiency and lower year-over-year sg&a, including reduced travel expense that we continue to experience through the second quarter.
moving now to advanced technology solutions. sales of $291 million increased approximately 18% compared to the prior year second quarter. this change included an organic increase of approximately 13% as well as increases of approximately 3% related to currency and 2% related to acquisitions. the increase in organic sales volume was driven by strong demand for test and inspection product lines serving electronics end market and fluid management product lines serving medical and industrial end markets. also, as we forecasted on the first quarter call, we started to see the electronic dispense applications contributed to growth late in the quarter.
second quarter 2021 operating profit for the segment was $77 million or 26% of sales. this increase of 30% over prior year operating margin of $59 million or 20% of sales was driven by sales volume leverage, favorable sales mix and the realization of benefits from cost control measures taken in fiscal 2020. it is encouraging to see the benefits of nbs next driving the top-line organic growth and delivering strong incremental profit margins in both of our operating segments.
finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on page 8. we again ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet and sufficient available borrowing capacity. cash totaled $133 million and net debt was $734 million, ending the quarter with a 1.2 times leverage ratio based on trailing 12-month ebitda. free cash flow in the quarter was strong at $94 million, and net income was 75% in the quarter, which was below normal levels, due primarily to a $50 million discretionary pension contribution. improvements in working capital efficiency contributed favorably in the quarter. the year-to-date free cash flow is north of a 100%.
i will now turn the call back to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, joe. let's turn to slide 9. again, thank you to the nordson team for delivering this outstanding performance in the quarter. we hosted an investor day on march 30 to detail our long-term plans for making a strong nordson even stronger. if you did not have a chance to participate in our investor day, the replay of the event is available on our website.
now i'd like to summarize a few highlights. first and foremost, we described the strong growth drivers enabling nordson's future profitable growth performance, including diverse end markets, new applications and emerging market. while our growth drivers are unique to each of our divisions, the diversity of our end markets and the high level of recurring revenue, made us resilient through fiscal 2020 and are strengthening in fiscal 2021 results.
at our investor day, we also reiterated our commitment to innovation, one of nordson's key competitive advantages. our customer intimate model gives us insight to the needs of our customers, and we develop our product roadmap as an enabler of their new technologies. in the presentation, we highlighted two of our newest products; the problue flex melter for packaging customers and the new vantage integrated dispense and automation system, which is the first fully integrated wafer handling system designed for the semiconductor industry. in both cases, these new products are advancing automation, reducing cost and accelerating productivity. both products contributed to record sales in the quarter.
to make a strong nordson even stronger, we also spoke to the new competencies that we are building, notably the nbs next growth framework. this data-driven framework is driving our decision making. we are already starting to see the benefits of our deployment of nbs next. last year, we announced structural cost reductions that were based on our strategic disciplined analysis. it also drove our decision to divest the screws and barrels product line at the beginning of the second quarter.
simultaneously, we approved new investments in our top opportunities such as funding new equipment for our loveland, colorado facility to grow our biopharmaceutical components and building a new facility in mexico to support the needs of our nordson medical interventional solution products. these decisions are strengthening both our top and bottom line. since been vaccinated, i have started to travel to our businesses. it is exciting to see the engagement of our teams deploying nbs next to make data-driven decisions on how to delight our best customers or invest in the most innovative technology projects or prioritize top products in manufacturing operations.
turning to slide 10. nbs next is a critical pillar of our new ascend strategy, which is designed to deliver top-tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. in addition to nbs next, the other inter-connected pillars of the ascend strategy are; owner mindset, nordson's entrepreneurial division-led organization and winning teams, nordson's talent strategy. it is also exciting to experience the progress we are making in each of these pillars. we now have all of our division leaders in place, and they are focused on building a deep and diverse bench of talent who will support our long-term growth.
the successful execution of the ascend strategy will help us achieve our long-term growth milestones of $3 billion in revenue and 30% ebitda. this target will be achieved through a combination of organic growth within each segment as well as the acceleration of acquisitions. clearly, the record second quarter and updated fiscal 2021 outlook demonstrate that we are off to a strong start toward achieving our long-term goals.
now let's turn to our updated fiscal 2021 outlook on slide 11. as we enter the fiscal third quarter, backlog is strong and trailing 12-week order entry is up double-digits above prior year levels across the majority of our product lines and geographic regions. for full year fiscal 2021, we expect sales growth to be approximately 8% to 10% over fiscal year 2020. excluding the 3% headwind from the revenue of the divested screws and barrels product line in the prior year, our forecasted full year sales growth would be approximately 11% to 13%. our forecasted sales growth combined with strategic actions taken around efficiency and cost is forecasted to deliver earnings in the range $7.20 to $7.50 per diluted share. the midpoint of this guidance reflects 34% earnings growth compared to prior year and a 25% increase over 2019 earnings.
our current financial results signify more than the benefits of the recovery. nordson wins because of the foundation of our precision technology focus, customer-centric model and diversified end markets. we are well positioned to benefit from the recovery, and our products remain a critical solution to our customers through the cycle ahead. additionally, our management team is fully engaged in advancing the implementation of the ascend strategy which will establish a growth framework, entrepreneurial organization and a deep diverse team to drive sustainable profitable growth. as always, i want to thank our customers, employees and shareholders for your continued support.
with that, we will pause and take your questions.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from the line of allison poliniak with wells fargo.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning. naga, we're hearing a lot about supply chain issues sort of impacting maybe some growth opportunities, particularly as we enter the back half. any thoughts there in terms of what you're seeing at this point?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, allison. from our standpoint, we've had some issues, but very limited around resin. from where we stand today, it is nearly non-material to our expectations in the back half of the year.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
perfect. and then i just want to go back to your comments on medical. obviously, you're seeing an improvement there, and you mentioned the single point-of-use on the consumable side. is your sense is that an inventory issue that people are replenishing inventories or is this sort of true demand kind of behind that what you're seeing today?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. in our single-use components, these are for biopharma applications, so think of vaccine, think of new biopharmaceuticals that are coming on the market. we truly see it is representative of the demand because this is a demand we have seen all through last year as well as this year. so we have very limited supply chain kind of restocking in this business. we sell mostly directly to our customers there.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. i'm just going to sneak one more in. any mix issues to be mindful of in the back half of the year for you?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
joe, you want to take that one?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think -- allison, good question. i do think that the mix was quite favorable when we looked at our q2 performance. but when we looked at the forecast for the remainder of the year, again, it's pretty much a broad-based demand environment that we see as it relates to geographies and as you see the volume organic growth in both segments. so i would tell you there is no mix issues to be aware of heading into the back half that we see at this time.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from the line of saree boroditsky with jefferies.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, and congratulations on the great quarter. you had really great margin performance in ips, could you just talk through if this is the right level to think about going forward given the divestiture? and how should we think about the benefit of lower travel that you mentioned?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
joe, will you take that?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i'll take that one, naga. when you look at our ips margins in the quarter and our nordson record level margins in the quarter, we did benefit clearly from the volume leverage. and then the improved sales mix, when you think about that, the divestiture of the screw and barrel business had a significant impact. i would tell you at the nordson level, that probably expands the margin to 150 to 200 basis points. and at the ips level, you're talking about 300 to 400 basis points can be attributed to the improved sales mix tied to the divestiture of the screws and barrels product line. and so even excluding that, there is nice margin performance.
when we think about going forward, i do think there is a component, as i mentioned in the script, where expense will start to ramp up a little bit in the second half. particularly if you think about our direct sales model with the travel and expense, t&e expense coming up, we'll begin to ramp a little bit more in the second half than we saw in the first half.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then with leverage now at 1.2 times, really below your target range, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the m&a market or how you're thinking about share buybacks?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so on the m&a market, i would tell you, we remained very active in looking at deals. i will tell you there is a feeling in the market that the number of deals coming across has continues to, i would say, increase as we work through post-pandemic. and so we remained very active. strategic discipline that we reviewed in our investor day is our primary filter. and then after we confirm strategic discipline, we put the financial criteria on and we remain financially disciplined.
so we are looking, as you know, for acquisition targets, primarily in the test and inspection in the medical space and we will continue to be active. so the volume, i would tell you, is picking up in terms of what it is we're looking at. as it relates to share buyback, we target to offset dilution. i will point out, saree, that we did contribute additional $50 million to our defined benefit pension plans and our u.s. funded status is north of 98% and we did pay down $150 million debt in the quarter.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks for taking the question.
operator
the next question comes from the line of connor lynagh with morgan stanley.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley & co. llc -- analyst
yeah, thanks. i was wondering if we could return to the supply chain conversation a little bit. so it sounds like availability is really not an issue for you. are you seeing component cost inflation that you need to address with price or is that also relatively muted?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. when you think about inflation as it relates to nordson, first of all, you have to think about our overall nordson cost structure. and i would tell you, the material cost is a relatively small component of our overall cost structure. so manufacturing conversion cost, fixed manufacturing cost and sg&a represents a larger component than the material cost itself. we do have procedures and processes in place to address material cost increases with price where and when appropriate. but i would tell you, connor, that the challenge is more on the labor cost potential inflation there or availability.
so when you think about the nbs next initiatives and investments that we've made in in-lining and streamlining the manufacturing process, this is really helping us mitigate some of those pressures on both inflation and availability of the labor cost on the manufacturing side. and where availability isn't a problem, we're able to expand our capacity to serve this 10% volume growth. so that's the pressure, i would tell you, we're seeing is more on the labor side than on the material cost inflation side.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley & co. llc -- analyst
okay. got it. and then maybe just sticking with the cost maybe, you called out the discretionary expenditure headwind as we move toward -- further toward reopening. could you maybe just give us an order of magnitude to think about? is that at a nordson level a 50 basis point, 100 basis point? how should we think about how significant that could be?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i would tell you, if you just look at the first half year-over-year, it's about probably a $5 million benefit in terms of travel and entertainment expense, particularly on our commercial sales force, direct sales model. so a portion of that's going to start to come back.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley & co. llc -- analyst
okay, understood. and maybe just to tie this together with some of the questions that others have been asking. i mean, it seems like based on the eps guidance that there is a certain degree of margin degradation, maybe some reversal of mix. is that the right way to think about the back half outlook? is that there could be some pressure on margin, but the top-line growth is strong?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so the top-line growth is strong. i think, as you're familiar, the mix in any given quarter could be favorable or unfavorable, and i do think in q2 we did see a favorable mix. and so as it goes forward, that may moderate a little bit. and then i would tell you on the cost structure side, the expense -- some of that expense should start to come back.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
joe, let me add something to this. connor, the best way to think about us is that our long-term incrementals on growth is 40% to 45%. we believe based [technical issue] guidance, we would still be north of that 40% to 45% incremental in the back half. so yes, there are some costs coming back, but still pretty solid performances what we are forecasting.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley & co. llc -- analyst
got it. i appreciate the color. i'll turn it back.
operator
the next question comes from the line of jeff hammond with keybanc capital markets.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
just on backlog, can you give us the backlog number and what that is up organically? i don't know if i missed that in the presentation.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. jeff, these are abnormal times coming out of the pandemic. and when we're looking at our customers' behavior, our backlog, our order entry, we're seeing differences now in the timing of delivery. and so i don't think our backlog is indicative of the next quarter sales. what i can tell you is our backlog and our order entry are up double-digits. and therefore, we have confidence in the guidance that we provided. but to give a backlog number right now would not be appropriate i think.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
so the idea is that you're getting significant orders, but they're longer turnaround than normal?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. we do see in particular businesses on the system side customers placing orders in advance. and so, therefore, with delivery times that go out actually into 2022, which is a little bit abnormal for our historical customer order patterns. so therefore, it's distorting that data point.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just -- maybe just to go back to ips margins, just is there a way to give what the underlying core incremental margins were in the quarter? and i'm just trying to understand like outside of screw and barrel, like how much mix drove it versus some of this temp cost and kind of how you think about that in the second half because those were pretty eye-popping?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so when you think about the ips business, in the quarter itself, i would tell you, the screw a barrel divestiture expanded margins roughly 300 to 400 basis points. so if we were 35% op, you can drop that down, which is still a very strong, north of 30% operating profit number for that business. and so the way to think about that is the power of the leverage on the 8% organic growth within that segment.
and so, as naga mentioned, very strong incremental margins in that business. some favorable mix on the consumer non-durable as it relates to packaging, some favorable mix also within our industrial coatings segment, and it's also in this business, the industrial coatings, where we took some actions last year to structurally reduce our cost late in q4. and so you see some of that benefit coming through as well.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just last one. you mentioned in advanced tech, the electronics precision dispense kind of picking up late in the quarter, maybe that's still lagging from a growth standpoint. but just talk about what you're seeing there from a forward kind of order quoting visibility? thanks.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
joe, let me take that one and then you could give some color. jeff, what we're beginning to see here is on the pcb side we are starting to pick up some pretty strong order patterns around surface treatment, our plasma surface systems -- surface treatment systems. late in the quarter, we also began to see our fluid dispense product lines in electronics beginning to contribute across a diverse set of the electronic supply chain. semiconductors certainly helping, pcb helping and complex electronic components also helping. so i would say, we feel pretty good about what we see in that business and expect it to contribute nicely in the quarters to come.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. thanks a lot.
operator
the next question comes from the line of mike halloran with baird.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
so on the medical side, maybe just some thoughts on elective versus non-elective, underlying trends that you're seeing today? and then how you think that inflection curve happens from here? obviously, such a nice improvement this quarter. is this kind of the right sustainable pace? and when do you think you're back to what a more normalized level would look like?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
well, when we would come to normalized levels, that is going to be difficult to predict, but let's talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the business right now. first and foremost, if you think about our biopharma side of the business where we have the fluid components, continues to be strong, has been strong, continues to be strong and mainly led by not only vaccine, but just the number of drugs that are getting manufactured and introduced from a biopharma perspective is just accelerating. we expect that part of the business continue to contribute in a nice way.
on the elective-selective surgery, what you're beginning to see is the covid slowdown is certainly benefiting and you're beginning to see elective surgeries or selective surgeries, in our case, starting to pick up. we saw some nice growth in the business in the quarter. we expect that the next two quarters look pretty good. and it's really difficult for us to say would we get back to high-single-digits, which is normally what we expect out of this business in end of this year, early next year, it's difficult to say. but that's kind of how we're thinking about is that our expectation for the second half for this business is still pretty good.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
and then maybe just a similar conversation in the industrial-facing end markets, underlying trajectory trend, any nuance that you're seeing within those pieces?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the industrial business is, as you can see, there is a certain amount of pent-up capex spending demand that we are certainly enjoying in the quarter. based on backlogs and order entries we see, we expect a pretty double-digit kind of growth is what implies in our guidance for the full year. what is difficult for us to again pinpoint is that when this gets to a normalized level, that is something difficult to predict right now. but based on what we can see, we feel really good about the second half having a pretty broad-based performance across number of -- across all of our core end markets and across all of our geographies.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
thanks, naga. appreciate it.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from the line of chris dankert with longbow research.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking the question. i guess, thinking about the strong semiconductor demand we saw in the quarter, can you comment about kind of the mix there? is this being more driven by strong product adoption of the t&i business or is this more customer expansion or combination of the two? just any comments there would be great.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, chris. we certainly benefit from our t&i business, which is having a really strong number of quarters and continues to benefit from this semi-investment and semi-growth. and also, the complexity of the semiconductors, complexity of electronic components as well, definitely benefiting the t&i business. but late in the quarter, we begin to see, as i indicated in the script, we're beginning to see contribution from our fluid dispense business as well. our surface treatment product lines have been really well. we're beginning to have some very good progress in our coating as well as dispense product lines as well.
and so in terms of where we participate broadly, i will tell you in the semiconductor space. we participate first in the surface cleaning side of it. second in the underfill in terms of packaging. in the past, a lot of this packaging happened post-wafer sliced and then packaging happened. but now, we are beginning to see packaging starting to move upfront and we are starting to participate there as well. so a pretty broad-based growth, chris. i wouldn't pinpoint that to just semiconductor or just one particular product.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
got it. got it. thanks for the color. and then -- and not to put too fine a point on it, but is it safe to assume t&i was up double-digits in the quarter though?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yes.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
okay, ok. and again, you called it out a little bit ago, very, very robust pcb demand and growth there. is this part of the beginning of some of the 5g cycle in your opinion or is this just -- it's really much more broad-based than that?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we have spent quite a bit of time in the past year or two on a shift in the strategy in electronics for us is to get to a place where we have broad set of applications across the electronic supply chain. and so what i would tell you is the growth that we are seeing, the forecasting that we're thinking about, is a broad-based demand rather than a specific particular product.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
understood. thanks so much, naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thank you, chris.
operator
the next question comes from the line of matt summerville with d.a. davidson.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
thanks. just a follow-up on the whole -- the test and inspection piece of the business. what sort of anticipated duration do you see, naga, in this cycle? what inning are we in? and do you expect that double-digit growth that you experienced in the second quarter to continue into the foreseeable future? what's the right way to kind of be thinking about that?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say a typical semi-cycle is three to five years depending on what happens. and we would say we are probably in year one or little bit past year one. and so the best way to think about it is, early in the cycle, certainly, the growth is much more magnified than it is in the back half of the cycle. so that's -- it's very difficult to sort of pinpoint how many more quarters or year we have on this double-digit kind of growth. but over the cycle, the best way to think about our end market opportunity is 4% to 5%, which is kind of what we indicated in our investor day. we clearly are in the first leg of the growth is maybe the best way to think about it, matt. hopefully that helps you?
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
thanks. and then just one last one on pricing. with the strength in demand that you're seeing pretty much across the board in your business, double-digit growth in orders and backlog. are you able to be more of a price-taker? are you positioned to be so as we think about this going forward given the demand environment you're experiencing?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
let me maybe make one comment, and then, joe, you could add a little bit more detail to it that would be very helpful. think about the gross margin of the company. pretty -- it's pretty strong, right? 55% plus, and that is indicative of the value we create for our customers. in some of our product lines we have a regular price increase once a year to sort of take into account inflation and things like that, but we really need to be thoughtful. we create value and we get paid for it. and should inflation become an issue, we will certainly have the opportunity to cover it. but in general, we feel good about where we are.
joe, you want to add any more color to it?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. again, i would just say that we feel very good about our gross margins, a record 57% gross margin. we have processes in place to monitor raw material cost increase inflation and processes to maintain that margin. but i would tell you the best opportunity is to support this volume growth and to meet the customers' needs as opposed to take this opportunity to raise price because we're already running at very nice incremental margins, as naga mentioned, as we look at the back half and this double-digit organic growth. as we think about it, we are managing the incremental margins to be attractive, and that's the best opportunity to support the organic growth and our customers.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
and maybe one more to think about this, just to reiterate nordson's position. typically, nordson is the lowest cost, but a very critical component. really small part of our customers' total cost deck, right? so our components are smaller part of the company -- customers' total cost deck. and so should we need to raise prices, we are able to provide that.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
got it. thank you, guys.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from the line of christopher glynn with oppenheimer.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
thanks. good morning, all. covered a lot of ground so far, i did want to follow-up on industrial demand patterns. you've seen any demand transitions within industrial recovery at this stage? and what i mean by that is, typically, early on, you just see a lot of production-oriented oem activity and then more maybe mid-cycle-type capital improvements driven by different types of capacity coming online. just wondering any light you could shed on how that's evolving?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. from what we can see, chris, today is mostly what we're seeing is a demand pickup based on pent-up capex spending. and we've not seen significant capacity yet as yet.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
okay, thanks.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
the next question comes from the line of andrew buscaglia with berenberg.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. i know you got a lot of questions on these, the supply chain and navigating that. i think, i was hoping you could explain one thing in that, the headlines every day are these component shortages. i'm just wondering what the nature of your business and that you're able to kind of sidestep that? and correct me if i'm wrong, your business test and inspect various components and with coatings on other component. i just don't -- i don't quite understand, i guess, we would not have expected a quarter in which that have performed so well. so just any there.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me maybe give you some overall point of view and joe can add a little bit more color to it at the end with some data. think about nordson from who we are, right? what we are is, we are an assembler of differentiated components to create value for our customers in specific end markets for critical applications. so what that really is, is that we are a assembler of value-added components. and what that really means is that, materials as a part of our total cost structure is fairly small. so that's one thing to keep in mind.
the second is that, we do manufacture our products in country, in region in most of the cases. so we really don't run into a lot of supply chain issues that way. so if you put those two things in perspective, i'm not saying we don't have any problems at all, we've had one or two issues here and there, but they're really not material is kind of what we're saying.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
they're just so niche, we can't look at it -- you can't look at the broad -- the broader headlines. you're kind of too narrowly focused that really doesn't impact your teams?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and we're not a big processor of materials either, right? yes, we have some consumable business, but we're not a big resin converter to contract manufacturing of injection-molded parts, that's not who we are, right?
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yeah. okay. and then maybe, naga, you put out that long-term target of 30% ebitda margin. but it looks like you're -- i mean, this year you're going to brush close to that. i mean, i think you'd be into the 29, 529 based on the implied guidance. so i guess is the way to look at that long-term guidance more or like three or should we be looking at year-over-year ebitda growth from like a dollar perspective or i guess -- or are you just being really conservative with being able to achieve 30% long-term because they're practically there after this year?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
joe can walk you through some of our thinking. but really, it is a long-term target. and what you're seeing now is only the impact of our organic growth this year. so -- and our long-term guidance includes organic growth and a dilution from acquisitions. so that is two things. we don't believe this is a conservative estimate. this is through the cycle. over the five years, this is what we expect we will be.
joe, would you add a little bit more color to that please?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, i would just add, andrew, that when you think about it, the organic growth has to drive margin expansion north of the 30% ebitda line such that when that $500 million of acquired revenue comes in at a 20% ebitda, the net dilution is down to the targeted 30%. so our 30% is still an appropriate goal. it just -- it includes the dilution of $500 million worth of acquisitions over the next five years at a 20% ebitda.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
another way to think about is that for every dollar of growth in our expectations within the businesses and how -- where we are headed is that we're going to have 40% to 45% incremental. that's really what we're focused around. and so on a yearly basis, that's how we are thinking about it. and if you project that out over time with acquisitions, that's sort of how we come to this 30% ebitda target.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay. thank you, guys.
operator
the final question comes from the line of walt liptak with seaport global research.
walter s. liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. good quarter.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. thank you.
walter s. liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
i want to follow-up on a couple of things. when you were talking about the backlog earlier, you were saying that there were some systems that were booking out 2022. i wonder if you can give us some idea of which segments those might be in and why they were running so low -- so long? is it just timing of when these things are supposed to get it sold or is there something else going on?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. walt, i would just tell you, our understanding is that it's into the macroeconomic environment where people are hearing what's been discussed on this phone call as it relates to supply chain challenges. and so some of our customers are, i think, responding back and placing orders in advance of when they would typically place orders. so they're not building orders or building inventory, they're just placing their orders with us earlier than they used to. and so that's what we view is going on and why we're choosing not to disclose the backlog number at this time.
walter s. liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
okay, i understand. can you give us some color though about which segment or is it kind of across the board where customers are just concerned about future delays, so they're sort of pre-placing these orders?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would tell you, we see it a little bit in both of our segments. and so it's not one segment specific. and it's generally tied to those products that typically have a longer lead time naturally that they're calling in and ordering in advance of those, and that's why i made the comment about the systems. as it relates to the parts business, you know, many of those it's booked and shipped within the week. and so there we don't have that built up backlog.
walter s. liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
okay, great. and as you're pulling out the gross margin that's absolutely great, and i understand that early in the cycle there are some things that are abnormal. but as we're looking at the back half of the year, is this 57% a reasonable run rate given what you're seeing from volume levels and mix?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think that 57%, i would tell you, is a new high watermark. but i do think that a lot of what drove it is sustainable. and when you think about the impact on the divestiture and improved mix, the divestiture of screw and barrel business, you think about the benefits of the cost structure actions that we took last year and at these increased demand levels, this is the type of leverage you would expect with strong incremental margins. and so, you know, on any given quarter that can fluctuate up or down 100 to 200 basis point based on mix. but i think this is reflective of the profitability of this business at these sales levels.
walter s. liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
okay, great. and then maybe a last one from me is just, i think it was in naga's comments, you made a comment early on that the majority of the products are growing double-digits and some of those elective surgery, medical are not growing double-digits. so i wonder if you could talk about what else is not growing double-digits? and if you think you can get a together recovery in those in the back half of the year?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i guess, let me take a stab at it and then naga can add some more color. but when you look at a geographic split, walt, i would tell you the one that was not growing double-digits in the quarter organically was japan. there, our business experienced -- in that region that experienced significant shutdowns due to the pandemic. and so we did deliver double-digit organic growth in japan. but i think the comment then, going back to your question on the electronics and the medical, i think if you look at our performance over the last several quarters, the medical was driven by the biopharma in the single fluid component, single-use application.
and what we started to see late in the quarter was the growth of the interventional solutions, which is encouraging because that's the one that's more closely tied to elective procedures or selective procedures. and so it was encouraging to see that come back. on the electronic space, t&i had been the strong performer, and it was encouraging to see the electronics dispense portion of that business come back and contribute to growth in the later part of q2. and so that was the comment there.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
walt, one other thing i would add is that if you compare the growth rate year-over-year, remember, last year, nordson's growth performance or declines were not as deep as -- we were down about 4%. so double-digit growth we are seeing is on path of what was not a too bad of a decline last year given sort of the broader environment.
walter s. liptak -- seaport global -- analyst
okay. got it. all right. thank you very much, guys.
operator
i will now turn the call back over to naga for closing remarks.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thank you. i want to reiterate that we are well positioned to benefit from the accelerating recovery, and our precision technologies remain a critical solution to our customer through this cycle ahead. additionally, our management team is fully engaged in advancing the implementation of the ascend strategy, which will establish a growth framework, entrepreneurial organization and a deep and a diverse team to drive sustainable profitable growth. thank you for you time and attention on today's call. have a great day.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the nordson corporation third quarter fiscal year 2021 conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, lara mahoney, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead, ma'am.
lara mahoney -- vice president, investor relations & corporate communications
thank you. good morning. this is lara mahoney, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. i'm here with sundaram nagarajan, our president and ceo; and joseph kelley, executive vice president and cfo. we welcome you to our conference call today, tuesday, august 31, 2021 to report nordson's fiscal 2021 third quarter results. you can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at www.nordson.com/investor. this conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 14 days.
there will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until tuesday, september 7. during this call, references to non-gaap financial metrics will be made. a reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable gaap metric was provided in the press release issued yesterday. before we begin, please refer to slide 2 of our presentation where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon nordson's current expectations.
these statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission that could cause actual results to differ. moving to today's agenda on slide 3, naga will discuss the third quarter highlights. he will then turn the call over to joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the two business segments. joe will also discuss the cash flow and balance sheet. naga will conclude with high-level commentary about our enterprise performance as well as our updated fiscal 2021 full year guidance. we will then be happy to take your questions.
with that, i'll turn to slide 4 and hand the call over to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining nordson's fiscal 2021 third quarter conference call. first and foremost, i want to congratulate the nordson team on another record quarter. during this quarter, we continue to benefit from the execution of our nbs next growth framework in combination with robust end market demand. investments in industrial capex and the strengthening medical and electronics end markets drove record results in the quarter.
i'm also pleased with the resilience of our colleagues. in this dynamic macro environment, that continues to be plagued by supply chain, labor and covid concerns, our division leaders are deploying nbs next to focus resources on the greatest growth opportunities in their respective businesses. i'll speak more about the business, including the recent announcement of the ndc technologies acquisition in a few moments.
but first, i'll turn the call over to joe to provide a detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. joe?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, naga, and good morning to everyone. on slide number 5, you'll see third quarter 2021 sales were $647 million, an increase of 20% over prior year's third quarter sales of $538 million. this is a new quarterly record for the company, $57 million above the prior quarterly record. the increase was primarily related to: 20% organic volume growth and favorable currency, offset by net -- negative impact from acquisitions and divestitures. the benefits from the fluortek and vivamos acquisitions were more than offset by the headwind from the divestiture of the screw and barrel product line. when excluding the divested product line in the prior year for comparability purposes, sales growth would have been 24% in the current year third quarter.
the organic sales increase was driven by continued demand across all divisions and end markets, including a seasonal increase in quarterly shipments into the electronics end markets. from a geographic perspective, growth was once again strong in all regions except japan, which continues to manage pandemic-related impacts. gross profit totaled $365 million or 56% of sales in the quarter, compared to $281 million or 52% of sales in the prior year. this 430 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by volume leverage, benefits from structural cost reduction measures taken in fiscal 2020, and improved sales mix particularly resulting from the divested screw and barrel product line at the beginning of fiscal second quarter.
also record in the quarter were operating profit of $188 million or 29% of sales, a 57% increase from the prior year adjusted operating profit of $120 million and ebitda of $215 million or 33% of sales. this result was 45% higher than the prior year ebitda of $148 million. our broad-based organic growth, plus the favorable sales mix benefits, including the divestiture has led to attractive incremental ebitda margins of greater than 60% in the quarter. the application of the nbs next growth framework at our divisions is helping us to focus and realize profitable growth in areas of greatest opportunity. looking now at non-operating expense, net interest expense decreased $1 million or 18% from the prior year associated with reduced debt levels.
other net expense decreased $7 million driven primarily by smaller currency translation losses and a non-cash pension settlement charge of $3 million in the third quarter of 2020 associated with the retirement of the prior ceo that did not repeat. tax expense totaled $38 million or an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter. net income in the quarter increased 71% year-over-year to a $142 million or $2.42 per share, yet another quarterly company record. this significant growth is reflective of volume leverage driven by the 20% increase in sales as well as benefits from cost control measures and improved sales mix and manufacturing efficiencies.
now, let's turn to slide 6 and 7 to review the third quarter 2021 segment performance. industrial precision solutions sales of $345 million increased 20% compared to the prior year third quarter. the organic volume increase of 22% was driven by the same growth in hot melt adhesive dispensing and industrial coating product lines. system sales in the quarter were particularly strong, up 37% across the broad set of end markets and geographies. the divested screws and barrels product line more than offset the currency gains on a year-over-year sales growth.
operating profit in the segment was $124 million or 36% of sales, compared to $78 million of adjusted operating profit in the prior-year period. this 60% profit growth was driven by sales volume leverage associated with the organic growth, favorable sales mix, and improved manufacturing efficiencies. the nbs next growth framework is driving strong sales growth at very attractive incremental operating profit margins. excluding the impact of the divestiture, incremental operating profit margins were 55% in the quarter. moving now to advanced technology solutions. sales of $301 million increased approximately 21% compared to the prior year third quarter.
this change included an organic increase of 18% as well as the increases of 2% related to currency and 1% related to acquisitions. the increase in organic sales volumes was driven by strong double-digit growth in all product lines particularly those serving electronics end markets and fluid management product lines serving medical and industrial end markets. third quarter 2021 operating profit for this segment was $81 million or 27% of sales. this increase of 51% over prior year adjusted operating profit margin of $53 million was driven by sales volume leverage, favorable sales mix, and the realization of benefits from cost controls measures taken in fiscal 2020.
similar to the ips segment, the implementation of nbs next throughout the divisions of ats is driving strong sales growth at attractive incremental operating margins of greater than 50%. finally, turning to cash flow and balance sheet on slide 8; free cash flow in the quarter was strong at $118 million, which was 45% above the prior year free cash flow. cash conversion on net income was 83% in the quarter, which was below normal levels due primarily to investments in working capital to support growth and a $30 million pension contribution. the year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate remains north of 100%.
dividend payments were $23 million in the quarter and the company's board approved a 31% increase in the annual dividend effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. this marks the 58th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend. the significant increase of 31% reflects the strength of our financial results, which is driven by our continued progress in executing the ascend strategy, combined with the desire to maintain targeted payout and yield ratios.
the annual dividend yield remains just under 1% at current market prices. our third quarter balance sheet includes cash of $174 million and net debt was $647 million, ending the quarter with a 0.9 times leverage ratio based on trailing 12 months ebitda. we continue to have significant available borrowing capacity to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities, similar to the ndc acquisition announced last week.
i'll now turn the call back to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, joe. let's turn to slide 9. again, thank you to the nordson team for delivering this outstanding performance. we are making progress on our ascend strategy to achieve top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. during the quarter, joe and i continue to visit our divisions to review their progress with nbs next deployment. it is exciting to see how nbs next is being applied to make data-driven decisions to meet the increased demand of our customers. for example, in our nordson medical interventional solutions facility in salem, new hampshire, the team has used nbs next to understand complexity and standardize their product offering.
this has allowed them to disproportionately focus resources for their best customers and products. we are purposeful in where we focus our energy to ensure we take advantage of the greatest opportunities for profitable growth even during the recovery. nbs next is at the core of our ascend strategy, which is designed to deliver $3 billion in revenue and 30% ebitda. this target will be achieved through a combination of organic growth within each segment as well as the acceleration of acquisitions. clearly, the record-setting second quarter followed by the record-setting third quarter demonstrates that we are off to a strong organic start toward achieving our long-term goals.
we're also making progress on our acquisition objectives. on august 23, we signed the definitive agreement to acquire ndc technologies, a leading global provider of precision measurement solutions for in-line process control. this acquisition expands our test and inspection platform into new markets and adjacent technologies. with nordson-like gross margins, it is clear that ndc has a differentiated product portfolio that is leveraged through a customer-centric business model. this portfolio includes in line measurements sensors, gauges, and analyzers using near-infrared, laser, x-ray, optical, and nucleonic technologies as well as proprietary algorithms and software.
for example, its near-infrared technologies can simultaneously measure moisture, oil, and surface brownness of a potato chip or it can estimate the porosity level in the film used to separate the anode and cathode in an electric vehicle battery. its laser and ultrasonic capabilities are used to measure wall thickness, ovality, and diameter of industrial cables or medical tubing. as customers focus on automation and process control, ndc supports their success through these critical quality control technologies. we also look forward to leveraging ndc's software and algorithm expertise to advance nordson's capabilities in manufacturing process intelligence development.
i'm very pleased with the strategic fit of this business, which aligns with the acquisition portion of the ascend strategy presented at our investor day earlier this year. we look forward to welcoming the ndc team to nordson, upon our nbs next growth framework and investing in ndc's greatest opportunities for profitable growth. we expect the deal to close within our fiscal first quarter of 2022. now, let's turn to an updated fiscal 2021 outlook on slide 10. as we enter the fiscal fourth quarter, backlog is approximately $700 million and 70% above the prior year. customer order patterns have clearly changed in terms of both volume and extended shipment request dates in this dynamic environment.
based on the continued strength in our order entry and elevated backlog, we are increasing our full year revenue and earnings guidance. for full year fiscal 2021, we expect sales growth to be approximately 11% to 12% over fiscal year 2020. excluding the 3% headwind from the revenue of the divested screws and barrels product line in the prior year, our forecasted full year sales growth would be approximately 14% to 15%. our forecasted sales growth combined with the benefits from the strategic actions taken around efficiency and cost is forecasted to deliver earnings in the range of $7.75 to $7.95 per diluted share.
the midpoint of this guidance reflects 43% earnings growth compared to prior year and a 34% increase over 2019 earnings. given the strong system sales in the third quarter 2021 plus the seasonality in electronics, it is important that investors look at the second half of 2021 when reviewing our full-year guidance. at the midpoint, the guidance suggests second half sales growth of 14% and earnings growth of 47%. additionally, the guidance implies that we expect to enter 2022 with a robust backlog, approximately 70% greater than the backlog entering fiscal 2021. our current financial results signify more than the benefits of the recovery.
nordson wins because of the foundation of our precision technology focus, customer-centric model, and diversified end markets. we are well-positioned to benefit from this increase in demand as our products remain a critical solution to our customers through the cycle ahead. additionally, our leadership team is advancing the implementation of the ascend strategy, which is establishing a growth framework, entrepreneurial organization and a deep diverse team to drive sustainable profitable growth. as always, i want to thank our customers, shareholders and the nordson team for your continued support.
with that, we'll pause and take your questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of matt summerville with d.a. davidson.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
thanks. a couple of questions. typically, how much of your backlog would converge in the current quarter? i guess, excuse me, i'm trying to get a sense in terms of how elongated maybe some of these orders have become.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, matt, this joe. let me just take that. typically, i would tell you entering backlog we have less than 100% of quarterly sales entering any given quarter. and so it'll trend, i don't know, let's just say in the 80% range of the quarterly -- upcoming quarterly sales. and we clearly see that changing as the customer requested delivery date is out further and further. so, customers are just placing orders further in advance. and so if you look at our quarterly sales going forward and our implied guidance, it would suggest that the midpoint is about $600 million and our backlog entering the year is about -- entering the quarter is about $700 million. so, it has elongated, it depends on the systems businesses versus parts and it's different for each business. but some of them are going out into q2 of 2022.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
great, that's helpful. and then have you guys encountered any actual shipment delays to customers? and in your mind, are things getting better/worse, stabilizing as we think about supply chain challenges, freight issues, etc.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
matt, this is naga. let me take that one. yes, we are experiencing some, but not significant, freight especially, our international shipments sometimes seems to get pushed out. but what we have experienced in the third quarter really is customers pulling orders forward and what is impressive is to see the team, even in a very difficult environment, be able to manage and ship it out when the customers requested it.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
and again, naga, just to put a finer point on my question, do you get the sense of things, in this regard, are getting more challenging? has the situation stabilized? are things starting to loosen up and get better yet? thank you.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. matt, i would say, it is a dynamic environment. it is not getting any worse, but it's not getting any better either. but i will tell you that the nordson team is fully participating in this recovery under some challenging environments, but doing an excellent job, so.
matt j. summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
excellent. thank you, guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of allison poliniak with wells fargo.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities llc -- analyst
hi. good morning.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities llc -- analyst
naga, just want to explore the order trends a little bit more for you guys. i guess, when you talk to your customers -- is it more on the ips or is advanced technology? and is it really just a reflection of some of those -- i think with matt talking with the supply team challenges, that people are trying to get those orders in a little earlier to guarantee delivery? just any thoughts, is this sort of a temporary situation or do you think this is sort of your customer patterns or order patterns are starting to shift a little bit permanently?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
i would say what you're seeing is broad-based strong order patterns across end markets, across regions. and are there some cases where people are trying to get in front of the line or ahead of the line proactively? yes. but quite frankly, if you think about the kind of end markets we play in and look at all the secular drivers for them, i'd tell you we are very pleased with the momentum that we are seeing, for example, in our medical business. if you think about our fluid component business, with biopharma -- just not vaccine, but biopharma in general, we see some pretty strong order rates that is -- embedded in it is really the secular growth drivers around biopharma really going well for us.
and if you think about interventional solutions in the medical side, what you'll find there is our aging population, single-use components, all of those drivers still intact. selective surgeries or some might have unfortunately have started calling it as elective surgeries have come back. but that remains a little bit fluid, but we feel really good about the recovery we're seeing in our medical businesses. on our electronic businesses, we are at the beginning of a really nice growth cycle here. you hear about chip shortages, and you can -- all of us read the headlines on the big investments that major semiconductor manufacturers are making and nordson is participating nicely in it.
we've got a couple of new products that are entering the market both on test and inspection and our dispense business. so, industrial capex is pretty robust. might you say that might moderate over time? i would say yes. that might do that. on the packaging side, on the consumer non-durables, i mean, really very strong move toward eating at home rather than out at a restaurant. might that continue? we're seeing a lot of activity in packaged goods, packaged beverages. our teams like to call them from keg to can, and you have more people using cans. so we see a lot of container businesses that are going well for us. hopefully, that gives you enough color, allison.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities llc -- analyst
no, that's really helpful. and then i just want to touch on operating execution. incredibly strong in the past two quarters here. relative to your expectations of setting some of these operational plans [indecipherable], is this -- is the execution maybe better than maybe you would have anticipated kind of walking into this up cycle? any color on how that is relative to what your view was in terms of what the organization could do?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. no. i am incredibly proud of the execution of the team. this is not ordinary times or environment that we are operating in. but we are using nbs next and -- in our businesses to meet this incredible demand. and it plays out in many different ways in multiple businesses across the company. nbs next fundamentally is all about making choices to drive growth. and what you begin to see is, for example, in some of our businesses understanding what are your greatest growth opportunities and disproportionately investing in them is one way it shows up in this great execution.
you'll see our team standardizing product offering, reducing complexity, streamlining and dedicating products to the most important products in the business, prioritizing our best growth opportunities, our best customers. so lots of different ways be it quality, be it manufacturing capacity, be it conversion costs, be it selecting the right end markets to choose to play. and also treating very differently unattractive opportunities in the business is really how this is playing out. i am really happy about the progress we are making. and i wouldn't say i'm surprised, but i am excited about the fact that the teams are doing one heck of a job really converting orders to shipments, shipments to profitable growth for all of us.
allison poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities llc -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of connor lynagh with morgan stanley.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley & co. llc -- analyst
yeah. thanks. i thought maybe we could touch on the ndc acquisition. and basically i'm just wondering if you could sort of illuminate, obviously, you guys are very focused on growth. how has the growth profile of this business looked over the past few years? where do you see the opportunities? is it -- this business enhancing your growth in your existing portfolio, your portfolio of existing growth in this business. how do you think about that?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. in this business, historically, they have underperformed in terms of growth versus where they should really be growing, because we play in the same end markets as these businesses. so, we fundamentally see an application of nbs next in this to understand what are the best growth opportunities for them and invest disproportionately in those to drive growth. this would most likely be, i would say, mid single digits is sort of our growth expectation for this business and we feel really good about it. their performance in the year is looking really good. certainly, we don't talk about specific product lines and how they perform, but we feel really good about it.
but what i will tell you about this business that we really like. it is strategically similar to a lot of nordson businesses. it's got a customer-centric business model. i would -- direct sales model, global sales and service support, large installed base, a lot of similarities to some of our consumer non-durable businesses. it has a very strong suite of differentiated products. and you see that in nordson like gross margins. so, we're looking forward to welcoming this team, using nbs next, understanding the growth initiatives. and really for us it is a pretty, pretty strong place to be. we do clearly see a path for the margins to expand north of 20% ebitda.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley & co. llc -- analyst
got it. a helpful context. i'm wondering if you could just characterize the broader m&a landscape out there? is this -- was this a diamond in the rough? was this one of many good options you saw out there? just an update on, sort of, the opportunity set and valuations would be great.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. m&a, we clearly remain focused, as everybody would tell you, m&a landscape has improved, banker activity suddenly have expanded and accelerated this year when compared to last year. we remain focused though, we are very focused around continuing to scale up our medical business, as we see a lot of opportunities there, we'll continue to stay focused there. test and inspection, as ndc will illustrate for you, is an area we continue to diversify, get into new markets, get into new technologies. our test and inspection, connor, today is very electronic centered. with ndc, you can begin to see us move beyond electronics and that's really what you would see.
so, we see opportunities there. and finally, we have an internal team that continues to explore opportunities on precision technologies that are very adjacent to what we do today. just as a reminder, we are laser focused on strategic criteria to play an attractive end-market that have real good growth profile to them, precision technology suite of products and have a customer-centric business model. on the financial side, clearly we are looking for assets that can add to our organic growth ambitions.
we, with nordson-like gross margins, that's really critical for us. for us, gross margin equals differentiation is the way to think about it, that's how we think about it within the company. and on ebitda, our expectation as we said in our investor day is approximately 20%. would we do deals below that? yes. and would we do deals above that? but we are looking for clear margin expansion opportunities. and all of these results in a fairly decent roic greater than our cost of capital over three to five years.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley & co. llc -- analyst
got it. thank you very much for the color. i'll turn it back.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
sure.

your next question comes from the line of jeff hammond with keybanc capital.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, jeff.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, jeff.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
so, just back on margins, i think there was an earlier question on that, but just -- i think the expectation was 3q would step down from 2q and we've gone the other way. and i think 4q guide suggests a step down. what's -- i guess, what's surprising you the most or maybe where's the caution in the guide on the margin? is it largely mix or do we start to see some of the inflationary pressures come through, maybe just a little color there.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. maybe if i could. on the gross margin in q2 we did 57%. and when you think about our gross margin, we used to operate in the range, i would say, between 53% and 55%. given the divestiture of the screw and barrel product line, that has systematically i would tell you moved our gross margin and at margin profile up probably 175 basis points. and so, now, i think the new normal from a gross margin standpoint fortune is in the range of 55% to 57% and you see that was sustainable in q2 and in q3.
then you think about the sequential q3 to q4 and you look at our guidance, and more specifically i guess if you look at the second half 2021, jeff, forecast and performance, you need to understand that approximately $25 million worth of system orders were pulled forward from our scheduled q4 shipment into q3 based on customer request. this was primarily in the industrial end market and primarily in ips. therefore, the guidance range implies q4 performance would actually be comparable to q3 if you adjust both quarters for the $25 million sales pull forward. again this was -- pull forward was request of the customer.
and as naga mentioned, proud of our team's -- despite some of the supply chain issues -- ability to meet the customer's requests and demand and pull that forward. it is also noteworthy, i guess, if you exclude that $25 million from q3, it would still have been a record-breaking quarter, $30 million north of the prior quarterly record. the sequential swing, we tried to point this out to investors by talking to the second half performance that the 14% growth in revenue and 47% growth in earnings at the midpoint. i would tell you, the other noteworthy point when you look q3 to q4 and you look at the year-over-year growth rates is the 4% tailwind that we had in q3, that starts to moderate when you look at the year-over-year growth rate in q4 to about 1%. and again, that's just given the movement in exchange rates last year q3 to q4.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
okay. that's all very helpful. thanks, joe. just back on medical, i think, naga you called out biopharma as particularly strong in your comments. i just -- i wanted to dig in more on the kind of the elective surgery pace of recovery. and is that trending in line or better than you had expected?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. jeff, thank you. on elective surgeries, in the third quarter we did really well and it was trending nicely. now with delta variant -- might you expect that to tick back down. that is possible. but i fully expect that what had happened last year as we talked last -- all of last year, as -- our surgeries, i'd like -- our teams would describe a more selective, not elective, right? if you need to get a heart valve replacement, you have to get a heart valve replacement. it's just a matter of time. so, you could get it postponed, but you couldn't get it canceled, right? i guess if something really bad happens, then that could happen. but that's not what you're hoping for. so, what we do see and what we experienced in the third quarter is a nice recovery.
you can -- we saw that business really get back to high-single digits in the quarter and that was really nice to see. going into fourth quarter, we're trying to be cautious here. we don't see it go all the way back down like last year. i do think it will be little bit lower, but we fully expect medical to recover completely because all of the growth factors that we played toward around aging population, all of this is going to be intact for us. and it is a great business that would -- that is already returning to normal. would there be bumps in the road, yes. absolutely. given the data -- delta variant would there be bumps in the road? yes, absolutely, given the delta variant, you could have a few bumps in the road. but hopefully that gives you answers to your question.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
no, that's very helpful. thanks.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of mike halloran with baird.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, mike.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
hey. just a quick clarification on that last question jeff asked. so, is it fair to say that you haven't seen the full recovery in the medical piece yet? trajectory is good, could get some volatility that happens over the next couple of quarters, depending on how the broader delta variant goes and other factors. but on a trailing basis, you don't think that you've gotten that full recovery yet, is that fair?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. fair.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
okay. okay. and so then two questions. first, when you look at the order patterns and how those have elongated and shifted, have you seen any change in the seasonality that you're expecting on the actual conversion of those orders? in other words, as the demand carries through, are you still thinking that on an all-in basis, the seasonality is about the same or do you think the seasonality has shifted some?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i would tell you, the seasonality is evolving. when you think about our end-market exposure in our particular applications, i don't -- we've studied the numbers on the quarter, i don't know what is the normal seasonality any more. i mean, if you take for example our customers' behavior on the industrial side, pulling in shipments into q3 when typically q4 was our strongest quarter and look at our implied guidance that suggests that q4 is going to be down through q3 because of that. so, i don't know that given our electronic exposure has changed in terms of applications with the semiconductor cycle, our medical business, the biopharma has been strong, as the elective surgeries come back and the international side starts to return to growth. our normal seasonality is, i would say, really challenged to make that statement any more.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
so the answer to this one seems like, no. but when you look at the orders that you're getting in, what's the risk that there's been some double ordering or that there's cancellability in that order book versus just this is just a different cadence and the underlying demand -- underlying order cadence so that your client can reserve spots over the next couple of quarters?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i would tell you we track order cancellation very closely and we do not see an uptick in that whatsoever. so, i think we monitored that risk. but to-date that risk is very low.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
you know, one thing.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
thanks, joe. no, go ahead.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
sorry, mike. go ahead, finish up and then i'll.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
no. no. no. i was going to say thank you, but i didn't know there was something else, so please, naga, go ahead.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think what i would add is, just look at the unprecedented investments that are going on in industrial capex, that is one, that i would really point to as one of the big drivers in what you've seen in our ips business. what you also see in our electronics, the ats business, is this real strong semi investments and a particularly strong consumer electronic demand for what is turning out to be a digital economy. so, the macro drivers are pretty strong that we feel really good about what we are seeing in terms of demand for some of our precision technologies.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
so, is the implication there then naga that, yes, the order book has been very good and you like the fact that you're getting more visibility. but it seems like you're also implying that the front log of opportunity still remains pretty robust?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes. good.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
thank you. [indecipherable] good. appreciate it.

your next question comes from the line of christopher glynn with oppenheimer.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
thank you. good morning.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
just wondering naga, if you had any anything to call out in terms of notable changes in the competitive backdrop consistent with the -- or coincident with the pandemic if anyone has kind of fallen off or gotten flat footed. clearly, it seems like you've picked up some momentum that you've generated. but just wondering about the kind of broader question as well.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we generally don't -- we have some really strong competitors, but you know the businesses, as of course, you have followed us for a long period of time. our consumer nondurable businesses, we really are very -- we have a significant position with being a global competitor, right? so, a lot of our businesses, what you see us being is this global competitor that can be relied upon through good times and bad times and can be relied upon for global support for customers' applications and service and sales, right?
and so, what we have seen come through in this environment is that value proposition getting strengthened even further as others will have some hiccups here or there or not able to make commitments, nordson team is there supporting our customers and really in a lot of ways strengthens our value proposition and reaffirms for the customer why you want to work with nordson not only because you're going to get the precision technologies, you're going to get reliable support that is going to be global in nature. and then that's -- if anything, it just reaffirms our strong value proposition.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
thank you. and then the backlog up 70%, should we think about that as both segments kind of participating in parallel more or less?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. we don't give backlog guidance on a segment specific basis, but you can interpret our performance year-to-date has been quite broad based. i mean, you see both segments growing approximately 20% organically in the quarter and broad based in terms of geography and end markets and division. so -- but we're not going to start giving backlog in segments specifically.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
yeah. that wasn't what i asked. appreciate the answer. last one for me. i'm curious about the industrial trends in particular. has that been accelerating sequentially during and through past the quarter? in particular, are there any types of applications that you're seeing really break out in industrial?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
our industrial business, strong investments, a couple of areas i would point out for you. we have applied nbs next in all of our businesses to really understand what are the best growth opportunities, where should we want to focus on and how do we treat some positions that are inherently unattractive. and so, the net result of all of this is, we find some real strong growth in container for example. so, we talked about beverage cans and nordson has a very strong position and a very attractive precision technology suite that supplies people who make beverage cans. and you coat the inside of a beverage can.
and that's an example of what you see in this whole consumer shift, in how they eat and consume beverages and food. so, really we are benefiting there. we're also beginning to see in our powder business this broad base industrial activity that is leading to investments on paint lines and things like that. so, we're doing well there. our packaging on the industrial, adhesive, hot melt adhesive is doing extremely well as well. so, hopefully, that gives you a couple of different points of -- some of this is certainly broad based but we are pretty pleased with how the team is fully participating in the recovery that was going on.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
great. thanks for the color.
operator
your next question comes from the line of andrew buscaglia with berenberg.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets llc -- analyst
good morning, guys.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, andrew.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets llc -- analyst
i want to talk a little bit about mix in the quarter. so, obviously, nbs next is helping and in industrial precision, you're seeing the divestiture is helping both. is there -- are you seeing any interesting trends that are helping mix from that standpoint? and then, same within ats, i would think that actually with electronics and test and inspection improving maybe you'd see maybe a less favorable mix, but what's going on in there?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so within the segments, i think particularly let's just take one segment at a time. ats, you do see some favorable mix. and i really think it's not to your point at the division level but almost within the division. so if you think about nbs next it's being implemented at the division level. so even the relatively low margin businesses or the divisions within that are seeing nice improvement in their profitability and their gross margin, which is driving the favorable mix within the divisions. so, it's funny at ats, within the -- at the division level, the mix is actually unfavorable, but it was favorable within each of the divisions such that the end result was favorable for the segment.
and so, i think that's evident that nbs next being applied at the -- within the division where you're looking at specific applications. i mean, naga mentioned within ics some of the liquid coating opportunities is clearly a favorable mix expansion. within ips, you see a very similar story. and particularly, i mean, you had strong growth in the systems over the parts within ips. but yet the margins improved beyond that of the mixed benefit that we got from the divestiture to screw a barrel business which if you look at the ips business that divestiture alone is probably worth 350 basis points of margin expansion. but they're expanding beyond that due to the favorable mix i would tell you within the divisions.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets llc -- analyst
okay. interesting.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
another point, noteworthy i guess which is also helping is we've had some nice success both in ips and in ats with our new product launches the problue flex and the vantage continue to gain traction and i would tell you that that is helping us from a top line perspective, as well as the mix standpoint.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets llc -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then another one on -- in that, with the ndc acquisition, it seems like a great company. i guess, i was a little bit surprised given, like, the specialty nature of this business and it seems like a pretty good deal. that ebitda margins, they look like they're around 16.5% to 17%. is this a situation where this company has a lot of very high gross margin profile? but maybe ebitda margins, do you see an opportunity to expand? and i know you gave out over 20% target, is that a near-term target or is it a longer-term to more get that margin in line or above corporate average?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
the -- let me first start and then joe, if you could add a little bit more color, that'd be good. the reason we acquired ndc technologies is because it fits right with our test and inspection business. and particularly that particular company we really like is because if you look at it gross margins, they have nordson-like gross margins. they have a customer-centric business model that is like nordson. so, it's this case of strong gross margins, indicating a strong differentiated product portfolio, but ebitda margins are slightly lower than our target. joe, if you want to just add a little bit more color on what we are thinking near-term?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, you are correct, the margins coming in are about 17% -- 16% to 17% ebitda margins and we see opportunities under our ownership and the execution of nbs next to get margin expansion over the next, i would say, a couple of years, similar to what you see on the core nordson similar to what you see on the core of nordson business as we roll out nbs next. yeah. but the main reason -- the main opportunity for here is to use nbs next to identify the best growth opportunities to invest in them disproportionately and really grow the company and margin expansion will follow. so, with the 55% growth, it has favorable incremental margin. so, it's the growth that drives the margin expansion.
andrew e. buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets llc -- analyst
okay. got it. thanks, guys.

your next question comes from the line of walter liptak with seaport.
walter liptak -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning, everybody.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, walt.
walter liptak -- seaport global securities -- analyst
great quarter. hey, i'd like to go back to that 25 million of ips systems that got pulled forward. i guess it's impressive with the supply chain that you were able to get that into the quarter. but i guess my question is about the fourth quarter, i think you said joe that the system -- ips systems would be down sequentially. is that right? and then what does that do to the operating leverage? what does that do to the margins if you've got more mix of aftermarket parts and ips in the fourth quarter?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, just my comment, it was holistically, there was about 25 million sold from q4 into q3. predominantly systems and predominantly, i would say, ips. and so, to naga's point and your point, it was impressive, our team being able to meet that customer request -- those customer requests. but from a margin standpoint, you build these systems over time. it shouldn't have huge -- our incrementals are what they are, and we're still going to deliver growth in q4 if you take the midpoint of our guidance and the sequential comment really while it's just q3 to q4 for nordson, when you level out and adjust that $25 million and take it out of q3 into q4, but in q4 on adjusted basis we would be relatively flat. and so, it's just that swing in the system which is driving the sequential drop.
walter liptak -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. and how are you thinking about the fourth quarter margins? are you saying that there's going to be less leverage because the volume growth won't be as high or is there a pickup in margin because there'll be more aftermarket because i typically think of systems as having a little bit lower margin, maybe that's incorrect.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. it's changing a little bit but not to the degree i think it was historically. and so, i would tell you we're thinking about margins for q4 at the gross margin line to be comparable with our new run rate that we saw in q2 of 57%, 56.5% here in q3. so, we feel confident to operate in the 55% to 57% gross margin range at the level of call it $600 million to $650 million in sales.
walter liptak -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay, great. okay. thanks. and then i wondered even -- you guys talked about this last quarter a little bit, but it sounds like the supply chain there's a little bit of challenges. but i wonder on pricing, are you seeing some inflationary pricing that you're passing along to customers? how are you doing that or is it on a project-by-project basis or have you taken out prices?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. it's really project by project. it's really project-by-project. i would tell you division-by-division. we are experiencing, as naga touched on, some supply chain challenges, some logistics challenges, but we are laser focused on managing the gross margins of this business. and we're also, i would tell you, looking out over the long term as it relates to our customer relationships and our position, i think that bodes well for us. when we entered this pandemic, in terms of strengthening what's core at nordson is that intimate customer direct sales model. and as we work through these challenging times, remaining focused on the gross margin and capturing the value we provide, but also protecting the long-term relationship with our customer. so, that's how we -- i would tell you look at that pricing.
walter liptak -- seaport global securities -- analyst
that's great.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
well, the one thing i would add to it is, given our gross margins, the material cost in our business is fairly small when compared to other companies. we had a value added assembler of components not -- we don't have big process component to our business. so, to the extent that we need to increase prices in certain areas, we have done that. we will continue to do that. but in general, this is not a huge significant material issue for us.
walter liptak -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yes. agreed. there's no doubt about that. okay. and then, maybe last for me is, naga, you mentioned that you and joe have been out traveling and visiting the facilities.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
walter liptak -- seaport global securities -- analyst
and i wonder if you've -- if you finished that process, how are you feeling now about, like the delta variant, will you continue to visit operations? and do think the delta variant is going to have any impact going into the end of the year?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. from our travel perspective, we continue to remain safe. but we can't continue to just stay in the bunkers, right? so, joe and i are being very cautious in how we travel, where we travel, but we're going to continue to travel in a very limited basis. if this thing didn't exist, would we be in more businesses than we were -- with we are today, absolutely, yes. but -- so, trying to find the right balance in terms of being safe as well as being in the businesses with our team, which is really where all of the action is going on.
walter liptak -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay, great. and are you -- your salespeople, i imagine, are getting out to and visiting with customers.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
walter liptak -- seaport global securities -- analyst
do you expect that a lot continue through the end of the year?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it is by request of the customers and it is in the region, we're not -- we do have some thoughts around trying to balance safety, as well as trying to help our customers meet their business needs. so, it is still decided by senior leaders in the company who travels where we travel. we have started going to some shows on a very limited basis. so, a dynamic environment. team is doing an excellent job of taking prudent measures to be safe, yet make sure we're taking care of customers.
walter liptak -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay, great. okay. thank you.

operator
good morning, my name is chris and i'll be your conference operator today. at this time, i'd like to welcome everyone to the nordson corporation fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
thank you. lara mahoney you may begin.
lara mahoney -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
thank you. good morning. this is lara mahoney, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. i'm here with sundaram nagarajan, our president and ceo; and joseph kelly, executive vice president and cfo.
we welcome you to our conference call today, thursday, december 16th, 2021 to report nordson's fiscal year 2021 fourth quarter and full-year results. you can find both our press release, as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at www.nordson.com/investors. this conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 14-days. there will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until december 30th 2021.
during this conference call, references to non-gaap financial metrics will be made. a complete reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable gaap metric has been provided in the press release issued yesterday.
before we begin, please refer to slide two of our presentation where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon nordson's current expectations. these statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, as discussed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission, that could cause actual results to differ.
moving to today's agenda on slide three. naga will discuss fourth quarter and full-year highlights. he will then turn the call over to joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the two business segments. joe also will talk about the year-end balance sheet and cash flow. naga will conclude with high level commentary about our enterprise performance, including an update on the ascend strategy, as well as our fiscal 2022 first quarter and full-year guidance. we will then be happy to take your questions.
with that, i'll turn to slide four and hand the call over to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining nordson's fiscal 2021 fourth quarter and full-year conference call. and the heels of 2020, a year marked by the covid pandemic, i don't think anyone knew what to expect coming into 2021. we were well positioned having both remained invested in our customer centric businesses and started deployment of nbs next growth framework. our focus remained sharply on protecting the health and safety of our employees, while also meeting the needs of our customers.
the successful deployment of nbs next ensured, we were able to fully participate in the accelerated economic recovery experienced in 2021. our division leaders use strategic discipline to identify and then focus on the best opportunities for profitable growth in their respective businesses. as a result we surpassed our prior record annual performance in sales by $108 million and an operating profit by $111 million. this new record was achieved through broad-based growth across most end markets and geographies.
fourth quarter was a solid finish to this record year. sales were in line with our expectations, particularly in light of the timing of the approximate $25 million customer order that had been pulled forward into fiscal third quarter. looking at the back half of fiscal 2021, we delivered 15% organic sales growth and 36% adjusted profit growth, compared to the prior year second half. i'll speak more about the businesses in few moments.
but first i'll turn the call over to joe to provide more detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, naga, and good morning to everyone. on slide number five, you will see fourth quarter 2021 sales were $599 million, an increase of 7%, compared to the prior year fourth quarter sales of $559 million. the increase was primarily related to 10% organic volume growth and favorable currency offset by headwinds from the screws and barrels product line divestiture.
when excluding the divested product line in the prior year for comparability purposes sales growth would have been a 11% in the current year fourth quarter. this double-digit organic sales increase was driven by solid growth in all product lines with particularly strong demand in electronics, industrial and medical end markets. test and inspection and consumer non-durable product lines delivered single-digit growth in the quarter, highlighting the continued stable demand in these markets. geographically, all regions except japan grew steadily.
gross profit totaled $331 million or 55% of sales in the quarter, compared to $297 million or 53% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. this 200 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by improved sales mix from the divested screws and barrels product line, sales volume leverage and process enhancements from our nbs next growth framework.
on a sequential basis, we experienced some pressure on gross margin from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, primarily due to elevated freight costs stemming from the dynamic macro-economic demand environment. additionally, we incurred approximately $2 million in non-recurring cost as we aligned our medical fluid components business with its best growth opportunities.
we believe these negative impact on gross margins are largely temporary in nature and we are taking appropriate pricing actions in fiscal 2022 to offset inflationary pressures. our differentiated product offering and market positions, organizational agility and disciplined approach to cost control combined with consistent deployment of the ascend strategy is allowing us to successfully navigate these challenges and continue to deliver profitable growth.
operating profit was a $151 million in the quarter or 25% of sales, a 16% increase from the prior year. double-digit organic growth, favorable sales mix and continued benefits from structural cost reduction actions taken in fiscal 2020 all contributed to incremental operating profit margins of 52% in the quarter. ebitda for the fourth quarter was $177 million or 30% of sales.
looking at non-operating expenses, net interest expense decreased $2 million or 31% from the prior year, driven by reduced debt levels. other net expenses increased $2 million, primarily driven by currency translation losses. tax expense in the quarter was $30 million for an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter, in line with the full-year and forecasted rates.
net income in the quarter totaled $110 million or a $1.88 per share, representing a 19% increase from the prior year adjusted earnings. this improvement is reflective of the 7% year-over-year increase in sales, and more importantly consistent application of the nbs next growth framework, which leads to steady, profitable growth with attractive incremental margins.
turning to slide number six, i'll now share a few comments on our full-year results. sales for the fiscal year 2021 were a record $2.4 billion, an increase of a 11%, compared to the prior year. this change in sales included an increase in organic volume of a 11%, and favorable currency impact of 3%, offset by the net unfavorable acquisition and divestiture impact of 3%. also company records operating profit was $615 million and diluted earnings per share were $7.74, a 36% and 41% increase respectively from the prior year. ebitda for the full-year increased 27% to $719 million or 30% of sales.
now let's turn to slide seven and eight, to review the fourth quarter 2021 segment performance. industrial precision solutions sales of $314 million increased 2%, compared to the prior year fourth quarter. organic volume growth in the quarter was 8% offset by an unfavorable divestiture impact of 7% and favorable currency of 1%. robust demand for industrial coating product plus steady growth in the consumer non-durable end markets for hot melt adhesive dispensing products drove this quarter's results.
from a regional perspective growth was strongest in the us, the americas and europe. operating profit for the quarter was $103 million or 33% of sales, which is an increase of 12%, compared to the prior year adjusted operating profit of $92 million. this growth was driven by favorable sales mix and manufacturing efficiency gained in part from the divestiture of the screws and barrels product line.
i also want to remind investors then it was this segment ips that had strong third quarter organic growth of 22%, which included approximately $25 million of sales that were pulled forward from fourth quarter into third quarter per the customer's request. therefore, this segment's second half 2021 organic sales growth of 15% and adjusted operating profit growth of 34% are more reflective of what this business is delivering.
advanced technology solutions sales of $285 million increased 14%, compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. this change included an increase in organic sales volume of 13% and a 1% increase related to favorable currency impact. growth was particularly strong in product lines serving electronics and medical end market. fluid dispense product lines serving industrial and automotive end markets also generated double-digit growth in the quarter. all geographies contributed to this quarter's growth with particular strength in the international regions.
fourth quarter operating profit was $67 million or 24% of sales. the 29% year-over-year increase was driven by sales volume leverage and realization of benefits from cost control measures taken in fiscal 2020. deployment of our nbs next growth framework continues to be a key element in the success of this segment delivering profitable growth.
finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on page nine. through our disciplined approach to capital deployment we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and abundant borrowing capacity. cash totaled $300 million, partially an anticipation of the $180 million ndc technology acquisition, which we completed on november 1st.
net debt was $516 million, resulting in a 0.7 times leverage ratio based on the trailing 12-months ebitda. free cash flow in the quarter was $160 million, which brings the full-year 2021 free cash flow total to $508 million or a conversion rate, a net income of 112%. as a reminder, the 2021 full-year free cash flow is inclusive of a net pension contribution totaling greater than $90 million.
for modeling purposes in fiscal 2022, assume an effective tax rate of 21%, capital expenditures of approximately $40 million and pension contributions of approximately $10 million well below the fiscal 2021 levels.
in summary our focus on disproportionally investing in the most profitable growth opportunities has led to another year of solid execution and record performance. while we continue to navigate the near-term challenges presented by this dynamic macro-economic environment, we remain diligent in implementing the nbs next growth framework and broader ascend strategy. we are pleased with our focus and progress on these strategic initiatives and remain committed to delivering top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns.
i will now turn the call back to naga.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, joe. let's turn to slide 10. again i want to thank our team for managing safely through another year of covid-19, as well as managing issues related to supply chain, labor and other macro concerns. with their dedication, passion and focus on making nordson stronger, not only did we achieve record results for the full-year, we also made great progress on our ascend strategy.
we first introduced ascend at our investor day in march 2021, designed to deliver top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns the ascend strategy encompasses three interconnected pillars: nbs next, nordson's growth framework; owner mindset, our entrepreneurial division led organization, which empowers our divisions to make decisions as close to the customer as possible; and winning teams, nordson's talent strategy. all three pillars are built on the foundation of what makes nordson special, our culture and values.
as we shared at our investor day, the successful execution of the ascend strategy will deliver our financial targets of $3 billion in sales, and 30% ebitda by 2025. through this cycle we expect to achieve sales growth of 7%-plus through an equal mix of organic and acquisitive growth.
2021 was a record year with double-digit organic growth and ebitda margins ahead of our targets. we're just beginning to make progress on our acquisitive growth targets. on november 1st, we completed the acquisition of ndc technologies, this test and measurement business as a differentiated product portfolio that is leveraged through a customer-centric business model. it is a great fit with our strategic and financial criteria for m&a.
the integration is off to a solid start. in november, the ndc leadership team received their initial training on nbs next. they are leaning in and asking good questions about how to incorporate our growth framework into their business. it is proving to be a good cultural fit and i'm very pleased with the level of engagement, i'm seeing at all levels of the ndc organization.
m&a is a very important part of our growth strategy. we are looking forward to executing upon our pipeline as the right opportunities present themselves. we have a strong balance sheet and are well positioned to do so. over the past year investors have asked, if we will adjust our long-term financial targets following the strength of this year. we strongly believe that these continue to be the right targets and we are pleased to have executed a very strong first year against that. our divisions are focus every day on delivering profitable growth and these long-term targets will not govern our potential to act on the best market opportunities.
before i address fiscal 2022 outlook, i would like to take this opportunity to highlight our new esg report. as discussed in more detail in the report our ascend strategy and esg priorities are closely integrated and depend on each other to refine and improve our overall performance. the underlying elements of esg have been central to nordson's culture and success throughout its 60-plus year history. nordson is a light assembly manufacturer, and we are committed to identifying ways to minimize our own environmental footprint, while helping our customers do the same.
throughout our long history of designing and developing precision dispensing technology we have sought to reduce our customers' material cost and consumption by increasing yields and reducing scrap during their manufacturing processes. this has been a vital part of our success. we're also bringing solutions to the market that address environmentally conscious market opportunities such as advanced battery manufacturing to support renewable energy and manufacturing processes that utilize plant-based manufacturing materials.
this report is a new foundation for our esg strategy, influenced by leading esg frameworks. it details our efforts to better understand our environmental footprint, while also highlighting our progress in social and governance initiatives. we look forward to building upon this foundation in future reports.
now for the outlook on slide 11. as we look to the full-year, we are conscious of the dynamic environment with strong levels of demand creating labor, material, logistic availability, challenges similar to what many of our peers are experiencing. our entrepreneurial division led organization structure has enabled us to address these ever changing dynamics head on. our teams are agile in identifying solutions around labor, material availability and transportation challenges to meet our customers expectation.
the strategic discipline is an element of the nbs next growth framework is undoubtedly helping the teams prioritize and deliver on the best growth opportunities within each division.
we expect 2022 to be another record-breaking year with sales growth in the range of 6% to 10% and adjusted earnings growth in the range of 8% to 18%, both as compared to fiscal 2021. we feel very confident going into the fiscal first quarter. as we first mentioned in the fiscal third quarter we are still seeing extended shipment request dates in conjunction with large orders from our customers. this increase backlog approximately 90%, compared to the same period a year ago and the trailing 12-week order entry was 25% above prior year levels.
as a result of these evolving order patterns, traditional seasonality where the first quarter is much softer than the prior year fourth quarter is not applicable. first quarter 2022 should be comparable to the financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the year-over-year growth rate comparable to the second half 2021 growth rates. based of anticipated sales timing, we expect the first quarter of 2022 sales growth to be approximately 14% to 16%, as compared to the fiscal 2021 first quarter with adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.80 to $1.95. as always i want to thanks our customers, employees and shareholders for your continued support.
with that we will pause and take your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is from mike halloran with baird. your line is open.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
well, hey thanks. hey, naga, can we pick up where you left off there. so you look at the guidance and obviously first quarter growth rate still stronger than what you are assuming for the rest of the year. you know, you certainly gave some context on why the seasonality would be different, but maybe talk about two things here: one, just how you're thinking about what is assumed in guidance for how you think the rest of the year plays out by segment?
and then my second question and related would just be how put this backlog in context? i mean, it's significantly bigger than what we would have seen historically. how much of this should have shipped last year? how much of this is just pulled forward through the rest of the year and just try to give some context? those are my two questions are related. so i asked them at the same time?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
okay, great. thanks, mike. and where we want to talk a little bit about as we go into the year we feel really good about the first quarter, just given the kind of environment that our customers are in and their order patterns we are seeing. so our first quarter is going to be more reflective of back half of '21, and in terms of -- if you think about the various end markets, let me start with electronics. electronics is customer order entry patterns and demand levels are pretty strong. medical, particularly biopharma and our interventional businesses the order entry patterns are really strong.
if you think about our industrial and consumer non-durable businesses early part of the year, we feel really good about it based on the backlog we have, but as we look into the back half of the year we do see those two end markets returning or normalized into historic levels that we shared at our investor day. so that's -- hopefully that answers the first part of your question, which is -- feel really good about the full-year guidance, which is going to be at the mid-point 8% growth on a record year. and that is really underpinning the strong demand patterns in medical, electronics and back half expecting some tapering off in industrial and consumer non-durable.
in terms of the backlog these are historical high -- as you indicated, we do believe these backlog is really forward dated or extended lead times that we normally don't have in our businesses. so our customers are asking us or giving us orders for shipments almost into the second quarter of next year, right, which is normally not the case. normally our demand patterns are such that people will ask is at the quarter out, right? and now people are putting their orders to be in line, and there is some amount of back and forth where customers are asking for some things to be shipped out ahead. so that's why some things get pushed pull forward or push back, but most often it's getting pulled forward than anything else.
so hopefully that answers the question, mike?
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
yes. i know it does, i mean, if i could put that last part in context, basically it seems which you are saying is, if you really good about where the order patterns are in the backlog patterns are? but don't overplay the magnitude of the backlog here, because of the extended lead times. but you feel good about the visibility that you have going into the second quarter, which is more than you would normally have. is that a fair interpretation?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
that is very fair. and that's exactly what we're seeing, and you know i wouldn't add anything more. joe unless you have something else to add to it.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i guess, i just -- when you think about the backlog, mike it is largely on the system side, which is longer lead times and there is a direct correlation when you look at our customer advance payments. so our customer advance payments year-over-year are also up 84%. so it's in line with the increase in the order backlog. so we think about the backlog is largely system orders, not necessarily past due items, and we've got pre-payments on those at 10% of last year's backlog and 10% of this year's backlog.
michael halloran -- baird equity research -- analyst
good. thank you. really appreciate it.
operator
our next question is from connor lynagh with morgan stanley. your line is open.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, thanks. i was wondering if you could give a little bit of context on the logistics costs that you called out? and just specifically, if there -- is one of the segments more disproportionately impacted by this? and is this something that was sort of isolated for the quarter? or are you sort of accounting for this persisting in next quarter's guidance?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so let me address that i guess holistically, when we think about the 55.3% gross margin. first of all, that gross margins coming off of a 10% organic growth and deliver 52% incremental margin at the op line. but when you look at the 55.3%, compared to where we were run in q2 and q3 it is down about 170 basis points. and when you think about that sequential drop, i would tell you where it's roughly threefold, there's three relatively evenly split things, one of them being the spike in freight cost, and you know in freight cost it's inbound, it's outbound, but it's also internal within the nordson facility. and so we saw this as did the rest of the environment spike in q4. i can tell you it's spiked above where we had estimated and it's starting to subside in the marketplace already from those elevated levels that we saw in q4, but we are addressing this with pricing actions in the first half here at 2022.
the other impact, i would tell you was that non-recurring write-off associated with aligning the factory and that was all in ats to answer your specific question around the segments that factory alignment within our medical business and so that approximately $2 million impact on gross margins impacted ats. the freight is felt across both segments, but i would tell you it's heavier on the ips side proportionately.
and the remaining the third factor, i would tell you is mix. and so, you know, if you look at our gross margins over the history here, we view prior to the screw and barrel divestiture, we were running about 53% to 55% gross margin on any given quarter depending on mix. in the last now -- three quarters, we've been running 55% to 57% based on the new mix post the divestiture of the screw and barrel business. so we -- when we give our guidance for 2022, i would tell you, you should think about operating between that 55% and 57% gross margin range depending on mix on any given quarter. but those were the main factors i would tell you in the q4 gross margins.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful context. appreciate it. so sort of related question here, but at a higher level as you're looking into fiscal '22, it certainly seems like you guys are feeling pretty good about margins holding up relative to where we were in 2021. so just curious, if there's any sort of inflationary pressures you're worried about and, you know, on the cost side of things? is there anything you're watching and sort of a swing factor on whether this margins will trend to the higher, lower end of your range?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. connor, let me just give you a high level color and certainly joe will add some more to what i'd say. in general, we feel good about where we've got margins forecasted based on our current customer demand and segments -- the various end market exposures we have.
from an inflation perspective, there are two things you want to keep in mind, right? first and foremost material cost is fairly small part of our cost, right? given our gross margins given about the value we create that sort of one thing to remember. the second thing to remember is that our cost to our customers is a smaller part of their total cost deck and so what that means is that we have a differentiated position and are able to pass along price increases where there is necessary. and we've already done that in some businesses. overall, we don't see this being a major factor for us in the coming year.
joe you want to add any color to that?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that covers it. i mean we are closely monitoring it and from an inflation perspective, both on the raw material side, as well as the labor side and then there was the logistics side, i would tell you that spike in q4 that impacted the margin slightly. i will also add, we see nbs next efficiencies helping offset some of this pressure, efficiencies in terms of labor and conversion cost in several of our pilot sites and so that has also helped our performance, and we anticipate that continue to contribute favorably as we go into '22.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. i appreciate it. i turn it back here.

our next question is from andrew buscaglia with berenberg. your line is open.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
good morning, guys.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
[speech overlap] if you look into your sales guidance for next year, if you back out ndc, the implied organic sales is more like mid single-digit. so i was wondering, you know, i know you gave lot of color already, but i would think that in some areas like medical and even electronics you see a reacceleration, i think mid to late year. and i just wonder how conservative you're being on that with that as a dynamic in the forecast?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
sure, yes.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. andrew, let me make one and then maybe i'll let naga will say something else, but when you think about our sales guidance for the full-year at the mid point 8%, there is roughly about a 2% fx headwind that we're contemplating. and to your point, the acquisitions, net of -- don't forget we have one quarter of screw and barrel business. so the way i -- that we're thinking about it as a negative 2% fx headwind, the net acquisition and divestiture is roughly favorable 3% and then it's 7% organic growth is what we have.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
all right.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
is there a way -- yes, sorry, go ahead.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
no, no. go ahead, andrew.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
well, i was just going to say with medical, i would think that that's being held up by recent variants activity again. so i would just think that would only be a nice tailwind as the year progresses.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yes, just historically, think about the medical business has high single-digit or electronics mid single-digit. we are in the early cycle of them maybe third wave there on electronics. so you are right, in electronics we're going to see some pretty nice growth, that's what is reflected in our guidance. in medical we are expecting to have some pretty good return to the high single-digits, biopharma doing well. so if you think about all of that these are going to be the big growth contributors. but look at the directed year on our investor business and consumer non-durable business in 2021, our expectation is we do -- we carry that strength into the first quarter, the back half of the year it is going to be some tapering on those businesses, which have double-digit organic growth in consumer non-durable and in industrial businesses.
so our expectation is some normalization in the back half for those businesses. but you're right, there is strength in medical, there is strength in electronic, that's what we have reflected. and what we are excited about is, as you go into the first quarter we are carrying the momentum of our second half of 2021 into 2022.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. is there a way in that backlog that you can identify what percent of sales is specific to electronics and medical?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i would tell you pretty heavily on the system side and on the electronic, there are a lot of systems businesses that we sell. but i can't tell you the split between electronics and medical.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
but we do have industrial systems that still need to get shipped out in the first quarter to -- that's in the backlog as well.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay. all right. thank you, guys.
operator
our next question is from matt summerville with d.a. davidson. your line is open.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thanks. a couple of questions. you commented, sort of, on the fact that we should not expect normal seasonality as it pertains to the first fiscal quarter of the year. but maybe naga and joe, if you can comment on how we should be thinking about the quarterly earnings cadence beyond that?
in that, should we expect kind of the typical, kind of, fiscal q3 being the high watermark for the year. what's the right way to be thinking about that, particularly as you see some tapering as you're describing, or at least expect to see some tapering as you're describing in non-durables and general industrial?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think our comments around the normal seasonality, and you know, q4 used to be the strongest, and here we had q4, which contributed $25 million of revenue back into q3, so q4 wasn't the strongest this year and therefore with coming off a q4 being strongest we used to see a big drop into q1. so now you're not seeing the big drop and actually q1 will be comparable to q4.
and the way we think about them, the remaining three quarters, i would tell you with the current order entry pattern and the customer behavior that we're seeing, i would think about those quarters relatively evenly split as you think about the remaining three quarters of 2022. so q1 will still being relatively light, compared to the other quarters, but not as dramatically light as it was in the past coming off of a strong q4.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
matt, one comment i would add to that is the ordering pattern of our customers are so different and expectation of shipments are so different. so that's why you see us, sort of, changing what was traditionally a normal ordering pattern and a seasonality to our revenues from a quarterly basis, that's the big difference.
the question really is when does -- when do you return back to a normal seasonality is the perfectly good question you asked us. i wish i knew the answer to that. i would say, as our customer ordering patterns stabilize or some of these supply constraint questions that customers have in mind when they ease up is when we get to that. we are right now at best in the middle of this transition. so i think at least for this year, we don't see a typical seasonality.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. and then as a follow-up relative to what you would normally do from a pricing standpoint. is what you're contemplating for fiscal '22 more than you would normally seek to get? and if so, if you could maybe perhaps quantify that a little bit for us? and then also just maybe a little bit of commentary on m&a actionability going forward as it pertains both to t&i and medical recognizing you just completed a bolt-on in the former. thank you.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
sure. on pricing, you are right. our expectations for pricing is going to be higher than our normal price increases that we have done and the timing of them is also reflective of what we see in our businesses, right. so in 2021, we didn't talk a lot about the price increases that we have already sort of acted on in 2021 because there were not material enough or did not move the needle for the total company. but in general, our view around pricing is that we are in an inflationary period, we need to adjust pricing where we need to adjust pricing. we are cognizant of the fact that we are the price leader in the marketplace. we are adding value so we will get paid for it. so, that's on pricing. let me have joe add a little bit more color on the sort of magnitude and such and then i'll come back and answer your acquisition question.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i guess again i think historically, i would tell you we would realize approximately probably 1% on price relatively correlated to inflation. and so when you see the elevated inflation numbers that are being reported, that's how you should think about our response as it relates to pricing. but again i'll go back to naga's original comment. when you think about the composition of our cost of goods sold, material cost purchase component is not the largest factor. the largest factor is on the labor side and that says we're generally a light assembly manufacturing operation. but you are correct, the price -- the historical way that we view price increases and the historical magnitude is no longer applicable in an environment that we're in right now.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
i think, matt, it's really important, right. if the inflation is 4% or whatever -- 4% or 5%, our material cost is lower so price increase we will realize would not be the same 4%, would be different.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
on the acquisition question, we feel really good about our pipeline. we continue to have very good conversations. but what comes to market and when espello is going to act upon an opportunity really we don't control, but we are actively pursuing our pipeline as we always do. but we will remain financially as well as strategically disciplined and the areas we really like are test and inspection, medical, and there may be some adjacent core -- adjacent markets to our core products that if we have an opportunity, might act on them as well. so acquisition pipeline healthy, good activity, but what we act on obviously depends on what comes to the marketplace. but you can expect us to remain disciplined.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. thank you, guys.

our next question is from jeff hammond with keybanc. your line is open.
jeff hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, jeff.
jeff hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
apologize for any background noise here, i'm jumping on a flight. but just kind of back on the industrial comment around tapering into the back half. is there anything that's really informing that as you talk to your customers or is that just your normal lack of visibility that would kind of want you to put some caution around that?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
well, it is couple of things, right. one, if you look at industrial capex activity as well as gdp activity over the cycle, you can start to expect that 2023 is going to be little bit lower than where we have been at, right. so, there's going to be a natural stabilization that goes and so we expect that to get reflected in that. that is one. the second is the comps are going to be really difficult. so about the ips business, that grew 15% in the back half and this is a business historically grew 2% to 3%. so as you think about year-on-year comps, in the back half it's going to get tough. and you are right, we don't have visibility to our industrial customers as much as to be have in other places. so, that's kind of where we're at. hopefully that -- so it's three things that are going on that sort of informs our thought process.
jeff hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just back on the non-recurring charges in medical, can you just expand on where you're -- what you're doing there and kind of where you're shifting your focus? thanks.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it is just a single r&d project that we were working on with one customer on a product category that was let's just say little bit away from where we were and where we see the best opportunities today. our best opportunities are in biopharma. without going into specific details of the particular customer and such, this is an r&d project we were working on with an inventor on the outside and given the kind of robust demand that we have and a very strategic discipline around where we want to grow this business. this is one that we needed to sort of stop doing and there was a write-off related to that asset.
jeff hammond -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. thanks so much, guys.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jeff.

our next question is from chris glynn with oppenheimer. your line is open.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
thank you. good morning. so, thanks for the update on ascend's strategy and curious where you're seeing -- as you've been enacting this for a little while now where you're seeing share gain, market space creation or enablement not necessarily in a broad stroke level, but maybe some finer points on that.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that'll be great. thanks, chris. one of the areas and it's a good example to share with you than actually sort of update us with a question that jeff just asked us. if you think about our biopharma business, one of the things that as we deployed ascend, as our teams used strategic discipline with nbs next and really begin to say what is my market position in biopharma and how big is it? what are my core competencies? how can i continue to grow this? really this just opened up a whole new opportunity for this team. certainly, the market environment helps them, but it allowed them to really focus on this biopharma part of the business and grow it.
and so what we're doing is as we invest more in biopharma, we continue to get new opportunities with existing customers as well as picking up new customers. and with existing customers where we were, let's say, the number 2 or number 3, we're moving up to number 2 or number 1. so, that'll be a concrete example of how this is happening. and another example i would give you would be in our coatings businesses. in the past we would take almost every project at an equal weight. but now our teams are able to say if i have 15 projects or 10 projects in front of me, what is the best growth oriented project and what is the most profitable project and have the courage to be able to invest more in the most profitable and most growth oriented project and maybe reemphasize the ones that are not so profitable.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
great. thanks for that. and looks like the book-to-bill was maybe a little over 1.1x. curious of a couple dynamics. i understand the extended lead time and behavioral aspect, but curious of the organic book-to-bill by segment approximating the impact of the acquisition. and then does guidance assumes a reciprocal of book-to-bill at some point of the year where you just naturally flow into a negative book-to-bill given how backlog's formed currently, but maybe you might advise us not to read so much into it if a negative book-to-bill reciprocates.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i guess i would repeat some of the naga's comments, if you think about the strength in the electronics and the medical end market those are predominantly that we see going out into 2022. those are predominantly in the ats segment. whereas the industrial and consumer non-durable, where we see the growth rate stabilizing in the back half of 2022, that's predominantly in ips. so when you think about the book-to-bill ratio and the movements, there as you're quoting chris that's how it's going to correlate by segment.
christopher glynn -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
okay. thanks. i'll pick it up offline.

[operator instructions] our next question is from saree boroditsky with jefferies. your line is open.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks for fitting me in. so the earnings guidance of 18%, it's a pretty wide range. could you just talk through the assumptions that the bottom and top end of the range? what do you need to see it hit the higher or lower end of your guidance?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you know, look, when we look out the range to your point, serious plus or minus, i would say 5%, 4% in terms of earnings guidance, and i think it was mentioned earlier on the call the covid is still out there, covid and the variant and what that does to the supply chain, what that does to the medical business. i think it is a little bit uncertain. and so that contributed i think to our guidance range the uncertainty around that.
and the second is the inflation combined with some of the supply chain challenges that we saw a spike in q4. some of those supply chain challenges have started to mitigate here over the last, i would say 30 to 45 days to a degree, but how that handles as handled going forward, i think will also impact our range, but really we were pretty specific, i think in terms of our guidance for q1, where we do have good visibility, where we are seeing top-line, it's 15% at the mid-point growth consistent with what we delivered over the last two quarters combined.
and at the midpoint, the earnings growth in q1 is at 40%, 50% incremental margins in q1, consistent with what we just delivered in q4. so we're trying to give, i would say some clear guidance one quarter out, which is where we have better visibility and then leaving out a little bit broader range for the back half.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
understood. and just a follow-up on the pricing question. when your topline guidance needs about organic growth from 7% at the midpoint. how much of this is related to price versus volume? and then just on pricing, given the larger backlog how should we think about pricing roll into the p&l in 2022?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so let me take those, i guess in reverse order. you are correct in some of our businesses, we have to go out with pricing actions earlier then, it what i'll call our fiscal year-end traditional practice given some of the inflation pressures that we were seeing, other businesses stuck with their year-end price increase. and so there will be a little bit of a timing issue now, although not material, and still hopefully will be within our 55% to 57% gross margin range. but it will take some time for some of our prices to take impact effect here as we roll into 2022.
when you think about the organic growth and the full-year of 7%, you know, we don't break that down specifically, but roughly when i look at the business and the timing and the price increases you could probably think that, that's roughly 2% to 3% pricing.
saree boroditsky -- jefferies -- analyst
great. that's helpful, thanks for taking my questions.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

our next question is from walter liptak with seaport research. your line is open.
walter liptak -- seaport research -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, walter.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, walter.
walter liptak -- seaport research -- analyst
wanted to ask about kind of a follow on to the last one with regard to the -- on the range that the gross margin of 55% to 57%, if you hit the high-end of your eps range would that imply that you're at the higher end of your gross margin range as well?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you know, i think the higher-end, the eps range, i think i would tell you is more reliant on be at the high-end of the revenue. the margins throughout the year will fluctuate between that 55% and 57% as you know we've delivered last two quarters, q2 and q3 were average 57%, roughly speaking. so it will depend on product mix, but i think it's more contingent on the sales than where the margin drops out.
walter liptak -- seaport research -- analyst
okay. and the sales, it sounds like the -- if there is any kind of caution or whatever and the big range for 2022, it's around covid and supply chain. so you are talking about not demand risk, but you're talking about your shipment timing. can we get the shipments out in 2022, is that fair?
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i would also tell you that the covid impacts demand particularly medical space.
walter liptak -- seaport research -- analyst
okay, ok. great. and i want just to review the -- i think you made a comment that the last 12-week orders were up 25%. and i wonder if you could help us just get some visibility into that? was that -- what was the comp like? it sounds like it was strong in electronics and medical. maybe what around both of those ats segments, you know, is it semiconductor that's strong? is it covid related medical that's strong?
sundaram nagarajan -- president and chief executive officer
walter, i mean we generally don't break order entry by product categories, but my opening comments around where we are seeing strength in order entry is still the same, which is our electronic business order entry is really robust, pretty strong. if you think about our medical businesses, they continue to be pretty strong. and going into the first quarter, i would say the order entry for our industrial and consumer non-durable are also pretty solid, you know.
joseph p. kelley -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and so from a timing [technical issues] walter, i guess going back, i think it was chris' question a book-to-bill and what have you. it was really in q2 that we started to see that the ramp up of last year. so from a year-over-year comp standpoint, from an order entry rate standpoint, that's when the year-over-year comps on growth rates start to become more challenging relating to order entry.
walter liptak -- seaport research -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. okay, great. all right. thank you.
