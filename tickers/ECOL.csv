thank you. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from tyler brown with raymond james. please go ahead.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. jeff, so you know that you completed some 1,700 decons, i think, year to date. but i'm just curious, was that maybe $10 million to $15 million in revenue? or just any thoughts about the remainder of the year there.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so year to date, which goes through basically july, we're about 1,700 completed jobs. there's a lot more in the queue that we've seen a lot of acceleration there. from a revenue perspective, i'm going to give you through just june, or i should say, second quarter's number.
it was about $12 million.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
second quarter specifically?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. year to date, we're running at about $14 million revenue trend.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. perfect. so i know you're not giving guidance. i completely get it, things are fluid, but i am hoping for at least a little bit of help, so kind of here i go.
but in the original $240 million guide pre-covid, i think it was comprised of, say, $90 million from nrc. and i think that included, say, $40 million from energy disposal and about $150 million in the legacy ecol. so as we sit here today, it feels like maybe there's a little bit, not a lot, but some friction in the legacy ecol. the energy business has been crushed by softness factors, and that's probably no ebitda.
and then the other $50 million of nrc also feels down, but then you also have some positives from the decon work. so if i'm following the bread crumbs, my logic is leading me on a path to somewhere in the high 100s for ebitda this year. i know you're not giving guidance, but am i crazy off with my logic?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so i'll give you a little bit of color around here. and the reality is what we see today may not be what we are seeing tomorrow, and i'm just going to caveat it that way. but you're directionally correct.
on the energy waste business, we thought that was going to deliver around $40 million of ebitda this year. that definitely is going to be close or near breakeven on that. so that's taken right off the top of that. the legacy us ecology business is holding up very well.
if you really â and this is a key thing eric covered in there is that if you look at year-to-date results, we're up year-over-year on revenue as well as ebitda. and it's holding well. we're seeing some positive signs. we would have probably been at a point of exceeding what we thought if covid didn't happen.
shifting to some of the nrc business, the ones that are tied to industrial activities are actually holding up well, and the er services are holding up fairly well with the addition of the covid work. what's been absent is industrial activity. that is what we're expecting to improve, come back in the second half of the year. so all in, we're not giving guidance.
and one of the things that we kind of looked at is, we've actually looked at what street estimates are out there and we think that's a fairly reasonable estimate that's out there right now, and probably would be in line with what we would have given if we were to have given guidance. so that's where we're at now. we need a little bit more time and space, seeing what happens in q3, potentially even in q4 and how the pandemic progresses until we're ready to reestablish official guidance.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. that was extremely, extremely helpful. real quick, eric, you proactively amended the credit agreement, i think, in late june. you ended the quarter at 3.8.
and by the way, does your credit agreement use some sort of pro forma ebitda for nrc in the calculation? because it just doesn't seem â the math doesn't line up. it feels north of 3.8.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yes. so within the agreement and the way the covenant calculation works, there is â it's an adjusted â it takes our ebitda, and then there are some adjustments. we get to take credit for things like some estimated synergies or assumed synergies for the next 24 months. we're able to take credit for some certain restructuring items that are considered those things.
so it's not just straight ebitda that we report, there are adjustments to it in the covenant.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. ok. yes, that's helpful. but as ebitda kind of snakes through over the next couple of quarters, i mean, do you think that, that leverage ratio is going to remain somewhat steady? or do you think it's going to kind of crest over the next couple of quarters?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yes. as we look at it, and again, not giving guidance, but as we look at our models and various sensitivities, what it currently shows for 2020 is that we will probably crest at the end of the third quarter and then come back down a bit in the fourth quarter based on what we see today. we haven't done a lot of work on 2021. we've done some high-level work.
but as you look at it, and we put, i put a slide in the presentation today, i think it's page 16, that kind of shows you the step-up in the amendment that we did and it shows that the credit agreement with the new amendment gives us the highest level at the end of q1 in the 2021, which i think is where we probably crest because typically, q1 is where we write-up the highest. but that trend, and as you look at that slide and how that flows up, that's kind of in line with, again, what we expect right now at a high level with a fair bit of cushion built into that covenant level.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
i'll just add, tyler. we negotiated cushion.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
we definitely did.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. no, it definitely seems like it. but real quickly on the capex, so do you have kind of a good number there? is it $60 million to 65 million? or maybe my math is way off, i'm not sure.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yes, yes. yes, tyler, we still think it's in that range, $60 million to $65 million, which is which is around 30 million less than what our initial guidance for the year was.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. and just one last one. so you mentioned it upfront, but where exactly is grand view? so i think in the original guide, you guys were budgeting something like $7.5 million for that build. but to date, you've only spent like, call it, $2 million.
i don't â maybe it was back-end weighted, it always has been back-end weighted, but did it get pushed out? or are you not going to spend that money? i'm just curious what's kind of going on there?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes, we started the construction of the stabilization building in the second quarter. we expect it to be done november, december timeframe. range is about what you said. there's still some additional insurance recoveries on that building in there.
and so that's in the $60 million to $65 million of cap spend this year. we had originally thought we were going to push that off into 2021, but the reality is, is that we wanted to get that up and operational and really take a long-term focus, and i credit simon to really pushing that forward.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. great. but that is in the $60 million to $65 million?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
it is, yes.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. all right, guys. i appreciate the time. thank you.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thanks, tyler.
operator
and our next question today comes from michael hoffman with stifel. please go ahead.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, jeff, eric. thanks for taking the questions. hope you guys are doing well. so cost cuts that were achieved in the second quarter, given the trends you're seeing, what should we expect that reverses in maybe like bonus accruals, stuff like that? and what do you think you get to keep? and another way to sort of word that is, do you think you've permanently moved up at least the low end of your incremental margins?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
so yes, michael, i think so. i mean it's â certainly a lot of our â the cost savings that we've experienced so far are going to be temporary, things like travel. obviously another big component is the financial component of our incentive plans which are going to be a fair bit of savings this year. but we have done some structural things, the largest of which are obviously in the energy waste disposal business, the former sprint business.
if you look at what we've done there in terms of rightsizing the labor force, in terms of returning a lot of equipment that's been on rental and things like that, if you look at that annualized savings number kind of going forward, that number is in the $20 million, $25 million a year range. and so pretty meaningful, pretty significant that, that would be structural pending the market completely turning around, us needing to rehire people, get cranked back up. but in the meantime, that's probably the area of the most meaningful structural reductions.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and you don't anticipate a reversal of any of the incentive comp accruals by the end of the year based on what you have as line of sight in the no-guidance guidance?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
that's correct.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. what would it take for those to come back? like as a percent of the 240 original, where would you have to land for you to have the incentive comp come back on?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
so for the lowest level on most of our incentive comp plans for the financial component, they start to pay out in the 80% to 85% of the target range. so we'd have to be in the 80%, 85% of that, call it, 240 ebitda, which puts you right around 200.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. and then within the free cash flow backstop, which we appreciate, sort of round number, $50 million. should we assume we take 100% of that and pay down debt with it?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. michael, our capital priorities are going to be â we're going to continue to invest the capex that's in there, but then we will be delevering the business.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and is there any timing related to the flow of that cash for the rest of the year? or are there some oddities around cash tax payments, cycles or interest payments so we don't find ourselves on a negative in the third quarter going, ""oh my goodness, you're not going to be able to do the 50,"" because of the timing of stuff like that?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. as we kind of look at it for the year, i think third quarter will likely â free cash flow for the third quarter will likely be down quite a bit from the second quarter. i don't think it will be negative, but it will be a lot lower than the second quarter and then a really strong fourth quarter is what i'm expecting.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. if you can talk about you shouldn't do anything less than the f'19 free cash, does that put us in a situation where we're basically finishing the year at no less than overall business, f'19? and then whatever the state of the world is, there's â we're back to 3% to 5% base growth? event business is pretty regulated-driven so it's not a lot of discretionary and your industrial business is finding a leveling off, and i'm back in that 3% to 5% kind of zone plus whatever is happening in retail growth. is that the right way to think about it conceptually?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes, barring the pandemic and its impact there. i mean, i think that is a reasonable way to think about it. that's the challenges i think most businesses are having today is that we're battling something that is unknowable and is outside anybody's core expertise on here and its impact to the overall economy. but that's probably a good way to think about it.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and in the field and industrial services and the industrial weakness, it was in 2q, are there particular â like i'm assuming auto was â exposure in 2q. so that gets â they're back online, maybe not at high levels of production, but they're back online, and that's one of the comebacks. but are there better end markets that stood out particularly that were disrupted as either nonessential or made decisions to close and now are back online?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. actually, i think it's more across-the-board. i mean you call out autos. yes, we had a forced shutdown, and we almost had 100-plus people furloughed on there.
all of them are back to work, all the plants are up and operational. and so that was a comeback in june, and it's continuing to be good in those business lines. when you start talking about where we saw a lot of â on the field services side is where, say, lab pack, where you didn't â you had customers that didn't want us on site. i mean they had their own protections in place, so they weren't doing business.
and so those are starting to come back in there. and that's where on the field services side in the second quarter we saw most of the most of the drag.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
the other one, michael, we saw a pretty significant drag in the second quarter was â and again, this is for field and industrial services, on the transportation and logistics. just a lot less or fewer opportunities as things were shut down on the transportation side from the services perspective in the second quarter.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then the emergency response piece of nrc, it's typical, business has been 15,000, 20,000 of these small little spills. it's outbreaks, to tank leaks or truck leaks, things like that. how do you see the pattern of that trend sequentially? is it consistent with the onboarding again of the customer broadly? or is it more â is it a big customer exposure? small customer exposure? i'm just trying to understand how to think about influences.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
it's really miles driven. i mean if you really get to it, most of those accidents and occurrences on the er side is from transportation mishaps. and we have seen recovery in all of that. it's nowhere near pre-covid levels.
and so the positive sign is that we are seeing a recovery. but, i mean, i don't know where you're at in the world, but our transportation levels are a lot down from a traffic pattern perspective in almost all of our markets that we've seen.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
so this is the total country vehicle miles traveled and lots of cars on the road and they â results in accidents? because vehicle miles traveled are off the bottom. there's a 70% recovery off the bottom, but we're still well below historic levels in rush hour, things like that or nowhere near back. that's what you're referring to?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
that is what i'm referring to, and we actually started seeing all of that, and that started recovering in june, and we started seeing our â what i call industrial activity er services, that's been consistently going up, and we continue to see that in july as well.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then lastly for me. remediation in that field and industrial line has got to be highly discretionary. so it kind of is a canary in a coal mine.
what's happening with that?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
it's actually trending up. this kind of correlates a lot to our event business on the waste side. remediation is very similar. we are not seeing customers pulling projects.
we're actually seeing a lot of customers bringing bid proposals and things to the table. so second half of the year for our remediation group is trending really positive right now with a number of contracts that we've won and are planned to go. so that's the irony in all this is call it, manufacturing down slightly just from the shelter-in-place and things like that, things that are on construction sites, remedial activities, things like that. it continues to move.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
all right. and then last for me. on the retail side, are there any major bids outstanding that could lead to ongoing incremental growth here at this healthy double-digit pace?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
sure. steve, do you want to address that for michael?
steve welling -- executive vice president of sales and marketing
sure, michael. we actually have four new awards that are kicking in. they started in second quarter, but should benefit second half, probably more than $9 million to $10 million just in ramping over the next few months. so yes, we are having success there, and we see future growth over the next couple of years.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks. thanks for taking questions.
operator
[operator instructions] today's next question comes from jeff silber with bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much. in your prepared remarks, when you talked about the event business, you mentioned the strong pipeline. can we get a little bit more color in terms of the type of projects in that pipeline and what you're expecting? thanks.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes, jeff. i'm going to let steve address the event side.
steve welling -- executive vice president of sales and marketing
yes. so there's a combination of things. we have multiple radioactive projects going to our sites in idaho and michigan. we have some court-ordered cleanups with waste streams like mercury and lead and chromium.
so it's a combination of things, but we're not seeing any slowing there. the pipeline remains strong and we continued on quite a few of these projects over the last six months without much delay.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
and when you have those court-ordered projects, those are considered essential even if it's in areas that are locked on, that's still something that you're be able to do?
steve welling -- executive vice president of sales and marketing
remediation in a lot of areas is considered essential when you're cleaning up the environment. one of the reasons that some of these companies have continued to handle the work is if you think about other parts of the economy being shut down, there's not as much traffic. you can get in and do the remediation without all the same concerns. you can actually go faster, which means the remediation company is making more money.
they're able to move trucks without all the controls because there's not the same level of traffic or concern as if things were moving at full pace.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's actually very interesting. and then just a quick numbers question. your free cash flow is really strong.
were there any specific items to call out in the second quarter? like i'm assuming there was a payroll tax deferral. anything else like that would be great.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes, jeff. we did and are taking advantage of the payroll tax deferral, which we think for the full year in 2020 is going to contribute about $8 million of free cash. and so a portion of that, obviously, is in there. the other piece that we saw â or one of the big drivers that we saw is we've actually â from a working capital perspective, we had a pretty strong quarter in the second quarter.
really good collections. we're monitoring collections very closely as is everyone and fingers crossed, things are still going very well from that perspective. and so you've seen some working capital pickups around our receivables and going the other way around the payables as well. so i would say that was one of the biggest drivers is just working capital and focusing and really getting â doing a great job from a collections perspective.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. thanks for the call appreciate it.
operator
and our next question today is a follow-up from tyler brown at raymond james. please go ahead.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. reat. thanks for the call appreciate it.i'm not sure if simon is on, but i have an operating question. so pretty much all of your rail partners have implemented precision scheduled railroading.
i know you're a heavy rail user. i'm just curious what you're seeing from a rail service perspective. are you seeing better turn cycles? is that driving costs down? or are you guys rethinking your gondola needs?
steve welling -- executive vice president of sales and marketing
i would say it's really been steady as she goes. i mean thinking back on our projects that we've seen improvement, i can say i haven't heard many issues, and i think they've been moving projects. they've been moving at pace. so i'd say it's really been very consistent.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
i appreciate. i just was curious. thank you.

and ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks.

good day, and welcome to the us ecology, inc. second-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, today's event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to eric gerratt, chief financial officer.
please go ahead, sir.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
good morning, and thank you for joining us today. joining me on the call this morning are chairman, president, and chief executive officer, jeff feeler; executive vice president and chief operating officer, simon bell; and executive vice president of sales and marketing, steve welling. before we begin, please note that certain statements contained in this conference call that do not describe historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. since forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
factors that could cause results to differ materially from those expressed include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission. these risks and uncertainties also include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, the microeconomic impact of specific end markets in which we operate and our expectations for the financial results for 2020. management cannot control or predict many factors that determine future results. listeners should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management's views only on the date such statements are made.
we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. for those joining by webcast, you can follow along with today's presentation. for those listening by phone, you can access today's presentation on our website at www.usecology.com. throughout yesterday's earnings release and our call and presentation today, we refer to adjusted ebitda, adjusted earnings per diluted share, cash earnings per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow.
these metrics are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and therefore susceptible to varying calculations. a definition, calculation and reconciliation to the financial statements of adjusted earnings per diluted share, cash earnings per diluted share, adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow can be found in exhibit a of our earnings release. we believe these non-gaap metrics are useful in evaluating our reported results. we'd also like to point out that our second-quarter results include contribution from the nrc group holdings acquisition that closed on november 1, 2019.
throughout this presentation, we often refer to nrc group holdings as nrc. we have also provided data on a stand-alone basis for us ecology, which is referred to as legacy us ecology. similarly, for stand-alone nrc data, we refer to that group as legacy nrc. this disaggregation is an attempt to provide increased transparency and understanding of the underlying business.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to jeff. 
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thank you, eric, and good morning, everyone. i hope you and your families have remained safe during these uncertain times. before i have eric review the second-quarter results, i'd like to update everyone on how us ecology is managing through the last few months, given the impact of covid-19 to the economy and our customers. for those that are following on our webcast presentation, please direct your attention to slide 6.
during the second quarter, in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we took swift action to deploy safety protocols throughout our organization, mobilized 30% of our workforce to work from home. using our established networks and expanding our procurement channels, we were able to secure valuable ppe to ensure that our teams and customers were properly protected. with our services deemed essential by the u.s. government, we implemented our business continuity plans and i am pleased to report that we have been able to remain operational during the entire pandemic thus far with no lost days.
this focus on safety, process and protecting our team members was critical in mitigating the spread of the disease, particularly in hot zones, where many of our team members are deployed. to safeguard the financial strength of the company, we implemented proactive and prudent measures to our operating plan, reducing costs and capital spending. our capital preservation initiatives included a reduction of approximately 30% to our planned 2020 capital expenditures, the suspension of our quarterly cash dividend, cost controls including deferment of noncritical activities, elimination of discretionary spending and rightsizing the organization where needed. these actions are anticipated to generate up to $70 million of annual cash savings, providing the flexibility to preserve our talented workforce and position us to take advantage of the opportunities as the market rebounds.
these actions also supplement our strong operational cash flow generation, providing added financial flexibility as we navigate these unprecedented times. in fact, our free cash flow during the quarter almost tripled to prior year levels, allowing us to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our net debt position since the first quarter. during the second quarter, we amended our credit agreement to temporarily increase our leverage covenant through march 31, 2022, allowing for further financial flexibility. i continue to be thoroughly impressed with the dedication, execution and adaptability of our 3,500 team members who have continued to service our customers despite these unparalleled and stressful conditions.
they continue to provide safe and compliant solutions to protect human health and the environment, which is exactly what is needed today. this includes our covid-19 safe operations program, a new proactive cleaning and decontamination solutions package for commercial and government customers. this multifaceted program supports a full range of business needs to safely reopen and resume operations, including onetime or ongoing decontamination, preventative cleaning, and waste disposal services, all from one trusted partner. through the end of july, we completed 1,700 covid-19 responses which accelerated in late june and july as infection rates increased on reopening.
looking at the quarter, we saw revenue declines across most business units compared with our budgeted 2020 expectations. as expected, the month of may was the low point, slightly below april levels. we saw a noticeable pickup in june as businesses started to reopen. looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic that we will continue to see sequential monthly improvement, barring any major pockets of the united states or eastern canada shutting down again.
despite the external challenges caused by the pandemic, our teams continue to move the company forward through the execution of long-term strategic initiatives. specifically, during the quarter, we completed the construction and expansion of our enhanced drum handling capabilities at our nevada operation, which will allow for more efficient treatment; implemented five new retail account programs; implemented our smarter sorting retail technology pilot program in three key markets; deployed $4 million of capital on new high roi growth projects; launched a new customer interface technology that we believe will be best-in-class for our customers to use our services, obtain data and manage their waste management needs; opened up our global emergency response operations center; commenced the reconstruction of our grand view stabilization building; focused on a number of environmental, social and governance initiatives, including advancing our diversity and inclusion program; and starting the operation of our aerosol recycling technology. and these significant accomplishments were carried out while making material progress on the nrc integration efforts. this is just a small sample of what we've been doing during the pandemic.
shifting to the highlights on the quarter from a financial side on slide 8. my big takeaway for the quarter is the resiliency of our business model. despite the headwinds and turbulence in many of the markets that we serve, including energy, the diversification of our services and collection of irreplaceable assets allowed us to continue to generate strong cash and produce solid financial results. during the quarter, total revenue was $213.9 million up 37% over the same quarter last year.
nrc contributed $70.4 million in the second quarter of 2020 and was down 19% sequentially from the first quarter of 2020. legacy us ecology saw a revenue decline of 8% compared to the second quarter last year and 7% decline sequentially from the first quarter of 2020. during the quarter, total company adjusted ebitda was $38.7 million. legacy us ecology's adjusted ebitda was down 6% when excluding over $2 million of insurance proceeds for business interruption claims recognized in the second quarter of 2019.
sequentially, legacy us ecology's adjusted ebitda was up 8% from the first quarter of 2020. nrc contributed $5.2 million of adjusted ebitda during the quarter, which included a $2.1 million adjusted ebitda loss from our energy waste disposal services business which was hardest hit of all of our business lines. we reported an adjusted loss of $0.08 per diluted share, which included a higher than expected effective income tax rate due to the near breakeven results and included approximately $0.14 per diluted share of noncash amortization of intangibles related to nrc. as i mentioned earlier on, despite these softer results, we were able to increase our free cash flow to $18.7 million during the quarter, up from $6.5 million in the same quarter last year.
diving into some more details on slide 9. legacy us ecology's environmental services segment revenue declined 9%. base business was the primary contributor of that decline, down 10% from the second quarter last year and down 8% sequentially from the first quarter of 2020. we continue to see growth in our event business, which was up 12% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially from the first quarter of 2020, helping to offset some of the impact of the shutdown had on our base business.
we also were able to expand our environmental services segment ebitda margin in the second quarter of 2020 by over 240 basis points to 44.1% compared to the same quarter last year. in our legacy field and industrial services segment business, revenue declined 6% in the second quarter from the same quarter last year. most of the service lines were negatively impacted by the pandemic shelter-in-place orders and related business shutdowns, especially those service lines that required our field teams to be on site. this led to an ebitda margin contraction during the quarter.
a bright spot continues to be our strong growth in our small quantity generation services led by our retail services. strong year-over-year growth in our retail services more than offset double-digit declines in other small quantity services like lab pack, ltl and household hazardous waste, which were more impacted by the shelter-in-place orders. our emergency response business line also saw year-over-year increases as our legacy us ecology operations responded to covid-19 decontamination services, benefiting from the cross-selling efforts of nrc services, offsetting the lower industrial based emergency response activities. despite positive developments in our business in june and into july, the evolving health crisis and its impact on local and regional business activity levels is resulting in a continued level of unprecedented uncertainty in the industrial economy.
as such, it continues to be difficult to provide 2020 guidance with any degree of accuracy. we do expect our second quarter will be the lowest quarter in 2020 with a healthy recovery anticipated in the second half of the year. despite the second half recovery, operating results will remain below our original expectations we established pre-covid. many of our field services that were hit the hardest by the economic shutdown are expected to resume at an accelerated pace, but are not expected to recover to pre-covid levels in 2020.
we expect our base business to continue its rebound at a slower pace, mirroring industrial activity. partially offsetting expected base business softness will be continued growth in our event business on active shipments and a strong pipeline of projects expected to commence in the third and fourth quarters of this year. we expect industrial based emergency response services to increase as business activity level increases. this will be in addition to responding to the high demand covid-19 decontamination events that have continued to accelerate as the infection rates rise as well as other weather and natural disaster responses.
we experienced in the second quarter â as we experienced in the second quarter, our energy exposed businesses that were the most severely impacted, and we expect them to be operating at near breakeven from an adjusted ebitda basis for the full year in 2020. despite the overall lower levels of business activities, we do not â we do expect to deliver strong year-over-year free cash flow generation in 2020 over 2019 levels. in summary, the financial flexibility of our business model, continued free cash flow generation, strong financial liquidity provided by cash on hand and available capacity on the company's lines of credit and the dedicated workforce will allow us to navigate these challenging times and position the company to quickly capitalize on opportunities for growth as business conditions begin to recover. with that, i'll turn it over to eric for some more details.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
thanks, jeff. as i cover the detailed financial review, i'll be discussing consolidated results that include nrc before i dive into the legacy us ecology stand-alone results for the quarter and the full year. starting with consolidated results on slide 12. revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $213.9 million.
revenue for the environmental services segment was $110.4 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $112.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. nrc contributed $7.3 million of environmental services segment revenue in the second quarter of 2020. the field and industrial services segment delivered revenue of $103.5 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $43 million in the second quarter last year. nrc contributed $63.1 million of fis segment revenue in the second quarter of 2020.
total gross margin was 25% in the second quarter, down from 32% in the second quarter of 2019. treatment and disposal margins for our environmental services segment were 39% in the second quarter of 2020 and reflected a loss of $2 million from nrc's energy disposal and services business. gross margin for our field and industrial services segment was 13% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 15% in the second quarter of 2019. selling, general and administrative spending, or sg&a, was $48.5 million and included $17.5 million for nrc as well as $3 million in consolidated business development and integration expenses.
this compared to sg&a of $26 million in the second quarter last year when excluding $2.5 million of business development expenses and the $4.5 million favorable property insurance recovery that was not repeated in the second quarter of 2020. adjusted loss per diluted share was $0.08 in the second quarter of 2020 compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.66 in the same quarter last year. cash earnings per diluted share, which adds back the per share impact of the amortization of intangible assets to adjusted earnings per share was $0.13 in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $0.75 per share in the second quarter of 2019. consolidated adjusted ebitda was $38.7 million in the second quarter of 2020, up 2% from the same quarter last year, reflecting $5.2 million from nrc.
this was partially offset by a 6% decline from the legacy us ecology business when excluding $2.2 million of business interruption insurance recoveries in the second quarter of 2019. shifting to legacy us ecology results on slide 13, revenues were $143.5 million in the second quarter of 2020 down 8% from $155.8 million in the second quarter last year. our environmental services segment revenues were down 9% to $103.1 million on a 25% decrease in transportation revenue and a 4% decrease in treatment and disposal revenue. as jeff mentioned, the primary decline in our treatment and disposal revenue was a 10% decrease in base business, partially offset by a 12% increase in event business in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter last year.
legacy us ecology field and industrial services revenue was $40.4 million in the second quarter of 2020 down 6% driven primarily by lower revenues in our transportation and logistics and industrial services business lines, partially offset by strong growth in our emergency response and small quantity generation service lines. gross margin for the legacy us ecology business was 33% in the second quarter up slightly from 32% in the second quarter last year. our environmental services segment treatment and disposal margin was 45% for both the second quarters of 2020 and 2019. treatment and disposal margin for the second quarter of 2019 benefited by approximately $2.2 million in business interruption insurance recoveries that were not repeated in the second quarter of 2020.
excluding this insurance recovery in the second quarter of 2019, we saw a 290 basis point improvement in the second quarter of 2020 on a more favorable service mix. gross margin for the legacy us ecology field and industrial services segment declined to 11% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 15% in the second quarter of 2019 on a less favorable service mix and lower revenues resulting from the shutdown. sg&a for legacy us ecology was $29 million compared to $24 million in the second quarter last year. sg&a for the second quarter of 2019 reflected the favorable $4.5 million property insurance recovery that was not repeated in the second quarter this year.
the increase in sg&a for the second quarter of 2020 was also partially due to higher insurance costs and higher labor and benefits related costs compared to the second quarter of 2019. legacy us ecology adjusted ebitda was down 12% to $33.5 million for the second quarter of 2020. this compares to $37.9 million in the second quarter last year. looking at the first six months of 2020 for legacy us ecology, despite the shutdown, we delivered strong results with year-over-year growth.
revenue for the first six months of 2020 was up 4% to $297.6 million. this was driven by 4% growth in our environmental services segment and 4% growth in our field and industrial services segment compared to the first six months of 2019. in addition to revenue growth, we were able to expand our gross margin by 68 basis points, which drove adjusted ebitda to $64.4 million for the first six months of 2020 which was up 5% over the same period last year. turning to slide 15.
we exited the quarter with a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity. we had cash of $122.5 million and net borrowings of $739 million at june 30, 2020. this was an improvement over our balance sheet at march 31, 2020. our operating cash flow increased to $59.5 million in the first six months of 2020, up 53% from $38.9 million in the first six months of 2019, driving our adjusted free cash flow up 86% to $34.6 million compared to $18.6 million in the first six months of 2019.
looking at our overall debt position at june 30, 2020, we had approximately $69 million of available capacity on our revolving line of credit in addition to the cash on hand. our total outstanding debt is $861.5 million which includes $448 million for our term loan b facility that matures in 2026 with only 1% required amortization or $4.5 million per year. the overall current average cash interest rate on our debt is approximately 3%. our $500 million revolving credit facility has two financial covenants, a leverage ratio of our total outstanding debt and capital leases to our trailing 12-month bank calculated adjusted ebitda and an interest coverage ratio.
as jeff mentioned, in june 2020, we entered into an amendment of our credit agreement to temporarily increase the leverage ratio from 4 times to up to 5.5 times, depending on the quarter, before returning back to the 4 times level by the end of the first quarter of 2022. our leverage ratio per the bank calculation at june 30, 2020, was approximately 3.8 times under the original 4 times level. overall, despite the current market conditions and the covid-19 pandemic, our solid liquidity and strong balance sheet will allow us to continue to operate the business with a long-term focus and position us for a strong exit from the pandemic. with that, i'll turn the call back to jeff.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thank you, eric. in summary, i am very pleased with the quarterly results given the unprecedented conditions facing us ecology and the world. the core legacy us ecology business really demonstrates the resiliency of its collection of assets and services. nrc's businesses that are tied to the industrial markets held up well, and their emergency response expertise opened up new decontamination services that are in high demand today.
the nrc businesses that service the customers in the energy sector, frankly, got dealt a tough hand, one that goes beyond normal market cycles. i am pleased to see how our teams have rapidly redirected those business lines, taking costs out and prepare for the long term recovery which will occur. the quarter also showed strong cash flow generation potential of the combined company despite the lower anticipated results. the resiliency truly highlights the intrinsic value of the collection of businesses we have today.
today, we are in excellent shape to navigate these turbulent conditions and create a sustainable future for us ecology's team members and stockholders. in closing, i'd like to thank our team members throughout the organization, from the critical frontline workers to our leadership team, for their extraordinary efforts and their unwavering commitment to servicing our customers in these most trying of times. we remain focused on those things we can control so we can respond to the improving economic conditions and seize the growth opportunities that will ensue. with that, operator, we are ready to open up the call for questions.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question will come from michael hoffman of stifel. please go ahead.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, gang. hope everybody's doing well out there. thanks for taking the questions. and by the way, love this presentation.
a nice shift here. been very transparent, so i appreciate that. within the guidance, can you help us -- you framed $29 million of decontamination work. is your assumption some of that rolls into the year early, but not all of it? and so not only are you overcoming one-timers in the ebitda, but you're also overcoming that as well, right?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll let steve address those markets there.
steve welling -- executive vice president of sales and marketing
sure. hi, michael. we ended the fourth quarter very, very strong, and that also continued into january and the beginning of february. trend is now down.
orders are down. but we're still on pace to do as much as $10 million this year in covid work. and what that does is it creates somewhat of an ebitda headwind, maybe $5 million to $6 million, but we're very confident we're going to offset that with just regular er business, hazmat er business recovering throughout the year. so give you some idea where our gap would be.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then, jeff, you framed the pandemic hit to revenues and if i think of a reopening angle, is in your guidance, is there an assumption that we are fully reopened in the numbers relative to the things that got dislocated in '20? how do i think about that?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yeah. it's a good question. i mean, we really don't know what reopening really looks like or how it's defined. but the way we're looking at 2021 is we're going to be facing some challenging conditions probably through the first half of the year as kind of our assumption.
when we get into the second quarter, we'll have a lot easier comparables. and so we are expecting growth there and not go through the balance of the year. from a reopening perspective, what we're kind of seeing right now is that we're going to have a lot more availability of vaccines toward midyear for more than just select population and demographics. and so by then, hopefully, we'll see much more normalized activities on the back half of the year.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and in your guidance, have you just assumed the rate of base recovery off of a lower number? or you've put back in the lost business and then the base recovery? that's what i'm trying to understand.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yeah. it's going to be more growth off a lower number right now, but then continue to see improvement. i think as we get toward the fourth, we're going to be seeing some more positive trends to maybe pre-pandemic levels.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then lastly, on free cash flow and the capital spending, can you give us a normalized way to think about the percent of revenue capital spending beyond this catch-up year in the big landfill investment that's being done? what's the right sort of percent revenue because you're approaching 10% this year, and i don't think that's probably the sustained number.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
well, when you include our growth investments in there, that probably is because we're going to vary those growth investments up and down depending on opportunities that we have. so if you look at it, this year is a high landfill year. a $38 million, $40 million of that, which is a high percentage of our capital spend on some landfill. and that's going to continue for a couple of years, as we've talked about previously.
maintenance programs, there is a little bit of pent-up maintenance activities in there from some of the capital preservation initiatives we put in, in 2020 but not much. i mean, it's kind of more of our normal programs. i would say that without growth, we're somewhere in that 6% to 7%. when you add growth in, that's pushing us up to that probably 9% of what you're seeing this year.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then from a free cash flow target, say, a conversion ratio, what do you think this business should be doing versus where it is right now? it was low 30s in 2020, but it's going to be at the midpoint, say, upper 30s of ebitda. but where can it be? can it be 45%, 50% of ebitda?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yes. michael, this is eric. if you look at 2020 and how we define free cash flow, which -- it's in the deck, and there's a calculation in there. based on that definition, where it's operating cash flows less capex with some add-backs for some contingent consideration payments and things like that.
but based on that definition, we're at about 40% this year, we were just over 30% last year. and if you go back to 2018, pre-nrc, we were in the low 30s. we feel pretty good about where we ended this year. i think on a longer-term basis, that 40% range is about where i'd like to see us, but on a more consistent basis.
working capital is always the wild card that can swing it a bit quarter to quarter. but i think that 40%, low 40s range is where we'd like to be on a consistent basis.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and then how do i translate that into sort of what's the leverage look like? you gave us a cheeky leverage of 4.3. i guess one of the questions would be, what is the ebitda you used to calculate that based on the bank calculation? and then what is the target for exiting this year? what's your thoughts about that?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yeah. and there is some additional items in the calculation we do for the covenant under the credit agreement. some of those relate to synergies and one-time costs and things like that. the good news is a lot of those start to fade away this year and come out of the calculation.
so by the end of the year, it will be more of a -- you'll be able to get much, much closer straight off the financials. that being said, we expect, kind of based on the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect to be under 4 times at the end of this year. and then obviously, at the higher end of the range, we'd be even lower. and then as we get into 2022, you see that really, really start to come down pretty quickly.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
all right. and then so the last question/semi comment for me is the upside surprise in the model has to do with the scope and timing of any reopening. otherwise, there's a fairly conservative view about the decon replacement and incremental underlying growth and timing of project business, let's put the question and a statement.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i think the potential upside or the big areas to watch is what is the reopening? how does that translate into industrial waste volumes coming through the network? we have been seeing very positive ism trends, and we're continuing to expect to see those coming through the network like we did in the fourth quarter on there. and then event business is going to be -- and the big wildcard is what the recovery is on the energy waste side because we're not assuming much there. it's pretty much almost flat if you really look at about -- it's a couple of million-dollar improvement.
so at the end of the day, we're seeing some real positive trends there. we don't know where it's in, where it's going to translate to, and we're being cautious on that market just because of the unknowns. and, michael, i'd also add that -- and you know this, but q1 historically is our seasonally lowest quarter. however, that will be even more prominent for the first quarter of 2021 since when we're comparing to q1 of 2020, that was pre-pandemic, and it was actually a pretty strong quarter.
so we expect q1 to be down pretty significantly from q1 last year. and then we start to pick up steam in the second and third quarters for 2021.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
so having introduced that, would you care to give us a framing of at the midpoint ebitda is 180, kind of proportioning, at least the first half, are we in the upper teens as a percentage of that number in the first quarter, then it pops in 2q and then the rest is sort of the rest of the year? that's the way to think about it?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think that's fair. i mean, if you look at q1 '21 compared to '20, i would expect in terms of ebitda, that we will probably be down from q1 2020 in a 25% to 30% range.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. all right. that helps. all right.
thanks very much.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thanks, michael.
operator
[operator instructions] and our next question comes from tyson bauer of kc capital. please go ahead.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen, and way to make it through 2020. and we'll leave that behind us, hopefully. kind of touching a little bit on what michael was talking about. you've now gone through an entire year that you're focused in on the cost structure, the incremental expenses.
how would you view that contribution profile on the margin side as business picks up, volume picks up? give us a degree of magnitude that you think that you've improved the cost structure of the business that once we do get to normalized levels, better volumes, that we're going to see much better profitability as we go forward.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yeah, tyson. i think if you look at 2020 in terms of margin, and i'll speak more in terms of ebitda margin. we ended the year at about 18% total. as you look at next year, which, again, q1 will be rough comparison and then we'll build throughout the year.
and so it won't be a full year of recovery in 2021. at that level, in terms of ebitda, ebitda margin, we're still going to be in that high teens, possibly low 20% range. i think as we continue to build out of the pandemic, as we continue down the integration path which we've seen a lot of success on, i think we really start to see traction in those margins going into 2022 and beyond. we've targeted for a long time to get back up into the 20 -- at least the low 20s and hopefully approaching mid-20s in terms of a consolidated ebitda margin over the long term.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
so a shift of the range approximately 300, 400 basis points?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
not yet. once we get into 2022 and beyond, yes.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
right. well, that's going to -- if we looked at ecology once you get this stuff behind us and what you've done, that really, what you view the company of being able to produce is in those low mid-20s range as we get more normalized operations.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yes. that's correct.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
and you're anticipating really the second half of '21 to have more or less the handcuffs come off of you and then we get into more economic drivers as opposed to some of these ancillary factors. so a run rate of the second half of '21 would be a fairly good indication of what you think you'll be as you go into the out years?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think that's fair. especially as you look at q3 and beyond, i think we'll see some really strong improvement in q2. but that's going to be as much a function of really, really low comp as anything but q3 and beyond definitely are going to be more indicative of kind of future performance.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
ok. do you know what esg score you have or have been receiving by the reporting companies? it would seem a hazardous-waste company involved with cleaning up, recycling, those kind of things, would be viewed more favorably, but is that what you're finding out in the marketplace?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
actually, tyson, we're not finding that. you would think that would be the case. so the isf score that is out there, i have it at the top of my head is, we're ranked a seven on environmental. and for those that are not familiar with that, one out of 10 is good or excellent.
so the areas that we are challenged by is there's a lot of measurement on greenhouse gases, and we are being compared with solid waste that emits those gases, and we're inorganic facilities. so we're gathering that data right now, and we don't have anything published. and that is part of the initiatives for 2021 to get that published out there. i think that will dramatically improve our score into an acceptable range.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
so to summarize, you think you're being unfairly categorized with the bigger waste management, the solid waste guys, that's not necessarily indicative of what your business is.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes, that is a fair assessment. and it's the fact that we don't have data that the rating agencies are looking for because it's really not a need to have it in the past. so it's a matter of us getting our data together and putting it out there. as far as what we're doing in on our esg scores, i think how you introduce the question is right.
i mean, we're the recipients from industrial customers on their byproducts to make sure that they are properly treated, recycled, managed, and making sure that they are not harming human health in the environment. and that is what is in our dna, and it's what we do. and it's why we have the technologies and the capabilities in place is to do that. and so this will correct itself over time once we get everything pulled together.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
and, tyson, i think you're going to see us continue to talk more and more about this and our story because i do think, and to the earlier point, there's a lot of misconceptions, if you will, and some assumptions that kind of go into and, again, as you mentioned, when you hear hazardous waste and treatment and disposal and things like that. we really do view ourselves and many of the -- of some of our esg investors that have spent time learning more about the company. also understand we really are a key part of the solution and a sustainable solution, as well as all the things we do around recycling beneficial reuse. we're constantly looking at opportunities to do that as well.
but we view ourselves as part of that sustainability solution, and we'll continue to talk more and provide more information about that.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
i'm glad you brought up that word recycling. it leads into my next question. we've seen a great focus of, as far as an investment community, on companies that have highlighted that and the benefits of doing that, especially given where the metals markets are and such. is that something that has been kind of missed with us ecology, that you do a great amount of recycling, whether it's petroleum, whether it's metals or others, and being an accumulator that just doesn't draw that focus from the investment community and the multiple?
simon bell -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes. tyson, this is simon. it's a good question. i mean, we're doing a lot really on the recycling side.
i mean, recently, launching what's 100% recycling of aerosols, which is our largest stream that comes from our retail business. we already are very heavy in the oil cycling business through a thermal desorption facility in texas to both recycles, catalysts and recovers the oil from that process. previously, that would have been disposed of in landfills and the like. we're really focusing on expanding that thermal technology more doing thermal distillation.
we do airport recycling. we hit it on multiple fronts. our wastewater treatment plants are diverting kind of the high metal content material, where we're recovering the metals out of that. and these are really great businesses with good returns.
we're really focusing on -- we process over probably approximately 1 million drums a year and finding ways to recover and reuse those drums and so we see these as both as really good businesses. and we have a lot of other things in the works as we talk about on the growth investments we're making is really heavy on the recycling in the sustainability side. so we really see a lot of good things happening in that front. whether we fully told the story to markets.
i think that's an evolving thing, definitely something we're going to be focused on.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
and, simon, since you answered here, on the event business being flat for this year, given the change in the epa focus and what we've seen in previous administrations under this political regime, would you not anticipate greater activity as we get into the back half of '21 and going into '22 and through these next couple of years of major event cleanup business?
simon bell -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
you know, it's always something we think and talk a lot about. we certainly, i think with the current administration, will be more focused and probably we'd see enforcement activity expanding, which often translates into more cleanups. the timing of that can be sometimes hard to predict. but we're also seeing some strong headwinds on the pfas side of the world, where you have -- under the 2020 ndaa, where the epa was tasked with putting out guidance on disposal of pfas.
and certainly, you look at that, they talk about some of the most proven technologies, if you will, be deep well, permitted subtitle c facilities, all assets that we have. so we certainly think and expect our customers to start getting more proactive on that side. kind of in advance of what the epa is trying to do. so short answer is, yes, i think you're going to see some headwinds there, though it can be sometimes difficult to predict, and sometimes it takes some time to change the regulations.
but certainly, we see that as a positive.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
all right. thank you, gentlemen.

good morning, and welcome to the fourth-quarter 2020 us ecology inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to eric gerratt, chief financial officer.
please go ahead.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
good morning, and thank you for joining us today. joining me on the call this morning are chairman, president, and chief executive officer, jeff feeler; executive vice president and chief operating officer, simon bell; and executive vice president of sales and marketing, steve welling. before we begin, please note that certain statements contained in this conference call that do not describe historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. since forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
factors that could cause results to differ materially from those expressed include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission. these risks and uncertainties also include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact of specific end markets in which we operate, and our expectations for financial results for 2021. management cannot control or predict many factors that determine future results. listeners should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management's views only on the date such statements are made.
we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. for those joining by webcast, you can follow along with today's presentation. for those listening by phone, you can access today's presentation on our website at www.usecology.com. throughout yesterday's earnings release and our call and presentation today, we refer to adjusted ebitda, adjusted earnings per diluted share cash earnings per diluted share, and adjusted free cash flow.
these metrics are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and, therefore, susceptible to varying calculations. a definition, calculation, and reconciliation to the financial statements of adjusted earnings per diluted share, cash earnings per diluted share, adjusted ebitda, and adjusted free cash flow can be found in exhibit a of our earnings release. we believe these non-gaap metrics are useful in evaluating our reported results. we would also like to point out that our fourth-quarter results include attribution from the nrc group holdings acquisition that closed on november 1, 2019.
throughout this presentation, we often refer to nrc group holdings as nrc. we have also provided information on a stand-alone us ecology basis, which is referred to as legacy us ecology. similarly, for stand-alone nrc data, we refer to that group as legacy nrc. this disaggregation is an attempt to provide increased transparency and understanding of the underlying business.
before i turn the call over to jeff, i would also like to point your attention to slide 5. as noted in our earnings release yesterday, in connection with our year-end 2020 reporting, we have redefined our reporting segments to better align with our strategy and to increase clarity. our new reporting segments include waste solutions, field services, and energy waste, which are defined in detail in yesterday's earnings release. throughout our presentation today, we will be referring to these new reporting segments.
all financial information presented has been recast to reflect these changes. the waste solutions segment was formerly known as the environmental services segment, with the only difference being that it now excludes the energy waste business, which is now a separate segment. the field services segment remains unchanged from what was formerly known as the field and industrial services segment and the energy waste segment represents the energy waste disposal services business acquired through the nrc acquisition. with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff. 
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thank you, eric, and good morning, everyone. it is with gratitude for the tireless work of our us ecology team members and our flexibility across our organization that i share the results of a solid quarter for the company despite the challenges faced. for those that are following the webcast presentation, i want to direct your attention to slide 6. our business continued on its path to recovery, as evidenced by strong trends in the fourth quarter that have continued into early 2021.
total company revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was up 4% year over year and up 1% sequentially from the third quarter of 2020. our field services segment led that way with double-digit growth in revenue, which drove a 57% improvement in segment ebitda. the growth was particularly strong in our legacy us ecology field services segment, which grew revenue by 16% in the fourth quarter and drove adjusted ebitda up by 46%. our base business revenue in our waste solutions segment saw a 7% sequential improvement compared to the third quarter of 2020.
looking more specifically at trends in our base business, the month of december was the strongest month of the quarter and resulted in a return to positive year-over-year growth compared to december 2019. the overall resiliency of our business, augmented by the capital preservation and cost-saving initiatives implemented earlier in the year, resulted in a 31% improvement in year-over-year adjusted free cash flow during the quarter. overall, the company delivered adjusted ebitda of $42.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and would have been in the top half of our guidance range when factoring in the $2.7 million incentive plan adjustment we gave to our front-line workers and non-executive team members. looking at the full year for 2020, the company achieved $934 million of revenue, adjusted ebitda of $170.2 million, and adjusted free cash flow of $68.8 million, up 45% from 2019 levels.
considering the difficult operating conditions that the pandemic created, our legacy us ecology business had a solid year with 2020 revenue flat with that of 2019 levels, which was a record year for the company. base business was down 7% on the lower industrial activity but was substantially made up by a 20% increase in our event business. adjusted ebitda was down approximately 4%, reflecting higher revenues in our field services segment compared to our waste solutions segment. legacy nrc was significantly impacted by the operating conditions that pandemic created in 2020.
this was most felt in our energy-exposed businesses, where revenue was 50% below our initial 2020 plan and down 40% from the prior year under nrc's ownership. our energy waste segment, which operates in the permian and eagle ford basins, delivered $1 million in adjusted ebitda for 2020, down from our original plan of $40 million. we have seen sequential improvement in this segment and expect this to continue as we see continued stability in recovery in oil prices. legacy nrc was also impacted by lower overall industrial activity, which resulted in fewer land and marine industrial-related spills and cleaning.
and there were limited large cleanups from industrial accidents or weather events like we have experienced in the past. we did experience increased business from covid-19 decontamination work, where we generated $29 million of revenue and on over 5100 events for all of 2020. we have now cycled our first year of ownership and continue to realize many benefits of this combination. in 2020, we realized net annualized synergies of approximately $13 million, which was ahead of our $7.2 million estimate coming into 2020.
cost savings came in ahead of plan, and revenue trends continued to improve. for 2021, we expect another incremental $5 million to $7 million of annualized net synergies, and we are well on track to achieve our $20 million of net synergies by the end of 2022. before i turn the call over to eric, i want to provide a brief update on slide 8 on our environmental, social, and governance initiatives that are designed to strengthen our business performance, increased reporting, and develop goals to make a lasting impact on our environment, our people and our community. in january, we launched our new esg reporting portal on our website and published our second annual sustainability and citizenship report, which reflects 2019 data.
our core purpose is to provide environmental solutions that protect human health in the environment. the data shows the positive impact our business has on accomplishing this through managing over 3 billion pounds of waste and nearly 70 million gallons of wastewater that our customers have entrusted to us for safe treatment, recycling, and ultimate disposition or disposal. we are aggressively pursuing sustainable waste solutions, including technologies to recover oil, solvents, metals, and other products through distillation and other technologies, including our aerosol recovery system that we launched in 2020. we remain focused on growing our beneficial reuse and recovery programs, which not only support long-term sustainable business practices but also align with our customers' esg goals.
we continue to upgrade our infrastructure to be more energy-efficient and deploy capital investments into sustainable technologies and solutions. this effort will continue in 2021 with new investments. we also recently announced that we are participating in a pilot study to evaluate the potential migration to electric vehicles for our over 1,100 vehicle fleet. as to social responsibility, taking care of our team members remains top priority.
it all starts with our continued investment and focus on our safety 360 program, designed to protect our team and promote safety first. i am pleased with our 2020 results, showing year-over-year improvement and are at levels that are significantly below industry averages. our focus on our people goes well beyond these great health and safety priorities. we have created a special culture that is built on inclusion, respect, protecting the environment, and continuous improvement in everything that we do.
we invested in our team members with a total rewards program that includes incentive plans, top-tier medical benefits, learning, and development programs, and in 2020 and 2021, includes incremental covid-19 paid time off to deal with these uncertain times. to this end, as i mentioned in the earlier comments today and in yesterday's press release, our 2020 results include a discretionary increase of $2.7 million to our non-executive incentive plans to recognize our team for the tremendous work they accomplished throughout 2020 in these most trying of times. we continue to see success in these programs, helping us lower our overall turnover levels and allowing us to recruit great talent. these programs have allowed us to improve our year-over-year diversity across the organization.
finally, we are not sitting idly by when it comes to governance. we constantly evaluate best-in-class governance practices and adopting those that make sense with our strategy. most recently, we further expanded our already diverse and experienced board, adding additional talent, experience, and diversity. and i welcome mack hogans' valued contributions as we work together building upon this great company.
i look forward to updating all of you as we continue to make significant progress in this area throughout 2021. with that, i'll turn it back to eric.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
thanks, jeff. starting with consolidated results on slide 10. revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $241.1 million. revenue for the waste solutions segment was $105.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, down 7% compared to $113.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
the decrease was due to a 13% decline in transportation revenue and a 5% decrease in treatment and disposal revenue. the decline in our treatment and disposal revenue was due to an 8% decrease in base business and a 3% decline in event business in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter last year. base business increased 7% and event business declined 23% sequentially when compared to the third quarter of 2020. the field services segment delivered revenue of $130.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $105.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
nrc contributed $75.2 million of segment revenue in the fourth quarter compared to $57.7 million for our two months of ownership in the fourth quarter of 2019. excluding nrc, the field services segment revenue increased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by increases in our emergency response, small quantity generation, and transportation service lines. total gross margin contracted approximately 200 basis points to 28% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period last year. this was a result of lower waste volumes in both our waste solutions and energy waste segments and the impact of a business interruption insurance claim of $2.1 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by a 470-basis-point expansion in our field services segment margin.
selling, general, and administrative spending, or sg&a, was $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 when excluding $4.1 million of business development and integration expenses. this compares to $46.7 million in the fourth quarter last year when excluding $19.5 million of business development and integration expenses and favorable property insurance recoveries recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. we recorded non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $104.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to our energy waste and field services segments. these non-cash charges were primarily related to the finalization of our purchase accounting for the nrc acquisition and an increase in the discount rate applied to some of the projected cash flows since our last assessment.
adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.19 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.38 in the same quarter last year. adding back the impact of intangible asset amortization, cash earnings per diluted share was $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $0.56 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. adjusted ebitda was $42.8 million in the fourth quarter, down 7% from the fourth quarter last year. looking at full-year results for 2020 on slide 11, revenue was $933.9 million.
adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.61 in 2020 compared to $1.96 in 2019. cash earnings per diluted share, which adds back the per share impact of amortization of intangible assets, was $1.48 for 2020 compared to $2.44 in 2019. adjusted ebitda was $170.2 million for 2020, compared to $149.4 million in 2019. turning to slide 12.
we exited the quarter with a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity. we had cash of $73.8 million and over $120 million of available capacity on our revolving line of credit at the end of 2020. net borrowings were $712 million at december 31, 2020, which was an improvement over our net borrowings at december 31, 2019. our operating cash flow increased to $107.1 million in 2020, up 35% from $79.6 million in 2019, driving our adjusted free cash flow up 45% to $68.8 million, compared to $47.5 million in 2019.
our bank covenant leverage ratio was 4.3 times at december 31, 2020, well under the 5.25 times covenant level for the quarter. overall, our solid liquidity and strong balance sheet will allow us to continue to operate the business with a long-term focus and position us for continued recovery and growth as we move beyond the pandemic and its related market pressures. with that, i'll turn the call back to jeff.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
all right. thank you, eric. we're encouraged by the trends we see and have seen in the fourth quarter and the continued momentum we're seeing in early 2021. with industrial production metrics continuing to strengthen and early signs of increased business activity levels, we are optimistic for what lies ahead.
we are even more encouraged by the fact that we are seeing these positive signs across most of our service offerings. moving to our outlook on slide 13. overall, we expect to see these positive trends drive growth in revenue, adjusted ebitda, and adjusted earnings per share across all of our businesses. we also expect to report growth in our adjusted free cash flow despite a 50% increase in our planned capital expenditures as we return to our regular capital deployment programs.
our expected return to growth in 2021 also assumes that certain of our capital preservation initiatives of last year are lifted and more normal business activities and associated costs resume. all in, we expect that our 2021 full-year performance to produce total revenue between $940 million and $990 million, adjusted ebitda between $175 million and $185 million, adjusted free cash flow between $60 million and $77 million, adjusted eps should be between $0.65 to $0.88 per diluted share, cash eps between $1.46 to $1.69 per share, and capital spending between $85 million and $90 million. with regard to capital spending, we are expecting to return to more normalized levels with elevated capital spending levels in 2021 on landfill. in addition, we are continuing to grow our company organically by investing in businesses and new technologies and investing in up to $21 million into new and ongoing projects.
as we sit here today, this guidance reflects our expectations that we will return to growth in 2021 with increases of up to 6% in revenue and up to 9% in adjusted ebitda. for the next several slides, i'm going to have eric walk you through our adjusted ebitda bridge, getting you from 2020 actual results to 2021.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
thanks, jeff. on slide 14, you can see an adjusted ebitda bridge for our 2020 results to the midpoint of our 2021 adjusted ebitda guidance range. included in our actual results for 2020, we have a number of favorable one-time benefits that are not expected to repeat in 2021. these favorable adjustments accounted for just over $9 million of adjusted ebitda in 2020 that we will grow through operationally in 2021.
the favorable adjustments included a cash medical insurance settlement dating back to the mid-'90s, a canadian government covid-related grant, and several favorable true-ups related to earn-outs on acquisitions made by the legacy nrc organization. as shown on this bridge, our growth starts with improving results in our waste solutions segment where we expect growth in 2021 on the back of an improving industrial economy. we expect base business to return to growth ranging from 5% to 7% in 2021, with much of this recovery expected to occur starting in the second quarter of 2021 through the balance of the year as the first quarter of 2020 included strong pre-pandemic trends. we continue to see positive trends in our event business pipeline and expect a healthy year of activity.
given the strong comparative period in 2020 and with several larger projects completing, we are currently expecting our event business to be flat to up slightly in 2021. we also expect to see solid growth in our field services segment through a combination of improved industrial activity increased business investment in services, implementation of contracts won in 2020 in our sqg and total waste management service lines, and further benefits from additional nrc integration activities. our energy waste segment is expecting moderate growth in dollar terms. despite the positive recovery in oil prices and increased activity levels, we are expecting limited contributions from this business unit, with most of the recovery commencing in the back half of 2021 and accelerating in 2022.
our corporate segment is increasing primarily as a result of a shift of support-related costs from our operating segments to the corporate segment as a result of integration and regionalization activities. to assist with your modeling, we've summarized these regional overhead cost shifts by segment to the corporate segment in the appendix of today's presentation. in addition, we are expecting costs to return to more normal levels in compensation, incentive compensation plans, and a higher level of business activity such as travel that did not occur in 2020. as jeff mentioned, we expect ebitda growth of up to 9% in 2021 over 2020 levels and up to 15% growth when factoring out the favorable 2020 adjusted ebitda benefits.
with that, i'll turn it back to jeff.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
2020 was nothing short of a challenging year. the trends that we saw toward the end of the year and continuing on early in 2021, compounded with the steady vaccine rollout and declining covid cases, gives us optimism of a much better year than in 2020, especially in the second half of 2021, with solid momentum carrying us into 2022. i am so very proud of the entire us ecology team and their ability to persevere and thrive during these times. as a result of the hard work of this past year, we are in excellent shape, both strategically and financially, and are positioned to continue to capitalize on opportunities ahead as the industrial economy continues to recover, and we move the pandemic to the rearview mirror.
this will allow us to continue to build upon our sustainable future for us ecology's team members and stockholders. and with that, operator, you can open up the call for questions and comments.

operator
[operator instructions] the first question comes from michael hoffman with stifel. please go ahead.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi, jeff, eric. thanks for taking my questions. hope you're having a good friday. i appreciate that you got, you opened the year a little bit ahead of plan, you're reaffirming the guidance and i don't think companies are supposed to be trying to chase their guidance up prematurely.
how would you reflect on the trend inside the guidance though? is this have more momentum to the upside than not given what you're seeing?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
i mean, we're one quarter into it, another month behind us after today with april on here. and what i would say is, is the year is looking, the way we intended it to look maybe it's a little bit better. i mean there's a lot of green shoots that are out there. and our first-quarter results, they were strong results given the fact pattern.
but you also put into context some of the continued start and stop activities that we've seen with the ongoing pandemic, but we also had some major weather events that disrupted everything. so, all in, i'm really proud of what we delivered in the first quarter. and i think it does set us up for a strong 2021. but there is still nine months to go.
and we're going to continue to execute our strategy in our plan. and we have conviction in our guidance range that we released just back in february and reaffirmed it yesterday.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and when we think about cadence, is there anything particular about what happened is exited 1q and what you know since march april, essentially done about, how to think about the cadence, is this sort of originally when we all have these conversations in february, it was kind of a steady, almost ratable march through the year. does it picked up a little bit speed in 2q or does it still stay pretty ratable as far as the top line?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
thinking about the cadence of the top line, normal seasonality will play in and will drive it. so, yeah, we're expecting q2 to be sequentially better than q1 and q3, sequentially better than q2. and they're talking about cadence from march to april, i would say, we're seeing similar patterns. and w -- when you get into the first quarter and look at it by month, march was the strongest month that we had.
so, all of that is pointing in the right direction. there is nothing that's given us a lot of pause there in there. and i would say that we're on track to deliver that range and execute on our plan.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and then you mentioned and it's not the first time i've heard this, but some of the supply disruptions are slowing the recovery of some of the customer base. that doesn't look like that's going to get any relief in this calendar year. and is that that's all accounted for in the guidance, as well as that that you weren't looking for a big lift on reopening per se more of an overall improvement in the industrial economy broadly?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
so all of that factored in michael in what we're seeing. and i think that that when you think about the choppiness we referred to in q1, we saw it with a lot of closures and kind of the high rates of infection that we saw in the pandemic, we've seen that alleviate. but on the supply chain information, it is impacting our customers. if you go and read the detailed commentary on what industrial customers are staying through ism and things like that, they claim, they can't meet their demand because one supply changes disruption, but also labor shortages.
and those are some of the things our customers are challenged with to regain and get back to i'll call pre-covid levels and growth there upon. and so, those are things that are all factored in. but we're seeing it in our customer base, and it creates ongoing choppiness.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and then last two for me. texas got snot beat out of it from a weather issue, power shutdown and you are not hiding behind any weather commentary. but i'm just curious if you hadn't had a loss of power for a week or more, what the difference in the numbers might have been?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
we haven't even tried to attempt to quantify that michael. from our operational perspective, some of our business lines were down 10 and 10 days to two weeks, others reopened fairly rapidly, especially in our services arm and we had a little bit of freeze damage from the weather. but the reality is february was definitely impacted pretty hard in that region. we did see a nice uptick in march in that area, which probably is a little bit of pickup on there.
but when we look at the whole of the equation, it's probably a setback because some of that business will never regain, because our customers were shut down. but for the most part, we still think that business conditions are robust enough down there that we'll be able to recover.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
so closing the loop on that, you had a good quarter better than your plan and you had to deal with all of that. so, if without it, it would have been that much incrementally better?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
absolutely.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
debt repayment, are there any structural limits on any of the terms of the debt make whole agreements anything like that that can allow you to keep walking these numbers down as you generate cash?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
no. michael, this is eric. we're able to pay the facility down as quickly as we'd like. so, there are no limitations on either obviously on the revolver, but even on the term loan b.
the only limitations we have for the first year, there were some limitations on that, but that's, it's now wide open and we can pay down as quickly as we want.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and one last one, you opened the year saying we expect decontamination work to trend down. it was actually better in 1q than your thought. is it trending down or is it holding up?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. it's actually trending down. so, we saw a surge in january and the first part of february, and it's been trending down since then, which is what we anticipated and it really follows the caseloads that are out there. and from the good side of things that for me humanity standpoint is we are seeing ourselves getting ahead of this pandemic at least here domestically.
and so, if we see a risen case load, i will imagine that business line will benefit from it and otherwise they will be replaced by hopefully resurgence of industrial-based activities.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thanks.
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, michael.
operator
the next question comes from tyler brown with raymond james. please go ahead.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. so, just to be clear, there's not really much additional de-con work in the guide for the rest of the year?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. i mean, no.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and then, i mean, i know the reopenings difficult to discern free all. but and you don't talk a lot about monthly trends, but you did kind of make some mentions about march. is there any way you can kind of let us know what base did in march or is it not really, just any color on exactly how much base was up in march?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
from a year-over-year perspective, directionally, it was up about 10%. now, the reality is if you go back to march of last year, we probably, we were starting to shut down in the second week or halfway through. so, probably, march last year was a little bit lower when you look at the monthly cycle on that. so, i think that's elevated.
when you look at our base business for the full year, we are still confident that we're going to be able to deliver growth for between 5 to 7% on that and that's with us being down 3% in the first quarter. so, everything is trending the way we expected it. it could be a little bit better than what we said on that side of things. but overall, when you equal everything out, we're still very confident in what we have for guidance out there.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
and so, q2 implicitly is like plus double-digit range on the base side?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
i would expect a very healthy rebound in q2 from a growth perspective.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
and then, just, again, i don't know if you can put a finer point on q2 just to help us with our models. but you say it should improve sequentially. i mean, are we talking something like 5 to $10 million of ebitda sequentially just to help us kind of get, because q2 is just a really funny quarter?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
i think that's, this is eric, tyler. i think that's probably a reasonable range. if you look at our second quarter last year, we did ebitda of just under $39 million. and so, i would expect us to be quite a bit better than that and that we can see laid out is probably reasonable.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, so jeff, you talked a little bit about investing in your people and about your kind of human capital and how you're really focus there, which is great. first off, i'm curious how many drivers do you actually employ roughly?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're right around 250 to 300.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
and so, how hard is that, is that group to retain and recruit in the current environment? i mean, we obviously cover the truckers. i mean, there is a lot going on out there. i know it's a different business. it's more of a go home at night business.
but curious, are you seeing like real, substantive pressures on hiring retaining in that particular group?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
we continue to see challenges in that group. and you nailed it. it's a demographic that it's not growing. and there's a lot of competing pressure, not only from our side of the world, but many other industries in there.
so, yes, we're continue to see challenges in there. simon, maybe you can elaborate on some of the things that we're doing.
simon bell -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
so this is simon. it is a challenge as jeff says. what we're doing is we're certainly launching programs that kind of provide retention. we're launching programs to kind of pay for schooling and encourage our employees to get their cdls, really creating committees to better understand what is important to the driving community and what we can do to support them.
as you mentioned, we do have both long haul and short haul. but certainly, we think we can differentiate ourselves in some of the short-haul and really just listening to their driver's needs. and so, as jeff said, it's something we are fiercely focused on, but, and we will be for a while i suspect.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
so, some of those jobs, like i said are a little bit more ltl in nature, where i guess are coming home. but there is a subset, where you're actually laying those guys down at night that that long-haul piece, it's probably a little bit tougher to recruit?
simon bell -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
absolutely. i mean, you think of our retail program in particular that -- those guys will be on the road for several days and then definitely a more challenging?
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
interesting. ok. and then, back to the nrc synergies. so, correct me if i'm wrong, because i'm going off top of my head here.
eric, i think you of the 20, i think is the number you may be got 10 last year. i think you were guiding to something like three to five. but then, jeff, it sounded like there is more optimism there. so, i'm just curious, are you basically tracking ahead of what you had originally thought on the synergies for this year, are we kind of right in line? you're just hoping that by the end of the year, you will be fully run rated.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
so, we're tracking a little bit ahead of what we thought for 2021 and it's really driven on the revenue side of things and i talked about the momentum, that's definitely continuing. and we're seeing a lot of opportunities emerged as we continue to really get more of a cohesive sales group across the organization and driving those results. and we're seeing opportunities there. so, we do believe that by the end of the year, we'll have achieved that $20 million run rate and there is potentially upside to that next year.
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
and as a reminder, tyler, the $20 million number was one that we put out at the time of the acquisition that we thought we'd be at that run rate by the end of 2022. so, we feel like we're a year ahead of schedule.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
and then just my last one. maybe coming back to the energy business. so, i think you talked a little bit about it jeff for kind of talked about on the periphery. but, obviously, oil prices have moved.
i'm just curious if you're starting to see any green shoots out there in the oil patch. are you starting to see any building confidence that maybe that business could be a positive delta to what you're expecting for this year?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, tyler, there's definitely green shoots in there. i mean, we definitely were ahead of plan and what we have anticipated on that business. we've seen rig counts increased dramatically from the low point, but they've increased, they've increased sequentially as well. and it's in both of the basins, both the permian and eagle ford that we're -- that we planned.
the reality though and the sanity check is we're still at 50% levels of where we were pre-pandemic. so, all the trends are good. the activity is increasing. we're seeing a lot of green shoots out there.
but we still have a ways to go to get back to that pre-pandemic level.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
and then, just real quickly, can you remind me what the mix is? is it roughly half and half permian versus eagle ford or is it skewed one way?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
from a revenue standpoint, it's about half and half on there. so, where our strength right now is in eagle ford, because we have two assets that we're put in place just before the pandemic set in and the permian. those are -- they are trending positive, but they're still not to where we want them to be.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
and is the capex on that business roughly set as then you've kind of developed the footprint of the landfills probably built-out the first cells. are you kind of good on the capex side, so that when we do see volumes come back in it, there is not a tremendous amount of capital mean?
simon bell -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
tyler, this is simon. we are certainly planning and moving forward with our landfill construction this year. so, we're going to make sure we have capacity for whatever the demand is. and we're also continuing with some refurbishment of equipment.
and certainly, we're planning for a recovery and we're spending our capital accordingly.
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
and to just clarify that a little tyler. the landfill simon is referring to is the one in the eagle ford that that's the first one that was built. and so, its current cell is almost, it's been operating for what four years and so it's just the next cell at that facility.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
good deal. all right, guys. thanks so much for the time.
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, tyler.
operator
the next question comes from jeff silber with bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you so much. actually, just wanted to follow-up from one of tyler's first question, about hiring and wage inflation and retention. we talked about truck drivers. are you seeing, if it is anywhere else throughout the company? i know, we've got a lot of other companies complaining that it's tough to find good quality skilled workers out there.
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think everybody is competing for the same talent. i mean, the reality is, not only is are we competing against other companies, but my personal opinion is i think that there, we're competing against some of the government subsidy programs that are out there and that will hopefully will free up here the summer timeframe. but i think the combination of those two is creating a challenging condition to recruit frontline workers.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and you mentioned the government subsidies. so, i wanted to ask about the infrastructure plan. i know it's still early.
i know there's just some proposals. is there anything in there that you think might either help or hurt your business?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, why don't you address that?
steve welling -- executive vice president of sales and marketing
sure. hi, this is steve welling here. what we've read so far is we look to potentially increase super fund clean-up work. there is possibly a proposal to add back the super fund tax on corporations, which will provide money for those types of cleanups.
there is also when you do infrastructure improvements, usually, that means there's things that get turned down, cleaned up first before you improve. so, like bridges, there could be lead paints and other waste streams that come from that. also seeing that there is some information about improvement at schools in urban areas, which they want to remove all the lead piping. so, it looks like that would, it would be a benefit to us for sure.
it's just we don't have much detail yet.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
sure. nobody does, but that's actually good to hear. and finally, i think you alluded to this a little bit earlier. but you mentioned some of the starts and stops in terms of reopening.
are there any specific areas to call out that are doing better than others?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
so what we're seeing is the west has seen some positivity and really the gulf. and they're the ones that are starting to have been reopened and are reopening more. when we saw the start and stop is we have a lot of operations in the michigan corridor and they've been a hotspot. and so, that was a challenge in the first quarter.
but they're getting things under control. and we anticipate that that to improve here overall. and then, internationally, canada continues to struggle. they're not -- they don't have the same vaccination rates that we do here.
and i think ontario just walk back down or the province of ontario. and so, they've been struggling there. but the underlying business still seems to be gaining traction and positive momentum even though they're going through some starts and stops.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's really helpful. thanks so much.
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jeff.

the next question comes from tyson bauer with kc capital. please go ahead.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen. on the whole theme of pricing and inflation and treatment cost, whether it'd be freight or wage or other, some of the companies in the coverage universe have benefited from the inflation effects, others have suffered because of it. what is us ecology stand as far as, are you able to pass those through, get a benefit in rising pricing environment or are you trying to absorb some of those treatment costs and that's may put a little pressure on?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, why don't you talk about the pricing in what we -- the strategy we've been doing this year and i'll have eric kind of chime in on where we're seeing some inflationary challenges.
steve welling -- executive vice president of sales and marketing
so in prior years, we've done more across the board tag price increasing and this year it has been totally different. what we did is some selective price increase in certain markets, on certain waste streams and then some specific geographies, where the customer base wasn't as impacted as others. so, we have taken price increases in the first quarter. most went into effect between january 15 and february 15th on base business only.
event work, we bid case by case. but we have been doing a number of things and we're also looking, whether we potentially, one of the possibilities for maybe another increase in mid-year. but we've been able to pass the number of things along. in terms of the transportation, generally, we have a separate charge like on fuel surcharge.
that does -- when things go up or down there recovered. but for the most part, a lot of our pricing, on waste disposal side, we have the ability to do adjust. we do have some select service lines, where we're in a longer-term contract. but that's not the majority of our business.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
and tyson, just in terms of kind of the categories where, we're feeling the most pressure in terms of costs. that we've talked a lot about labor, that that's probably one of the biggest right there with it insurance. insurance is one that that everyone frankly whether in our industry or not, we're seeing pretty significant increases and have over the last couple of years, this year is no exception. steve talked about transportation.
we feel like we do have some opportunities there just based on where our contracts work to recapture, a lot of the increases there. so, the reagents in commodities, that's another area. i would say, as the companies grown and as we've kind of diversified at that that's not a significant of portion as it used to be us ecology, but it is still a meaningful cost that we're continuing to watch and monitor. and there's some pressure there as well.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
well, piggyback they targeted price increases. you only do that when you have the ability to do so. what are you seeing us as the greater leverage opportunities for you as far as certain business segments or waste streams that you can take advantage of?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, like i said what we did already was in the mid-west, we've looked at some select waste streams and particularly known it has solidification, where there seemed to be opportunities. and we're just that much more than 3 to 5%. in west coast, we're able to look at our customer base and do some things across the board in the west, that maybe we're not able to do in the gulf. right now, we're seeing the gulf recovered, which was not at all in the first quarter, we're struggling a bit in the beginning.
and then, we had to freeze. so, we may be looking to see if there's opportunities there in the future. but it's a case by case review. and we're just trying to see how things evolve as the roads get doing back to normal here.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
do you anticipate, even though they don't call it the green act that we may see some materials or other things that have not previously been considered as it is fall into that category going forward?
simon bell -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
tyson, this is simon. there was long term, yes. i think there will be some certainly you think fast, but i'll say it's a, that's a generally fairly slow process in terms of changing the regulations. but certainly, i would expect this administration to be more aggressive on that front.
but i certainly can't point to specific things in the near term.
tyson bauer -- kansas city capital -- analyst
last question. on the event pipeline, are we still looking at a lot more of the smaller jobs maybe the 5, 10 million or less as opposed to some of the larger discrete projects that are multi-year and have that?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
we still have a combination of both. we have some multi-year projects that are continuing this year, that we have a multi-year project that we had done work in prior years that was off a bit last year is kicking back in in the next three weeks. and then, we have another new long-term project that will be kicking off in the third quarter. so, i would -- i don't think anything is really different in terms of that, it's a mix of all the above.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks, tyson.

[operator instructions] the next question comes from peter rabover with artko capital. please go ahead.
peter rabover -- artko capital lp -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question and for being so thorough on the inflation talk. just a couple of questions. one small one, how much was the texas freeze or the storms, was that a beneficial or a negative impact for you guys in the quarter?
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
peter, we didn't quantify it, but it would have been negative in the quarter.
peter rabover -- artko capital lp -- analyst
just thinking through next year. and then, maybe like a longer-term question. i mean, what are you guys thinking in terms of capital structure? i know you suspended dividend last year and were cash conservation mode. and i think you're back to be in fairly free cash flow positive and growing.
and so, just thinking, what's your ideal capital structure, what are your plans for capital allocation any, you have some warrants out there or so? just anything you guys can comment on that will be appreciated.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
so our capital deployment plan is really focused on organic capital investment, paying down debt, doing small tuck-in acquisitions if they come available and then we'll be looking at returning any capital to shareholders likely in 2022.
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
all right, thank you.

good morning and welcome to us ecology first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to eric gerratt, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
good morning and thank you for joining us today. joining me on the call this morning are chairman, president and chief executive officer, jeff feeler; executive vice president and chief operating officer, simon bell; and executive vice president of sales and marketing, steve welling. before we begin, please note that certain statements contained in this conference call that do not describe historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. since forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
factors that could cause results to differ materially from those expressed include but are not limited to those discussed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission. these risks and uncertainties also include but are not limited to statements regarding the continued impact of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the macroeconomic impact of specific end markets in which we operate and our expectations for financial results for 2021. management cannot control or predict many factors that determine future results. listeners should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management's views only on the date such statements are made.
we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. for those joining by webcast, you can follow along with today's presentation. for those listening by phone, you can access today's presentation on our website at www.usecology.com. throughout yesterday's earnings release and our call and presentation today, we refer to adjusted ebitda, adjusted earnings per diluted share cash earnings per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow.
these metrics are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore are susceptible to varying calculations. a definition, calculation, and reconciliation to the financial statements of adjusted earnings per diluted share, cash earnings per diluted share, adjusted ebitda, and adjusted free cash flow can be found in exhibit a of our earnings release. we believe these non-gaap metrics are useful in evaluating our reported results. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to jeff. 
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, eric and good morning to everyone joining the call today. before i dive into some prepared remarks on the quarter, i'd like to personally thank all of my colleagues within us ecology for their dedication to health, safety and operational excellence, despite the disruptions from the ongoing global pandemic, weather events and other constraints. for those that are following our webcast presentation, please direct your attention to slide 5. the positive momentum we saw in our business in the second half of 2020 has continued into the first-quarter 2021, with improving trends and overall business conditions across a substantial portion of our business.
overall, our first-quarter results were slightly ahead of our expectations. these solid results were achieved on the efforts of our broad-based team, that navigated the continued pandemic challenges and new challenges such as the extreme weather events impacting our texas-based operations and customers and supply chain disruptions that are proving to be headwinds for many of our industrial-based customers delaying them from returning to pre-covid levels. total company revenue was $228.6 million for the first quarter of 2021 and was down just 5% year over year when compared to a strong pre-pandemic first quarter last year. our field services segment was a bright spot with organic revenue growth of 4%.
our emergency response business was strong on the backs of continued covid-19 decontamination work. we completed just under 2,700 projects and generated approximately $12.5 million of revenue during the quarter. this was a 13% sequential improvement over the fourth quarter last year and was the strongest quarter since the pandemic began. in our waste solutions segment, base business revenue was down just 3% year over year, as beginning to benefit from the improved economic conditions.
looking sequentially at our base business, it was down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, much less than the sequential decline of 5% we experienced in the same period last year. dissecting our base business by month, march 2021 was the strongest month of the quarter, recording both sequential and year-over-year growth. we anticipate base business will build on the results in march and record year-over-year growth in the second quarter, putting us on track to achieve our 5 to 7% growth target for the full year of 2021. event business revenue was down 9% in the first quarter compared to the prior year and was up 2%, sequentially, from the fourth quarter of 2020.
we continue to see positive developments in our pipeline with increased bidding activities, with market reopenings and expectations for more normalized business conditions as we approach the summer construction season. our energy waste business has now reported its third quarter of sequential ebitda improvement, with increased treatment dispose and disposal volumes on improved rig count and related business activity. this allowed us to return to a positive ebitda contribution during the quarter, generating approximately $1.3 million of ebitda. though revenues were down 64% in the first quarter compared to last year, they were up 29% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing.
while we are nowhere near pre-pandemic levels, the positive developments are welcome side and are better than we had expected to see last year. overall, we reported total company adjusted ebitda of $33.2 million, down 23% from the prior prior year, which was ahead of our internal plan. we continue to generate strong free cash flow of $13.7 million during the quarter. before i turn the call over to eric, i want to provide an update on some of our latest sustainability initiatives which we are working on in 2021.
on the governance front, in february, we had announced the appointment of mack hogans to our board. mack brings extensive experience in leadership, strategy, m&a, governance and esg programs. this addition along with others made in 2020 demonstrate our ongoing focus on board refreshment and our commitment to board diversity, not only with regard to gender and race, but also experienced and expertise as well. these ongoing steps we are taking to improve diversity both within our board and our employee base has strengthened us as a company.
on the environmental front, we have substantially completed gathering our vehicle fleet and emissions data and its impact on greenhouse gas emissions. our vehicle fleet represents the most significant impact to the environment, given that our landfills have minimal greenhouse gas emissions, particularly when compared to solid waste landfills of our peers. with our baseline data in hand, we are working with our capital planning group and advisors to develop emission reduction targets below our baseline levels, despite expanding our fleet to support our growing field services business. we are also advancing sustainable waste solution services we offer to our customers, including investing and beneficial reuse technologies like aerosol recycling, container recycling and distillation recovery systems, which we believe are responsive to demands in the marketplace and are not only good for the environment, but also good for business.
finally, on the social front, we know that it's essential in a sophisticated and competitive market sector like ours to have leading human capital practices. the starting point for us therefore is to look as widely, inclusively and creatively as possible to identify, attract and retain, promote, and protect our top talent. anything we do that needlessly limits our talent pool or just diminishes the effectiveness of our team members and their career prospects can adversely affect our employment value proposition, as well as our overall culture. this means that our diversity, equity and inclusion are a core to our value creation and sustainability efforts, and this is evident in the strength of our programs.
to give a couple of examples, we offer a wide variety of industry-leading programs to meet our employee's individual needs wherever possible. we have created regular and robust feedback loops, so that we can gain insights from all of our people, including our fresh size. and we continue to evolve our training, mentoring, promotion and retention programs to increase diversity, respect and inclusive ways of working throughout our company. we are proud of the special culture we have created, that is built on inclusion, respect, protecting the environment and continuous improvement in everything we do.
with that, i'll turn it over to eric.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
thank you, jeff. starting with consolidated results on slide 8. revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $228.6 million. revenue for the waste solutions segment was $104.1 million for the first quarter of 2021, down 5% compared to $109.4 million in the first quarter of 2020.
the decrease was due to a 17% decline in transportation revenue and a 3% decrease in treatment and disposal revenue. the decline in our treatment and disposal revenue was driven by a 3% decline in base business and a 9% decrease in event business in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter last year. the field services segment delivered revenue of $118.2 million in the first quarter, up 4% compared to $114 million in the first quarter of 2020. this increase was driven by increases in our emergency response, small quantity generation and total waste management service lines.
total gross margin contracted approximately 280 basis points to 23% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year. this was primarily a result of lower waste volumes in both our waste solutions and our energy waste segments. selling, general and administrative spending or sg&a was $51.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 and included $1.2 million of business development and integration expenses. this compared to $52.4 million in the first quarter of 2020, which included $2.9 million in business development and integration expenses.
adjusted loss per diluted share was $0.07 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.12 in the same quarter last year. adding back the impact of intangible asset amortization, cash earnings per diluted share was $0.14 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.33 per share in the first quarter of 2020. adjusted ebitda was $33.2 million in the first quarter, down 23% from the first quarter of 2020. turning to slide 9.
we exited the quarter with a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity. despite the lower operating results compared to the prior year, we were able to generate strong adjusted free cash flow of $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. we had cash of $82.4 million and over $140 million of available capacity on our revolving line of credit at the end of the first quarter. net borrowings were $702.9 million at march 31, 2021, which was an improvement over our net borrowings at december 31, 2020.
our bank covenant leverage ratio was 4.5 times at march 31, 2021, well under the 5.5 times covenant level for the quarter. we expect the first quarter of 2021 to be the high point in terms of leverage and that will be below four times at the end of 2021. with that, i'll turn the call back to jeff.
jeffrey feeler -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, eric. we are encouraged by the positive trends we are seeing with quarter-over-quarter improvement across most if not all our business lines. with this and the improving industrial trends combined with our ongoing success in our nrc integration activities, we have reaffirmed our 2021 business outlook. this includes a forecast of growth for revenue, adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2021.
diving into our integration activities in more detail. we continue to make terrific progress and we are seeing our revenue synergies really gained momentum here in the second year. we continue to see a path to meet our three-year target of $20 million of ebitda synergies by the end of 2021, one year ahead of our original target. slide 10 has a detailed breakdown of our 2021 guidance that was released in february of this year and that we are reaffirming today.
i am so proud of the entire us ecology team and their ability to step-up, innovate and drive value during these times. as the industrial economies recover, we have the right assets and services in the right places to capitalize and thrive. we continue to be a trusted partner to our customers and together we are building a sustainable future for all. and with that, we'll open up the call for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and the first question will come from michael hoffman with stifel. please go ahead.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, jeff and team. thanks for taking the q's. can we tease out on the guidance, since no change in revs, but changing ebitda. clearly, there's a bridge there where something is better, but something is worse and then the mix works down to the $10 million.
so on the $10 million in the ebitda, you said $3 million is emergency response. what were the pros and then the other negative that get me to the net of the $10 million?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
so, yes. so the deferral on the event business from this year into next, michael, is about $3 million of ebitda. there's another $3 million on event business for projects coming into the year that were included in our initial guidance that have completed early. and so that's about another $3 million.
and then you've got the $3 million for the large-scale emergency response that was in our guidance that we didn't experience in the first half of the year. and then the rest is really a function of some of the inflationary pieces and things like that that i discussed.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. but sales are staying constant. so there -- if i gross this up into a revenue impact, there's an offset in revs that's happening as well, which means there's an offset in ebitda. right?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
correct.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
so this -- the negative is bigger gross, but there's a positive -- i'm trying to tease out that there's a positive going on here as well. that's part of the business outperformed, the part of the business underperformed.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
correct. and michael, if you look at the revenue guidance, so there's the kind of summary guidance table in the release and if you look at the revenue by segment, for our revenue guidance the total is the same, but there is a bit of a shift between waste solutions to field services within that guidance range, which, again, that field services revenue comes at a lower margin than the waste solutions.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. all right. i got -- i'm on my 14th earnings call this week, so i haven't gotten to that yet. ok.
corporate overhead, your number looks like it's really big as a percentage of revenues. can you talk through what are the big chunks and maybe how you put things that some might put in opex versus put it in so that people appreciate this isn't some big target for an opportunity to slash and cut --
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yes. one of the things, as we look at our overhead or our sg&a, and it's hard to compare it to peers because i don't always know exactly what's included in theirs versus ours. but i know for us, the large component of sg&a, i mean, it includes labor for, obviously, the corporate functions as well as a lot of the administrative expenses and people at our facilities as well and within our regions. the other thing that's included in our sg&a is we have a pretty large chunk of intangible amortization, that relates to non-permit-related intangible assets that the biggest jump in those was when we did the nrc acquisition in 2019, but we have upwards of $8 million of intangible asset amortization that flows through sg&a through the first six months.
if you strip some of that noise the intangible amortization, business development integration expenses out of our sg&a, we're at about 16.5% of revenue at the end of 2020, we're around 17% year to date through 2021. but i think some of that noise that's within our sg&a and our overhead is that intangible asset amortization, which is a pretty big number.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. what's the incremental business -- what's the incremental margin for business coming on in energy waste?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
i'm sorry, michael. i didn't hear that.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
i'm sorry. the incremental margin for energy waste as business recovers, what's that look like? lots of the peers are in a similar business, talk about that being 70%, 80%. is yours that good?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yes. i don't know that it's 70% or 80%. but if you look at our revised guidance and kind of what we did in the second quarter for the energy waste segment, i mean, we had a pretty good recovery in our ebitda margins. they were back in the mid-20s.
and so i would expect -- and as we look back at that business pre-pandemic and pre-acquisition, it's a ebitda margin business that's closer to our waste solutions segment, so low to mid-30s in a normal environment, potentially higher, but we already made a lot of progress getting it back in that 25% range. the new guidance that we put out yesterday for that business, our ebitda margin is 25% to 28%. so some pretty good improvement with more upside as it improves.
simon bell -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
this is simon here, michael. some of the comparables you're talking about, would they include the services component because i'm not sure that all of them do, which would also impact that incremental margin when comparing to just the disposal assets.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. most of them it would be about disposal, so that's fair enough. and then on waste services side, based on commitment that you're going to do 5% to 7% for the year and you've done what you've done for first half at a plus 2% get to the midpoint, you're doing 12% base business in the second half?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yes. it's somewhere around 10% to 12%. and really, i would expect that q3 will be the largest. and part of that is it's typically our strongest quarter, and that's a lower comparable if you go back to 2020.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. so it's just a tough question, and i would like -- i hope it comes across plate, not sounding nasty. why model in a guidance for big things that require an event to occur you can't control?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
good question, michael. the reality is we modeled that in based off history. if you go back to all the way down into 2015, a lot of events have happened and a lot more than what we modeled in. and last year was with all the conditions being shut down and depressed, we didn't see much materialize.
so if you go back look in history, those things occur. and so the reality is we believe those to occur in a more normal state, and we model them out what we believed at the time would materialize this year and still may materialize in the back half of the year.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and that's the wildfires or the weather events?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. it could be a whole bunch of different things. it could be chemical plant accidents. it could be a lot of things.
i mean, we've had events in the past that a singular accident outside of a major pipeline break could be $20 million to $50 million, i mean, they are big events. we didn't anything like that in. and the reality is more smaller we define it as something over $1 million, which can happen. and we talked about this in our guidance and what was out there when we first launched it.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. yes. you did say at the time, specifically on the event side, i think, more so than the emergency response. what's the risk that these transportation restrictions on capacity there is just lack of drivers for paying people stay home persist through d fall into early '22.
and therefore, does that -- that doesn't provide any relief on the project activity? or are there time lines on some of this that are mandated by a court order or what have you, where this is going to happen in '22 if it doesn't happen in '21. how do i think about that project number?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes, michael. we have a number of different projects that are going to be mandated by regulatory drivers oppose it. but your bigger question is what the industries are facing with right now with driver shortages is real. i mean we're not the only one navigating it.
everybody else is navigating it, and it does create a headwind and we called it out. so when you look at risks into just project-based work and even to a certain degree, our base business, that has some inherent risks. i know that everybody is trying to -- is looking forward to government programs getting released and other things like that, so hopefully more people enter the labor market. but that is a real risk that we're navigating, along with others in the space.
so i can't quantify what that can do. but the reality is it's inherent in what we're dealing with right now.
michael hoffman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thanks for taking the questions.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, michael.

jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
hey, jeff.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets --analyst
you talked a little bit about the truck driver issue. from a labor constraint perspective, are there any other pockets of labor where you're having trouble finding people or filling jobs?
simon bell -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes, jeff. this is simon. the drivers are certainly the most challenging in terms of labor shortages. but the short of it is, yes, we're seeing challenges across the board, chemical operators, equipment operators, just general labor.
it's different in different regions. but certainly, we're having some pockets where we're having challenges, and we're not able to fully realize the full potential of jobs out there. we've got a lot of programs moving, which we think are going to help us there. but, yes, it is beyond drivers.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
and i'll just add, jeff, on that is we have a couple of hundred plus positions open that we're actively recruiting for. and it comes back to that fundamental is there's 9-plus million people in the united states alone that are sitting on the sidelines today. and all the data shows that there's over 9 million of job openings. so the reality is there is some impacts that we're hoping that we'll release here in the coming months on there to help mitigate what we're seeing.
but we're competing for talent. we're trying to get talent. if we had more people, we would be able to drive more revenue. we are being held back on our growth potential right now because of labor.
and we're trying to diligently compete for that and be able to get good talent in and being able to service our customers. but it is a reality we're facing right now.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets --analyst
all right. that's helpful. and if we can shift gears over to the pricing environment, i mean, we're hearing from everybody that they're able to put through price increases. i wouldn't say very easily, but -- in a fairly easy method to some extent.
can you talk about what the pricing environment is out there, both from your perspective and from a competitive perspective?
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
sure. i'll let steve address and i'll fill in.
steve welling -- executive vice president of sales and marketing
sure. so we did take some price increases in q1 and q2 in select markets. and depending on the service line, we do have the ability to potentially do additional increases in the second half of the year. we've been looking at that.
it's a balance of whether -- what's the competitive market because we want to make sure we don't price ourselves out and losing work. what are the timing notifications because on our waste disposal business, we have, in some cases, 60- to 90-day notification to make an adjustment. so we're looking at what we can do. there are a number of areas we can move quickly.
there are certain other service lines, though, that we are stuck with an annual adjustment. so it just really depends. but it's something that we have flexibility there.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. jeff, i'll just add a little bit to this. i think the global takeaway on this is we do have the ability to push pricing through as steve just talked about. and it depends based on contractual arrangements and that type of thing and the timing thereof.
the caution we put up is we're -- we've been able to manage all the inflationary pressures for the most part to the first half of the year. really, the notifications we're starting to see now and what we kind of put a headwind in part of our guidance is we're starting to see more of those starting to come through in the back half of the year. and we're really analyzing what the overall impacts are and timing of when we can actually start adjusting price, especially since we already did one price increase earlier this year. the last thing we want to do is be in raising prices every week on our customers because it's not good.
so we're trying to get our arms around all of that, determine the best strategies of when we go to market to make sure we can fully capture what we're seeing. and that's why we put a headwind it may not be fully implemented by 2021 and really focused on 2022.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets --analyst
all right. that's really helpful. thanks so much.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thanks, jeff.

the next question will come from william grippin with ubs. please go ahead.
william grippin -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you. just had one here on the ebitda guide. it looks like the guidance implies a pretty significant second-half ramp in margin versus the first half.
i mean, you just talked about cost inflation pressures possibly accelerating here in the second half. could you just give a little color on, i guess, what's driving that half-on-half increase in the margin?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yes. i think the biggest -- one of the biggest things is just additional activity that we typically see seasonally in the third quarter, and we're projecting a really strong fourth quarter as well. and so as that -- particularly on the event business side picks up, some of that large-scale er picks up, it comes in at a higher incremental margin. so that's really the biggest driver of that lift you see from the first half to the second half, which isn't uncommon that we typically see each year, a decent-sized lift in our second half over the first as the event business and the activity in the third and fourth quarters pick up.
william grippin -- ubs -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question will come from tyler brown with raymond james. please go ahead.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
good morning.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
hey, tyler.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
so i hastily kind of put together this little -- like the guidance from q1 and the guidance from q2. and i just want to kind of go through this because i got to understand the guide pieces. so if we start in waste solutions, you're looking for, call it, an $8 million, and this is all at the midpoint. so an $8 million revenue and a $6 million ebitda.
i think you fleshed that out pretty well. $3 million of deferral, $3 million of kind of projects that have ended early. so you assume about a 75% incremental margin there. so first off, is that a good placeholder for incrementals and decrementals in that waste solutions business? or is there something unique there?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
gosh. i got to think about that, tyler. that sounds pretty reasonable to me and not uncommon with what we see. so i think, yes, as that event business scales up and scales down, it can cut both ways at a pretty high incremental margin.
simon bell -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
i mean, it's really defining the operating leverage these landfills have those incremental tons that come through really flow down to the bottom line.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. so that makes sense. now i'm confused on field services. so you raised revenue, but you lowered ebitda by like $4 million.
so why would that be? what exactly is going on there?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
so some of it, tyler, well, a portion of it is the large-scale er that didn't happen in the first half that, again, similar to some of our event business comes through at a really high incremental margin on the waste solutions side. so that is a piece of it as well as just some of the mix and some of what we're seeing and some of the cost and inflationary challenges that we're expecting in that piece of the business that jeff touched on a bit in terms of drivers and labor and some of those things. and if you look at the guidance -- the revised guidance versus the previous, it's about 100 basis points of margin that went down in this version of the guidance versus the previous.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. ok. that's helpful. and then on the energy waste side, again, kind of just like a funny change to the guide because you raised revenue by $3 million, but ebitda by $6 million.
and you guys talked about -- i mean, again, i'm just kind of confused as to why that would go up so much.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yes. it's again, incremental. it's that incremental margin as it's recovered. we're also feeling a lot of the benefits of some of the cost cutting that we did last year on both labor side, rentals, things like that.
and so you've really seen us pick up traction really since the second or third quarter last year and seen that improving margin. and so incremental revenue comes through at a better margin than it did say a year ago.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
so you have those incremental cost cuts layering in, ok. and then just, again -- just kind of, this is hastily put together, but it looks like the overall corporate costs also we're going to be higher, but i would have thought that incentive compensation would have been a cushion there or is that not the case? again, this is all relative to the last guide, not to last year, but relative to the last guide.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
i would say there's some incentive compensation shift there, but that's about at least through the first six months in the guidance about where we kind of expected coming into the year. we are seeing some headwinds in terms of some of our benefits costs, some of our insurance costs, and then just overall labor.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. so that's a lot where some of that inflation is picking up. ok. well, that all is very helpful.
so real quickly, i think you had talked about $50 million of ebitda in q3, is that a good placeholder?
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
yes. it's -- yes, i would say, right around there is about right. we actually -- our guidance and our forecast, which, just to be clear, so our forecast is -- our current forecast is the midpoint of our guidance. and if you look at it and break it down by quarter, we're actually showing that q4 will be a bit stronger than q3.
but q3 is kind of about in that $50 million range.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. super helpful. and then on the interest cost and tax rate, just to make sure we have that i know you changed your credit agreement a little bit.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so the credit agreement, really, the big change, the big positive change is we extended the revolver out another five years. we also, while we're at a extended -- or increased the covenant permanently. so it steps down and there's actually a chart in the appendix of the presentation for today that shows the new levels.
but in terms of interest, we're expecting interest expense to be pretty similar to what we guided before, maybe a bit less. and then on the tax rate, we are seeing some of the change in the eps guidance is we are seeing or expecting a higher tax rate than we were coming into the year in last quarter. a lot of that is due to, as we look at the forecast and where the revenue is shifting. some of it is shifting into some of our higher tax jurisdictions, canada is one good example.
and we continue to see our state effective rate continue to increase. so there's about a 250, 300 basis point increase in our tax rate for the year now versus what we thought coming into the year.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. ok. it's all like something was going on there. ok.
that's helpful. and then on the capex, so you held capex at the, call it, $87 million, how does that look -- does it actually trickle up in 2020 and then kind of start to trickle down later or more into the mid part of the decade? or how should we think about that, again, assuming no acquisitions, but just kind of looking at the business today?
simon bell -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes. this is simon. i would say 2022 is going to be another heavy spend on the landfill side. so i would expect probably a slight increase over 2021, then 2023 kind of returning lowering maybe to mid-80s and then really seeing benefits into the '24-'25 because of the reduction in the landfill spend.
it was just a case, and it would be a long explanation, but we have to -- with the most efficient thing and it made the most sense for us to build a large portion of the landfill in '21 and '22, pulling some of that spend forward, but we should see the benefits moving into '23-'24.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. ok. that's helpful. and then my last one here.
i know there's some talk about truck drivers and such. i know a thing or two about that. but one other aspect is the railroads. so i'm curious, the rail -- if you look at train speeds and dwell obviously, the rails are struggling.
there's a couple of things. i'm curious if you're seeing increased accessorial charges or if you're seeing just an overall slowing in rail velocity if that is problematic for you as well?
simon bell -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes. again, this is simon. tyler, it's something we're watching very closely, and we've heard about some of these slowdowns. but the corridors that we're using today, i'm not seeing a lot of impacts, not seeing a lot of delays that may be in part because a lot of the material comes from out east and heads east and maybe they're not dealing with the wildfires like they are out west.
so something on the rail side today, i would call it stable, but carefully watching it.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. yes. it could be your traffic mix, not to get into a long discussion about this, but yes, that makes sense.
steve welling -- executive vice president of sales and marketing
our business really isn't too dependent on the timing of the rail. i mean, it could result in the need for extra cars to rent. but for the most part, as long as it's leaving the customer site, they seem to be happy.
tyler brown -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. ok. all right, guys. thank you so much for the time.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer

good day, and welcome to the second-quarter 2021 u.s. ecology incorporated earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to eric gerratt, chief financial officer.
please go ahead, sir.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
good morning, and thank you for joining us today. joining me on the call this morning are chairman, president, and chief executive officer jeff feeler; executive vice president and chief operating officer, simon bell; and executive vice president of sales and marketing steve welling. before we begin, please note that certain statements contained in this conference call that do not describe historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. since forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
factors that could cause results to differ materially from those expressed include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission. these risks and uncertainties also include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the macroeconomic impact of specific end markets in which we operate, and our expectations for financial results for 2021. management cannot control or predict many factors that determine future results. listeners should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management's views only on the date such statements are made.
we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. for those joining by webcast, you can follow along with today's presentation. for those listening by phone, you can access today's presentation on our website at www.usecology.com. throughout yesterday's earnings release and our call and presentation today, we refer to adjusted ebitda, adjusted earnings per diluted share, cash earnings per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow.
these metrics are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are therefore susceptible to varying calculations. a definition, calculation, and reconciliation to the financial statements of adjusted earnings per diluted share, cash earnings per diluted share, adjusted ebitda, and adjusted free cash flow can be found in exhibit a of our earnings release. we believe these non-gaap metrics are useful in evaluating our reported results. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to jeff. 
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thank you, eric, and good morning to everyone joining the call today. i would like to begin first by personally thanking all of my colleagues on the us ecology team who are working hard to continue to keep people and our environment safe for our communities. our emergency response teams are currently responding to the wildfires that are impacting the western parts of the united states and canada, protecting critical infrastructure that we all depend on. my thoughts and well wishes are with these team members and all of those that are involved for their continued safety in these challenging times.
turning to our second-quarter results. for those that are following the webcast presentation, i'll direct your attention to slide 5. strong industrial trends and solid momentum continued to accelerate in the second quarter of 2021, allowing us to drive revenue growth across each of our business segments, with total revenue up 13% compared to the second quarter of 2020. due to project deferment and unfavorable service mix in the quarter concentrated primarily in our waste solutions segment, our results came in below expectations, both from a margin and ebitda perspective.
we do expect to see continued improvement in the coming months and quarters. turning first to field services. our strong execution in this segment delivered double-digit revenue growth and ebitda growth when stripping out a contingency consideration gain recorded in the second quarter of last year. this growth was reflected across substantially all of our service offerings.
we are encouraged by the recovery and remain confident in our ability to more than offset the covid-19 decontamination work that we had last year. our energy waste segment delivered results ahead of expectations and reported its fourth quarter of sequential ebitda improvement with rising disposal volumes driven by improved rig counts and related business activity. we remain encouraged by the trends in our energy waste segment with oil remaining above $70 per barrel. our waste solutions segment returned to revenue growth in the second quarter with strong base business revenue growth, up 7% from the second quarter last year and is up 3% sequentially from the first quarter earlier this year, reflecting broad improvement in our end markets, including metals manufacturing, mining and e&p, general manufacturing, and chemical manufacturing.
with this growth, our base business is up 2% in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months last year, keeping us on track to achieve our expected base business target growth of 5% to 7% for the full year. the growth in this segment reflects an overall improvement in the industrial sector that we are seeing in our services side of the business as well as those industrial production metrics that are being reported. however, some industry headwinds remain as customers continue to manage through supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and transportation shortages, while others, like our refinery-based customers, are managing their maintenance spending to focus on free cash flow generation. we expect these headwinds to lessen over the coming quarters.
additionally, our base business growth is being further constrained by third-party incineration capacity, which is causing restrictions in our waste receipts across the industry. our waste solutions segment was impacted during the quarter by a 13% decline in event business compared to the second quarter last year, due in large part to projects shifting to the back half of the year and into 2022, along with the early completion of a few larger projects. the event business revenue decline had a disproportionate impact on our second quarter margin due to an unfavorable service mix as replacement projects were at a lower average selling price and margin profile compared to the second quarter last year. overall, the second quarter we delivered adjusted ebitda of $34.2 million and generated free cash flow of $11.6 million.
despite the year-over-year decline in adjusted ebitda, we continue to see strong fundamentals driven by the industrial recovery as seen by our solid base business and services revenue growth, which is expected to continue into the second half of the year. before i turn the call back over to eric to further review our financial results, i want to provide a quick update on some of our latest sustainability initiatives. providing environmental solutions for our customers' complex needs is at the heart of what we do, and we have compiled a nearly 70-year history of regulatory and operational expertise. this week, we released our 2020 esg supplement report, which is available on our website that builds upon our previously issued sustainability report and includes more detailed disclosures based off sasb, an independent nonprofit that develop sustainability accounting standards.
i want to take a quick moment and point out a couple of highlights from this report. on the environmental front, in 2020, we protected our environment by ensuring safe treatment, recycling, and final disposal of more than 4.6 billion pounds of customers' hazardous waste. we also treated more than 68 million gallons of wastewater and recycled more than 22 million pounds of metal and more than 1.7 million gallons of oil. we are pleased to report that 39% of our power consumption used in our facilities in 2020 came from renewable energy sources.
we are making significant progress gathering our baseline greenhouse gas emissions data in 2021 and are on track to publish these results and reduction goals by the end of the year. on the social front, our inclusion and diversity committee continues to promote our shared values of diversity, equity, and inclusion and improve engagement with employees. we are dedicated to promoting a culture of safety. and while we are already significantly better than industry average statistics, we continue to bring down the number of safety incidents and accidents across our organization.
we also recognize the difficulties of the ongoing pandemic has had on our team members and have provided more than 46,000 hours of incremental covid-related paid time off for our team members to deal with these uncertain and trying times. we are proud of the special culture we've created here at us ecology that is built on inclusion, respect, protecting the environment, and continuous improvement, and we look forward to continue building on this strong foundation. with that, i'll turn it back to eric.
eric gerratt -- chief financial officer
thanks, jeff. starting with consolidated results on slide 8. revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $240.8 million. revenue for the waste solutions segment was $108.4 million for the second quarter of 2021, up 5% compared to $103 million in the second quarter of 2020.
the increase was driven by a 4% increase in treatment and disposal revenue and an 11% increase in transportation revenue. as jeff mentioned, the growth in our treatment and disposal revenue was due to a 7% increase in base business, partially offset by a 13% decrease in event business in the second quarter of 2021 compared to last year. the field services segment delivered revenue of $124.7 million in the second quarter, up 20% compared to $103.5 million in the second quarter of 2020. the increase was across most of our field services business lines.
total gross margin was 23% in the second quarter, down from 26% in the second quarter last year. gross margin for our waste solutions segment was 33% in the second quarter of 2021, down from 41% in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting a less favorable service mix, which resulted in lower treatment and disposal margin as well as lower gross margin on transportation revenue. treatment and disposal margin for the waste solutions segment was 38% in the second quarter of 2021, down from 45% in the second quarter of 2020. as jeff mentioned, the decline in mix of event business had a disproportionate impact on our margin, and we estimate that approximately five full points of the treatment and disposal margin decline was a result of lower average selling prices on replacement projects compared to the prior year.
gross margin for our field segment improved to 15% in the second quarter, compared to 14% in the second quarter last year. selling, general and administrative spending, or sg&a, was $51.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 and included $785,000 of business development and integration expenses. this compared to $49.7 million in the second quarter of 2020, which included $3 million in business development and integration expenses. in the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.2 million on the settlement of an earn-out contract related to the legacy nrc business, which was recorded as a reduction of sg&a expenses for the quarter.
excluding this gain as well as business development and integration expenses, sg&a increased 3% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter last year. this increase was primarily related to higher incentive compensation and benefit costs. adjusted ebitda was down 12% from the same quarter last year, which included the $2.2 million earn-out contract settlement i just mentioned. excluding this gain from the second quarter of 2020, adjusted ebitda was down 6% in the second quarter of 2021 attributable to the decline in event business and a less favorable service mix in our waste solutions segment in the second quarter compared to the second quarter last year.
turning to slide 9. we exited the quarter with a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity. despite the lower margins compared to the prior year, we were able to generate adjusted free cash flow of $11.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. we had cash of 85.2 and $83 million of available capacity on our revolving line of credit at the end of the second quarter.
net borrowings were $699.2 million at june 30, 2021. turning now to our business outlook. as included in our release yesterday, we are revising our 2021 full-year guidance as shown on slide 11. we now expect 2021 adjusted ebitda to range from $165 million to $175 million, down from our previously issued guidance of $175 million to $185 million.
adjusted free cash flow is now expected to range between 42 and $57 million, down from our previously issued guidance range of $60 million to $77 million. adjusted earnings per diluted share is now expected to range from $0.37 to $0.60, compared to our previous range of $0.65 to $0.88. revenue is expected to range from $940 million to $990 million, which is consistent with our previous range. our guidance revision is primarily due to the deferment event of event business to 2022, early project completions, and large-scale emergency response work that did not materialize in the first half of the year.
with respect to event business, we estimate that approximately $3 million of adjusted ebitda will shift out of 2021 and into 2022. the majority of this shift is due to ongoing pandemic-related challenges that have resulted in delays in mobilization or delays in regulatory approvals at our customer site. in addition, two of our event projects coming into 2021 finished earlier than anticipated, which will impact our full-year adjusted ebitda outlook by approximately $3 million. our guidance also assumes that we will likely -- we are likely to see additional delays in deferments in the second half of 2021 as project sites continue to navigate logistical challenges due to truck shortages in the u.s.
and canada. while these factors are impacting our outlook for the remainder of 2021, our business fundamentals remain strong, and the pipeline of event business opportunities and improved bidding activity should benefit us in 2022 and beyond. a lack of large emergency response projects in the first half of the year is also responsible for approximately $3 million of our downward revision to adjusted ebitda guidance. as jeff mentioned in his opening remarks, we are currently deploying teams to respond to the wildfires in the west, and we're still early in the storm season that typically runs through october.
finally, we are expecting additional costs and inflationary pressures in the back half of 2021 in areas such as labor, supplies, and treatment reagents. though we can recover some of these increased costs or future pricing adjustments, the timing of these adjustments may not be completed in 2021. we remain encouraged by the underlying industrial trends and pace of business activity and we are seeing conditions strengthen across all of our segments. we anticipate additional recovery and growth in our base business and remain on track to achieve our 5% to 7% growth target for the full year.
while growth in our services businesses has been limited by challenging labor conditions, we remain confident of the potential of this segment as we look ahead. our energy waste business continues to show positive trends and will likely exit the year above our initial targets. before i turn the call back to jeff, i'd like to again reiterate that our business fundamentals remain strong, and we are seeing continued improvement across all segments. we continue to expect better financial performance in the second half of the year, both from improving fundamentals as well as historically strong seasonality that typically benefits us.
with that, i'll turn the call back to jeff.
jeff feeler -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thanks, eric. we are encouraged by what we're seeing in the fundamentals of the industrial recovery and the current trajectory that we're on. we communicated at the beginning of the year that the biggest risk to our 2021 outlook was replacing and growing upon record levels of event business in 2020. while we are disappointed that continuing effects of the pandemic have shifted projects into the second half of the year and in 2022, we are encouraged by the bidding activity and opportunities and the overall health of the pipeline.
as eric mentioned, the large emergency response events that have not developed in the first half of the year, pose the risk to the second half and if they did not materialize. while these headwinds are mitigated by strong base business and services work, along with the positive trends we're seeing in the energy segment, these risks to our initial guidance are difficult and were difficult to overcome in the remaining six months. turning to our longer-term outlook. we are still marching toward our five-year targets with organic revenue growth of 5% to 7% per year, driving $100 million of free cash flow and achieving double-digit returns on invested capital by the end of 2025, while lowering our leverage levels to two to two and a half times, we remain confident in our ability to achieve these targets.
before i conclude and open up the call for questions, i'd like to recognize our talented team here at u.s. ecology. this past quarter, i've had the ability to finally get out and travel to our facilities and sit down with our team members. i continue to be impressed by our people in how they continue to protect human health in the environment, while navigating through ever-changing circumstances.
we have the right people and the right assets to respond to our customers' needs, and we continue to be a trusted partner for our customers. and together, we are building a sustainable future for all. with the remaining focus on executing our strategy to drive long-term growth and value creation. i am looking forward to all that's to come.
with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
