good morning and welcome to the agree realty fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to clay thelen, chief financial officer. please go ahead clay.
clay thelen -- chief financial officer
thank you. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for agree realty's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. joey will of course be joining me this morning to discuss our record results for the past year.
please note that during this call we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities laws. our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements for a number of reasons including, uncertainty related to the scope; severity and duration of the covid-19 pandemic; the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact; and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures on us and on our tenants. please see yesterday's earnings release and our sec filings, including our latest annual report on form 10-k and subsequent reports for a discussion of various risks and uncertainties underlying our forward-looking statements.
in addition we discuss non-gaap financial measures including core funds from operations or core ffo; adjusted funds from operations or affo; and net debt to recurring ebitda. reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release, website and sec filings.
i will now turn the call over to joey.
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, clay, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. before i begin, i'd like to wish all of our listeners and their families' health and safety, as we continue to navigate these very difficult times. despite the incredibly challenging circumstances, our team had a tremendous year achieving a number of notable milestones, including record investment activity of $1.36 billion, nearly doubling our previous record in 2019, adding 325 properties to our growing portfolio. the acquisition of 18 walmart stores, cementing walmart as our top tenant at 7.3% of annualized base rent; increasing our investment grade exposure by 930 basis points to 67.5% of abr; executing our inaugural public bond offering and receiving a bbb investment grade rating from s&p and lastly, surpassing $4 billion in equity cap and $5 billion in total enterprise value.
just as important, we continue to invest in our people, adding 12 team members across an array of functions as well as additions in our systems with our state-of-the-art database driving tremendous efficiencies. these investments will enable us to continue on our robust growth trajectory. while we achieved yet another year of record acquisition volume of $1.31 billion, our continued focus on best-in-class omnichannel retailers is demonstrated by nearly 84% of annualized base rent acquired being derived from leading investment grade retailers. our laser like focus is further cemented by the ground lease opportunities that we executed on during this past year. we added 26 ground leases to our portfolio during 2020, representing over 12% of annualized base rents acquired, increasing our overall ground lease exposure to 9.6% of our total portfolio. several notable ground leased assets were acquired during the year, including our first wegmans in chapel hill, north carolina; five long-term wawa convenience stores; three walmart; two home depot; two aldi; two sheetz convenience stores and a lowe's in toledo, ohio.
as a reminder, our ground lease portfolio derives more than 92% of rents from investment grade tenants and is comprised of the company's -- country's premier retailers. we continue to identify additional compelling opportunities to add assets to this portfolio and i look forward to updating you in upcoming quarters.
we closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter investing $363 million in 106 properties across our three external growth platforms. consistent with our focus on quality throughout the year, more than 83% of annualized base rents acquired during the fourth quarter are derived from retailers with an investment grade credit rating and more than 19% of annualized base rents acquired were derived from ground leased assets. the 100 properties acquired during the fourth quarter are leased to 31 tenants operating in 18 distinct sectors, including off-price retail, home improvement, auto parts, general merchandise, dollar stores, convenience stores, grocery stores and tire and auto service. the properties were acquired at a weighted average cap rate of 6.4% and had a weighted average lease term of 11.6 years.
our pipeline heading into 2021 is robust and i'm very pleased with our progress to date. as indicated by our initial acquisition guidance of $800 million to $1 billion, we are confident in our team's ability to aggregate high quality transaction comprised of leading omnichannel retailers. consistent with our initiative to rethink retail, we continue to construct a net lease portfolio with sector-leading operators that are well positioned to succeed in an omnichannel world. during this past year we added kroger to our top tenants list, while reducing exposure to mister car wash and dave & buster's who are no longer among our top tenants. as mentioned, at year-end, our portfolios investment grade exposure stood at more than 67%, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 900 basis points and a two-year stacked increase of more than 1,600 basis points. our focus on best-in-class retailers will continue as we continue to not see it prudent to move up the risk curve.
moving on to our development and partner capital solutions platforms. we had 12 development in pcs projects either completed or under construction during the year, that represent total capital committed of more than $43 million. nine of these projects were completed during the past year, representing total investment volume of approximately $31 million. two of these projects were commenced during the fourth quarter with total anticipated cost of just over $6 million. the projects consist of a burlington in texarkana, texas and a gerber collision in buford, georgia. construction continued during the fourth quarter on the company's first development with grocery outlet in port angeles, washington, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021.
subsequent to quarter-end, we commenced construction in our first 7-11 development in saginaw, michigan. 7-11 will be subject to a 15 year net lease upon rent commencement which is anticipated to take place in the first quarter of 2022. the continued growth of our pipeline demonstrates our efforts to expand our relationships with best-in-class retailers and leverage our three-pronged external growth platform. these capabilities continue to produce opportunities that fit very nicely within our portfolio. while we fortified our portfolio through record investment activity, we have also diversified our portfolio during the year through strategic asset management and disposition activities. we sold 17 properties for total gross proceeds of just more than $49 million in 2020. these dispositions were completed at a weighted average cap rate of 7.1%. notably, we sold 12 franchise restaurants during this past year, reducing the company's franchise restaurant exposure to a mere 1.2% of annualized base rents at year's end.
our asset management team remain diligently focused on addressing our upcoming lease maturities. as a result of their efforts at year-end, our 2021 lease maturities stood at just 0.9% of annualized base rents, representing a year-over-year decrease of 170 basis points. during the fourth quarter, we executed new leases, extensions or options on approximately 82,000 square feet of gross leasable area. for the full year 2020 we executed new leases, extensions or options on approximately 518,000 square feet. notable new leases extensions or options included new 20 year leases on three wawa convenience stores located in the mid-atlantic, a dick's sporting goods in boynton beach, florida and a giant eagle in ligonier, pennsylvania.
as of december 31, our rapidly growing retail portfolio consisted of 1,129 properties across 46 states. this represents approximately a 38% increase in total property count over the course of just one year. the strength of our carefully constructed portfolio is reflected in our collections data for 2020. during the year we received second, third and fourth quarter rental payments originally contracted for on those quarters from 95%, 98% and 99% of our portfolio respectively. during that past year, we also entered into deferral agreements for second and third quarters of 2% and less than 1% of fourth quarter rents respectively, net of repayments received.
in january of this year we saw a continuation of these collection trends as we again collected 99% of rent. this marks the fifth consecutive month of 99% collections for our portfolio. i will again highlight that our collections data includes both base rents and recurring operating cost reimbursements. in addition, we include base rents and operating cost reimbursement charged to tenants in bankruptcy and have not made any covid related adjustments to the denominator when making these calculations. our goal remains to provide complete and transparency to our investors on actual collections data. as evidenced by our increasing investment grade exposure, our expanding ground lease portfolio, our minimal near-term lease rollover and our leading rent collections, our portfolio is better positioned than it has ever been.
in january, we launched our rethink retail initiative to challenge the misperceptions about the future of brick and mortar retail and highlight why net lease properties and specifically our portfolio is exceptionally positioned in an omnichannel retail world. our newly launched websites that include resources regarding our portfolio, as well as our first white paper which provides our perspective on omnichannel retail. we will be putting out additional materials in the coming weeks, focused on the dynamic nature of retail and how agree realty is positioned to capitalize on this landscape. i would encourage everyone to visit our new website and please provide any feedback as we continue to build out the content portal.
in january, we also announced the conversion to a monthly dividend. the conversion to a monthly dividend is a testament to the reliability and consistency of our portfolios operating cash flow as well as the increased individual investor participation in the equity markets.
lastly, i'd like to take a moment to welcome karen dearing to our board of directors. many of you are very familiar with karen as she serves the chief financial officer and executive vice president of sun communities. we're very excited to add karen to accounting, finance, capital markets and reit industry experience to our board. i look forward to her many insights and experiences as we continue to scale our growing and dynamic company.
i'll hand the call over to clay and then we can open it up for any questions.
clay thelen -- chief financial officer
thank you, joey. i'll start by providing a balance sheet update and an overview of our capital markets activities during the year. we were very active in the capital markets this past year having raised or settled a record of nearly $1.5 billion, fortifying our balance sheet and positioning us for growth. in addition to external capital raised, we also generated approximately $85 million through our disposition activity and free cash flow after dividend during the year. some of our notable capital markets activity from the year includes $575 million of net equity proceeds raised or settled through our atm program, a forward -- a follow-on public offering of 2.9 million shares of common stock including the underwriters' over-allotment option for net proceeds of approximately $170 million, an underwritten public offering of 6.2 million shares of common stock in connection with the forward sale agreement in which the shares were sold to cohen & steers. we settled the offering and tranches during the third and fourth quarters, realizing net proceeds of $355 million and the completion of our inaugural public bond offering for $350 million of 2.9% senior unsecured notes due in 2030. accessing the public debt markets represents an important milestone for our company, which we anticipate representing a meaningful source of capital in the future.
subsequent to year-end, we completed an overnight offering of approximately 3.5 million shares, including the underwriters' option and received net proceeds of approximately $222 million. the proceeds were used to pay down our revolving credit facility, fund acquisitions and development activity and for working capital. inclusive of the january offering, anticipated net proceeds from our outstanding forward equity and availability under our credit facility, we have nearly $700 million in liquidity. as of december 31, our net debt to recurring ebitda was approximately 4.8 times. pro forma for the settlement of our outstanding forward equity offerings, our net debt to recurring ebitda was approximately 4 times. total debt to enterprise value at year end was approximately 23.4%, while fixed charge coverage, which includes principal amortization remained at a company record 4.8 times.
moving to earnings. core ffo was $0.84 per share for the fourth quarter and $3.23 per share for the full year 2020, representing 3.8% and 4.8% year-over-year increases respectively. affo was $0.83 per share for the fourth quarter and $3.20 per share for the full year, representing 4.8% and 6% year-over-year increases. during the past three quarters, we have elected to treat covid-19 deferrals as delinquent receivables and our ffo measures include this revenue. on a quarterly and full-year basis, core ffo per share and affo per share were impacted by dilution required under gaap related to our recent forward equity offerings. treasury stock has been included within our diluted share count in the event that prior to settlement, our stock trades above the deal price from the offerings. the aggregate dilutive impact related to these offerings was roughly $0.01 to both core ffo and affo per share for the fourth quarter, an approximate $0.03 for the 12-month period.
general and administrative expenses in 2020 totaled $20.8 million. g&a expense was 8.4% for total revenue or 7.9%, excluding the noncash amortization of above and below-market lease intangibles. given the recent changes to the leadership team and newly or recently amended employment agreements, g&a expense as a percent -- percentage of total revenue increased slightly year-over-year. for 2021, we expect that g&a expenses as a percentage of revenues will decrease approximately 100 basis points.
income tax expense for the full year totaled -- for the full year 2020 totaled $1.1 million. for 2021, we anticipate total income tax expense to be in the range of $1.4 million to $1.6 million. the company paid a cash dividend of $0.62 per share on january 6 to stockholders of record on december 31, 2020, representing a 6% year-over-year increase. this is the company's 107th consecutive cash dividend since our ipo in 1994. for the full year, the company declared dividends of $2.405 per share, a 5.5% year-over-year increase. our payout ratios for the fourth quarter were a conservative 74% of both core ffo per share and affo per share respectively. for the full year 2020, on a per share basis, our payout ratios were 75% of both core ffo and affo respectively. these payout ratios continue to reflect a growing and very well covered dividend.
as joey highlighted, in january, we announced the transition to a monthly cash dividend and have since declared monthly dividends for january and february of $0.207 per share. the monthly dividend -- this monthly dividend reflects an annualized dividend amount of just over $2.48 per common share, representing a 6.2% year-over-year increase.
with that i'd like to turn the call back over to joey.
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, clay. at this time, operator, we will open it up for any questions.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and the first question comes from linda tsai with jefferies. please go ahead.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning. could you just give us more color on your investor outreach to retail investors, the new website, white papers, tiktok. do you have a systematic strategy for this initiative and how do you measure participation. how familiar are retail investors with net lease reits?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
good morning, linda and i appreciate the question. i didn't realize we had a tiktok account, i think that may be my children. but look, i think first and foremost, the important piece was to build the infrastructure out here in terms of investor accessibility. so the new website, the rethink retail campaign, the industry insights inclusive of the white papers and then we will use different social media tools as well as other tools to continue to build out the individual investor strategy that we have, which is truly a medium term platform for us. and we think is an incremental approach to our shareholder base. so it's not a whole change of direction here, but it's incremental. and i think it's additive longer term to our shareholder base.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. and then we saw in the news that kroger's pitching a portfolio of 28 stores under its fred meyer banner. is this something you're looking at? and do you view this is indicative of the potential for more increased sale leaseback deals coming to market in 2021?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
yes, i'm sure the team here will look at retailers. they have accesses still with a historically low rate environment, the unsecured debt markets. there are retailers that are looking at sale-leasebacks. no, i would remind everyone that's not a predominant means of growth for us although we explore all opportunities. we have seen that portfolio which you're referencing and iâm sure the acquisition team will look at it, but for that to hurdle it would have to -- not only hurdle from a earnings perspective or a -- we would also really have to hurdle from a real estate perspective. so i'm sure we'll look at it like we do everything, but our typical mo of aggregating one-off isn't going to change soon.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. and then just a question for clay. you talked about the 12 members you added to your team. are there any other additions you need? and then in terms of the g&a going down 100 bps. could you provide a dollar range too?
clay thelen -- chief financial officer
sure. good morning, linda. i appreciate the question. look, in terms of building out the team, joey mentioned, 12 team members were added in 2020. that's an addition to the investment we made in processes and systems as well, which as a growing company, we continue to make and continue to invest in the business. so in terms of additional hires, we'll continue to invest in the business, we'll continue to hire more and bring on new team members as the company grows. and that 100 basis point reduction in g&a is reflective of continued growth in g&a. if you look back at where g&a is kind of grown or trended the past couple of years, it's grown between 20% and 25% the past couple of years and that's obviously with meaningful growth in revenues as well. i won't provide a range in terms of dollars for the year, but we're certainly targeting 100 basis point reduction as a percentage of revenues, which we think represents just a continued scaling of the company.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks.

the next question comes from nate crossett with berenberg. please go ahead.
nate crossett -- berenberg -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. i was wondering if you could give some color on the outlook for pricing for this year. i know it's been pretty stable in the last six months or so, but are you seeing any changes in competition or pricing? what should we expect in terms of yields?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
good morning nate. pricing and interest rates and demand, there is a causal here, correlations are very difficult to determine. with the recent increase in the tenure, i'd be hesitant to give any pricing forward-looking guidance. we've seen fairly static pricing cap rates either in the same place, potentially marginally lower earlier in the year or late last year, i really should say. but again there is a lot of moving pieces here. i think i mentioned in the last call, i think also, which is very difficult to quantify, net lease specifically is one of the only investable asset class i think that can be underwritten today. and so i think you're going to see additional dollars pour into the space. the vast majority of those dollars are chasing higher yield non-credit, and so it's not incremental competition to us. i don't expect any true expansion of cap rates unless we see economic volatility that's unpredictable, which weâre afraid we could see, but i think cap rates will remain effectively where they are today.
nate crossett -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. could you maybe remind us the returns that you guys get on your development starts and what's i guess the guidance for development starts for the year or is it more ad hoc?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
well, i tell you, development and pcs are both value-added progs to our external growth platform, which are targeting 200 plus or minus basis points above market cap rates, obviously subject to the duration of the project. if we're just financing to own a project, it's a very different rate of return that we're looking for, for taking the project all the way through the permitting entitlement and construction phase. we don't give forward-looking guidance in terms of acquisitions and partner capital solutions, those deals can obviously have a number of hurdles in front of them and our longer duration in terms of the life cycle of those assets and the gestation of those assets. i'll tell you, our pipeline on both fronts continues to grow. we continue to see a number of interesting opportunities, specifically on the pcs front.
nate crossett -- berenberg -- analyst
okay and then -- that's helpful, thanks. and just one last one, can you kind of remind us, how you guys just source your overall deal flow? what percent is in-house generation versus other sources today? and has that changed at all over the last year with all the adds that you guys have made?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
iâll tell you, we have a 10 person origination team led by our chief investment officer craig erlich, that is regionally focused. transactions come from all different sources and relationships from retailers to developers, owners from leasing brokers, investment sale brokers. frankly, the best transactions typically come from the strangest places as you would expect. and so, it's a very wide net that we cast, i think in the deck, we go through the $30 billion plus that we've underwritten and that's not reviewed, but truly underwritten and spent time on in the last few years. and so it's a wide net, it's a low batting average with high hurdles, but we'll continue to focus on best-in-class retailers and the team and the systems are built out to continue to build to scale.
nate crossett -- berenberg -- analyst
okay, thanks guys.
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
thanks nate.

the next question comes from haendel st. juste with mizuho. please go ahead.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho -- analyst
hey, good morning.
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
good morning haendel. how are you?
haendel st. juste -- mizuho -- analyst
hey, great, thanks. i hope you're well. so, question on the -- looking back at last year, some of the investments that 84% of the deals were i-grade the walt [phonetic] were closer to 11 years almost two years above the portfolio average in prior year than pre-covid. i guess i'm curious if you think looking back 2020 will [indecipherable] prove to be an anomaly given maybe some covid dislocation or is it realistic to think you could repeat that level of i-grades and walt in your deal this year?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
well, i would tell you, i would anticipate our investment grade exposure to tick up this year. i would anticipate our ground lease exposure to tick up this year, and that's just in the visibility, which we have today. it's hard to look forward. we have -- we always say 70 days of visibility into our pipeline. so it's hard to look forward and predict those outcomes. we're focused on that sandbox of retailers, the 25, 30 best retailers in the country. the majority of those carry investment grade credit ratings and we're not seeing any deviation from traditional or last year's weighted average lease term as you mentioned. so i think that is, i wouldn't say it's an anomaly, i think we are targeting the same types of retailers and so outcomes wouldn't deviate very -- wouldn't deviate very far from there.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho -- analyst
got it. thank you. question on the 1% uncollected tied to the fitness operator, it's been a few quarters now with no movement there? is it still your expectation you will be receiving those rents this year, any recent conversation with them or any update to provide there?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
we continue to have conversations. we anticipate receiving those rents for the largest operator effectively in the country. we anticipate receiving those rents. i think everyone acknowledges that they are not only collectable, but they are due in owing. we'll look at our remedies and our recourse and then continue to engage in dialog with them.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho -- analyst
got it. one more on that. 10-31, but maybe from a different angle. i noticed that you're an upreit and was curious that if, 10-31 is repealed, would you consider issuing op units to sellers of assets as maybe a tax mitigation strategy. is that something that's come up in any conversations and what do you see the pros and cons of maybe doing that issuing op units in some of the transactions to the sellers you're dealing with? thanks.
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
it's a good question. it's the tool in our tool belt that we continue to look at with select transactions. i'll say the frictional cost of doing it for something under, call it $20 million, $30 million, probably doesn't make much sense. it's a great currency that we have. i think with karen's addition specifically to the board and sun communities history of using op transactions and preferred op units, brings an additional experience to the board of directors level. we've looked at a number of transactions. i think it's a -- i -- frankly, i'm surprised that more sellers don't look for op units of larger portfolios or larger assets, but we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to use in this currency.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho -- analyst
all right, thank you guys.
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, haendel.
operator
the next question comes from katy mcconnell with citi. please go ahead.
katy mcconnell -- citi -- analyst
great, thanks, good morning. could you provide some more background on the rethink retail opportunity in your portfolio? and then, to what extent are you starting to see increased demand from traditional malls or strip center tenants today to migrate to the net lease concept, because of the flexibility?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
yes. i appreciate the question. good morning katy. look the rethink retail campaign challenge is, it's really double nuance, right. it challenges retail investors to rethink net lease in agree realty and then challenges real estate investors to think of net lease in an omnichannel world. so i think the three dimensional video on the landing page demonstrates the increased capabilities, enhanced capabilities have been accelerated by covid. everything form lockers and bopus and same-day delivery and pickup. if you go to walmart's most recent press release, i believe just three, four weeks ago, it is on our website, you can see the pickup windows that they are now and micro fulfillment centers that they are now adding to their stores. the net lease format and will come out with another whitepaper that compares and contrasts net lease formats or freestanding formats with the shopping center format is amenable and capable of enhancing all of those different omnichannel capabilities in contrast to being in line stuff in the middle of shopping center. so we think that that omnichannel capability is unique to net lease as we continue to move to a world where 25% of sales are e-commerce related.
the second part to your question, will you remind me? oh malls and shopping centers. look, we continue to see what i'll tell you is a slow migration of retailers rethinking their own strategies in context of this omnichannel paradigm that we're in. now, commercial real estate has leases that range from five to 25 years and so these changes are always slow. i mean there are still sears stores and kmarts in existence. but these changes are always slow, they take time. but you see them on the margin, continuing to move. so for example, chipotle today is exploring a drive through only store. you see the walmart pickup and micro fulfillment. you see all different retailers recalibrating, adding additional drive throughs, adding -- i mean, you can just go to any of your local stores, adding pickup spots. the bottom line is that those modalities are not capable to be fulfilled if you're in the middle of a mall or if you are in the middle of a shopping center. the middle of the shopping center you have a front door and you have a back door. the front door is for consumer traffic, the back door is for truck deliveries, compactors and trash. and so if you are stuck in that middle of the shopping center, you cannot effectuate a true omnichannel micro fulfillment strategy, which we think is the future.
katy mcconnell -- citi -- analyst
thanks. and then just a quick follow-up. based on the acquisition pipeline you're seeing today, how should we think about your pace of ti volume throughout the year?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
as it always does, it adds inflows, our pipeline changes every day. i would tell you today, our pipeline is quite strong. again, i would always emphasize not only strength in terms of size, it's not like a broken record, but quality, it's easy to buy things, it's easy to create sports short-term spreads, it's easy to ignore residual values and acquire single purpose buildings. we simply, we just don't play that game. everything in our pipeline stands on its own, it's qualitatively additive to this portfolio, it's obviously quantitatively additive in terms of earnings in the bottom line. but i think if you look at our investment grade percentage or ground lease percentages, they keep climbing because we're focused on the best of the best and we see no shortage of opportunities to create not only short-term but long-term value embedded in this portfolio.
katy mcconnell -- citi -- analyst
great, thanks.

the next question comes from wes golladay with baird. please go ahead.
wes golladay -- baird -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. just want to go back to the rethink retail and the pace of adoption based on the retailers. do you think this could actually be accelerated? i think you mentioned a longer duration of typical change, but are you starting to see maybe existing tenants wanting to modify their stores and then maybe when you look at your existing walmart, will any of those be local fulfillment centers?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
no news from the walmart. for your last question, no news on the walmart conversion to any of the micro fulfillment centers. i wouldn't be surprised over time if that happens. they have a number of test stores that they are either working on currently, which i think is -- which is public knowledge. in terms of the rethink retail campaign, i think if you just look around and you drive to your local stores again, you can see the changes that they're making in their formats and it has been accelerated dramatically by covid, and we think that adoption even in a post-covid world isn't going to go away. i mean, it may not be as significant, but the adoption of omnichannel, i mean, i'll tell you my father, my parents they are in their mid-70s, they've used instacart for the first time, they've stayed in their car and had groceries put in their trunk for the first time. they've used doordash for the first time. we're in a world where all of these modalities have been accelerated from covid.
and frankly the most challenging, one of the two most challenging demographics, you have the older and then lower income. the older demographic has used these modalities the most and these are through apps and things where typically adoption is among the slowest. and so it's -- this is coming. it is inevitable and we think we are uniquely positioned given our portfolio and the retailers within it and the real estate, within it to be a major player there.
wes golladay -- baird -- analyst
got you. and then i guess, do you have any kind of guidance for g&a -- not g&a, you gave g&a but bad debt reserve? what was last year's level and then what is the normal run rate for you?
clay thelen -- chief financial officer
sure. so in terms of run rate, i guess, we -- let me start by saying in terms of whatâs still uncollected for 2020, we've put some additional disclosure at the bottom of our reconciliation on page 15 of our release. in terms of a run rate for bad debt, we specifically identify, we don't have a general reserve related to any bad debts. in terms of what was written off this year, if we go back just related to covid specifically, in terms of tenants that were moved to cash basis, that was roughly $1.5 million in total for the full year.
wes golladay -- baird -- analyst
great, thanks for the details.
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, wes.

the next question comes from todd stender with wells fargo. please go ahead.
todd stender -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, thanks. can we hear a little bit more about the ground leases you acquired in the quarter, maybe going in yield, any annual rent escalators, and then how much term is left? if you can characterize the 16?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
yes, just a little color. i don't have the granular detail on a lot of those on the individual transactions, todd. but i'll tell you a couple of transactions we bought. a walmart ground lease in rancho cordova, california, a very unique store, very unique piece of real estate. we bought a number of wawa ground leases. those have significant escalators within them, 20 year typically wawa ground leases where they constructed their own c-store, put their own tanks and canopies. so a number of -- we bought another good one is a hannaford grocery store paying $4 a foot in augusta, maine, a very unique building. i'd encourage everyone to look at that structure itself. i'm trying to think of the top of my head, a sheetz one or two sheetz similar to wawa industry leading c-store. those are ground leases as well. so a number of ground lease transactions, obviously that we've identified and we continue to see those opportunities frankly during this quarter and upcoming quarters.
todd stender -- wells fargo -- analyst
joey, how about going in yields, particularly for walmart in california or maybe the maine properties, any range you can give us?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
yes, generally they vary between 5.5 and 7, low 7 subject to terms, subject to a number of things. i'd remind everybody that our relationships with retailers enables us enhanced visibility into real estate performance store level coverage and other things, metrics that are important. so we have no problem buying short-term transactions. frankly some of those are some of the best deals that we do. so i'd tell you, the range of yields is within the band that equates to effectively the mid-6s in this case approximately a 6 and 6.4.
todd stender -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks. that's helpful. and you don't have a lot of leases expiring in the quarter in q4, and you have -- really have a modest level coming up this year. can you maybe just share some color on how these conversations are going? we're still in covid. what's the tenantâs willingness to sign a long-term renewal or really they're just reverting to kind of a five-year renewal at this point?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
we anticipate most tenants there are -- basically almost all the tenants that are upcoming this year in 2021, it's only 0.9% of total portfolio. in terms of gaap abr we anticipate them effectively all exercising options. those options typically are five years.
todd stender -- wells fargo -- analyst
all right, thanks. last one and thanks clay for the color on the g&a, but just as a reminder for timing for your forward equity offerings getting settled. is it fair to assume that once you hit the 12-month mark, we'll see that being settled or maybe any timing color you can provide?
clay thelen -- chief financial officer
sure. hi, todd. in terms of timing, i think, how we've approached forward settlement in the past couple of quarters is a good indicator. in terms of settling amounts to remain within our stated leverage range of 4 times to 5 times net debt to recurring ebitda. you're right in that our forward contracts allow for up to a year of settlement or a year to settle. our first contract that comes up is in may, so we have ample time there and flexibility in terms of when we settle. and we have roughly $50 million or so in the second quarter that will come up for settlement. so a lot of flexibility there. but again, i think the past couple of quarters is a good indicator in terms of solving within our targeted range of 4 times to 5 times.
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
one comment i'd add there, todd. i think the forwards and inclusive, as you can see in our filings, any swaps that we have in place for long-term debt is an overall part of an overall hedging policy for what we think is the biggest threat to this business, it's very difficult to identify internal threats in terms of credit or lease duration or in the balance sheet, is the macro environment, and so we've used forwards both off of the atm and regular way as well as swaps on the debt side to mitigate volatility and frankly, give us a medium-term visibility into our cost of capital. and so that overall hedging policy provides for stability and visibility there and we pair that obviously with what i call the brains of the organization, is the origination capability. so i've always looked at net lease as two piece of the heart, and then you have the brain, the heart is your cost of capital, preserving that cost of capital to create those spreads. and then the brains of the organization executing in terms of net investment activity and high quality real estate.
todd stender -- wells fargo -- analyst
that's helpful, thanks guys.

michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
it's michael bilerman. joey, just on the ground lease portfolio, which obviously has been increasing in size. how do you think about typically the returns on ground leases are going to be lower than if you're just buying the box and the ground together? and if you're not getting a commensurate decline in your cost of capital, both debt and equity blended, how do you sort of keep up the accretion? and i get the point of the quality of the real estate and the quality of the credit. but in order to drive cash flow and drive accretion, you sort of need a commensurate drop in cost of capital. so are you thinking about different structures as the ground lease portfolio, which is almost double-digit today, just go through some of that for us?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
yes, no, it's we arenât reaching on ground leases. so we are creating value in many of these ground leases. we are extending leases. we're working with tenants. we're sourcing them from unique structures. back to todd's question, these cap rates are falling within, generally speaking, in the ranges of our traditional turnkey acquisitions. what i think is really interesting and frankly almost a little bit frustrating, it goes almost the segmentation theory here is, is our ground lease portfolio which is going to -- i will tell you will increase, i anticipate it being double-digits by the end of q1 and then surpassing 10% of the overall portfolio is approaching a $1 billion in value, it's 92% investment grade, it's got a weighted average lease term of nearly 12 years. i tell you, it's vastly superior to the bbb, bbb+ bond index. there is tremendous upside, fantastic real estate in free buildings if they ever leave. so i think the market is missing the embedded value in that portfolio. and we aren't reaching to construct that portfolio, we're working through a whole range of origination capabilities to find them.
i'll tell you, interestingly, i mean the rancho cordova walmart that we acquired was from alex trebek's state. and we're a big jeopardy fans here and may he rest in peace, but that was literally alex trebek of walmart. and so these are unique opportunities that we are finding through the origination team in all of our, the 25,000 plus contacts in our crm system, but we will not reach in terms of yield there.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
right. but thinking about not getting credit for, it sounds like you're frustrated that the equity market may not be giving you the appropriate credit for that income stream. i guess are you thinking about maybe capitalizing that portfolio either through the cmbs market or another either maybe just direct secured financing against it to effectively scrape that value that you think and then roll that capital in or maybe it's through a joint venture with institutional partner. i guess waiting for the equity markets to distinguish your income streams, ground lease versus traditional net lease assets. i just don't know if it's going to come and so i just don't know how much you're spending time trying to highlight or scrape that value for shareholders?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, no, it's a great question. well i think we are in the short-term or medium term. we're not looking at different financing options to encumber that portfolio or lever that portfolio. so we will maintain an unsecured balance sheet. we anticipate being a consistent unsecured borrower in the investment grade public markets. i think what's most important we'll continue to hammer home the embedded value in that portfolio, it seems like investors have understood it in context of safe hold. we think these ground leases are very divergent for those. they have enhanced credit to the tenant. these are not structured leases. the tenant bills or structured transactions. the tenant paid for their own building and their own improvements again at 92% investment grade. i think the true change here and to pierce that segmentation just philosophy there is to continue to educate investors on the embedded value in that ground lease portfolio and in the individual pieces of real estate that we're actually acquiring. but look, i hope that works. my expectation is that education works. it's not easy in context of a vaccine trade and then the craziness we see in the equity markets today. but longer term, if we're unable to effectuate that, we'll look at all options as you mentioned.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
is there a public markets option that is creating this portfolio which sounds like itâs over $1 billion and more to come of creating a tracking stock or spin off or a separate entity where that income stream could be capitalized differently?
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
i wouldn't rule it out. i think that could be a longer term solution here. again, i think it's an extremely unique portfolio. if you look at the relative yields of the bbb, bbb+ bond index. you look at the term credit and embedded escalators and residual value here. if i'm a fixed income investor, i'd much rather own this ground lease portfolio than the unsecured paper for the retailers within it. and so i think we will look, we will always evaluate options. but i think that is an option longer term, that if we don't think we're getting with the correct value and it continues to scale that that's an option that we should look at.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
and by the way you are a tiktok star. your interview with benzinga is on tiktok. it looks like you're in the c-store by the way.
joey agree -- president & chief executive officer
well, i -- so maybe i don't know, social media is everywhere i guess. but look part of our rethink retail campaign back to the earlier question, part of the rethink retail campaign involves an enhanced digital and social effort on our part. i have been anti-digital social media for a long time, but i think it's important as we expand and increase our outreach to individual investors to use those mediums i guess inclusive of tiktok.

before turning the call over to joey, let me first run through the cautionary language. please note that during this call we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities law. our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including uncertainty related to the scope, severity and duration of the covid-19 pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures on us and on our tenants. please see yesterday's earnings release and our sec filings, including our latest annual report on form 10-k and subsequent reports for a discussion of various risks and uncertainties underlying our forward-looking statements.
in addition, we discuss non-gaap financial measures, including core funds from operations or core ffo, adjusted funds from operations or affo, and net debt to recurring ebitda. reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release, website and sec filings.
i will now turn the call over to joey.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, peter. i'm very pleased to report that we continued our strong start to the year, achieving record investment volume of more than $750 million during the first six months of 2021. robust and high quality investment activity further increased our investment grade, concentration and raised our ground lease exposure to a record of nearly 13%. our investment activities during the quarter were supported by more than $1 billion of strategic capital markets transactions that fortified our best-in-class balance sheet and positioned our company for continued growth in the quarters ahead. during the second quarter, we invested approximately $366 million in 59 high-quality retail net lease properties across our three external growth platforms. 54 of these properties were originated through our acquisition platform representing acquisition volume of more than $345 million. the 54 properties acquired during the second quarter are leased to 32 tenants operating in 18 distinct retail sectors including best-in-class operators in the off-price, home improvement, auto parts, general merchandise, dollar store, convenience store, craft and novelties, grocery and tire and auto service sectors.
the acquired properties had a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% and a weighted average lease term of 11.8 years. through the first six months of this year, we've invested a record $756 million into 146 retail net lease properties spanning 35 states in 24 retail sectors. approximately $732 million of our investment activity originated from our acquisition platform. roughly 75% of the annualized base rents acquired in the first half of the year comes from leading investment grade retailers, while almost one-third of annualized base rent is derived from ground leased assets. these metrics demonstrate our continued focus on best in class opportunities with leading omnichannel retailers, while still achieving record results. given our record acquisition activity date and visibility into our pipeline, we are increasing our full-year 2021 acquisition guidance to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.
during this past quarter, we executed on several unique and notable transactions, including a new small format target on the university of georgia's campus in athens. we are extremely pleased to expand our relationship with target, as well as add another unique street retail asset to our growing portfolio. we continue to invest in market dominant grocers during the quarter. most significant with a five-store sale leaseback transaction with kroger for approximately $68 million. the stores are located in texas, michigan, ohio, and mississippi and each location is subject to a new 15 year net lease. with this transaction kroger moved into our top 10 tenants at 3.2% of annualized base rents. kroger's of course is a leader in the grocery space. their fortified balance sheet, strategic omnichannel initiatives, and significant investment in e-commerce fulfillment are emblematic of our investment strategy.
additionally, we closed on the purchase of a shoprite, which is owned and operated by wakefern in new rochelle, new york. shoprite is a tremendous operator in the real estate located at a strategic interchange of i-95 is yet another example of the diligent bottoms for analysis that we conduct on every asset that we acquired.
finally, as you may recall we acquired our first wegmans ground lease in chapel hill, north carolina during the fourth quarter of 2020. we've built upon that momentum in this quarter with the acquisition of our second property ground leased to wegmans. the store located in parsippany, new jersey is over 100,000 square feet and was constructed at wegmans expense. the ground leases over 21 years of term remaining and is a welcome addition to our growing ground lease portfolio. through the first six months of the year we've acquired 45 ground leases for a total investment of over $240 million. the second quarter contribution to this total was 14 ground leases representing an investment volume of more than $113 million. additional notable ground lease acquisitions during the quarter included our first capital grow in whippany, new jersey. a walmart supercenter and lowe's and hooks at new hampshire, our first cabela's in albuquerque, new mexico, as well as three additional wawa assets increasing our wawa portfolio to 25 properties including their flagship store in downtown philadelphia.
as mentioned at quarter end, our overall ground lease exposure stood at a company record of 12.7% of annualized base rents and includes a very unique assets leased to the best retailers in the country. inclusive of our second quarter acquisition activity, the ground lease portfolio now derives nearly 90% of rents from investment grade tenants and has a weighted average lease term of 12.5 years. the majority of the portfolio includes rent escalators that result in average annual growth of close to 1% while the average per square foot rent is only $9 and $0.65. this growing portfolio continues to be a source of tremendous risk adjusted returns when reviewing the lease term, credit, underlying real estate attributes and of course the free building and improvements of a tenant wherever to vacate.
we look forward to continue to leverage our industry relationships and strong track record of execution to identify potential additions to this expanding and diversified sub portfolio. as of june 30, our portfolio's total investment grade exposure was nearly 68%, representing a significant year-over-year increase of approximately 670 basis points. on a two-year stacked basis, our investment grade exposure has improved by more than 1,300 basis points. the continued growth of our ground lease portfolio and the investment grade exposure demonstrates our disciplined focus on building the highest quality retail portfolio in the country.
moving on to our development and partner capital solutions platforms, we continue to uncover compelling opportunities with our retail partners. we had six development in pcs projects either completed or under construction during the first half of the year that represent total capital committed of more than $36 million. three projects were completed during the second quarter, including a grocery outlet in port angeles, washington, a gerber collision in buford, georgia, and a floor & decor in naples, florida. i'm pleased to announce we also commenced construction during the quarter of our second development with gerber collision in pooler, georgia. gerber will be subjected to a new 15 year net lease upon completion and we anticipate rent will commence in the first quarter of 2022. we continue to work with gerber collision on additional opportunities that we anticipate announcing later this year and into next year.
construction continued during the quarter on our first development with 7-eleven in saginaw, michigan. we anticipate delivery will take place in the first quarter of next year at which time 7-eleven will be subject to a new 15 year net lease. we remain focused on leveraging our full capabilities to grow our relationships with these leading omnichannel retailers. i look forward to providing an update on our continued progress in the coming quarters. while we continue to strengthen our best-in-class retail portfolio through record investment activity we're also quite active on the disposition front during the quarter. we continue to reducing walgreens exposure and as well as franchise restaurants as we sold seven properties for gross proceeds of approximately $28 million with a weighted average cap rate of 6.7%. in total, we disposed of 10 properties through the first six months of the year for gross proceeds of more than $36 million with a weighted average cap rate of approximately 6.7%. given our disposition activities during the first half of the year, we are raising the bottom end of our disposition guidance to $50 million for the year, while the high-end remains at approximately $75 million.
our asset management team has also been proactively and diligently addressing upcoming lease maturities. their efforts to reduce the remaining 2021 maturity to just three leases representing 20 basis points of annualized base rents. during the second quarter, we executed new leases, extensions or options on approximately 209,000 square feet of gross leasable area. most notably, we are extremely pleased to have executed a new 15 year net lease with gardner white to backfill our only former loves furniture store in canton, michigan. as you may recall, this was the art van flagship we developed prior to the company's acquisition by th lee. we delivered the space to gardner white in june and rent commenced in july, allowing us to recover close to 100% of prior rents with just over one month of downtime. i would note this is the second time we have released this asset on effectively full recovery since the art van bankruptcy.
gardner white is michigan-based family owned and operated, has been one of the preeminent furniture retailers in the state for more than a century. the company is led by rachel tronstein, one of the brightest minds in the retail furniture industry and a former high school classmate of mine. we are extremely pleased to have rachel and her team as partners in this flagship asset.
i'm also pleased to announce the addition of burlington to central michigan commons in mount pleasant, michigan, one of the only two remaining legacy shopping centers that we chose to retain during the transformation of our portfolio. to date we have redeveloped the former kmart space for hobby lobby and alta and added texas roadhouse on an outline via ground lease. these transactions are emblematic of our ability to unlock embedded value within the portfolio and support our decision to hold on to this very well located legacy shopping center across from central michigan university's main campus.
during the first six months of the year we executed new leases, extensions or options and approximately 275,000 square feet of gross leasable area and as of june 30, our expanding retail portfolio consisted of 1,262 properties across 46 states, including 134 ground leases and remains nearly 100% occupied at 99.5%.
with that, i'll hand the call over to simon and then we can open it up for any questions.
simon leopold -- chief financial officer
thank you, joey. starting with earnings core funds from operations for the second quarter was $0.89 per share, representing a record 17.3% year-over-year increase. adjusted funds from operations per share for the quarter was $0.88, an increase of 15.9% year-over-year. as a reminder, treasury stock is included within our diluted share count prior to settlement if and when adcs stock trades above the deal price of our outstanding forward equity offerings. the aggregate dilutive impact related to these offerings was less than half a penny in the second quarter. per factset, current analyst estimates for full year affo per share range from $3.40 per share to $3.53 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 6% to 10%. as mentioned on last quarter's call, we continue to view this level of growth as achievable and expect to end the year toward the higher end of this range given current visibility into our investment pipeline and the broader operating environment. building upon our 6% of affo per share growth in 2020-this implies two year stack growth in the mid-teens.
general and administrative expenses totaled $6.2 million in the second quarter. g&a expense was 7.6% of total revenue or 7.1% excluding the noncash amortization of above and below-market lease intangibles. even as we continue to invest in people and systems to facilitate our growing business, we anticipate the g&a as a percentage of total revenue will be in the lower 7% area for full year 2021 excluding the impact of lease intangible amortization on total revenues. as mentioned last quarter, g&a expense for our acquisitions team fluctuates based on acquisition volume for the year and our current anticipation for g&a expense reflects acquisition volume within our new guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. total income tax expense for the second quarter was approximately $485,000 for 2021. we continue to anticipate total income tax expense to be approximately $2.5 million.
moving onto our capital markets activities for the quarter, in may we completed a $650 million dual tranche public bond offering, comprised of $350 million of 2% senior unsecured notes due in 2028 and $300 million of 2.6% senior unsecured notes due in 2033. in connection with the offering, we terminated related swap agreements of $300 million that hedged for 2033 notes receiving approximately $17 million upon termination. considering the effect of the terminated swap agreements, the blended all-in rates for the 2028 notes and 2033 notes are 2.11% and 2.13% respectively. we used the portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay all $240 million of our unsecured term loans, the termination costs related to early pay down of our unsecured term loans total approximately $15 million. given the one-time nature of the termination costs, these amounts have been added back to our core ffo and affo measures. the offering in combination with the prepayment of all of our unsecured term loans extended our weighted average debt maturity to approximately nine years and reduced our effective weighted average interest rate to approximately 3.2%. in june, we also completed a follow-on public offering of 4.6 million shares of common stock.
upon closing, we received net proceeds of approximately $327 million. during the second quarter, we entered into forward sale agreements in connection with our atm program to sell an aggregate of roughly 1.2 million shares of common stock for anticipated net proceeds of approximately $81 million. in may, we settled roughly 164,000 shares and received net proceeds of approximately $10 million. at quarter-end we had approximately 3.9 million shares remaining to be settled under existing forward sale agreements which are anticipated to raise net proceeds of approximately $259 million upon settlement. inclusive of the anticipated net proceeds from our outstanding forward offerings cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $950 million in available liquidity at quarter-end. the balance sheet continues to be a huge strength for us. as of june 30, our pro forma net debt to recurring ebitda was approximately 3.6 times, including our outstanding forward equity offerings. excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring ebitda was approximately 4.5 times.
total debt to enterprise value of quarter-end was approximately 25% while fixed charge coverage remained at a record five times. during the second quarter, we declared monthly cash dividends of $0.217 per share for april, may and june. the monthly dividend reflected an annualized dividend amount of $2.60 per share representing an 8.5% increase over the annualized dividend amount of $2.40 cents per share for the second quarter of last year. our payout ratios for the second quarter were a conservative 73% of core ffo per share and 74% of affo per share respectively. subsequent to quarter-end, we declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.217 per share for july. the monthly dividend reflects an annualized dividend amount of $2.60 per share or an 8.5% increase over the annualized dividend amount of $2.40 per share from the third quarter of 2020.
with that, i'd like to turn the call back over to joey.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, simon. at this time, operator, we will open it up for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] the first question comes from ki bin kim with truist. please go ahead.
ki bin kim -- truist -- analyst
thank you and good morning out there. so joey when i look back at your transaction history, you've been buying in the past, like in the mid-7 a few years ago and then 7% in the past, i think in 2019 and 2018 and then that yield has gone down to the low 6s lately. so i'm just curious when you look at that is it because cap rate compression across the sector or is it that you're targeting certain types of investments like ground leases which nevertheless have lower yields. i'm just trying to understand what was the cause of that and if a low 6% is what we should be expecting from you guys for the foreseeable future.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, no, i appreciate the question, kim. but i think generally speaking, we've seen in several years of cap rate compression with cap rates at historic lows as of today, so we continue to target high-quality assets. i don't think you've seen any change there since we've launched the acquisition platform in 2010 and we've said historically that our ground lease assets generally fall within the range. the cap rate range of the turnkey acquisitions that we make, so we continue to see very aggressive capital chasing a high-quality lease retail properties and i think what you'll see from us relative to other acquirers out there is that we're continuing to drive toward quality without sacrificing yield. and so it's a competitive environment we don't see that changing, but the team is doing a fantastic job creating value through all sorts of transactions.
ki bin kim -- truist -- analyst
ok. and second question, can you just help me understand the ground lease portfolio strategy. i forget what the lease duration is for that segment of your portfolio and when the lease does come do how are you thinking about that? and is there, is it fair market value, reset, or is there contractual rent increases built today. i'm trying to understand, eventually when that comes to, what will actually happen.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, so the ground lease portfolio is weighted average lease term about 12.5 years as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. rent per square foot is only $9.65 with annual embedded growth of approximately 1% and is 90% investment grade. so when you look at our ground lease portfolio. i'd tell you, from a credit, real estate, and return perspective, but i think it is a very unique sub-portfolio that obviously is growing trending toward 13% of our overall portfolio. we continue to find just compelling opportunities there now. upon expiration or failure to renew an auction, we effectively get the building and the entire premises for free now. that is very rare, tenants typically don't want to give away improvements that are sitting on their balance sheet. and so, it's the upside, upon lease expiration or failure to exercise an option or rejection in the bankruptcy once that contractual leases is broken, is very compelling, as well.
so, i think when you look at the front end, the economics, the underlying credit profile, the lease duration, the embedded growth in the portfolio and you combine that with the residual value in real estate, that's not on our balance sheet that the tenant paid for, for example, the wegmans and the capital grill that we acquired with the parsippany, new jersey here it's a pretty compelling risk-adjusted return.
ki bin kim -- truist -- analyst
so when you say that the tenant has an option, is that option based on the contractual rent increase of whatever stated x percent or is it a fair market value reset type adoption?
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
the vast majority is the former, so contractual increases throughout the base term then contractual increases pursuant to exercising any options.
ki bin kim -- truist -- analyst
ok, thank you, joey.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks kim.
operator, i think we can go to number two.
operator
the next question comes from crossett with berenberg. please go ahead.
nate crossett -- berenberg -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
morning, crossett.
nate crossett -- berenberg -- analyst
maybe just following up on that ground lease question, what can you may be provide us in terms of helping us value that optionality of the ground lease portfolio. do you guys track kind of your cost basis versus the appraised value of everything that's on top of the ground lease?
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
no, i think, look, first off, we're not going out and appraising every single asset, we're not getting asset-level financing. we're not looking at valuations really in that perspective. we're looking at price per pound that we're acquiring the building, if and when we were to get that back, we're looking at price per acre and then we're looking at replacement rents for that specific use.
so again the ground leases range just to give you a sense, the ground leases range from mcdonald's rate chase ground lease on a one acre parcel of 354,000 square foot building to us to a walmart supercenter our costco sitting on 20 acres. and so those are very different constructs. obviously, if we were to get one of the walmart or in this case our first cabela's building back, we would have effectively a 20-acre parcel with 600 feet of frontage where we could develop five to six outlets plus 100,000 square foot to 200,000 square foot building back it for free in the rear, which used to formally how obviously is the store and so they're very different analysis in comparison to a wawa c-store, that is a c store, that's a c-store, always a c store. and i think it really takes an individual bottoms up real estate analysis to be able to understand each and every asset, but at the end of the day, we are always getting the improvements in the building back for free if the tenant were to vacate for any reason.
nate crossett -- berenberg -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. maybe, i was wondering if you could parse out i think the average yield in the quarter was 6.2%. what was the yield on the ground leased stock versus the non-ground leased stock.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. just rate of that range. i don't have the exact number in front of me in april it is really right in that range, we're buying generally speaking between 5 at the low end and a 7. sometimes higher frankly and what we're doing things with tenants such as blend and extends or really exercises of options or working in conjunction, but that's the general range here. we acquire a number of shorter-term ground leases or medium-term ground leases with asymmetric information and we're working in conjunction with a tenant on a longer-term prospect.
nate crossett -- berenberg -- analyst
ok. maybe just one last one on pricing. i was just curious on what leasing spreads were like on the renewals and kind of what's the expectation or what is left this year. i know it's not a lot, but.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, i mean, really effectively every single option has been exercised this year, asking we're extremely pleased to have burlington added to mount pleasant. that was a former jcpenney, where they're paying 250 a foot or something ridiculous, so obviously is a significant positive leasing spread, but in the overall scheme of things it is very de minimis obviously. and then with the former art van, then the former loves furniture we're thrilled to have gardner white in there. as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, gardner white has been in business for over 100 years, i think since 1914 or 1916. it is led by a fourth generation leader and rachel tronstein today. this store is now their flagship. they have effectively relocating the store from down the street, they've been in the market, they've been in the state. and this is a stable family owned company and we recaptured essentially 100% of rent for the second time from art van to loves and then loves to gardner white, which we're thrilled to have taken over that asset.

the next question comes from katy mcconnell with citi. please go ahead.
katy mcconnell -- citi -- analyst
thank you and good morning everyone. so on the ground lease acquisitions, whether any other portfolios acquired this quarter and then just looking at the future pipeline did you expect to keep that at similar pace of deals relative to the total deal volume?
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, good morning, katy. we did acquire some small portfolios of just diversified assets during the quarter. nothing overly material. in terms on a go-forward basis, look our q3 pipeline has a significant ground lease exposure. we're excited about those opportunities. many of them very similar to what we've executed in the past couple of quarters here in terms of on a go-forward here, we're going to continue to evaluate all opportunities whether they're ground lease or turnkey in the next few on the best opportunities that we're able to originate and so it's hard to predict the future.
never thought we'd see the ground lease portfolio approaching 13%, but again the team continues to do a tremendous job originating opportunities.
katy mcconnell -- citi -- analyst
thank you, great. another, you've adjusted on 2021 lease expiration, what percentage of that space is ultimately renewed and how does that compare to historical trends.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
effectively 100% was ultimately renewed. obviously, we had the loves bankruptcy. so that was a unique situation and jc penney bankruptcy where they rejected. i believe the actual rejection took place in 2020. the jcpenney rejection in mount pleasant where we've signed on burlington and so i caution everyone our leasing activity is probably not emblematic of any broader trends. in retail we have very de minimis remaining leases expiring. obviously, this year at only 0.2% of abr and 1.1% of abr in 2022. and so again, i would caution everybody not to see any larger trends on that.
katy mcconnell -- citi -- analyst
thank you, guys.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, katy.

your next question comes from robert stevenson with janney. please go ahead.
robert stevenson -- janney -- analyst
good morning, guys. joey. i know it's a relatively small piece of the portfolio, but how are your movie theaters doing these days where are rents rebounding to and then also, have you seen any theater assets trade in the market and where those asset values versus pre-pandemic if you wanted to sell down some of your portfolio?
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
good morning, rob. full transparency, i haven't been to the movies or looked at a movie theater since the pandemic started, but we've got five movie theaters in the portfolio today, they're all paying rent, the red mafia is helping a number of these operators, obviously in the portfolio. we have no interest in movie theaters, adding additional movie theater exposure. we weren't adding movie theater exposure for several years before the pandemic. my kids do want to see space jam too. so we'll have to put that on the docket here, but besides that, we just don't think the fundamentals of the business, plus the residuals on the real estate makes sense in context of this portfolio.
robert stevenson -- janney -- analyst
but, i guess if you wanted to sell that today is there a significant haircut or has it rebounded enough that you could sell those plus or minus a bit of where you'd want to or is this on hold for 2022 or 2023 and hope for a bigger rebound to get out of those?
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
it's a good question. i'd say there is a lot of liquidity in the feeder market today, we're very comfortable with the five theaters that we have in the portfolio, it's again large operators, the amc regal cinemark. i wouldn't anticipate that pricing with that pre-pandemic levels by any means, but i think you saw pricing weakness pre-pandemic as well in the sector in general. and so if we see an opportunity to divest of one of the theater, just like we divested of the dave & buster's in austin we will do so. but we're very comfortable, holding them. it's, again it's a fairly de minimis. it's a very de minimis piece of our portfolio and we're comfortable with the five assets.
robert stevenson -- janney -- analyst
ok. and then how are you feeling about the furniture segment going forward as a whole these days, and you still want to be there longer-term on a risk adjusted basis. and then i guess with 15 years now on this gardner white lease is now the time to sell that asset as well.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
but -- we have very de minimis exposure to furniture, i believe we have one ashley furniture and now with gardner white in the portfolio. so we've never been overly acquisitive in the furniture space, it's obviously highly cyclical related to the housing market, the broader macroeconomic trends, the bigger problem with the furniture space generally in real estate is the lack of parking for most of the stores. and so you take the average grocery stores parked one per 1,000 and so a 40,000 square foot furniture store frankly cannot park for a grocery operator or a soft good operator. so that's the biggest challenge, so it effectively becomes almost the single purpose buildings in like we're to a movie theater or gas station. and so we've never been overly attracted to the furniture space. obviously, we develop the art van flagship in conjunction with our van predating obviously his death in th lee. we're thrilled to have a gardner white here. we will look at all opportunities, i think if everybody who hadn't seen this asset goes through the youtube video. i think it still has our van on it. this is a premier retail location in the state of michigan sharing a traffic signal with ikea heads up and one of the three largest retail thoroughfares in southeast michigan. so gardner white is going to do fantastic year. they've been in that sub-market for a long time right down the street and this store is going to do fantastic and we'll look for any opportunities if it makes sense for us to divest or move on from it.
robert stevenson -- janney -- analyst
ok, thanks, guys. appreciate it.

the next question comes from john massocca with ladenburg thalmann. please go ahead.
john massocca -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
good morning.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
good morning, john.
john massocca -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
with regards to your balance sheet strategy, what should we expect with regards to the forward issuance under the atm? is there an absolute or relative amount you're targeting had outstanding on a forward basis at any one time.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
i'll touch on and then hand over to simon. and i think, we're will continue to be opportunistic with capital sources seeking to maintain a balance sheet is going to enable our growth like we have historically in the four to five times range, inclusive of forwarding settlement of any equity and then we'll continue to look to reduce our cost of capital at attractive pricing. simon. go ahead.
simon leopold -- chief financial officer
yes, i mean just sort of echoing what joey is saying, obviously the balance sheet's in great shape, we got very little leverage and great access to efficiently price capital and we raised over $1 billion to this year and the combination of institutional debt, forward equity, straight common equity and we're generating very strong ffo growth while improving an already high quality portfolio. so i think at the end of the day it's working and we don't plan to change it. if we can find other ways that makes sense to give ourselves some more tools in our toolbox to keep funding this company and its growth the right way, then we'll certainly look at them, but we think what we're doing is working and we're going to keep doing it.
john massocca -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
is there like a level you have in mind that you think about that issuance in terms of, gives you kind of a set cost of capital, no matter what the equity markets do in terms of volatility, but obviously, it's kind of a reserve the hold in some way. so is that, is there a number you have in mind, could we see that decline over time. given the amount you kind of raised on the atm on a forward basis in this quarter, or sorry, q2 versus as well as having to kind of follow-on offerings in the quarter as well or is it kind of just going to be an opportunistic thing on your end.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, john, i wouldn't think of it as an absolute or relative level generally. forward equity is part of an overall hedging policy we have that we utilize to maintain medium-term visibility into our cost of capital. so very similar and this is why we derive the forward equity strategy several years ago and we've seen a number of net lease reits follow suit through regular way atm is that we looked out in the marketplace we knew we are growing at a 30% cagr. we obviously there's macroeconomic volatility that is out of our control and so companies have historically used forward starting swaps on the debt side, we said was 75% of our balance sheet is equity. why don't we take an overall hedging policy to have a more stable perspective of the larger piece of our capital stack the equity side?
and so it's part of an overall hedging policy. the last two transactions i believe we've done have been regular way transactions. they haven't been forward then we utilize the forward structure on the atm in conjunction with it, and again the goal here is, we know we're going to grow, but we have visibility in the 60-70 days of our pipeline, hence the increased acquisition guidance here. we're still just working on q4. and it gives us that visibility beyond q4 into our cost of capital, whether it's covid 2020 or the margins come down or who knows what happens or inflation runs rampant, we're going to have the ability to execute on our strategy assets.
john massocca -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
that makes sense. and then i know you already touched a little bit on kind of disposition outlook but with regards to the restaurant space, it sounds like that was a focus on dispositions in the quarter, is that something we can see on the casual dining side, go down to zero eventually or is there kind of a lower bound for where that may end up in terms of exposure.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, we will continue to opportunistically divest of generally speaking franchise fast-food restaurant into a very aggressive environment. in q2, we closed the sale of two wendy's, a burger king. i think you'll see us continue selling those assets. we don't have very many left, frankly, we sold the vast majority of them. and so the franchise fast food restaurant space is effectively winding down for us. in terms of casual dining we have very few assets that are casual dining and then the vast majority asset i think one or two of the entire portfolio our ground leases, and so we're very comfortable with those positions, as i talked about on the call in the pre-recorded part the capital grew ground lease is a very unique asset right -- that's fine dining and mature with the category or sector designated for that it's the only one in the portfolio, but it's sitting there in parsippany, new jersey, capitals built the entire building and obviously it's a beautiful build-out and so it's a ground lease, similar to the rest of the casual dining assets in our portfolio.
john massocca -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
ok. and i guess is there any kind of low-hanging fruit then maybe we think beyond 2021 in terms of dispositions, as you kind of solidify into you may be more ground leases in the restaurant space that you're not going to end up selling and obviously, we'll see theater pricing as you talked about the ability on the call, but anything else that kind of stands out as a potential sorts of dispositions category-wise.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
i tell you our disposition activity over the last several years has reduced our pharmacy exposure, obviously reduced our walgreens exposure, the restaurant exposure, the dave & buster's now where we only have two including effective with the flagship in new orleans. i think the portfolio as a whole has never been in a better place, we'll continue to opportunistically divest of assets.
that being said, i think if we roll back the clock to 2010, when we had 70 properties, i would bet you, we have less than 20 remaining of those legacy assets of the entire portfolio today. so we have, it's a new portfolio that's been constructed with an omnichannel future in mind since the advent of our acquisition platform in 2010 and it frankly doesn't have a lot of legacy challenges and so we're in a good place.
john massocca -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
makes sense. and that's it for me. thank you very much for taking the question.
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, john.

[operator instructions] the next question comes from linda tsai with jefferies. please go ahead.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning with grocery now your largest tenant take that almost 11%, how does the credit quality of these tenants compared to the overall portfolio average. and would you expect it to grow as a percentage of, your whole?
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
good morning, linda. our grocery exposure is now led obviously by kroger. walmart doesn't fall into the grocery stores for us. there are in general merchandise, is now led by kroger and it's effectively a 100% or nearly 100% investment grade. so the shop rate acquisition is wait for credit. the amazon fresh as we acquired are amazon. the kroger portfolio obviously has kroger credit. we have one or two publix in the portfolio in heb, now the two wegmans inclusive of the new jersey asset on a ground lease. and so, our focus in grocery we think there's going to be significant shakeup in the grocery industry over the next several years, is on best of breed operators who have the balance sheet to invest in price and invest in an omnichannel future through both macro and/or micro fulfillment or whatever permutation of that may take.
and so it's a highly competitive industry with 2% historic margins. it's going to be continued to be very competitive with amazon fresh continuing to roll out stores in full price transparency and so we think the best of breed whether the super-regional or national is going to shake out and be on top year and that's the only place we'll invest capital in the grocery space.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. and then there's a lot of headlines on rising covid cases in the delta variant. what kind of conversations you have internally or might have had with your tenants on the potential impact you know if the case counts continue?
joel agree -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, -- we were in a very unique position outside of the off-price retailers tjx being among them. the retailers in our portfolio thrived during the pandemic, generally speaking, so walmart, tractor supply, dollar general even best buy, the auto parts guys, the home improvement guys. they were thriving during the pandemic, frankly do agree that i wouldn't have anticipated. and i think i mentioned on the last call and never knew there were so many people to perform home improvement projects or fix their cars on their own out there, but it was the sales were absolutely tremendous at the four-wall level.
i think the biggest challenge for every retailer or the conversations we have is labor challenges today, is staffing. that's obviously apparent everybody who goes out to eat or goes shopping today is the staffing challenges out there continue to persist. most retailers in our portfolio have figured out a way to navigate it, but that's the biggest challenge, but nothing specific to the delta variant or any other variant in terms of impact on the business.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst

good morning and welcome to the agree realty third quarter 2021 conference call. [operator instructions]. i would now like to turn the conference over to nicole witteveen, executive vice president and chief of staff. please go ahead nicole.
nicole witteveen -- executive vice president, people and culture, chief of staff
thank you. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us agree realty's third quarter 2021 earnings call. before turning the call over to joey and peter to discuss the results for the quarter, let me first run through the cautionary language. please note that during this call we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities law. our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements for a number of reasons including uncertainty related to the scope, severity, and duration of the covid-19 pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and the containment measures of us and our tenants. please see yesterday's earnings release and our sec filings, including our latest annual report on form 10-k and subsequent reports for discussion of various risks and uncertainties underlying our forward-looking statements.
in addition, we discuss non-gaap financial measures including core funds from operations or core ffo, adjusted funds from operations or affo and net debt to recurring ebitda. reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release website and sec filings. i will now turn the call over to joey.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, nicole. i'm very pleased to report that we achieved record investment volume of approximately $1.1 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 with continued momentum heading into the 4th quarter of this year. while replicating these investment volume is the testament to the efforts of our talented team, i am most pleased with the exceptional quality of the investments that we've made in a challenging environment. while our investment activities further strengthen our best-in-class retail portfolio we have also fortified our robust balance sheet with $1.5 billion of capital markets transactions year-to-date positioning our company for dynamic growth in the quarters ahead. notably, we completed our inaugural preferred equity offering during the 3rd quarter, raising $175 million at a 4.25% coupon. this represents the lowest non-psa reit preferred equity coupon in history and provides a new source of perpetual capital for our rapidly growing company. during the 3rd quarter, we invested approximately $343 million in 83 high quality retail net lease properties across our 3 external growth platforms, 80 of these properties were sourced through our acquisition platform representing acquisition volume of over $340 million. the 80 properties acquired during the 3rd quarter are leased to 49 tenants operating in 20 distinct retail sectors including best in class operators and off-price retail, convenience stores, tire and auto service, home improvement, auto parts, grocery, and general merchandise. the acquired properties at a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% and a weighted average lease term of 10.7 years. as mentioned, through the first 9 months of the year, we've invested a record $1.1 billion in 226 retail net lease properties spanning 40 states across the country and 26 retail sectors. while raising the lower end of our acquisition guidance for the year to $1.3 billion our thoughtful and disciplined approach is evidenced by the nearly one-third of annualized base rents acquired year-to-date derived from ground lease assets and roughly 70% of annualized base rents acquired derived from leading investment grade retailers. during this past quarter, we executed on several unique transactions, including our 3rd amazon fresh store in illinois. we're excited about the opportunity to add yet another amazon fresh store to the portfolio located in a prominent chicago suburb with median household incomes of 110,000 and a daytime population of roughly 225,000 within a 5-mile radius. our acquisition team also continues to uncover compelling ground lease opportunities. during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a 9-property portfolio of thorntons convenience stores for approximately $21 million. the stores which are paying an average annual rent of only $120,000 per year and had a weighted average lease term of close to 20 years are all well located in the nashville and chicago msas. shortly after executing a letter of intent to purchase this portfolio, bp announced they're taking full ownership of thorntons convenience store chain after 2.5 years as part of a joint venture established in 2019. this transaction makes bp, which is an a minus rated company by s&p, one of the leading convenience store operators in the midwest with more than 200 stores across 6 states. other notable ground lease acquisitions during the quarter, including are walmart and sam's club in lansing, michigan, two lowe's stores located in wallingford, connecticut and abington, massachusetts, and a cvs in springfield, massachusetts.
we have acquired 73 ground leases year-to-date for total investment spend of nearly $350 million representing nearly 31% of acquisition spent for the entire year. this includes 28 ground leases during the 3rd quarter representing investment volume of over $108 million. as of september 30, our ground lease exposure reached a record of nearly 14% of annualized base rents. the ground lease portfolio now derives roughly 87% from investment grade tenants and has a weighted average lease term of 12.1 years, with an average rent of less than 10 dollars per square foot. this portfolio continues to represent an extremely attractive risk-adjusted investment for our shareholders. on recent earnings calls and discussions, there had been considerable dialog regarding our ground lease portfolio and its valuation. i would encourage everyone to take a look at the new slide we added on page 10 of our investor presentation which compares our ground lease portfolio to the 10-year bloomberg bbb index, which has been trading between 2% and 3% over the past 12 months. this is a very compelling comparison when thinking about the value of our ground lease portfolio, which is a weighted average credit rating of bbb plus over 2 years of additional term in comparison to the bloomberg bbb index and internal growth of nearly 1%.
as of september 30, our portfolio's total investment grade exposure was approximately 67% representing close to 100 basis point year-over-year increase. on a 2-year stacked basis, our investment grade exposure has improved by roughly a 1,000 basis points.
moving on to our development and partner capital solutions program, we continue to uncover compelling opportunities with our retail partners. we had 7 development in pcs projects either completed or under construction during the first 9 months of the year that represent total committed capital of approximately $40 million. i'm pleased to announce we commenced construction during the quarter on our 3rd development with gerber collision in new port richey, florida. gerber will be subject to a new 15-year lease upon completion and we anticipate rent will commence in the second quarter of 2022. construction continued during the 3rd quarter on 2 development in pcs projects with anticipated cost of just over $5 million. the projects consists of our first 7-eleven development in saginaw michigan and a gerber collision in pooler, georgia. we remain focused on leveraging our three external growth platforms and our differentiated asset management capabilities to expand our relationships with best-in-class retailers providing comprehensive solutions that facilitate the real estate strategies and growth plans.
while we continue to strengthen our best-in-class retail portfolio through record investment activity, we remain active on the disposition front during the 3rd quarter. we continue to reduce exposure to franchise restaurants and non-core tenants through the disposition of 3 properties for total gross proceeds of approximately $11.8 million with a weighted average cap rate of 6.3%. as of september 30, we've disposed of 13 properties for gross proceeds of just over $48 million and are maintaining our disposition guidance of $50 million to $75 million for the year. bolstered by the recent addition of david darling as our vice president of real estate, the asset management team continues to diligently address upcoming lease maturities. their efforts have reduced our 2021 maturities to just 4 leases, representing 10 basis points of annualized base rents. during the 3rd quarter, we executed new leases, extensions or options in approximately 72,000 square feet of gross leasable area. through the first 9 months of the year, we executed new leases, extensions, or options on approximately 347,000 square feet of gross leasable space. our 2022 lease maturities are de minimis with only 19 leases maturing representing less than 1% of annualized base rents expiring over the course of the next year. as of september 30, our expanding retail portfolio consisted of 1338 properties across 47 states, including 162 ground leases and remains effectively fully occupied at 99.6%. notably and as pointed out in our press release, walgreens in la fitness are no longer top tenants for our company, both now represent less than 1.5% of annualized base rents. for those that have been following our company over the years, this reduction in walgreens exposure is a true milestone given our historical exposure which once approached 40% of our portfolio. we have made a concerted effort to approach to tailor our pharmacy exposure given the high per square foot rental rates of many vintage pharmacy leases and then virgin approaches of cvs and walgreens to a quickly changing landscape.
before i turn the call over to peter to discuss our financial results, i'd like to welcome, mike judlowe to our board of directors. many of you are familiar with mike as he most recently served as chairman of the us real estate, gaming and lodging investment banking practice at jefferies. over the course of his career, mike has raised in excess of $50 billion of capital through numerous transactions. having had the opportunity to work with mike for many years, i am extremely excited to leverage his unique perspectives and experiences as our company continues to dynamically grow and evolve. with that, i'll hand the call over to peter to discuss our financial results for the quarter. peter?
peter coughenour -- interim chief financial officer
thank you, joey, starting with earnings. core funds from operations for the 3rd quarter was $0.92 per share, representing a 13% year-over-year increase. adjusted funds from operations per share for the quarter increased 11.5% year-over-year to $0.89. as a reminder, treasury stock is included within our diluted share count prior to settlement if and when adc stock trades above the deal price of our outstanding forward equity offerings. the aggregate dilutive impact related to these offerings was roughly half a penny in the 3rd quarter. as mentioned on the last 2 calls, we expect to achieve high single-digit earnings growth for full year affo per share. building upon our 6% affo per share growth in 2020, this implies 2 year stack growth in the mid teens. we view this level per share growth is very compelling when combined with the strength of our portfolio and our fortress like balance sheet. this consistent and reliable earnings growth continues to support a growing and well covered dividend.
during the 3rd quarter, we declared monthly cash dividends of [phonetic] $0.217 per common share for july, august and september. on an annualized basis, the monthly dividends represent an 8.5% increase over the annualized dividend from the 3rd quarter of last year. while meaningfully increasing the common dividend over the past year, we maintained conservative payout ratios for the 3rd quarter of 71% of core ffo per share and 70% of affo per share respectively. subsequent to quarter end, we again increased the monthly cash dividend by 4.6% to $0.227 per common share for october. the monthly dividend reflects an annualized dividend amount of $2.72 per share or 9.8% increase over the annualized dividend amount of $2.48 per share from the 4th quarter of 2020. on a 2-year stack basis, this reflects annualized dividend growth of more than 15%.
general and administrative expenses for the 3rd quarter which were impacted by recent changes to the company's executive officers totaled $5.7 million. g&a expense was 6.5% of total revenue or 6% excluding the noncash amortization of above and below-market lease intangibles. while we continue to invest in people and systems to support our dynamic and growing business, we still anticipate that g&a as a percentage of total revenue will be roughly 7% for full year 2021. this excludes the impact of lease intangible amortization on total revenues. as mentioned last quarter, g&a expense for our acquisitions team fluctuates based on acquisition volume for the year and our current anticipation for g&a expense reflects acquisition volume within our new guidance range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.
total income tax expense for the 3rd quarter was approximately $390,000, which was slightly lower than our expectation. due to a one-time refund. we continue to anticipate total income tax expense for 2021 to be close to $2.5 million.
moving onto our capital markets activities for the quarter, as joey mentioned, in september, we completed our inaugural preferred equity offering raising $175 million of gross proceeds at a record low coupon of 4.25. this attractive offering demonstrates our ability to opportunistically access yet another source of capital to support the continued growth of our company. during the 3rd quarter, we entered into forward sale agreements in connection with our atm program to sell an aggregate of approximately 367,000 shares of common stock for anticipated net proceeds of roughly $27 million. during the quarter, we also settled close to 886,000 shares under forward atm sale agreements and received net proceeds of approximately $56 million. at quarter end, we had approximately 3.4 million shares remaining to be settled under existing forward sale agreements which are anticipated to raise net proceeds of more than $226 million upon settlement. inclusive of the settlement of our outstanding forward equity, our fortified balance sheet stood at approximately 3.7 times net debt to recurring ebitda. excluding the impact of our unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring ebitda was approximately 4.4 times. if you include our recent preferred equity offering and net debt, this adds roughly half a turn of leverage to our net debt to recurring ebitda metrics.
at september 30, total debt to enterprise value is just under 25%, while our fixed charge coverage increased to a record 5.1 times. with full availability under our revolving credit facility and nearly $830 million in total liquidity, we have tremendous flexibility to execute on our growth plans. with that i'd like to turn the call back over to joey.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, peter. at this time, operator, we will open it up for questions.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]. our first question comes from brad heffern with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
brad heffern -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone. i was wondering on the acquisition front, if you could walk through the relative attractiveness of the investment grade versus sub-investment grade. this quarter i noticed it was a little bit below the normal proportion for the portfolio overall and it was down quite a bit sequentially. thanks.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, brad. first off, we're focused on our sandbox of industry-leading retailers at 25 to 30 retailers across the country that generally speaking have investment grade credit ratings and/or a ground lease asset where we see residual upside and so notably, this quarter, we acquired a shorter term out that portfolio of unrated tenants, we don't impute any scores or rating to those included. there is a aaa kfc franchise and outback steakhouse just for example, the outback paying 950 a foot on 2 acres, on the 2-acre site $63,000 a year we see tremendous upside if we were to able to get that, get that asset back. we acquired a publix, obviously it doesn't have a credit rating. you can impute an investment grade credit rating to publix if you'd like in south carolina. lastly, we acquired a bj's in wallingford, connecticut to immediately adjacent to the lowe's, we own in wallingford as well right on the toll road, great piece of real estate, high performing store, low rent and clear visibility into the residual of the real estate there. so you will see those numbers investment grade and/or term ground lease as well fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but i think over the course of the year it is pretty consistent.
brad heffern -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, got it. and then on ground lease you all continue to acquire sort of 30% level every quarter, is that what we should sort of think of as the long-term goal for ground leases as a percentage of the portfolio or any color you could put around how big you want it to eventually be?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
we see, as i mentioned, in our prepared remarks, tremendous opportunity, we think the valuation of that portfolio when you convert to something like a bbb index it is extremely compelling. in terms of a go-forward basis we're opportunists that are core, the outback that i just mentioned is a perfect example there, we'd love to get that asset back and release it for 3 times of the current rent. so we'll see those transactions continue to materialize as a number of them in q4, visibility into 2022 is still pretty light here at the beginning of november. but we're focused on finding the best in class opportunities on a risk adjusted basis.
brad heffern -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, thank you.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thanks. brad.

our next question comes from katy mcconnell with citi. please go ahead.
katy mcconnell -- citi -- analyst
thanks, good morning. can you discuss what the acquisition pipeline looks like today and have you seen any notable changes in the opportunity set or pricing trends that might contribute to some conservatism that you're assuming for 4q.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, good morning. katy i would read too much into the upper end of our guidance being raised, certainly no deceleration in our pipeline. we have a few hundred million dollars, close to 100 properties in our pipeline today. it's really just a question of timing when those -- when those close. so does it close by year end or they push into next year, a lot of that is under our control subject to a seller and-or are retailers, and so i can say with confidence here the pipeline is in place, to continue to execute on the granular nature of our traditional transactions or much larger transaction if that comes to -- comes about or comes to fruition. so you can combine the team here in conjunction with our arc system, it's a powerful combination, will continue to execute. i wouldn't read into any guidance not being raised at the year end here or the 1.4 billion not being raised, it's quite possible we will hit it or exceed it subject to timing.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
hey, joey. it's michael bilerman. good morning. and just going back to the ground lease portfolio, you and i discussed this earlier when you started to really accelerate the ground lease assets. if you're not going to get a commensurate decline in your cost of capital and i can understand the residual value, that could be embedded in some of these, which are quite long duration. so it's not always immediate in terms of getting to that opportunity, and i'm sure you're going to company examples that you have, but in aggregate, you're not going to able to get the residual value as quickly and i'm not sure the market gives you value especially if your cost of capital is not declining to the same degree to create the same level ofaccretive growth. so i guess, are you thinking at all about different structures for the ground lease portfolio or how do you, help us understand why buying a ground lease even i understand the risk-adjusted growth bbb's argument, but that's not how you're stock sort of trades and so i'm just trying to better understand why go after lower yielding even if they are more secure, longer term, how does that really drive your cash flow growth to which, would we get a higher multiple.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
no, i appreciate the question. we've obviously made a focus here and an emphasis on communicating and articulating the value proposition of the ground lease portfolio. first, we're not reaching for yield, in terms of chasing cap rates or in the ground lease portfolio generally the ground lease assets on individual basis at acquisition are in line with our acquisition cap rates. what we've done is pivot with our capabilities with our relationships with retailers and owners, developers, sellers is really a flight to quality and so we see tremendous upside. now, these aren't 99-year ground leases, ie., leasehold interest or something of the like in the safe hold where 99-year ground leases in your never getting the residual back. the alpek is a good example of that. i think it's -- there are 2 ways to go to in an environment where you see continued cap rate compression, it's continue to drive toward quality and finding symmetric and unique opportunities or you can go up the risk curve in terms of credit or term or single purpose buildings which you won't see us do, so i think the premise of that question we're not going to reach for yield in terms of ground lease, they're going to be effectively in the same range as our standard net leases.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
and then if you can just transition to the cfo side of the equation, obviously you and simon leopold sort of i guess broke up in mid-august. you only had come into the cfo role in 6 or 7 months, before that was a board member for a period of time before that and look over the years you've this will be cfo, i think, number 4 or 5 over the last decade. help us understand what's going on in that role. why isn't there more and i know you're going to -- i know every situation specific, but it is rare to see the turnover in a company that's growing as fast as yours and that has performed well and hasn't had the hiccups that you would normally see with a lot of executive turnover. so what is it about that role, that's not getting sticky within the company and how are you thinking about filling the role going forward and just take us through a little bit of what's happened.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, i appreciate the question. peter, can you plug your ears or leave the room please.
peter coughenour -- interim chief financial officer
just getting.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
well, look, i think the simon and joey did not break up that first of all, there was no personal animosity, there was no challenge interpersonally or strategic -- strategic challenge there in terms of the performance of the company on a go forward basis that was just a case of operating styles or operating models not sinking, it was obviously disappointing for us, we quickly pivoted and understood that we needed to -- we needed to separate and i think both parties it's better off for both parties there. so that's what i'll say about simon, we only wish him -- wish him the best continues to be a friend. in terms of the cfo, we've had, we've had a -- we will continue to execute on the search, we will do our diligence. peter is doing a tremendous job, you can plug your ears now. peter is doing a tremendous job here, executing on the preferred offering and now earnings. we're going to continue to do our diligence on this search. it's been a unique circumstances instead of events with these cfos, two left on their own volition, for other, for one for a personal reason and one for professional opportunity that didn't work out for them in another state, and so it's incumbent upon us to make the right choice for the seat for this company. most importantly, this is an operating seat and so it's, we're not out there pontificating or thinking strategically about things that aren't aligned with our operating strategy, everyone here in the 60-person company rolls up their sleeves and has to execute to a really a disciplined operating strategy. so that's most important and we've taken the last several months here -- a few months to really evaluate this seat, i've had a number of conversations with not only candidates but existing reit ceos, as well as under industries to think about how the cfo search here should -- should culminate in a permanent successor. i mean, david wolff, our chief accounting officer is sitting here, we have -- we have a fantastic chief accounting officer and david in accounting team that's really closing the books here and day to day accounting. and so now it's incumbent upon us to figure out what the right role and responsibilities for the cfo here at aga realty and a growing company.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
right. i guess is there any introspective that you have on yourself or the board because it is i know every situation has got their reasons or rationale. it has happened a little bit often, and so i'm just wondering if there is a reflection of maybe your own management style, or how you like to work with people, how the boards involved. i mean it is rare right you obviously knew simon well, he was a board member even for a short period of time. these things don't happen that often joey and i feel like it's come up, you have to explain things away a few too many times and so i'm just trying to understand if there is a larger thing going on that's not keeping the cfos, but in their seats.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
to succinctly answer to that question, the last part of the question is, no, there is no larger thing going on, this is not a personal dynamic with joey. this is part of being a broader leadership team at a growing and dynamic company, even comparing with the cfo seat today to 2 years ago or 3, 4, 5 years ago here required just so just what's different skill sets, 5.5 years ago we moved into the current building that we're in with 14, 15 employees, but we are at 60 team members here. and so i think is it to the first part of your question, yeah, 100%. there is an introspective look in the mirror and we would be, we'd be ignorant frankly not to look in the mirror and say what do we have to do differently, but also and what can we do better, but also what is, how has this rule change in context of the overall growth of this company, we're a $7 billion approaching $7 billion enterprise more likely than not soon to be $10 billion enterprise with the dynamic team here and so the introspective piece here is both looking backwards, but also looking forwards and again i would emphasize that this is the team that is committed to producing consistent results and also is committed to working both in and on the business. we aren't -- we aren't golfers here. we take this thing seriously, we operate it like it's a private company in the sense that we have an ownership mentality that's probably are most important core value.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
thanks for your time joey.

our next question comes from linda tsai with jefferies. please go ahead.
linda tsai -- jefferies group llc -- analyst
hi, good morning. looking at slide 16 of your ir deck sandbox offers runway for growth, and you showed the different retailer categories. where you're seeing the best opportunities from a risk adjusted basis as you continue to build the pipeline for 2022.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, linda. i think, i think it's across the full spectrum for us. so we saw the surge in grocery due to the kroger transaction and the wegman's transaction in q2. this quarter we see divergent again we have emphasize the amazon fresh in the portfolio, but it's really across the sectors that we're targeting. but most importantly across the sandbox of retailers. obviously, the ground lease opportunities spans the full spectrum, all the way from a casual dining opportunity like the alpek a highlighted to a walmart costco, lowe's, or home depot and so it's pretty fragmented, this quarter the c-store emphasis with the thornton's transaction as well as the ground leased to royal farms that we also acquired were very unique. but the most interesting part about this business is the pipeline changes every day. and again, i emphasize, there is no rhyme or reason for that change. it's what the origination team continues to dig up, so i'd tell you, it's extremely divergent.
linda tsai -- jefferies group llc -- analyst
got it. and then, just given the lift that retailers have seen across the board in 2021, has your underwriting changed at all to accommodate for this more positive environment. i know you mostly have material exposure to necessity based and [phonetic] ig retailers, but even these guys have done a little bit better than usual.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
no, i tell you, it hasn't changed our underwriting if anything it's emphasize that we have a firm belief that the stronger, the bigger getting bigger, the access to capital, their balance sheets, their ability to invest in price even in a supply constrained environment and compete as well as their ability to invest in an omnichannel future. so, but we've seen sales surge is pent up demand across categories, we've seen some idiosyncrasies in different sectors everyone got a bike or a shotgun or whatever they're buying an academy sports today, we've seen some unique changes there, but we think those are our cyclical and will normalize here hopefully sooner rather than later in terms of consumer behavior. so the environment continues to be what we expect the big, have the access to capital, they have the ability to invest in both 2 most important pieces of their business today competitive on price and an omnichannel future which obviously is paramount.
linda tsai -- jefferies group llc -- analyst
thanks. just one last one on the past couple of earnings calls, you've for verbalized here earnings growth expectations for the year. for 2022, should we expect the same type of communication.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
good question. but we're looking at all -- we're looking at all options including providing all the way from providing formal earnings guidance all the way to a similar strategy we've executed this year. i'll tell you, our expectation is a continued upper single digits earnings growth profile in terms of affo. we have the ability to do that with extremely strong balance sheet, investing in the best retailers in the country with superior real estate and that's what you're going to see us execute and do.
linda tsai -- jefferies group llc -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from tayo okusanya with credit suisse. please go ahead.
omotayo okusanya -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes, good morning everyone. joey. you guys are still pretty bullish on your acquisition outlook, a bunch of your peers put out '22 guidance this morning as well with very strong acquisition outlook, i guess what i'm curious about is number one, what's kind of really driving everyone to being so bullish and being able to kind of match or even the kind of what our record acquisition volumes this year, especially given the backdrop of everyone getting concerned about higher interest rates, higher inflation and things of that sort.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, good morning. i wouldn't want to answer for our peers. ours is opportunistic. it's 100 transactions approximately right at any given time moving through our pipeline average price point of 4 million to 5 million ranging from $1 million to $80 million. i wouldn't want to speak for our peers. i'll tell you across we have done -- you see favorable cost of capital. you see, generally speaking companies deploy them in terms of external growth and the next question is what is the quality of the underlying real estate, credit, residual that people are acquiring. and so i know what our strategy is specifically here it's starts with that omnichannel critical e-commerce resistant necessity based approach on a granular basis, open to larger opportunities that fit within the context of this portfolio and obviously are accretive, i can't speak for what other -- what other reits or other peers are acquiring, but i think given the favorable cost of capital you see them continuing to achieve spreads that they think makes sense and context of their overall portfolio.
omotayo okusanya -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, that's helpful and then just a quick second question. you guys have relatively low leverage at this point why did this isn't go down the pref route rather than just kind of issue straight up debt that would have not a lower interest rate.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
i'll turn that question over to peter. i'd tell you when we saw forward a quarter as peter mentioned in the prepared remarks and non-psa record at forward a quarter, it was extremely attractive now obviously that preferred equity is a hybrid security, we think perpetual paper at 4.25 with a call ability feature after 5 years was extremely attractive and again non psa record, but i'll turn that over to peter, he really executed on that.
peter coughenour -- interim chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, joey. tayo, i would just mention when historically look at the preferred market to joey's point, the pricing has and always made sense in the context of other capital sources, but this past summer we saw several reits print very low coupons, relative to what they've been able to achieve historically and thought it made sense for us to explore that market further and the market dynamics when we're taking a look seemed favorable. there was a lot of demand for high quality investment grade paper and given that anticipated pricing and strong demand, as well as the fact we really didn't have a need for a $300 million index eligible bond we thought that it made sense to issue our inaugural preferred offering and really open up another source of capital for the company as we continue to grow. in terms of the execution of that offering, the demand was stronger than we anticipated and we were able to upsize the deal from $100 million to $175 million and tighten pricing down to 4.25 as we mentioned with a really strong order book and strong institutional demand. so it was a great execution for the company.
omotayo okusanya -- credit suisse -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
operator
out our next question comes from wes golladay with baird. please go ahead.
wes golladay -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. i just want to stick with the preferred. when i look at the portfolio, it's very high quality and the company's balance sheet is very strong with low leverage and it is a risk on environment. so i wanted to see what your appetite is to get a little bit more leverage to the common via the preferred.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think the preferred all of inherently. if you look at net debt plus preferred ebitda inherently leverage was up an additional half a turn. now again, with no maturity and a call ability to perpetual paper our stated range of 4 to 5 times is exclusive of that preferred and that half turn that add to our current leverage profile. so it does provide for us to ""lever up"" obviously then we look at it both -- in both directions here, both as an equity substitute, as well as the ability to add incremental leverage without a maturity.
wes golladay -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
so what did i guess a half a turn would be where you'd be comfortable with as you grow the company.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
certainly, i mean it's, again our stated range of 4 to 5 times is exclusive of the preferred, but we're certainly comfortable at 5.5 times with the preferred, so inclusive of the preferred, so you can look at and i, we understand investors look at it both ways preferred as well as the rating agencies. we've had continued dialog with. as peter mentioned, the ability to to raise $175 million at 4.25 effectively rate on our weighted average cost of capital and then invested with 200 hundred basis point spreads in the perpetuity there, it's, we think that was extremely attractive for us.
wes golladay -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
got it. and then i guess when you talk to existing tenants. i guess what is your appetite for new projects. to go into the development and pcs project pipeline for next year.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
so it varies across the board, by tenant, and generally by sector. we see a lot of activity, obviously in the off-price space. we see a lot of activity in the auto and tire service space. and so it truly varies. at the same time, we see the home improvement retailers, most notably home depot and lowe's, not looking for net new stores but investing in their omnichannel distribution initiatives and so it varies across retailers, there are definitely retailers in a freestanding basis that are expanding throughout this country. our 3rd amazon fresh store obviously they're expanding into who read the news. and so it really varies by retailer and by sector today, you've guys that are contracting and guys that are growing aggressively.
wes golladay -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
got it. thanks for the time. thanks, wes.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the agree realty corporation's first quarter 2022 conference call. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to reuben treatman, director of corporate finance.
please go ahead, reuben.
reuben treatman -- director of corporate finance
thank you. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for agree realty's first quarter 2022 earnings call. before turning the call over to joey and peter to discuss the results for the quarter, let me first run through the cautionary language. please note that during this call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities law.
our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including uncertainty related to the scope, severity, and duration of the covid-19 pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and the containment measures on us and our tenants. please see yesterday's earnings release and our sec filings, including our latest annual report on form 10-k for discussion of various risks and uncertainties underlying our forward-looking statements. in addition, we discuss non-gaap financial measures, including core funds from operations or core ffo, adjusted funds from operations, or affo, and net debt to recurring ebitda. reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release, website, and sec filings.
i will now turn the call over to joey. 
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, reuben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. i am pleased to report that we're after a very strong start in 2022. the first quarter mark record development in partner capital solutions starts as well as our second highest quarter of acquisition volume in the company's history. while continue to execute across all three external growth platforms, we are very pleased that our fortress-like balance sheet and discipline portfolio construction received an upgrade from moody's to baa1.
during the first quarter, we invested approximately $430 million and 124 high-quality retail net lease properties across our three external growth platforms. 106 of these properties were originated through our acquisition platform, representing acquisition volume of just over $407 million. while investment volume was impressive, we maintained our discipline focused on best-in-class opportunities with our leading retail partners as demonstrated by more than 74% of first-quarter acquisitions being comprised of investment grade retailers. the 106 properties acquired during the first quarter at least 43 tenants operating a 20 distinct sectors including leading operators in farm and rural supply, dollar stores, home improvements, general merchandise, tire and auto service and auto parts.
we executed on several notable transactions during the quarter including the 55 property $180 million portfolio discussed on our last earnings call. the acquired portfolio has a weighted average lease term of nearly 10 years, derived approximately 90% of annualized base rent from a diversified set of investment-grade retailers. top tenants include tractor supply, cvs, dollar general, sherwin-williams, advanced auto parts and o'reilly auto parts. for the quarter the total properties acquired had a weighted average cap rate of 6% and had a weighted average lease term of 9.2 years.
excluding the 55 property portfolio the properties acquired during the quarter had a weighted average cap rate of 6.2%. during the first quarter, we also acquired six sunbelt rentals source in north carolina, new york, washington, florida, and michigan. several years ago, we identified sunbelt and their parent ashtead group as a compelling and alliance partner with the only investment-grade credit profile in their respective space. our decision to invest in sunbelt rentals was recently reinforced by the upgrade at bbb by fitch.
we continue to look for opportunities to build our relationship with sunbelt across all three of our external growth platforms. given our significant acquisition activity in the first quarter and robust pipeline, we are increasing our full year 2022 acquisition guidance to a range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, representing a 25% increase at the midpoint. while the midpoint of our increased acquisition guidance would represent record volume for our company, we have not and will not sacrifice quality or yield. we continue to believe that retailers dynamically evolving and we remain intent on investing in those retailers best positioned to succeed in an omnichannel and dynamic world.
moving on to our development and partner capital solutions platform. this quarter demonstrates the results of our efforts to provide comprehensive real estate solutions to our retail partners through our programmatic relationships, and as well as the modifications and additions we have made to our team to increase productivity. led by our chief operating officer, craig erlich, our development and construction team is working around the clock on a host of exciting projects. during the quarter, we commenced to record 15 new development and pcs projects including 13 geographically diverse gerber collision locations, a sunbelt rentals in st.
louis, missouri, as well as a burlington in turnersville, new jersey. we completed our first development was 7-eleven in saginaw, michigan during the quarter, while construction continued on two gerber collision projects in pooler, georgia and new port richey, florida. in total, we had 18 projects either completed or under construction during the first quarter, representing $53 million of committed capital. on last quarter's call i mentioned our expectation to commence between $50 million and $100 million through our development and pcs platforms this year, and we have now surpassed the low end of that range and our pipeline continues to ramp.
our value proposition remains unique and distinct. our three-pronged external growth strategy combined with our outstanding asset management platform continues to provide a full-service solution for the country's premier retailers. moving on to dispositions, we sold one property opportunistically for total gross proceeds of approximately 8 million during the quarter. the property was a recently acquired ground lease convenience store.
notably, we acquired the property during the third quarter of 2021 and received an unsolicited offer shortly thereafter. we sold the asset at just over a four cap approximately 200 basis points below the initial acquisition yield, resulting in a gain in over 2 million in just six months. while this was a one-off transaction, it demonstrates the embedded value in our ground lease portfolio and validates the compelling risk-adjusted returns that we have discussed on prior calls. during the quarter, we executed the new leases, extensions or options on approximately 358,000 square feet of gross leaseable area.
notable new leases, extensions, or options included at walmart in ohio, and at best buy in amarillo, texas. as there is result of our asset management team's efforts at quarter end, our 2022 lease maturities stood at just 0.4% of annualized base rents, representing a year-over-year decrease of approximately 80 basis points. at quarter end, our quickly growing retail portfolios surpassed 1,500 properties, a remarkable achievement in terms of our exponential growth in recent years and consisted of 1,510 properties across 47 states, including 186 ground leases, representing 13.5% of total annualized base rents. our investment grades exposure stood at nearly 68%, representing a two-year stacked increase of more than 800 basis points.
with that, i'll turn the call over to peter, and then we can open up for any questions.
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
thank you, joey. starting with earnings, core ffo for the first quarter was $0.97 per share, a 15.5% year-over-year increase. affo per share for the quarter was also $0.97, representing an increase of 16.4% year over year, which is the highest affo per share growth achieved in 10 years. as a reminder, treasury stock is included within our diluted share count prior to settlement, if and when adc stock trades above the deal price of our outstanding forward equity offers.
however, the aggregate dilutive impact related to these offerings was negligible in the first quarter. our consistently strong earnings growth continues to support an increasing and well-covered dividend. during the first quarter, we declared monthly cash dividends of $0.227 per share for each of january, february, and march. on an annualized basis, the monthly dividend represents a 9.7% increase over the annualized dividend from the first quarter of last year.
at 71%, our payout ratio for the first quarter was below the low end of our targeted range of 75% to 85% of affo per share. subsequent to quarter end, we declared an increased monthly cash dividend of $0.234 per common share for april. the monthly dividend reflects an annualized dividend amount of $2.81 per share or a 7.8% increase over the annualized dividend amount of $2.60 per share from the second quarter of last year. general and administrative expenses totaled $7.6 million in the first quarter.
g&a expense was 7.2% of total revenue, excluding the non-cash amortization of above and below market lease intangibles. while we continue to invest in people and systems, our anticipation is that g&a as a percentage of total revenue will continue to scale, decreasing between 20 basis points to 50 basis points as a percentage of total adjusted revenue compared to last year. additionally, we continue to anticipate total income tax expense to be in the range of $2.5 million to $3.5 million. moving on to our capital markets activities for the quarter, in march, as joey mentioned, moody's upgraded the company's issuer rating to baa1 from baa2 with a stable outlook.
the improved investment-grade credit rating is a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and reflects the thoughtful and disciplined manner in which we've grown the company since achieving our initial rating four years ago. the baa1 credit rating will further improve our long-term access to capital and enhance our ability to execute in the public bond markets. as mentioned on last quarter's call, we have $300 million of forward starting swaps in place, effectively fixing the base rate for contemplated long-term unsecured debt issuance at 1.7%. near the end of the quarter, we settled approximately 3.8 million shares of outstanding forward equity realizing net proceeds of $251 million.
at quarter end, we still had approximately 4.1 million shares remaining to be settled under the december 2021 forward offering, which is anticipated to raise net proceeds of $263 million upon settlement. inclusive of the anticipated net proceeds from our outstanding forward equity cash on hand and availability under our $1 billion credit facility, we had almost $970 million of liquidity at quarter end. as of march 31, our net debt to recurrent ebitda was approximately 4.3 times, pro forma for the settlement of $263 million of outstanding forward equity. excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurrent ebitda was approximately five times.
total debt to enterprise value at quarter end was approximately 26.5%, while fixed charge coverage, which includes principal amortization and the preferred dividend remains that a company record of 5.2 times. in summary, we continue to maintain a conservative and well-positioned balance sheet that affords us tremendous flexibility with pro forma net debt to ebitda of 4.3 times and roughly $970 million of liquidity to fund our robust investment pipeline. our significant liquidity more than $560 million of hedged capital and our robust pipeline continues to give us confidence in achieving high single-digit affo per share growth in 2022. combined with our nearly 10% affo per share growth last year, this implies two years staff growth in the high teens.
we do that per share growth to be very attractive, when combined with our best-in-class portfolio, our fortress-like balance sheet, and extremely well-covered dividend. with that, i'd like to turn the call back over to joey.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, peter. at this time, operator, let's open it up for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from josh dennerlein with bank of america. please go ahead.
josh dennerlein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so you had a pretty sizable portfolio acquisition during the quarter. just curious how that deal came about and maybe what the bidder pool like in the current environment?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yes. good morning, josh. i think we talked about it on the last call that transaction for the portfolio itself, we started to look at it 2019. at the time, the swap breakage fees for the seller, which is a private individual in the mid-atlantic, were too heavy for him to burden.
and so we were reapproached, i believe in december of last year, december of last year, and then within three days, had a transaction that was getting papered. and so there was no bidder pool that was fully off-market, a single individual owner with the aggregated the portfolio over several years.
josh dennerlein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and then -- so you had a record number of starts across your development and pcs programs. are there any terminals on how big your development pipeline can get?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
no. i think look, we've always said that we're going to deploy our development capabilities selectively in terms of dedicating our time, energy, and capital. we, of course, want those projects to hurdle, our internal rates to make sense. so we don't see any governor, we've made significant additions to the team, both on the development and construction side, as i mentioned, in the prepared remarks.
and so we're going to continue to ramp that pipeline opportunistically, we have several projects we anticipate announcing in q2. but we think there's -- we think there's ample opportunity right there given the disconnect between rates and returns for private developers for us to step in. then we're having a number of conversations with retailers on both programmatic and individual projects.

our next question comes from robert stevenson with janney. please go ahead.
robert stevenson -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
joey, just a follow-up on the last question. on the gerber stuff, was there anything in particular that sort of drove timing, i mean, of doing that? i mean, that was 13 of the 15 development pcs volumes at this point in time, or is this just part of their expansion plans etc.?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
generally, part of their expansion plans, we continue to look for opportunities with gerber across all three external platforms. gerber continues to grow both from a greenfield perspective and an m&a perspective, acquiring generally independent operators. these projects are i would tell you about half what we call, retrofits renovations or expansions and then half greenfield projects. so gerber continues to take market share in this country, and we see them as a pretty critical partner and industry that is very favorable.
robert stevenson -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
and then you guys sold the la fitness you acquired in the portfolio deal pretty quickly. how are you thinking about the other la fitness locations in the portfolio and the other gyms in the portfolio in general? are those near-term disposition candidates? was there something about this one that caused this one to be sold so quickly versus the others? how are you thinking about gyms and fitness going forward?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yes. just for clarity purposes, that was not part of -- the la fitness was not part of the $180 million portfolio that was part of a walmart and home depot portfolio that we acquired. we agreed to take the la fitness which was based in houston, but immediately looked at divested that even pre-close to divest of that at our cost basis. we're just simply not willing to take on incremental specifically la fitness exposure, but generally health and fitness exposure unless it's a really low-cost operator or a piece of real estate that we're really in love with.
so as you can see, we reported the la fitness at 331 to 1.5%. but they're truly down to 1.3% just immediately after or subsequent to quarter close. we still look at the gym sector over or the health and fitness sector, with general subscription. we have some impaired balance sheets.
obviously, we still have covid out there, but i think just the fragmentation of the space, the private equity in the space and just the sheered number of options available for consumers today, really make that space difficult to underwrite for us.
robert stevenson -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
ok. and then last one for me. peter, if you were doing a note issuance today, where have you gotten indications from your banks group that you could price 5 or 10-year debt versus where you would've been at the end of 2021?
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
yes, rob, first, as noted in the prepared remarks, we have $300 million of forward starting swaps in place today that have effectively fixed to base rate at 1.7%, what is a contemplated as a 10-year unsecured debt issuance. in terms of the spread on top of that base rate, it depends on when we access the market. obviously, the capital markets have been somewhat volatile to start the year, but the good news is we are in excellent position from a liquidity perspective and can be opportunistic in terms of when we access the market and issue additional unsecured debt.

our next question comes from nicholas joseph with citi. please go ahead.
nicholas joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks. with regards to the development pipeline, what are you seeing in terms of construction costs, and how does that ultimately allocate relative to the yield?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, nick. welcome back to net lease. construction costs continue to rise across the country. and so we are very cognizant of where those costs.
these are generally fixed return projects. i think most tenants are aware that construction costs, and also lead times things like hvac units, roofing material, both things are factoring into construction costs, but also efficiencies to deliver. i think and that's why we see a number of retailers looking to us with the liquidity, obviously being publicly traded and having the access to the revolving credit facility, to be able to provide certainty, truly of delivery at the end of the day. but construction costs continue to be a challenge for everybody here, we are very cognizant of those.
and like i said, most of the transactions that we enter into are open book, fixed return, and so that risk isn't going to be on us.
nicholas joseph -- citi -- analyst
ok. and then as you think about kind of pricing forward deals, do you expect to be able to continue to get the similar returns is what you've been experiencing? or ultimately, is there kind of a price point where maybe that yield has to come down a bit?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
on the development side specifically.
nicholas joseph -- citi -- analyst
on development?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we are very hesitant to go too far out the curve. we are really looking at shovel-ready projects, nothing that's taking too long from an entitlement perspective or permitting perspective. as we can see the 15 starts, we have this quarter.
we will have a few starts next quarter as well. in the case where we are going out longer with a longer entitlement period or permitting period, and again, it's going to be a fixed return, open cost structure, or we know what those costs are. but even in that instance, given the volatility we see out there, we are pretty hesitant to enter into those without a significant premium.

our next question comes from spenser allaway with green street advisors. please go ahead.
spenser allaway -- green street advisors -- analyst
thank you. can you just comment on the broader cap rate environment specifically as it relates to what you are seeing in terms of portfolio deals versus some one-off transactions?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yes. good morning, spencer. i think i always compare the net lease space to single-family residential. it's the longest lag time in terms of cap rate movement because of the fragmentation of ownership, but also the sheer number of intermediaries in the forms of brokers and agents that are out there trying to get or promising to get aggressive pricing for sellers.
i'll tell you, we're starting to see some cracks and specific instances of cap rates moving upwards. but i think it's really going to take that 90 to 150 days, which are typically, upon expiration of those listing agreements, which again brokers have promised sellers very aggressive pricing, and then set the tone for the overall market, but we're starting to see some cracks. in terms of portfolios versus one-off, it's really dependent upon the quality of the portfolio, and the type of portfolio. and we're not looking at anything that generally abs buyers or heavily levered buyers would have played in that pool historically.
those irrs have gone down significantly because of the availability of debt and obviously the coupon on debts available today. but i tell you, on both sides of the equation, we're hopefully we see more movement. it takes time. they haven't seen material movement across the board yet, but there are of course, opportunities where we've been able to push cap rates.
spenser allaway -- green street advisors -- analyst
and anything like thematic, in regards to the cap rate increases that you're seeing? or is that just kind of -- is it kind of very nuanced? and then perhaps maybe just some color on the general ground lease environment and more pricing is there?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yes. nothing thematic. it's really one-off sellers generally what we're dealing with average price points of 5 million absent the portfolio transactions we've mentioned. ground leases this quarter were light for us partly because of the large portfolio transactions, the 180 and then the other 80 million.
we've always said we're going to take advantage of ground lease opportunities that we see them. i think we acquired five during the quarter, we obviously disposed of the c-store ground lease, extremely aggressive cap rate for the $2 million that was off-market just an opportunistic inbound bid by a high net worth individual. there are a number of ground leases in our pipeline today. don't see any material change to the ground lease versus the turnkey structure, although there is obviously more focus on ground leases today given the focus on us as well as safe and some of the work that you guys and others have done.

our next question comes from wes golladay with baird. please go ahead.
wes golladay -- baird -- analyst
you have a lot of gerber collisions added to the portfolio or the developer pcs program this quarter. do you anticipate adding more retailers at a similar scale? and the program also appears to be building momentum throughout this year? can you comment about how big you think this program can get over the next few years? could we get 300 million, 400 million, 500 million? what is your ultimate vision here?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
with gerber specifically with?
wes golladay -- baird -- analyst
well, just more, so it's like you clearly have a programmatic program going with gerber collision, will there be more added to a similar scale and not the gerber program, but just the developer pcs program? how big can that get?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we're very pleased and how it scaled and ramped. as i mentioned, we've always held that capability. it's the core of this company that started as agreed development in 1971.
and up until the launch of the acquisition platform in 2010. i'll tell you we've had more and more inbounds from retailers to provide that certainty of execution. we have retailers that are growing in this country. they're facing the pricing pressures, the labor shortages that their historical developers cannot -- and in a rising interest rate environment and potentially rising cap rate environment, their historical developers can't perform and they can't deliver the stores that they're typically being public have produced or promise, i should say to wall street.
so we're having a number of conversations. i'll be frank. some of them aren't fit for us. they may be credit fits for us.
we may like the operator, but the price point is too small. it'd be akin to us launching a single-family home construction business across the country. we're not interested in doing that. but i'll tell you those conversations have significantly ramped up given the environment we're in today.
specifically to gerber, i think it's almost akin to what we did with sunbelt, and we discussed in the prepared remarks in terms of identifying early on a retailer that we thought was in a tremendous position to access a fragmented space and had the balance sheet capabilities to do so. so with gerber specifically owned by the boy group of canada publicly traded on the toronto stock exchange has over 700 stores, very low leverage at just over three times leverage at the conservative company at its core. as you're probably aware, there are the big three collision operators in this country, gerber, caliber, service king. service king, if you read media reports is entering into a potentially in out-of-court restructuring given to some of their financial constraints, and if not, could be heading into bankruptcy.
what's interesting about the collision business is it's really a tremendous business today. it used to be that you bumped something with your bumper, you had a little scratch or a little thing and maybe you got it fixed and maybe you didn't. now you got three sensors, two cameras, lidar, all of this high-tech equipment in there. and so frankly, the days of the local collision shop having the skilled labor and the capability for all of those high-tech repairs are pretty much gone.
the vehicles, the accident rate could we see going down generally across the board just because of some of those safety features as well. but the cost to repair these, what used to be minimal repairs is absorbent. and so the national vendors which have relationships and pricing power, with the auto insurers are really thriving. gerber works hand in hand with those insurance companies to direct customers to their collision centers, and as a preferred vendor for him.
and so we see very similar to the equipment rental business, we see caliber really taking the lead on collision. and so we're excited to continue to work with them across all three platforms.
wes golladay -- baird -- analyst
and then one for peter. can you talk about the swaps are -- those 10-year swaps, and for your 200 million of the potential issuance will double and risky, including the swaps? and then, just a follow-up to that, does that moody's upgrade at all help you from your current debt issuance?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
so first the $300 million of forward starting swaps contemplate a 10-year unsecured debt issuance. so they're hedging effectively a tenure issue, so we could apply them to an issuance with a different tenor. they have effectively fixed the base rate at 1.7%, as i mentioned, and they can be used at any time throughout 2022. so there's no near-term rush to use those swaps.
certainly, we think that the upgrade from moody's to baa1 will help improve pricing and also access to capital in the public markets. and in terms of ultimately where that price is. i think that's dependent on when we access the market. and we're in an excellent position today, as i mentioned in terms of liquidity and can be opportunistic in terms of when we go to public that markets.
operator
our next question comes from ronald kamdem with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. just can i touch on tenant health a little bit -- saw the occupancy was up sort of very little bankruptcies that we are hearing. maybe you just give us an update, how are the tenants feeling and what are you hearing about sort of inflationary pressures, or even talks of a recession that we have seen mentioned broadly?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ron. i think, look, we are in a very unique position. we have zero, i believe bankruptcies in the portfolio today, and this is a portfolio that is built for, with recession resistance in what we call, used to call e-commerce resistance, but omni-channel critical. and so the largest tenants in our portfolio are non-discretionary led by the walmarts and dollar general of the world, non-discretionary retailers that are providing core goods and services to customers.
they also have the greatest ability to absorb and compete on price and give inflationary pressures and have the greatest distribution logistics networks among those retailers in the world. and so today for a smaller midsize retailer, who is dealing with labor pressures and inflationary pressures and you name it right. logistical pressures, it is extremely challenging. if you are walmart, or if you're the home depot or tj maxx, you have global procurement network that can quickly pivot, and have the ability to absorb price.
we have always talked about, we want invest in retailers that have a few distinct characteristics. number one, they have the capital and the balance sheet to invest in omnichannel. we know how expensive micro and macro fulfillment can be. two, they have the ability to try and test out new forms of distribution and delivery to meet customers' needs.
and then three, they can compete on price because once you lose customers because of due to price today, in a price transparent world where any customer can see a price of anything on an iphone in about four seconds, they generally don't come back. and so we are heavily focused on those retailers, and even in the short term, if they have to impact margins, can retain customers and frankly grow their customer bases.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and just wanted to sort of go back to the acquisition questions, i think it's been asked a couple different ways. but, look, i think you talked about sort of cap rates, maybe having a little bit of a lag before repricing, which is all fair. but, just specifically, on either the private equity buyer or any other type of buyer, have you started to see any sort of deals being retraded, just signs of that sort of buyer pool taking a step back at all, or is it sort of too soon to see?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
ron, frankly, we don't have much exposure to the private equity heavily levered buyer pool. they are just not participants in the types of transactions and the types of opportunities that we are pursuing. we haven't seen on the disposition side, obviously, very negligible. we haven't seen -- i've heard rumblings of retrades.
obviously, irrs have gone from upper teens to lower teens, if that for a number of heavily levered purchasers. but our competitive set is generally the 1031 purchaser, the private individual. and so if they do retrade or if they do back out of a deal, we are generally the first call.

our next question comes from linda tosai with jefferies. please go ahead.
linda tosai -- jefferies -- analyst
the high single digit earnings growth, you hit that last year and you're on track to achieve it this year. what do you see as the key puts and takes in potentially sustaining this growth going forward?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
a number of one is our ability to source obviously accretive transactions across all three of our platforms, cost of capital, obviously moves into that cost of equity capital, as well as debt, predominantly equity capital, cap rates, where cap rates move, maintaining spreads. what's amazed me is the team's ability here to consistently and continuously find those opportunities across the country across all three platforms without sacrificing our investment criteria. again, this quarter 74% investment grade, that number, now its 68% investment grade. so we're not going up the risk curve, we're not, we haven't changed our tune.
and i think that's most important. and so the investments in the team, we've made the additions to the team, we've made -- the investments in technology that we've made specifically arc. those types of things continue, frankly, to surprise me to the upside. i never envisioned if you would have asked me several years ago that we'd be deploying at the midpoint of just that acquisitions $1.5 billion a year at 70-plus percent investment grade, and then putting another $50 million to $100 million in the ground, i would have told you, that's pretty crazy.
but what we're operating in is a massive space, which is 65% of u.s. retail gla, it's highly fragmented and the team just continues to do a tremendous job by uncovering those opportunities.
linda tosai -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. and then i know you said that the 4% was a bit aggressive for the unsolicited ground lease deal. what sort of cap rate would be reasonable to assign to the rest of your ground lease portfolio that's close to 14% of your adr?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
it's a great question. i'll tell you that that was not a dominant operator. it was not wawa. it was not the quick dripper sheets.
it was a smaller regional operator, i believe with a couple of 100 stores that unsolicited inbound four months from closing, but 200 basis points inside. i don't think i've ever flipped an asset that quickly in my career. but a $2 million gain was something that we just couldn't turn away. i think that is demonstrative of the overall value of the ground lease portfolio here.
i mean, this was a c-store. it was a smaller regional operator. it wasn't walmart or lowe's, or wegmans. i think it's demonstrative of the overall value of the ground lease portfolio.
so i'll leave that to others to decide but it was an interesting unsolicited offer someone who was familiar with the credit with the real estate. and then we were pleasantly surprised to be able to book that game.
operator
our next question comes from ki bin kim with truist. please go ahead.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
just wanted to tie together a few things that you mentioned about the prospects of potentially higher rates, you also increase your full-year acquisition guidance. and i know this isn't like a video game that you can start and stop and turn on and off the acquisition switch right, i mean, business and there's a momentum to it, and i get that. but as a ceo, how do you balance the prospects have higher rates and maybe better deals ahead versus pushing that throttle up a little bit and buying more today versus how do you balance that?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
it's a terrific question. if we didn't have our overall hedging policy in place, i think it would change the answer. and so having forward starting swaps at 1.7% as peter mentioned. having $260 million plus in forward equity already priced.
so let's call it nearly $300 million post settlement of some of the forward at before 331 gives us that medium-term visibility into a pipeline, and also into effectively outside of just spreads on the debit side locked in our cost of capital. and so if we were a spot issuer of capital and a spot purchaser was given plus or minus 70 days of acquisitions, every single decision becomes much harder. and that's why we have always been emphatic users and we have always said getting visibility into a medium-term cost of capital is critical to us. if you really think about it, what we're acquiring today was already financed, months ago, i mean, that's the bottom line.
and so we know what those spreads are today and that's a critical component of it. and i said, on the last call, in regards to leverage, it's much easier to lever up right then to de-lever. and so maintaining that balance sheet capacity heading in the intermediate view of your cost of capital in an external growth business makes that question, it removes a great preponderance of the answer to that question. that said, you always have to look out at opportunities and you have to try to project forward in that video game simulation you said of what's going to happen with cap rates.
and so we balance what we think is going to happen on a go forward basis with the opportunity at hand. but again, knowing that you have your cost of capital locked into the medium term makes that a much easier decision because of course there is no video game and there probably is. there's no right answer just a bunch of prognosticators including us.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
and going back to that client gerber collision questions and i think about the next generation of automobiles coming out. i'm not an automobile expert. i can barely drive one. but if you think about kind of ev, it's kind of ev revolution in autos.
i mean it's foreseeable to think about a bear case scenario where maybe the auto parts o'reilly, there's less use for going forward. and i'm sure this question is like five years too early, but any kind of early thoughts on that?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
well, there's definitely less parts right moving parts in evs in the typical combustion engine. the benefit to the collision shops such as gerber is that you can't jerry rigged ignored any longer these minor fender benders, let alone any larger collision. again, when you bump into the light pole in the parking lot by accident, when you're backing out of your parking space, it used to be a little ding on your bumper. now it's a camera on a sensor.
and so if you don't get that fixed, then your overall vehicle protection system doesn't work. and so the cost of repairs, i mean, it's almost an it job today, it's not a bump shot right? it's not a bump shop anymore. these are it professionals that almost have to be working on the cars. and so the days of the local grocery shop as i mentioned are gone.
you can't just bump things out or paintings or all the little fixes anymore because these cars are loaded with high-tech equipment that works on an integrated basis to provide for the overall safety of the driver. and so those repairs are much more nuanced and that's enduring to the collision operators benefits, who have the scale, who have the relationships with the retailers, and who can maintain that labor pool, which is also challenging obviously today, to be able to get those people, working at those collisions to fix those repairs. but it's a very different profession today and a very different business than it was just several years ago.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
but you don't see any kind of the longer-term risk to the auto parts retailers.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
well, auto parts retailers, they are very different from collision. the collision operators generally are working on the exterior of the cars right down to the struck. they are not working on generally on the combustion engine, that's a different operation there, that's the mechanics. the auto parts retailers continue to benefit from two different forms of customers, the do-it-yourself customer, which has been o'reilly's core business now working to continue to expand the backdoor customers or the commercial customers, and then o'reilly which their core businesses historically been more commercial oriented working to expand the do-it-yourself of customers or front door business as they call it.
now, we really don't see much in the way there. if you look at their same-store sales, if you look at the trajectories and their commentaries and their earnings call, those operators continue to gain market share through recessions, through pandemics. the average age of cars on the road continues to go up. you can't even find a car anymore, half of the time.
and so it's a benefit. now, look, there is no doubt the auto industry we are sitting here in the motor city is going to continue to change with evs especially, but those premier operators with the balance sheets and the store network and the distribution networks are going to continue to thrive here.

our next question comes from nate crossett with berenberg. please go ahead.
nate crossett -- berenberg -- analyst
good morning, guys. maybe some funding questions just on the swaps. when do those expire and when they do expire, if rates are, where they are today or higher, is the swap kind of, would you continue to, i guess, do swaps regardless of where rates are. and then also i just had a question on the preferred equity, you did that deal, i think last year.
is that funding options still on the table? or is that off the table given where rates have gone?
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
nate, this is peter. with respect to the swaps, we can use the forward-started swaps at any point in 2022. and technically there is an option available to us too, to roll the asset related to those swaps and to a swap and really extend that if we really wanted to. but we have plenty of optionality and flexibility in terms of when we use those swaps this year.
as it relates to the preferred equity, that's still an option for us. we are always evaluating, all forms of capital markets and what makes the most sense in the context of market conditions, pricing, and how we want to fund our business. it's today probably not something that we would look at given where pricing is, but certainly an option longer-term as we evaluate everything available to us.
nate crossett -- berenberg -- analyst
a question on the portfolio that you bought. is there any -- sorry if i missed it, but is there any pruning that needs to be done from that portfolio, or is essentially every property a property that you want to have?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
no. as you probably saw in the jump intending concentration, tractor supply was the largest operator in there, the largest concentration in there. sunbelt a couple of cvs is a few dollar generals. there's a fedex in there that will look to dispose of it.
we are not in the industrial or distribution business here. we think that will be a creative obviously the overall portfolio with a small fedex, i believe in north carolina, adjacent to the airport. and so we'll dispose of that asset. other than that, we're pretty comfortable with the entire portfolio.
again, it was 90% investment grade, 100% retail outside of that one fedex asset with 10 years weighted average lease term. we're very cognizant of the cvs is that we acquired in terms of that pharmacy exposure, we're very comfortable with the store performance there their long-duration cvs is they're not on any closure lists. this was a really unique opportunity. frankly, the only portfolio absent a ground lease portfolio from seven years ago, that truly fit qualitatively within our existing portfolio composition.
and that's why it was such a great fit, let alone the unique circumstances here. and so we'd love to be able to find more of them. the problem is most of them, don't have one assets, you got to dispose of them. 20% of it doesn't fit qualitative within the portfolio.
so that was i would tell you that you hit it on the head that was the real driver here is that there. there was one asset that's a disposition on the creative basis that we intend to execute on.
nate crossett -- berenberg -- analyst
is there any reason why it wasn't shopped around? i mean, now it's a testament to your relationships, but it would seem like portfolio this quality, the seller would want to kind of shopping around to see what pricing they could get?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
i'll give you a little background on the seller. the seller was historically the largest post office, private post office contractor in the country. in his mid-70s, he works out of a converted house into an office with four women that have been with him for over 20 years. he owns 1000s of acres of land in the beltway that he sold to polti and toll brothers.
he disposed of a number of assets years ago, and started acquiring net leased properties. his lawyer/friends/broker, we started the conversation with him to 2019. but, jim, our seller on this wanted to get something done, doesn't like to mess around and would have done a deal on a handshake. and so it was a very unique situation, a great guy with a great eye for real estate, whether it's agricultural land, whether it's net lease real estate.
but he is a unique guy, and he wanted to get something done with someone he could trust and someone he could get something done quickly.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from haendel st. juste with mizuho. please go ahead.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho securities -- analyst
joey, just one follow-up on the back of that portfolio question. i guess, just trying to seller psychology. it sounds like the gentleman that scenario was looking to perhaps monetize his real estate holdings. but i'm curious if you've seen a noticeable change in seller psychology from folks looking at the market looking at the rising rates and thinking well, maybe now might be a better time to sell, and so curious if that's resulting in more deals coming across your desk as a result as well?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
it's a good question, haendel. it's really tough. when you do -- when you work on so many transactions, 100 at any given time, it's hard for us to draw any broad strokes here. i think there are sellers out there given the volatility that will say i need to sell quick and then there are sellers out there or owners out there that say, i want to get past this volatility.
it's a bell curve. i think it ends up on both sides. what will be interesting to see as we progress through the year is, obviously what will happen with cap rates, but the seller psychology is going to drive that. and i've always said real estate owners have two primary emotions, greed, and fear.
and so we will see how much of that fear sets in and then that's when we always operate the best, whether it's a pandemic or recession. our balance sheet is always prepared. and we're always ready to pounce when we see an opportunity there. but it'll be interesting to see as this played out given just the extreme volatility we've seen, obviously, in recent weeks, i don't have a dredge for you.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho securities -- analyst
i just want to get some perspective from you. but did you know --
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
hang on. let me qualify one, one area where we do see weakness. merchant developers, who have developed projects and signed the leases, with tenants that now have zero to no margin and maybe even a loss because they did not anticipate the price appreciation in building components and labor and that inflationary pressure need to sell their existing product to try to get to their next project. and that's on the merchant developer side, not the passive owner or longer term owner.we're seeing more and more of that, where i'll give you the example the dollar general developer that was trying to hold out in the middle fives for their dollar general.
and they're developing a meta, let's call it a seven. and all of a sudden, they wrapped up the project. and they were pretty close to a return on costs at a seven net of a brokerage commission or whatever else. it's a breakeven deal and they promise 5 or 10 more projects to dollar general.
they have to recycle that capital, they can't hold out. and so we are seeing pressure there. that's led to a number of conversations with retailers, where they said, can you provide a more seamless solution for us that will actually give us some predictability in terms of, certainty in terms of delivery. so that is the one place we're seeing pressure, that pressure though is necessitated by the requirement to recycle that capital redeployed.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho securities -- analyst
is there anything that you perhaps would be willing to do with any scenarios maybe be a short-term or lender or something that to capitalize on that opportunity?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
we've never been a lender. i don't see that happening. i wouldn't rule it out. it's not something that's a core competency that we do.
the opportunities we've looked at in the discussions we've had with retailers is jumping in and taking over the entire programmatic relationship and/or pipeline. but again, we're not going to do that for million-dollar project strewn across the country, i.e., for a dollar store that does not make sense for us. we're just too busy to do that. but as you can see in opportunities like gerber collision in some of the work we've done with these repeat tenants, the certainty of execution here, there is a premium placed on that from retailers.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho securities -- analyst

joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
the answer is, yes, but that's about as far as i'll take it. i think the increase in guidance speaks for the robust pipeline itself it includes everything from $2 million transactions to larger transactions that we have been working on. so we anticipate, obviously, the pipeline is pretty large and that includes some larger opportunities as well.

this concludes our question and answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to joey agree for any closing remarks.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the agree realty second quarter 2022 conference call. [operator instructions]. i will now like to turn the conference over to reuben treatman, director of corporate finance. please go ahead, reuben.
reuben treatman -- director, corporate finance
thank you. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for agree realty's second quarter 2022 earnings call. before turning the call over to joey and peter to discuss our results for the quarter, let me first run through the cautionary language. please note that during this call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities law.
our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements for a number of reasons. please see yesterday's earnings release and our sec filings, including our latest annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of various risks and uncertainties underlying our forward-looking statements. in addition, we discuss non-gaap financial measures, including core funds from operations or core ffo, adjusted funds from operations, or affo, and net debt to recurring ebitda. reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release, website and sec filings.
i'll now turn the call over to joey. 
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, reuben. i'm very pleased to report that we continued our strong start to the year, deploying significant capital across all three external growth platforms, maintaining near full occupancy and further solidifying our balance sheet. while these results are readily apparent for investors to see what our most notable achievements was our continued progress on our adc state-of-the-art initiative. both our erp implementation and arc enhancements made material strides during the quarter and will drive significant efficiencies for our growing organization.
during the second quarter, we invested approximately $430 million in 121 properties across our three external growth platforms. 99 of these properties originated through our acquisition platform, representing acquisition volume of more than $420 million. the 99 properties acquired during the second quarter are leased to 34 tenants operating in 21 distinct sectors, including best-in-class operators in the dollar stores general merchandise, tire and auto service, home improvement, off-price, warehouse clubs, convenience store and auto parts sectors. the acquired properties had a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% and a weighted average lease term of 10 years.
our investment activities were supported by almost $525 million of equity raised during the quarter that fortified our best-in-class balance sheet and positioned us for continued growth. through the first half of the year, we've invested a record $860 million across 228 retail net lease properties spanning 40 states and 26 retail sectors. approximately, $828 million of our investment activities originated from the acquisition platform, nearly two-thirds of the annualized base rent acquired during the first six months of the year is derived from leading investment-grade retailers. these metrics demonstrate our continued focus on a broad spectrum of opportunities with leading omnichannel retailers through multiple growth avenues, ranging from one-off acquisitions, diversified portfolios, select sale leasebacks, development, and our pcs platform.
this diversified toolkit continues to ramp and produce superior risk-adjusted opportunities and long-term relationships with our retail partners. as of june 30, tire and auto service was our top sector, representing 9.4% of the portfolio. we continue to find compelling opportunities across this space and view the sector quite favorably. the average age of u.s.
cars on the road hit a record over 12 years. this combined with high-quality national operators and the low rent per square foot scored very highly in our model. given our record acquisition volume year-to-date in our robust pipeline, we are increasing our 2022 acquisition guidance to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion from the previous range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. the low end of this range would represent record acquisition volume for our company, surpassing the approximately $1.4 billion acquired last year.
given our improved cost of equity capital, we are able to invest in even greater spreads and provide additional cash flow accretion. our superior cost of capital, combined with our fortress balance sheet positions us to pursue many exciting opportunities while levered competitors have exited the market. we are seeing distress among owners and developers and are intent on leveraging our strong positioning. while once again raising our acquisition guidance, we are cognizant of the dynamic macroenvironment and will remain disciplined to our strategy.
moving on to our development and partner capital solutions platforms. our team continues to uncover compelling opportunities with a growing pipeline. cap rate expansion, inflationary pressures and rising construction interest rates have uniquely situated us to deliver projects timely and on budget. during the quarter, we commenced five development in pcs projects, including three additional gerber collisions as well as another sunbelt rentals.
we completed the development of the gerber in pooler, georgia, and construction continued on 16 additional projects. in total, we had a record 23 projects either completed or under construction during the first half of the year, representing $74 million of committed capital. on last quarter's call, i mentioned our expectation to commence between $50 million and $100 million through our development in pcs platforms this year. given our significant activity year-to-date in our growing pipeline, we've increased that range and now expect to commence between $75 million and $125 million this year.
moving on to dispositions. we sold four properties for total gross proceeds of almost $17 million during the quarter with a weighted average cap rate of approximately 7%. this activity includes the previously announced sale of the la fitness in houston, texas, which further reduced our health and fitness exposure. through the first six months of the year, we sold five properties for gross proceeds of nearly $25 million with a weighted average cap rate of approximately 6%.
on the leasing front, we executed new leases, extensions or options on approximately a 102,000 square feet of gross leasable area. notable new leases extensions or options included at best buy in el paso, texas; and chick-fil-a in rocky river, ohio; and a panera bread in nashville, new hampshire. as a result of our asset management team's efforts at quarter end, our 2022 lease maturities stood at just 0.1% of annualized base rents. our portfolio remains nearly fully occupied at 99.6%.
at quarter end, it encompassed over 1,600 properties across all 48 continental in the united states and included 193 ground leases representing 13% of total annualized base rents. our investment-grade exposure stood at nearly 68%, representing a two-year stack increase of 650 basis points. before handing the call over to peter to discuss our financial results, i want to commend peter and our entire esg steering committee for their efforts on our second annual esg report. the report includes enhanced disclosure to the incorporation of climate-related and investor-preferred frameworks.
we encourage you all to read our report, which you can access within the investors section of our website. with that, i'll hand the call over to peter, and then we can open it up for questions.
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
thank you, joey. starting with earnings, core ffo for the second quarter was $0.98 per share, representing a 9.7% year-over-year increase. affo per share for the second quarter increased 10.4% year over year to $0.97. as a reminder, treasury stock is included within our diluted share count prior to settlement, if and when abc stock trades above the deal price of our outstanding forward equity offerings.
the aggregate dilutive impact related to these offerings was close to $0.01 in the second quarter. in april, we increased our monthly cash dividend to $0.234 per share, representing a 3.1% month-over-month increase. we subsequently declared monthly cash dividend of $0.234 per share for each of may, june and july. the monthly dividend represents an annualized dividend amount of $2.81 per share and a 7.8% higher than the annualized dividend amount from the comparable periods in 2021.
our payout ratios for the second quarter were a conservative 72% of both core ffo per share and affo per share. our growing and well-covered dividend continues to be supported by our consistently strong earnings growth. general and administrative expenses totaled $7.7 million in the second quarter. g&a expense was 7.3% of total revenue or 6.8% excluding the noncash amortization of above and below market lease intangibles.
while we continue to make investments to support the growth of the company, our anticipation is that g&a as a percentage of total revenue will continue to scale, decreasing between 20 to 50 basis points as a percentage of total adjusted revenue compared to last year. our expectation for total income tax expense this year remains between $2.5 million and $3.5 million. our capital markets activities during the second quarter further fortified our balance sheet and positioned us for continued growth. during the quarter, we raised more than $0.5 billion of additional forward equity.
this included our may transaction of 5.8 million shares of common stock for anticipated net proceeds of approximately $388 million upon settlement. we also sold nearly 1.9 million shares during the second quarter via our forward atm program, raising anticipated net proceeds of approximately $127 million. in june, we settled approximately 4.7 million shares of outstanding forward equity, realizing net proceeds of $300 million. at quarter end, we still had nearly 7.1 million shares remaining to be settled under existing forward sale agreements, which are anticipated to raise net proceeds of approximately $476 million upon settlement.
additionally, in connection with the acquisition of the walmart and home depot portfolio, we assumed a mortgage loan with a principal balance of just over $42 million at a fixed interest rate of 3.63%. the loan is interest only and matures in december of 2029. our strategic capital markets transactions during the quarter provided us with more than $1.1 billion of liquidity at quarter end, including cash on hand, $630 million of availability on our revolver and approximately $476 million of outstanding forward equity. as mentioned on prior calls, we have $300 million of forward starting swaps in place, effectively fixing the base rate for contemplated long-term unsecured debt issuance at approximately 1.7%.
taken together with our outstanding forward equity, we have hedged the cost of more than $775 million of capital to fund this year's investment activity. as of june 30, our net debt to recurring ebitda was approximately 3.8 times pro forma for the settlement of $476 million of outstanding forward equity. excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring ebitda was approximately five times. total debt to enterprise value at quarter end was approximately 25%, while our fixed charge coverage ratio, which includes principal amortization and the preferred dividend remains at a very healthy level of or significant liquidity more than $775 million of hedged capital and a robust investment pipeline gives us continued confidence in achieving high single-digit to, building upon our nearly 10% affo per share growth in 2021.
this implies two-year staff growth in the high teens. combined with our leading retail portfolio, fortress-like balance sheet and well-covered dividend, we believe this level of per share growth is very compelling. with that, i'd like to turn the call back over to joey.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, peter. at this time, operator, we'll open it up for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question will come from ki bin kim with truist.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
good morning. so joe, you want to go back to the acquisition topic. you closed on a lot of deals at about a 6.2% cap rate, which is pretty close to where you've done over the past year. could you just talk about your outlook on the pricing dynamics and the types of assets that you're looking at?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think as we talked about on the last call, we're seeing a pretty wide dispersion among cap rates, and that cap rate trend obviously upward is more concentrated in the high-velocity merchant build product. so i'll tell you, dollar general, specifically, we've seen 75 basis points increase in cap rates. names like o'reilly, we've seen 35 to 45 increase in cap rates.
now, those are merchant builders who are after moving through and cycling through products fairly quickly. you get to the other end of the spectrum, there are still sticky cap rates and the less fluid product out there. so it's a pretty wide dispersion. i'll tell you we do see an upward trajectory in cap rates.
as we've talked about previously, it's a highly fragmented and large space. it will take time. how long we'll see. but we do see cap rates starting to adjust, again, with greater velocity in that merchant build type product.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
so what does that mean for a degree, meaning the 6.2%, should we expect that to decrease x amount over time?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
i can't tell you. i can't see anything today beyond the third quarter to be honest with you. i think it's going to be a function of the macro environment, one, it's going to be a function of how -- again, how quickly sellers adjust their expectations. we've moved from fear degree, but we still have 1031 buyers that are remnants of 1031 buyers in the market or sellers who are hopeful to obtain 2021 pricing.
i think the most important thing is today with our cost of capital, our spreads are as large as they've been all year long, even at these cap rates. so we'll take advantage of opportunities across all three platforms. every day, a new deal pops up. but at the same time, given our balance sheet, given our cost of capital and our liquidity profile, there's no reason for us to opt out of the market.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
and just last question. you talked about the disruption you might be seeing. i wasn't sure if that's in the ig space or more in the high-yield space. but given your comments about [inaudible] your comments, but the reality of your cost of capital and your balance sheet, does that make you want to perhaps enlarge your bull's-eye and take advantage of some assets like maybe you traditionally wouldn't have bought just the pricing has gotten that much more attractive? how do you think about all that?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
no. we're going to stick to our sandbox, and that's the 30 to 35 best retailers in the country. we are seeing disruption among merchant builders today. the pressures as i talked about in the prepared remarks that they're under today are tremendous inflationary pressures, construction interest loans are harder to obtain.
and if you do, obviously, the rates are much higher. there's obviously cap rate volatility upon the exit. and so i would anticipate our pcs platform to continue to uncover those types of opportunities because we can deliver. we don't need a typical construction financing.
we have a $1 billion revolver and obviously, plenty of access to capital. so no, we're going to stick to the top 30 or 35 retailers. i don't think it makes any sense to go up the risk curve today to achieve or obtain a few extra basis points.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
our next question will come from nick joseph with citi.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks. maybe just on that development in the pcs, as you look at kind of new leases being signed or deals being struck, are there any changes to the lease terms either from inflationary, cpi protection or anything else?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's a good question, nick. i would tell you, our sandbox of retailers have their traditional lease terms. what i'll tell you that they are now more amenable to higher growth rates, typically every five years and in the options.
and so while we were seeing potentially one bump or 5% bumps every five years, retailers today given the inflationary pressures are more amenable to seeing 10% bumps or multiple bumps during the base serve and then continuing on through the options.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
and then you touched on, i think, in your opening remarks some internal initiatives. can you just walk through those a little more and kind of the benefits of the organization going forward as you make those investments?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll touch on it briefly. peter can speak to it much more technically than i can. we went live with our erp overhaul with mri with the first phase of it.
just recently, that was a, i'd tell you, a multiyear effort to convert from timberline to mri. peter, i'll let you speak to the specifics of it.
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
yes. just to speak on the erp system in more detail, as joey alluded to, our team has been very busy in the first half of the year, implementing a new mri software for accounting and financial reporting. we're live with that software and already seeing efficiencies, including using their contract intelligence tool, which leverages ai to abstract new leases or lease documents. we'll continue to make enhancements to that software throughout the year and look forward to realizing additional efficiencies from that software.
and then the other initiative that joey mentioned is arc, which we've talked about on prior calls, arc is a proprietary technology platform that we have developed over the past couple of years in-house, which provides us with real-time access to portfolio and pipeline data from multiple data sources across the organization, including our new erp system. and it allows us to underwrite a value real estate while also understanding the pro forma impact on portfolio concentrations and other key metrics and includes modules for departments throughout the organization. it also includes critical lease information and a work order management system for our asset management team. and i stated in the prepared remarks, nick, we had a three-year thrust to become state-of-the-art.
everything that we've done, whether it's the mri implementation, arc moving to triple net with our internal internet this year or intranet this year, along with a number of other initiatives, including hires has positioned us now to succeed on that three-year thrust.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thank you. that's very helpful. 
operator
our next question will come from brad heffern with rbc capital markets.
brad heffern -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you. can you talk about ground lease. it slowed down quite a bit from the roughly 30% of acquisitions that it was running at. is that the market more properly reflecting the value of those assets or is it opportunity set related?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
it's a great question, but i think it's a little bit of both. i think ground lease, first of all, our ground waste activity will pick up in the third quarter as we anticipate. i think if the market has become more cognitive, frankly, we took advantage of a dislocation in pricing for, call it, 18 months in that ground maybe two years in that ground lease space. there's been more attention brought to the ground lease space.
obviously, peers like safe, not really a peer, but a company like safe, the initiation by a number of sell side and within the space. that's what we still continue to uncover high-quality opportunities. this quarter, we bought a lowe's in delaware on the ground lease, so wawa and the cbs, the discount tire all on ground leases. and so we continue to be interested obviously in the space.
but like everything in net lease, it is fragmented and you will see opportunities arise at very disparate times. but i think there has been more, obviously, lightshow on the ground lease space in general as opposed to just be really conflated with the triple net space.
brad heffern -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. got it. and then i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the transaction team, how many people you have at this point? and obviously, your scale for the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, but what do you think your scale for in addition to that at this point?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
we've done a tremendous job building out what we call two teams really of the acquisition team, which has 10 team members in it today. and then the transaction team, which is really overseeing contract purchase agreement negotiation and diligence through close with another 10 team members led by four lawyers in four different subgroups. and so we have built out and scale the organization. we are continuing to focus on developing young talent here.
that's most important in terms of the acquisition origination realm. we wanted to bring them up in the agriculture in the agri way and so we think we are appropriately scaled there to continue to grow.
brad heffern -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
our next question will come from rob stevenson with janney.
rob stevenson -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
good morning, guys. how are you thinking about dispositions today? i mean there still doesn't appear to be a market for well-leased tier assets. but does the market get better from here for selling the stuff in the portfolio that you may not want to own two, three years from now?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
to be frank with you, rob, there isn't much of that left outside of those few theater assets that you mentioned. there really isn't much of that left. the portfolio here today, our watch list is extremely de minimis, if at all. and so we are very comfortable with where the portfolio sits today.
we will look at opportunistic dispositions where there's just a pricing or valuation disparity. but the portfolio has never been in better shape, right? we have all the exposures where we wanted by sector and by tenant and/or just a specific piece of real estate really where we want them today. so again, outside of those few theaters in the portfolio, we're sitting in a really good spot in terms of portfolio quality and concentration there.
rob stevenson -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
ok. and then most of the assets that you guys acquired bought with someone else's existing lease structure in place, but you guys have ramped the development in pcs stuff, you've done some more sale leasebacks. so in those cases, you're obviously starting with a blank page. anything that you guys are structuring differently in terms of length of lease, annual bumps, cpi indexing, etc., these days when you can start with a blank page rather than take on somebody else's lease?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
well, first, thanks for pointing that out because that is obviously a very different dynamic. yes, i think, again, going back to the earlier question, we were able to get -- we're able to obtain better growth rates on an overall basis. i think retailers are more amenable understanding the inflationary pressures not only in their business, but the overall macro environment. so i think that's a great dichotomy that you kind of -- that you broke out there because that is true.
in those select sale leasebacks and the development in the development area specifically, we're able to start from a blank slate.
rob stevenson -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
ok. thanks, guys. appreciate the time.
operator
our next question will come from haendel st. juste with mizuho.
unknown speaker
hi. good morning. this is robbie on the line for haendel. i hope you guys are doing well.
can you comment a bit on the auto entire industry given that it is your largest sector, particularly how you think this industry plays out going forward where work-from-home seems to be persistent?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
i think we spoke about in the prepared remarks. the average age of cars on the road in the u.s. is over 12 years. it's a record.
to get a car today is an extremely difficult proposition. obviously, cargo just passed is on the president's desk, a bill to increase chip production in this country. so i think if you -- the work-from-home trends, will see where those go. but i think if you actually look at the miles driven, if you look at the travel trends that are out there, if you look at the link, cars today frankly are made to be run for 200,000 miles.
that is very different than automobile construction in the past. the tire and auto service industry and the auto parts industry continue to thrive, frankly, because of the duration of those cars on the road. cars are more expensive today, whether it's new and/or used cars although we've seen some de-escalation in the pricing in used cars. and so it's a great space.
it has some of the great best retailers in the country. they are low rents per square foot. they typically are in small fungible boxes between 4,000 and 6,000 square feet on major thoroughfares with retail synergy. and i think if you look at the overall dynamics of the space, all macro trends, especially if you believe we're heading into a recession here point in the favor of the auto parts and tire service industries.
unknown speaker
thank you. just one more here. can you disclose what the cap rate and the investment-grade exposure would have been for the second quarter acquisitions outside of the large auto portfolio?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
i can. we're under a pretty strict nda in regards to any transaction. obviously, we have a new tenant in our roster, but we're very comfortable. it's one of the largest, obviously, retailers, especially in their sectors in the world.
it's over a 100-year-old company. we've always said that investment grade isn't a driver of our decisions in terms of investment. it's real estate related. it is tenant, it is sector related.
it's obviously rent per square foot and getting our arms around the residual as well as the store level performance. and we thought a transaction here this transaction, you're referring to make a lot of sense for us. so on a holistic basis, i would anticipate that our investment-grade exposure in terms of acquisitions for next quarter to be north of 70%, closer to 75%, in line with traditional, really our traditional metrics, especially the last couple of years.
unknown speaker
got it. thank you. just one more here, if i can. can you discuss your balance sheet strategy and what your target leverage is.
currently, it's 3.8% with the forward equity. what are you willing to let this tick up to?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
well, we've always stated that our targeted leverage range is four to five times net debt to recurring ebitda. we brought it down during the pandemic. we hadn't brought it back up to five to six times. i think if you look today at our capital structure, the cost of debt and cost of equity, there's an argument, obviously, to be made that the equity is cheaper than debt today outside of our $300 million swapped out at a tenure of 1.7%.
and so our balance sheet strategy is to remain flexible, they remain nimble and it's to remain positioned to execute on any opportunity that arises.
operator
our next question will come from wes golladay with baird. you may now go ahead.
wes golladay -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. first one was related to that last point you just made with the cost of equity extremely attractive and maybe that was attractive, still very good, but less attractive to maybe where you could issue later down the road if spreads were to come in. so my question for you would be, what is your appetite after you just continue to fund everything with equity over the near term and the relever when spreads fall?
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
well, thanks for the question, this is peter. i would say first, to just provide a little bit more detail here. look, that said, we're in a fantastic position from a liquidity perspective and we have a lot of options as it relates to the swaps. and so as joey said, we'll continue to be nimble and opportunistic in terms of how and when we access the capital markets.
wes golladay -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok. and then maybe going to the arc platform. it's been, i think you launched it in may of last year. is there a way to quantify how this is helping drive acquisition volume? is it more deal flow coming in? is it a higher close rate? just any way to put numbers behind it?
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
well, first, arc is not relegated simply to originations. arc has lease administration, asset management, portfolio metrics, acquisitions, transactions, diligence, all embedded into it. so that's the portfolio level data and statistics all embedded into it. i think what most importantly there, there is no way to quantify it directly.
what is most important there is it is a management tool, it's a self-management tool, it allows us to drive to kpis, it allows us to drive to conversion rates and make adjustments on the fly in real time. and so i'd tell you, we haven't spent a lot of time yet quantifying the impact of arc. it would be difficult to do. i'm sure peter or reuben here can come up with some algorithm to do so.
but we really look at it as a tool of transparency and a tool to measure our progress and manage our progress as we move forward toward our goals and objectives.
wes golladay -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
thanks, guys.
operator
our next question will come from ronald kamdem with morgan stanley. you may now go ahead.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. two quick ones for me. just first on -- just going back to the retail commentary. obviously, you mentioned that the tenant health has never been stronger with almost watch list and so forth.
but as you're looking forward, and obviously, there's more talks of going into a recession and so forth. how are you guys thinking about either sectors that you maybe pause on or get more cautious on or sectors that you lean into over the next sort of 12 to 18 months?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
brian, i appreciate the question. it's really the same for us. we haven't changed since covid from a sector perspective or really even a tenant perspective. we generally avoid discretionary goods outside of superior, high-quality operators.
the portfolio was constructed with the 30,000-foot lens of recession resistant to begin with. and so we've been anticipating a recession that -- i would tell you not to the day or the month of the year, but over the long-term, just because of the cyclical nature of the economy. and so we don't venture into experiential, we don't venture into high luxury, high-end luxury goods or discretionary goods unless there is an investment thesis there that overrides that 30,000-foot perspective. does that make sense?
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. sure, it does. the second question i had, and it's just as we're sort of putting together the breadcrumbs for 2023 and you're thinking, we're not asking for guidance obviously, but if we're running sort of a similar acquisition pace of this year, similar sort of credit losses this year? it sounds like interest costs maybe potentially could be slightly up, but you sort of locked in rates and so forth. but is there any other sort of big pieces or is that sort of the right way to think about it?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
i think in a static environment, that's probably the right way to think about it. i think everybody across the board, the cost of short-term debt, obviously, with the increase in libor and transition to sofr is obviously impactful. as peter mentioned, as you mentioned, the swaps that we have in place put us advantage for long-term debt. our cost of equity puts us in advantage in terms of our capital structure as well.
i think, generally speaking, coming off the highs of 2021 when i saw -- i just don't think a static environment is most likely to continue into 2023. we were at such pricing, i'll call it, just in sanity in 2021 with dollar general trading in the low 5s and o'reilly is trading at five caps. those are two tenants we've called out. i think we're going to continue to see pressures from a labor perspective, pressures from an inflationary perspective.
they may mitigate somewhat, but we're going to continue to see pressures that are continue to show us opportunities to take advantage of dislocations in the market. when you're -- when you have our capabilities across our three platforms combined with our balance sheet and our cost of capital, retailers can look at us and know we're going to get a job done. to look at other players in the space, not specifically the reit space, but in the net lease space and have that level of confidence that they're going to get it done at the end of the day is pretty difficult given the changes we've seen. and that's not assuming we enter into some type of deep recession here, that's assuming that there's a soft landing here engineered by the fed.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
super helpful. thanks.

spenser allaway -- green street advisors -- analyst
thank you. most of my questions have been asked but maybe just another one in regards to the increased development pcs guidance. i understand you don't need any construction financing. but can you just comment on your confidence in executing newer developments, just given labor shortages, as you just mentioned, there's some permitting backlogs, etc., that have been caused for development delays in many other sectors.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's -- look, we have spent capital in terms of building out our construction team. we're not entering in the speculative project. so we're not closing on a piece of dirt until all contingencies have been waived.
we have bids in hand from a general contractor on a guaranteed maximum price basis, and we're ready to go. these are single tenant projects, as you know, spenser, they're not multidimensional with multiple moving pieces. this is a triangulation of getting the entitlements in place and getting the tenant onboard waiving contingencies and so once we have that in place, we're all systems go. most of the projects that we're even undertaking today, frankly, are open book fixed return on cost.
and so retailers understand the cost of metal buildings have doubled every week, you hear about the next log jam or the next inflationary pressure and some building component of material. retailers understand that today and so we go into these eyes wide open and our retail partners go into wide open, but we certainly aren't going to go risk on in terms of development here.
spenser allaway -- green street advisors -- analyst
ok. that's really helpful color. that's all for me. thank you.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, spenser.

our next question will come from linda tsai with jefferies.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. in terms of the comments on the pressure on the merchant builders resulting in cap rate expansion for dollar generals and o'reilly, it sounds like you might be investing more in these names. are there any other names you would highlight?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
good question, linda. i think those are the two that come to mind that we've seen material cap rate movement, dollar tree is another one. obviously, any of those tenants that are growing organically through a merchant build program with private developers at high velocity. the bottom line is those developers need to recycle that capital and either try to get new projects in their ground or just get in the ground for their test of tenants that they're working with or get their capital out of the ground for some other reasons.
so i'm trying to think off the top of my head for the most high-growth names. tractor supply comes to mind, not as growing as quickly 60 to 70 units per year. but the greatest discrepancy or the grade is material change we've seen is the dollar stores that are growing to the tune of 1,700 stores per year. those developers just need to cycle capital.
we've had discussions directly with those tenants. they're obviously strong retail partners and our interest in development. it's not something that we're interested in doing necessarily. it's just too widespread too small of price points for us, but there are challenges there.
if you are a net grower today at any significant velocity as a retailer, it is a challenging environment to rely on private developers today.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.

our next question will come from joshua dennerlein with bank of america. you may now go ahead.
joshua dennerlein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. thanks for the question, guys. so just kind of curious on the big picture. one thing i've kind of noticed this earnings period outside of net lease is that the transaction market seems to have slowed down or even paused.
what kind of gives you comfort that the net lease market will remain robust through year end?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
well, jos, i'm not sure about the net lease market specifically remaining robust through year-end. and i think that the private purchasers will slow based upon the availability of leverage, i mean, you're looking at negative leverage in most of these situations and lower ltvs. i'm confident in our ability because our cost of capital is now driving the biggest spreads that we've had all year 1. and so what you're going to see us do is take advantage of the best retailers of the best real estate.
-- at greater spreads. and that's what we're going to do through q3 and q4. and so i won't speak to others cost of capital but just given our positioning from a balance sheet and cost of capital perspective, we're going to take advantage of those opportunities. this company has been built to take advantage of dislocations, whether we launched the acquisition platform in the great recession, while we've doubled the size of the company throughout the pandemic.
we are positioned always to take advantage of dislocations in the market, whether that's just purchasers being on the sideline, macroeconomic turbulence, lack of debt, we feel pretty good with our swaps in place today. we've been wrong on the other side historically. but part of our overall hedging policy inclusive of forward equity and forward starting swaps on the debt side is to position ourselves for disruption in a downturn. and so we will be ready, we will take advantage of opportunities that are both big and small.
joshua dennerlein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thanks for that.

thanks, josh.

our next question will come from r.j. milligan with raymond james.
r.j. milligan -- raymond james -- analyst
yeah. hey. good morning, guys. joey, just a bigger picture question.
you guys are trading at now the highest multiple in the space. there's a varying discount between you and some of your peers, which you could argue is a dislocation. i'm just curious with your market cap significantly higher or larger. are there any other public portfolios agri would be interested in and how seriously do you guys think about public-to-public m&a?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
i think we look at all opportunities, everything from one million side to a few billion. we look at evaluated all opportunities that are out there, public-to-public m&a is fairly rare, obviously and read them. i think we're going to see potentially more m&a as we move through this economic cycle. i think efficiency from a g&a perspective is critical.
i think obviously, access and cost of capital is critical. i think everyone is going to be focused at the end of the day on margins. it's not something we spend a lot of time on here. our threshold has always been, we're not going to qualitatively dilute the portfolio that we've constructed over the past, call it, 12 years so methodically and meticulously.
and then if anything surpasses that qualitative threshold then we move to the quantitative. does it make sense at the pricing at that given time.

this concludes our question and answer session. i would like to turn it over to joey agree for any closing remarks.

operator
good morning, and welcome to agree realty third quarter 2022 conference call. [operator instructions] i will now turn it over to reuben treatman, director of corporate finance. please go ahead, reuben.
reuben treatman -- director, corporate finance
thank you. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us for agree realty's third quarter 2022 earnings call. before turning the call over to joey and peter to discuss our results for the quarter, let me first run through the cautionary language.
please note that during this call, we'll make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities law. our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements for a number of reasons. please see yesterday's earnings release and our sec filings, including our latest annual report on form 10-k, for a discussion of various risks and uncertainties underlying our forward-looking statements. in addition, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, including core funds from operations or core ffo, adjusted funds from operations or affo, and net debt to recurring ebitda.
reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release, website, and sec filings. i'll now turn the call over to joey. 
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, reuben. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. before running to our standard update, i'd like to take a step back to provide some observations on the current state of the market, as well as the steps we've taken to further strengthen our positioning in a challenging macro environment. our recent capital markets transactions have bolstered our balance sheet with attractively priced capital.
at quarter end, our fortress balance sheet stood at approximately 3.1 times pro forma net debt to ebitda, providing tremendous flexibility and enabling us to opportunistically execute as buyers and sellers continue to adjust to the market. cap rates are creeping higher, most significantly in the merchant builder space, and provided us opportunities to take advantage of distressed situations. we have seen the levered buyer in a number of institutionally capitalized investors exit the market altogether or move significantly up the risk curve to drive incremental yield. as the bid ask spread continues to narrow and more sellers capitulate, our focus will remain on the strongest retailer in the country, with the balance sheet to execute their omnichannel strategy in a challenging retail environment.
we will not go up the risk curve in terms of tenant credit profile, single purpose assets, or private equity-sponsored sale leasebacks. our working assumption is that attractively priced long-term debt does not return to the market for the foreseeable future. hence, we are focused on unlevered returns on equity. we are very fortunate to have the balance sheet and cost of capital to still drive incremental spreads without leverage.
our focus continues to remain on per share affo growth while preserving the dry powder to execute on distress. i remind all investors that our company has thrived in times of economic uncertainty. we launched our acquisition platform after the great financial crisis and nearly doubled the size of our company during covid. candidly, i think the market has been ready for a reset for a while now, and i am confident that our team is ready to once again seize on the opportunities that will be forthcoming.
moving on to the third quarter activities, we selectively invested approximately $372 million in 121 properties across our three external growth platforms. ninety-eight of these properties originated through our acquisition platform, representing volume of more than $360 million. the properties acquired during the quarter were leased to 39 tenants, including best-in-class operators of dollar stores, auto parts, farm and rural supply, grocery, home improvement, consumer electronics in the off-price sectors. the acquired properties had a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% and year-to-date record-weighted average lease term of 11.1 years.
nearly 73% of the acquired properties will be used to invest in grid operators. during -- throughout the first nine months of the year, we've invested a record $1.2 billion in 328 retail net lease properties spanning 42 states. over two-thirds of the annualized base rent acquired is derived from leading investment-grade retailers. these metrics demonstrate our continued focus on leveraging all three external growth platforms to execute on opportunities with best-in-class operators.
given the increased visibility into our high-quality pipeline, we are increasing the bottom end of our acquisition guidance to $1.6 billion while maintaining the high end of our guidance at 1.7 billion. that said, we remain prudent and disciplined in how we deploy capital. our investment activities were supported by almost $815 million of equity and debt raised during the quarter that fortified our balance sheet. at 9/30, we had over 630 million of forward equity in cash on the balance sheet with no outstanding balance and a revolving credit facility.
moving on to our development in partner capital solutions platforms, our team continues to uncover compelling opportunities helping to build the company's largest ever development pipeline. our platform is uniquely situated to provide struggling merchant developers with the ability to lock in funding while providing us with additional opportunities to drive superior risk-adjusted returns. we continue to have dialogue with many of our retail partners to find solutions that fit their store growth strategies. during the quarter, we commenced two new developments in pcs projects, including one gerber collision located in murrieta, california, as well as the sunbelt rentals in wentzville, missouri.
we also completed the development of two gerber collision locations, as well as in burlington. construction continued in 18 additional projects. in total, we had a record 25 projects either completed or under construction during the first nine months of the year, representing approximately $82 million of committed capital. moving on to dispositions, we sold our gardner-white furniture store in canton, michigan for approximately $20 million during the quarter.
as noted on previous calls, this was the art van flagship we developed prior to the company's acquisition by t.h. lee, which was subsequently released to love's furniture, and then, most recently, to gardner-white. during that time we owned the asset, we were able to release this property twice, recapturing effectively 100% of rent without tenant improvement dollars. so, now three tenants in a pandemic later, we are ultimately selling the asset in an irr of approximately 10%, which demonstrates our bottoms-up approach to real estate underwriting.
through september 30th, we sold six properties for gross proceeds of nearly $45 million with a weighted average cap rate of 6.5%. given our year-to-date activity, we are increasing the lower end of our disposition guidance range to $45 million while maintaining the upper end of our range at 75 million. on the leasing front, we execute a new leases extensions or options at approximately 192,000 square feet of gross leasable area. notably, new leases extensions are options included in dick's sporting goods in saint joseph, missouri, and the big lots in cedar park, texas.
at quarter end, our 2022 lease maturity stood at just 0.2% of annualized base rents. we're also in terrific position for the upcoming year, with only 1.5% of our portfolio wide leases maturing. at quarter end, our portfolio encompassed over 1,700 retail properties across all 48 continental united states, including 201 ground leases, representing 12.7% of total annualized base rents. occupancy ticked up during the quarter to 99.7%, while investment-grade exposure stood at nearly 68%, representing a two-year stack increase of 530 basis points.
our portfolio is the best in the country and undoubtedly positioned to withstand any economic headwinds. with that, i'll hand the call over to peter, and then we can open it up for questions.
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
thank you, joey. starting with the balance sheet, as joey mentioned, we had another very active quarter in the capital markets, raising or settling almost $1.3 billion of capital. at quarter end, we had no floating rate exposure and approximately $252 million of cash on hand. in conjunction with no material debt maturities until 2028, we are well-positioned to withstand interest rate headwinds and volatility in the capital markets.
in august, we completed a $300 million public bond offering comprised of 4.8% senior unsecured notes due in 2032. in connection with the offering, we've terminated related swap agreements of $300 million, receiving approximately $28 million upon termination. considering the effect of the terminated swap agreements, the effective all-in rate for the 2032 notes is 3.76%. the offering further staggered our maturities and extended our weighted average debt maturity to approximately eight years.
during the quarter, we raised more than $500 million of additional forward equity. we sold nearly 1.7 million shares during the quarter via our atm program, raising net proceeds of approximately $127 million. and in september, we completed a 5.8 million share forward offering for anticipated net proceeds of approximately $382 million upon settlement. in conjunction with the september forward equity offering, we settled all 8.7 million shares of outstanding forward equity, realizing net proceeds of approximately $601 million.
at quarter end, we still had 5.8 million shares anticipated to be settled from the september forward offering, representing anticipated net proceeds of approximately $382 million. our capital markets transactions provided us with more than $1.6 billion of liquidity at quarter end, including cash on hand, full availability on our $1 billion revolving credit facility, and our aforementioned outstanding forward equity. as of september 30th, pro forma for the settlement of the 382 million of outstanding forward equity, our net debt to recurrent ebitda was approximately 3.1 times. excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring ebitda was approximately four times.
total debt to enterprise value at quarter end stood at 24%, while our fixed charge coverage ratio, which includes principal amortization and the preferred dividend, remained at a very healthy level of five times. moving to earnings, core ffo and affo for the quarter were $0.97 and $0.96 per share, representing 5.6% and 7.8% year-over-year increases, respectively. as i mentioned on prior calls, we continue to anticipate high single-digit affo per share growth in 2022, implying two-year stack growth in the high teens. as a reminder, treasury stock is included within our diluted share count prior to settlement.
if and when adc stock trades above the deal price of our outstanding forward equity offerings. the aggregate dilutive impact related to these offerings was $0.01 in the third quarter. during the third quarter, we declared monthly cash dividends of $0.234 per common share for july, august, and september. on an annualized basis, the monthly dividends represent a 7.8% increase over the annualized dividend from the third quarter of last year.
while meaningfully increasing the common dividend over the past year, we maintained conservative payout ratios for the third quarter of 73% of core ffo per share and affo per share, respectively. subsequent to quarter end, we again increased our monthly cash dividend by 2.6% to $0.24 per share for october. the monthly dividend reflects an annualized dividend amount of $2.88 per share, or a 5.7% increase, over the annualized dividend amount of $2.72 per share from the fourth quarter of 2021. general and administrative expenses totaled $7 million in the third quarter.
g&a expense was 6.4% of total revenue, or 5.9% excluding the noncash amortization of above and below market lease intangibles. we now anticipate that g&a expense will decline between 40 to 50 basis points as a percentage of total adjusted revenue compared to last year from a prior anticipated range of 20 to 50 basis points. total income tax expense for the third quarter was approximately $720,000. our expectation for total income tax expense this year remains between $2.5 million and $3.5 million.
in summary, are well-positioned balance sheet affords us tremendous flexibility with pro forma net debt to recurring ebitda of 3.1 times and roughly 1.6 billion of liquidity to fund our robust investment pipeline. with that, i'd like to turn the call back over to joey.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, peter. at this time, operator, we'll open it up for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] first question will be from r.j. milligan of raymond james. please go ahead.
r.j. milligan -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, r.j.
r.j. milligan -- raymond james -- analyst
so, i'm going to start with my boilerplate question of this earnings season. what's your current weighted average cost of capital? and how do you calculate it?
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
thanks, r.j. this is peter. i'd say, first, we're always looking to get ahead of our capital needs so that we can retain flexibility in terms of how and when we access the markets. and to that end, we raise their set of $900 million of capital during the third quarter.
that was used to fund our acquisitions during the quarter but also provides a significant runway moving forward. the breakdown in terms of the capital raised during the quarter includes $300 million of long-term debt, issued an all-in rate below 4%, and we also settled $600 million of forward equity with a cost in the mid to high fives. so, blending that all together, we raised $900 million during the quarter at a weighted average cost of around 5%, weighted two-thirds equity and one-third debt. as joey mentioned in his prepared remarks, with the debt markets effectively frozen today, our long-term cost to borrow in the six is assuming a new 10-year public issuance.
and so, absent any changes in the debt, capital markets will likely look to fund the business using equity only going forward while continuing to utilize the revolver for shorter-term borrowings. today, we have more than $380 million of outstanding forward equity available to us. that was raised at a cost in the mid to high fives. and any incremental equity issued would be at a similar cost based on our current share price.
i think, most importantly, we're going to continue to be disciplined and prudent in terms of investing in incremental capital. we're not going to deploy capital if it's only marginally accretive. and at the same time, we're not going to go up the risk curve just to achieve better spreads.
r.j. milligan -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. so, i think it's fair to acknowledge, obviously, the prefunding that you guys have executed on over the past few months. there is a pretty long equity runway relative to some of your peers. and you've got a cost of equity capital that still allows for accretive growth.
but if cap rates are moving higher, the expectation is that they are going to move higher. why accelerate growth into 4q versus waiting for the market to move?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think, r.j., that's opportunistic for us. so, i anticipate cap rates in q4 to tick up for us with a similar credit profile to the third quarter and a similar term profile to this quarter as well. so, i would anticipate taking advantage of the merchant builder market where there's an immediate need to recycle capital. and i think we'll see that in q4 given the increase in the bottom end of our guidance.
going forward, we'll take qualitative and quantitative aspects, obviously, both into consideration as we deploy capital. i think the bottom line is this. we've taken flak historically. not from you.
but we've taken a flak historically for running a very low levered balance sheet, introducing forward equity into net lease space, which wasn't really overly welcome the first time. it was introduced to maintaining a conservative approach. so, these are the times, frankly, when that pays off. and at the same time, we're going to continue to run a low levered balance sheet, stay within our historical sandbox of investing in the best retailers in the world.
because, at some point, debt will come back into the market. i don't believe it's going to be anywhere near the rates that we've seen given this super cycle. but we'll be in a position to add incremental leverage at that time.
r.j. milligan -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks for that. joey, you've been pretty vocal over the past couple quarters that you expect m&a and in the broader reit space and maybe a net lease. and we just see one of your peers taking private recently. do you think there's more m&a to come?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
first off, congratulations to mary and her team. i mean, obviously, that was a terrific outcome for them. but i think we are not only in the net lease space. i think there are a number of companies situated, given their cost of capital and potentially their balance sheets and/or their investment strategies, which aren't able to drive those spreads.
and as you know, it's very difficult to come back in the reit space once you have an impaired cost of equity especially. and so, our approach, our bent has always been conservative, you know, in preparation for what's next. we'll continue to follow, obviously, that historical approach here that predates my time in terms of balance sheet management. and we'll see what happens in 2023.
we don't have a crystal ball here, but i wouldn't be surprised to see more m&a activity across the across the reit space.
r.j. milligan -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you, guys.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, r.j.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brad heffern, rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
brad heffern -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. joe, in your prepared comments, you mentioned distressed opportunities sort of in passing. i guess, how frequent are those? and what do they look like?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think the most ""distressed"" we're seeing right now is those that are in the need to sell, the need to recycle capital. and so, what you'll see again for us in q4 is opportunistically working with those developers that have pipelines that are delivered that need to recycle capital, that are historic merchant builders across the space, and have recognized that the 1031 buyer of the 2021 pricing there isn't a feasible option for them to recycle capital into new projects or into other ventures. and so, that is, i will tell you, the true distress that we're seeing today. those are the first to recognize the immediate expansion in cap rates.
the second level is those with debt maturing or having a defined use for other proceeds -- for those proceeds. and we're seeing that as well. you know, the remainder of the market continues to lag with wishful thinking for that miraculous 1031 buyer, or frankly, the person, the buyer who thinks we're still in 2021, or an all-cash buyer. that's where we really see the bid ask spread remaining.
we anticipate that, hopefully, to see more capitulation for that narrow as well.
brad heffern -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then, you said you won't invest if it's only marginally accretive. i know, historically, you've solved for a spread of, you know, 150 basis points, plus or minus. so, if you're saying cost of equity is in the high fives, do you anticipate cap rates going above 7% for your sandbox eventually?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
well, i would tell you, would i anticipate cap rates going? i mean, i'm looking into my crystal ball. i think history here is a useful guide between 2014 and 2018. there was approximately $55 billion of single tenant net lease. retail traded, the tenure averaged about 2.5% at those times.
and the average cap rate was 6.5%. so, i'm not going to sit here today and say i believe cap rates are going to go north of seven. that said, i have no idea what type of economic conditions we're going to be in 2023. i think if we're investing capital, and let's call it around 75 basis points unlevered on an accretive basis and high quality assets, with a later infusion of debt, again, not with the tenure at 2% and spreads back to 100, you know, with an all-in cost of 3%, i think we can get there.
that said, if we're unable to invest capital accretively, we're going to maintain our discipline. and so, we're not going to take this balance sheet to a leverage position. we're not going to get on a hamster wheel. halloween is over.
so, we're going to find the best opportunities. what i can tell you is this. i can guarantee you that this team and this company will lead the cap rate expansion in our given space. and that's without going up the risk curve.
that's without moving into private equity-sponsored companies out of sale leaseback basis. that's without looking at short duration risk on assets. it's going to stay within our confines of what we're best at.
brad heffern -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brad.
operator
thank you. next question comes from josh dennerlein of bank of america. please go ahead.
josh dennerlein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. hey, guys. joey, i want to explore your comment on the competitive debt, not returning the market anytime soon. i guess, what are you looking for when it comes to kind of recapping the debt markets? or what or how do you really describe, like, competitive debt? like, what does that mean to you guys?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think, look, first of all -- first off, i mean, debt today is outside our cost of equity. i mean, that's first off. so, i mean, there really is no true debt market today, especially in the 10-year unsecured space. i mean, obviously anyone can look at where investment-grade paper is trading today.
we've never historically been a short-term borrower. we're not going to run a significant balance on the facility and on a variable basis. so, debt, obviously, has to be accretive relative to our cost of equity. i think that that's the threshold.
from there, we'll see -- look, i already said, i think the super cycle lower for longer is over. that's my best guess. but at the same time, maybe it's wishful thinking. i would hope in the back half of next year that we'll see a debt market that materializes and truly becomes a market again that is rent -- that companies are able to obviously raise debt capital in.
josh dennerlein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
alright. and how are, like, sellers -- like, do they understand the change in the cost of capital that buyers have today? like, what are the conversations like?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
josh, they are wide-ranging. i will tell you, there are sellers that still believe that wishful thinking maybe that will end with the fed today. we'll see. but we are seeing more and more sellers recognize that we're in a very distant position from 2021 or even earlier this year.
i think the most important thing there isn't really sellers' recognition of the macroeconomic conditions and/or uncertainty, it is the hope of the loan 1031 or all-cash buyer throwing in a bid for an asset. so, in conversations with brokers, and there's been notes to a similar degree, the assets that are out there widely marketed, asking low cap rates, sub five or five caps, for high-quality net lease assets, are getting two bids today. maybe not 10. you know, activity is down to 20% of historical activity -- recent historical activity.
so, i think the biggest challenge there, again, is not pouring cold water. i think it's the wishful thinking in the hope for that 1031 buyer or all-cash buyer to return, or throw in a bid. i think as we move forward in this economy, as there's less 1031 dollars here deployed, we're going to see some changes, hopefully, in terms of sellers' expectations.
josh dennerlein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
hopeful expectations, i should say. thanks, josh.
operator
thank you. next question comes from ki bin kim of truist. please go ahead.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning. joey. sorry if i missed this, but what kind of capital should we expect over the next couple of quarters?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ki bin. i -- next quarter is all we have visibility into. we just began sourcing for q1. and i would expect cap rates to pick up moderately there again with similar profiles to the third quarter.
q2 was an aberration because of the large sale leaseback that we executed out in terms of investment-grade profile. but i would expect over 70% investment grade, similar to this quarter, at or near 11% -- or 11 years weighted average lease term. and i would also anticipate ground lease activity kicking up there as well.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. and i know someone asked this previously, but let me try another stab at it. how do you balance looking at -- you know, you mentioned your wac, obviously, was more favorable looking backwards and going forward for everybody. but how do you balance buying this type of volume? i know you can with a great balance sheet.
but how do you balance buying it versus, you know, with your view that cap rates need to be higher and maybe taking a little bit of, you know, a pullback?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
so, i think it's a great question. i think this is an art and not a science. nobody has a crystal ball into 2023. we'll get hopefully a little bit more clarity from mr.
powell shortly here. but nobody has clarity into 2023 yet. that's why i would refer back to peter's comments. we will be disciplined.
we are going to make sure that transactions are accretive, both mathematically accretive but also qualitatively accretive. we are, by no means, is going to put the pedal to the metal here and lever up a balance sheet with spreads that don't make sense. and we're going to be disciplined and thoughtful like we've always been. but we are in very uncertain times.
there are many risks on the horizon, whether they're domestic or macro international risks. we're cognizant of those risks. again, this balance sheet, this company was built for those risks. and so, every dollar we deploy has to be thoughtful and has to do with purpose.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. and more a bigger picture question, i'm a little surprised that more triple net reits have an issue with convertible debt. i mean, you guys report on a affo basis anyway, where the gaap interest expense nonbenefit doesn't really matter. just any broader thoughts on convertible debt and if that's a tool that makes sense for you guys at some point.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
it doesn't make any sense for us. again, we're trading today on an implied or affo basis in the mid five range. convertible doesn't make any sense for us today in terms of an option of capital source for other companies. i really haven't spent any time on it.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. thank you.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ki bin.
operator
thank you. next question will come from nick joseph of citi. please go ahead.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks. joey, do you have any sense of how much 1031 money is still out there looking to be deployed?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
i wish i did. it's amazing that even though -- i'll tell you, there's a lot of talk of it still. i think the feedback that we've gotten, that i've gotten from my team, especially from recent conferences, and road shows, and meetings, is that there's a recognition that that money is waning. so, there's a lot of talk about this.
i'll tell you that the sentiment and the hope has gone from -- in the broader community has gone to wishful thinking, more from hopeful that there's 1031. and so, that has been recognized. i haven't seen anybody try to quantify those dollars. but undoubtedly, those dollars are beginning to wane the sheer number of real estate transactions in the commercial space as the velocity of them decrease significantly.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
yeah, exactly. and then, what are you seeing in terms of the different stickiness for cap rates on ground leases versus traditional net lease?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
really the same. i think ground leases have gotten -- as i mentioned, probably on the last couple of calls, ground leases have gotten a lot of attention due to us to safe hold to the sell side covering them. i tell you that it's -- that market is very similar relative to the broader net lease market that there's still a bid ask spread. we're still looking for sellers to capitulate.
that said, i do anticipate our ground lease pipeline in q4 will be fairly sizable.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thank you very much.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, nick.
operator
thank you. next question will come from haendel st. juste of mizuho. please go ahead.
ravi vaidya -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hi, good morning. this is ravi vaidya in the line for haendel. hope you guys are doing well.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
ravi vaidya -- mizuho securities -- analyst
can you comment on the acquisition -- good morning. can you just comment in the acquisition pipeline? are you targeting any new tenants or categories? are you seeing any pricing differentials that you're seeing on a category basis?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
so, no new tenants or categories. i will tell you, you know, selectively, we will insert tenants into that sandbox, or we will remove them into that sandbox. but i don't think it's appropriate, any new tenants or categories on a holistic basis. in terms of cap rates by sector, we're seeing velocity in those sectors in terms of cap rate dispersion.
we're seeing velocity in the sectors that are driven by merchant builders. that's generally retailers that are growing at a fast clip or have leveraged the merchant build community and -- the builder community, excuse me, to drive new store growth from.
ravi vaidya -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. got it. just one more here. i know you're shopping in the higher-quality end of the spectrum.
the cap rates tend to be stickier there. but can you comment how cap rates have shifted for investment-grade tenants versus noninvestment-grade tenants?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
i would tell you, we don't spend much time -- look, investment grade, we've always said, is an output of our strategy. there are significant tenants in our portfolio that don't have ratings that have fantastic balance sheets. many of them are transparent for the public to see, whether that's publix, hobby lobby, chick-fil-a, ollie, so top tier retailers in this country. the bottom line is tenants in the noninvestment grade are unrated that aren't, i would tell you, probably bb or better, especially the smaller operators and, even more acutely, the private equity-sponsored retailers.
the cap rates on those assets are blowing up. and they should. i mean those assets today, those sponsored tenants have balance sheets that have variable rate debt, have near-term maturities. they're generally single-purpose boxes in nature.
it's nearly impossible to put a residual or terminal value on the underlying real estate. they have limited access to capital. and their funding source is predominantly net lease reit on a sale leaseback basis who tend to be their largest unsecured creditors or among their largest unsecured creditors. we have no interest in playing in that space.
i think it's imprudent, given the macroeconomic outlook that we see today over the potential ranges of outcome. but we've never played in that space. and so, i can't give you specific instances of the cap rates because, frankly, we don't spend time there.
ravi vaidya -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. appreciate the color, guys.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from tayo okusanya of credit suisse. please go ahead.
tayo okusanya -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes, good morning, everyone. congrats on a solid quarter. joey, could you -- i mean, your earlier comment just about, again, rising cost of debt, you know, bad balance sheets, creating opportunities for you. you know, could you talk on the flip side with your retailers who are also going through that rising cost of capital and kind of, you know, bad balance sheets, if any? and just talk a little bit about the watch list, where you see going, you know, any particular reit categories you become a little bit more concerned about with just what's going on with the overall macroeconomic backdrop in the u.s.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, good morning, tayo. i think in terms of categories, we don't have exposure to categories where we have concerned. again, we just don't have the discretionary component, the recreational component, the luxury component in this portfolio. we are focused specifically at those core durable, generally recession-resistant tenants, and the leading operators in their respective sectors.
so, that's really not -- now, every property in our portfolio is on our website. if you want transparency, go to our website. all 1,706 properties as of 9/30 are on our website. we have three bed bath & beyond in the portfolio.
we bought them all for the real estate. they are all tremendous pieces of real estate. feel free to google earth them. we have one at home in our portfolio in provo, utah.
it is a critical piece of real estate on the main thoroughfare in provo. we'd love to get it back one day and have had multiple offers on it. so, at the end of the day, you know, we will get every asset and on a singular case-by-case basis. and we just, really, outside of a couple of few movie theaters that we have in the portfolio, just don't have those challenges.
tayo okusanya -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then, in the transactions markets, are you seem to be look a little bit different for ground lease-type transactions versus kind of, you know, standard fee simple triple net buildings out there.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
no. as i mentioned before, generally the same. it's transaction specific. now the ground lease market is nowhere near as deep or as large as the standard debt lease market.
so, there are, of course, aberrations. but generally, the same. nothing overly -- both markets today are in a stare-down for the, you know, general -- a general stare-down, i'll say, in terms of buyers and sellers and gaps there.
tayo okusanya -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thank you.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. next question will be coming from linda tsai of jefferies. please go ahead.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning. the high single-digit earnings growth in 2022 and high teens on a two-year stack, you know, as you look at your pipeline and given the view that cap rates move higher, you know, what type of earnings growth might be achievable next year?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, linda. it's a great question. a lot of it is going to depend, obviously, on the sources and uses if and when the debt markets come back, where cap rates move to. i think the thought of net lease reits growing in the upper single digits in terms of affo growth or double digits probably isn't overly prudent if there's any thought of that next year.
and so, we're going to see -- the macroeconomic circumstances are really going to drive, obviously, the sources of capital in terms of the cost there. and then, what happens in the overall cap rate environment and pricing environment is going to be the second piece there. and i wish i had the crystal ball to be able to tell you that today. but we, unfortunately, don't have it.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. and then has the tone or tenure change from retailers as it relates to their store growth outlooks?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
no. i would tell you that the conversations we have with retailers -- again, we're not in the luxury or discretionary space. so, i can't speak to those retailers. the conversations that we're having with retailers today revolve around the inability of developers to perform on their new store strategies.
their story strategies for 2023 are generally already built out with those -- with pipelines. now, it comes down to execution. and so, i'll give you an example. we talked to a large farm and rural supply retailer recently with a developer who had 50 stores in the pipeline, then down to 30 stores, three ended up hurtling.
so, generally speaking, the retailers in our portfolio have promised new store openings to the street. they are in growth mode. and now, they have challenges getting constituents and stakeholders to actually execute on that new store growth due to rising costs, both labor, obviously, and materials, rising interest rates, the lack of availability of construction loans. and then most importantly, now for a merchant builder, i tell you, the lack of clarity on what their exit cap rate will be.
and so, we're working with those partners to see if there's a solution that makes sense for both of us in terms of deploying all three of our platforms.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. that's really helpful. just one last one. what's driving g&a lower?
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
linda, this is peter. in terms of decrease in g&a during the quarter, it was spread across several different areas, including accounting and tax, it and stock-based compensation expense where there was a one-time decline due to some employee forfeitures. i would note that our guidance for 2022 implies a 40 to 50 basis point deceleration in g&a to approximately 6.5% of total adjusted revenue. and that guidance assumes that g&a in the fourth quarter returns to a level more similar to the expense that we saw during the first and second quarters of this year.
linda tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. next question comes from wes golladay, baird. please go ahead.
wes golladay -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. has there ever been a time where your cost of equity has been less than your cost of debt for a prolonged period like we're seeing now? and then, you did make a comment about no short-term debt. is that to read no term loans, always going to target tenure debt, looking for a clarification on that.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, not my tenure, wes. i mean, our cost of capital is effectively inverted today. and we anticipate to remain inverted for a while here as the tenure remains elevated and spreads remain extremely elevated. when we talk about short-term debt, we're talking about carrying extended balances on the credit facility, either on a variable basis or on a swap basis.
we have looked at the term loan market and executed specifically in the seven-year term loan market historically. most recently, we've been obviously an unsecured issuer in the public bonds space at 10- and 12-year levels here. but we'll look at all available options here, which makes sense in terms of our capital stack debt maturities. but we're not going to take any variable rate risk, or any tenure risk.
wes golladay -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok. got it. and then, when we look at the merchant builders situation, do you get the sense there are retailers who are willing to pay higher rent to help the merchant builders absorb a little bit higher cap rate on their exit? and when you look at your pipeline, this year was really a lot of gerber collisions, you made a good headway there. in the background, you have a bunch of retailers or handset retailers that you're potentially going to have dropped next year where we see, you know, maybe this pipeline just swell.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
so, retailers are looking for all different types of solutions today. the team has been to a number of retailers headquarters meeting with their heads of real estate in their respective departments. they're looking at increasing rent. they're looking at internalizing development.
they're looking at fee-based programs to keep it on balance sheet. they're looking at more term, larger increases. i think all different types of solutions are being looked at so they can get new stores opening in the ground. to your second question, we're always talking to retailers, and we're always looking for opportunities to grow commensurate with their pipelines.
again, it just really has to hurdle for us across all three platforms from an economic basis.
wes golladay -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
got it. and just a follow-up on that, i mean, was there something specific about gerber where you're just going to probably maybe provide them a little bit more, i guess, platform value when they said, ""hey, we want to just grow with you quite a bit. and you're the one that we want to work with where, you know, maybe others are just doing one-offs."" i just wonder if there's anything special about that one? because it really was a lot of gerbers this year.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, we've been talking to gerber, i would say, for upwards of six years. and we had identified gerber specifically because they're the only public company traded on the toronto stock exchange owned by boyd group. they're the only public company in the collision space.
and so, as we saw caliber and service king, both private equity-sponsored, continue to gobble up independent operators, as well as open net new stores, you know, we were very attracted the collision space because of the cost of repairs, the third-party payment, cost of repairs because of the cameras and the sensors. as i mentioned before, you can't just go to your traditional buckstop. you need a technician and a computer wizard to fix everything on your car today. so, we were very attracted to this space.
we identified gerber again because of their well-levered balance sheet, which everybody can see online. those conversations culminated with gerber entering into a significant growth phase obviously from an organic perspective rather than m&a perspective. and so, the collision space was dominated by m&a, by the big three operators. as i mentioned, gerber being the only public one acquiring one-off and small collision repair chains.
it then became cost prohibitive or, frankly, lack of opportunities out there. so, they flipped to greenfield and brownfield development. and that's where we finally hit a chord and found a partnership there that worked for both of us. and so, we're very active, obviously, with gerber.
they have over 725 locations across the country. and we love the business, the direction of the business, and, frankly, their relationships with auto insurers with direct clients that took over.
wes golladay -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
got it. thanks, everyone.
operator
thank you. next question will be from ronald kamdem, morgan stanley. please go ahead.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, two quick ones. just coming back to sort of the acquisition pipeline, you know, there's sort of two factors, right? there's volumes, and then there's pricing. and then, you sort of talked about that, you know, cap rates 6.2 in the quarter, that should be going up. as we're sort of thinking about next year, should we expect sort of the same amount of volume at those high cap rate levels, right? because i think what your messaging is that cap rates are rising, but they're probably rising a little bit slower than cost of capital.
so, is this a scenario where, yeah, we should be expecting higher cap rates coming through? but are the volumes, is there a give or take there? or is there just enough sort of to go around, if that makes sense?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think you hit it dead on. and if we don't see cap rates rise, where they hurdle for us quantitatively, then you will see volumes slow down. i mean, there's obviously no doubt about it. and as cap rates move, we will be careful with -- or don't move, frankly, we'll be careful with how we put our pedal to the metal, or frankly, we lay off.
and so, again, we have to be -- take every transaction on a discrete basis, look at the qualitative and quantitative aspects of both of them, and then decide whether it makes sense relative in the broader market for us. and so, we are going -- we are in a read and react mode. i think it's fair to say everybody is in a read and react mode. and we will not get ahead of our skis, that's for sure.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then just moving on to tenant health, tenant risk. maybe can you just remind us just what bad debt has been this year? obviously, you guys have a super clean portfolio. so, it's pretty small.
but the real question is, obviously, as we're thinking about the next year or the next two or three years, are you seeing anything that suggests that there's going to be more pain coming down the retail pipeline? like, what are you hearing on that front? thanks.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
i'll take it. from a high level, yeah, i anticipate pain. not specific to this company because the portfolio is so strong. but i think a lot of balance sheets were repaired -- retail or balance sheets will repaired during covid.
they either -- they ought to be [inaudible] sales or, frankly, the ability to access low-cost capital. and so, a lot of balance sheets, ironically, were repaired during covid. i think we're seeing the deterioration of those balance sheets today, back to a more normalized pattern based upon their overall businesses. and so, over the next two or three years, i think we're going to see -- and i think maybe even a shorter period of time, we're going to see more and more distress in the broader retail environment.
again, a lot of this is dependent upon the consumer and macroeconomic conditions. but covid was an outlier. covid -- and i told people consistently, covid was not a proxy for recession. covid was not a proxy for retailer distress.
it was a timeout. and during a timeout, a lot of people and a lot of retailers got to eat, and, frankly, got some free things or very cheap things. and so, now, we're seeing a normalization of sales levels across most retail sectors today. and the normalized sales patterns of a lot of these retailers, pre-covid, didn't make much sense to be sustainable in terms of an ongoing retail operations.
and so, i think we're going to see that normalization. and actually, we're seeing it today. we're seeing the tip of the iceberg today. peter, if you can talk specifically about the bad debt.
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
yeah, in terms of bad debt, year to date, we've only recorded approximately $300,000 of bad debt expense, which is roughly 10% -- sorry, 10 basis points of revenue on a year-to-date basis. so, very minimal bad debt expense recorded year to date. looking forward, we specifically identify tenants or instances of bad debt. so, it's difficult to predict exactly what level of bad debt we will have moving forward.
but again, as joey referenced, we think our portfolio is in great shape today.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you so much.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ron.
operator
thank you. next question will come from chris lucas, capital one. please go ahead.
chris lucas -- capital one securities -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. just a couple of quick questions. joey, if we take a step back and think about the buckets of transaction opportunities that you guys look at. so, you've got direct-to-tenant deals, and then you've got sort of, you know, existing lease deals that are out there that you might acquire.
are you seeing any differential in terms of the sellers in these cases, either one side or the other, adjusting to the capital market pricing today faster than the other at all?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
it's a great question. i think the direct to sellers, those conversations generally and those thoughts are moving a little bit quicker, inclusive of direct to retailers than either marketed opportunities and/or off-market opportunities that are out there shopping. so, i think those direct conversations are cutting through to today's reality a little bit quicker, generally speaking, than some of the circuitous, kind of hopeful conversations that are out there.
chris lucas -- capital one securities -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. and then, peter, i guess, maybe just taking the prior question one step further, any sense as to what year fully swapped seven-year or five-year term loan all-in costs would look like today?
peter coughenour -- chief financial officer
yes, chris, i guess to answer that, i would say, this year has progressed. obviously, there's been a lot of volatility in the debt capital markets, specifically the public bond markets. and as a result, i think more issuers have looked to the term loan market rather than the public bond market. we had the swaps in place earlier this year, where it made sense for us to access the public bond markets at an all-in rate below 4%.
in terms of accessing the term loan markets today, i think as banks have issued more term loans this year to issuers, you've seen bank balance sheets grow and less of an appetite to issue term loans, particularly five- and seven-year term loans. and so, it's difficult to say exactly where we can price a five- or seven-year term loan today. i think we're seeing banks push companies toward the shorter-term term loans, one or two years with options to extend.
chris lucas -- capital one securities -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and last question for me, joey. just curious as to your thoughts about how you feel about kroger as a credit given the kroger and albertsons merger announcement, and how you're thinking about your portfolio there.
any risk to regulatory sales or anything like that, that you, you know, you have to worry about?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
no, nothing there concerns me in terms of credit. there's no release provisions in any of our kroger release. i think the more interesting fact -- or i think the more interesting thing, frankly, is kroger's desire to actually acquire albertsons. you know, we've been talking for a long time about how we only will invest in the top tier grocers in the country.
and that grocery has been thought of as a safe haven generally, both in the net lease space, as well as the shopping center space in the broader retail environment. and we continue to remind people that grocery has been a 2% business historically. when you have to pick it off of the floor, paying associates $20 an hour, some of them loaded wages even higher on the union basis, the margins quickly deteriorate. and so, what we're seeing and i think we're seeing with the kroger-albertsons is a move to increase scale even further because of margin deterioration capex spend in terms of ocado and fulfillment.
and so, no concern on our end. all of our kroger deals have, again, full kroger guarantees. no release provisions there. i would anticipate a spin-off being really consolidated in the existing albertsons stores.
i think it's going to be interesting to see what the ftc does here. we obviously track the tractor orscheln ftc approval process, which i believe extended 18 or more months. and only it was in the farm and rural supply business with 180 stores that tractor was buying, you know, that consisted of the entire company for orscheln. they had to divest of approximately 50%.
so, as we watch the ftc here, it's going to be very interesting when it comes to something, such as food, especially with the inflationary pressures we've seen on food, what that approval process is going to look like. but i think there's no doubt that we're going to continue to see grocers search for scale. and so, we're going to stay at the top end of the grocery spectrum because i just truly don't believe it's actually the safe haven than investors have generally perceived.
chris lucas -- capital one securities -- analyst
great, thank you. that's all i had this morning.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, chris.
operator
thank you. next, will be a follow-up question from tayo okusanya of credit suisse. please go ahead.
tayo okusanya -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, yes. just a very quick one. the cap -- the 6.2 cap rate this quarter, the gap cap rate, could you give us a sense of what the cash [technical difficulty] are on your most recent transactions. i'm trying to get a sense if you feel a gap in the cash yield spread between the investment-grade and the noninvestment-grade market, but the other two gap out again because it had kind of collapsed over a while.
[inaudible] gap out again at this point.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
tayo, you're breaking up. to your -- the part that came through, really, the spread between investment-grade and noninvestment-grade or unrated for us is really close. you know, again, some of our favorite retailers, ollie, hobby lobby, chick-fil-a, publix traded at very aggressive cap rates. they are unrated.
some of them are closely held, private family owned companies, but they are -- but they trade as if they were investment grade because of the perceived credit profile, although they don't carry a third-party rating. and so, there really isn't that wide of a dispersion. i'll tell you, there's probably, given term, credit, real estate, and in a number of other factors, probably about a 75 to 85 basis-point dispersion across cap rates of where we invest capital. in this quarter, average of 6.2.
and again, we anticipate that ticking up in q4 as we see more opportunities really driven by the merchant builder space.
tayo okusanya -- credit suisse -- analyst
and then, your cash yields were probably like mid five?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
excuse me. you're breaking up again.
tayo okusanya -- credit suisse -- analyst
cash yield. and so, your gap yields were 6.2. your cash yield for the quarter?
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
no. closer. around 6%.
tayo okusanya -- credit suisse -- analyst
the cash yields are around six.
joey agree -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
