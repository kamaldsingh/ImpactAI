eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jim. welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. i am eric thornburg, and it is my honor to serve as chairman, president and ceo of sjw group. the importance of delivering clean, safe and reliable drinking water has never been more evident than now when something as basic as hand washing has become such a critical activity in protecting public health and preventing the further spread of covid-19. as i was preparing my remarks this week, our new england operations, especially connecticut, was hit with tropical storm isaias. despite widespread power outages across our serviced towns, we continued to provide uninterrupted water service to all of our customers, which remains essential during the pandemic. this is a testament to our highly effective planning and capital investment strategy and our dedicated teams who served our customers well throughout the event.
we also thank the commissioners of the connecticut public utilities regulatory authority and leadership of the connecticut department of public health for their support and assistance to prioritize power restoration to our essential facilities during the event. our 700-plus employees nationwide deliver a mission-critical service to the customers and communities that we are privileged to serve. that has not changed because of the pandemic. there's no replacement for clean, safe tap water. what has changed is how we do our work. in the early days of the pandemic, we temporarily paused all nonessential field work to assess the risks associated with meter reading, construction and other field operations. our mission was simple: protect our people so that they could continue to deliver on our public service mission of delivering life-sustaining water service, protect our customers from the further spread of covid-19 and protect the company so that we could continue to deliver on our critical public health mission.
the vast majority of our office employees continue to work remotely, and we anticipate this to continue through at least the third quarter. our critical field employees returned to work after a thorough review of each task was conducted by our environmental, health and safety and operations teams. extra safety precautions and the use of appropriate ppe were implemented. and we continue to follow the guidance of federal and state officials and public health agencies. the leadership team is incredibly proud of our people and the way they've responded to the unique challenges during this pandemic, finding new ways to work effectively and safely while serving our customers and communities. we've seen tremendous innovation as our teams effectively and efficiently work remotely. we have launched an internal initiative to capture those ideas and processes, and we will build on them as we move forward.
as an example, our successful work-from-home program, which launched when we wanted to get our people out of the office because of covid-19, has enabled us to sign on to the commute pledge spearheaded by santa clara county in california. for our california employees whose work can be conducted remotely, we've targeted a goal of working online, out of the office for 25% of the work week or about five days a month when normal operations resumes. this pledge brings several benefits, including greater work-life balance for our employees, continued delivery of exceptional service to our customers and enhanced protection for the environment. there have also been some surprising benefits. covid-19 has given sjw group and its subsidiaries an opportunity to work shoulder to shoulder, virtually, of course, with a common purpose: protecting our employees' and public health during the pandemic. our teams in california, texas, connecticut and maine seized that opportunity and forged a bond to serve customers, communities and each other now and into the future.
this has highlighted the strength of our new team and shown how the skills in the respective states complement each other for the benefit of the combined organization. it has accelerated our integration work and built a web of teamwork, knowledge and resource sharing all across our operations. we've also launched our first nationwide customer satisfaction survey that will allow us to benchmark each of our operations and provide a platform to share successes that will further enhance customer satisfaction across our organization. regulators in all four of our states where we operate have initiated proceedings or adopted mechanisms that allow us to track and record covid-19-related expenses and lost revenue for consideration at a future date. through the second quarter, we have seen no measurable impact on total revenues due to the pandemic. account collections, while slowing, continue to be strong, and we are closely monitoring this now that the federal pandemic unemployment compensation benefit has expired.
on the expense side, we are seeing some areas of savings such as travel as well as areas of incremental costs. we also remain focused on closely tracking our operating results and working with our peers in local and national industry associations to raise attention to the industry impacts of the pandemic and advocate for further regulatory relief. as we are now part of a larger combined organization, we have the added benefit of weather, economic and regulatory diversity that comes from operating in four states to help mitigate some of the risks. our response throughout this event has been and will be guided by this fundamental principle: protect our people; protect public health; and exemplify our core values, integrity, respect, service, compassion, trust, transparency and teamwork. it has served us well, and we will continue to rely on that approach as we move forward. as such, we reaffirm our earlier guidance of $1.95 to $2.05 per share in 2020.
i will now turn the call over to jim who will review our q2 financial results. and after jim's remarks, i will address other regulatory and business matters. jim?
james lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, eric. our quarterly operating results reflect the second full quarter of combined operations with connecticut water service, inc. or ctws, an increase in customer usage and authorized rate increases in each of our water divisions. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the availability of surface water supplies due to dry weather conditions in our northern california service area this past winter. during our first quarter earnings call, we noted that the ctws transaction will change the pattern of our future quarterly earnings. recall that interest on debt and the impact of new shares issued to finance the transaction is being recorded evenly throughout the year. on the other hand, ctws earnings follow a seasonal pattern that is typical for water utilities. while this mismatch will have no impact on annual results, we anticipate it will lead to changes in the pattern of our future quarterly earnings compared to what we experienced prior to the ctws merger.
second quarter revenue was $147.2 million, a $44.2 million increase over reported second quarter of 2019 revenue of $103 million. net income for the second quarter was $19.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share. this compares with $13.5 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2019. diluted earnings per share for the quarter reflects the results of ctws, which contributed $0.27 per share; increased usage, which contributed $0.24 per share; and rate increases, which contributed $0.05 per share. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in california surface water production of $0.19 per share, interest expense on new long-term debt of $0.12 per share and increased production cost of $0.08 per share due to higher customer usage. in addition, in the first half of 2019, we earned interest of $0.06 per share on invested proceeds from our december 2018 equity offering, paid customer rate credits of $0.06 per share related to our 2019 billings settlement with the california public utilities commission or the cpuc and incurred ctws merger expenses of $0.06 per share. none of this reoccurred in the first half of 2020.
turning to our comparative analysis for the quarter. our $44.2 million increase in revenue was primarily due to the merger with ctws, which contributed $32.8 million; increased customer usage, which contributed $8.4 million; and we generated $1.6 million in cumulative rate increases. the revenue increase was partially offset by a $1.3 million net decrease in california balancing and memorandum accounts. in addition, we issued $2.2 million in customer credits in the second quarter of 2019 that did not recur in the second quarter of 2020. water production expenses increased $16.1 million compared to the second quarter of 2019. the increase included $6.9 million related to ctws sales, $6.7 million for the purchase of additional water supply necessary to supplement the low volume of northern california surface water and $2.9 million due to higher customer usage. these increases were partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in california cost recovery balancing and memorandum accounts.
as stated on our first quarter earnings call, in 2020, we anticipated greater availability of surface water from our northern california watershed. through the first two quarters of 2020, we experienced the second lowest rainfall total in the watershed since 2011. absent additional rainfall, we anticipate 2020 surface water production will be approximately 2.3 billion gallons lower than planned. the incremental cost to supplement this shortfall is approximately $4.2 million per one billion gallons. other operating expenses increased $14.1 million during the second quarter primarily due to higher depreciation expense of $7.7 million, $4.5 million in new general and administrative expenses and $3.3 million in higher property and other non-income taxes.
these increases were primarily a result of the inclusion of ctws' second quarter activities. in addition, we experienced a $1.8 million decrease in merger-related expenses. the effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 18% compared to 23% for the second quarter of 2019. the effective tax rate decrease was primarily due to the flow-through impact of certain ctws tax deductions. turning to the first six months of 2020. revenue was $263 million or a 46% increase over the same period last year. net income for the first six months of 2020 was $22.1 million or $0.77 per diluted share compared to $19.4 million or $0.68 per diluted share during the same prior year period. the change in diluted earnings per share for the year was due to many of the same factors noted for the quarter. higher customer usage in california and texas contributed $0.42 per share. ctws results contributed $0.35 per share.
rate increases contributed $0.15 per share and savings and merger-related expenses contributed $0.12 per share. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in california surface water production of $0.35 per share, increased production costs due to higher customer usage in california and texas of $0.33 per share and interest expense on new long-term debt of $0.26 per share. in addition, in 2019, we earned $0.11 per share of interest income on invested proceeds from our december 2018 equity offering. these proceeds were used at the end of 2019 to partially finance the ctws transaction. as such, no similar interest income was earned in 2020. our 2020 first half increase in revenue was primarily due to the merger with ctws, which contributed $60.2 million, $14.4 million in increased customer usage and $5.1 million in cumulative rate increases. water production expenses increased $33.1 million in the first half of 2020. the increase was primarily due to $13.1 million in ctws expenses, $12.1 million from the northern california surface water decrease and $8.2 million in higher customer usage.
these increases were partially offset by a $3.4 million decrease in california cost recovery balancing and memorandum accounts. other operating expenses increased $32.1 million in the first half of 2020 primarily due to a $13.9 million increase in depreciation expense, $13.7 million in higher general and administrative expenses and $6.6 million in higher property and other non-income taxes. these increases were primarily a result of the inclusion of ctws year-to-date activities. in addition, we experienced a $4.4 million decrease in merger expenses related to the ctws transaction. first half 2020 other income and expense included $8.2 million of new interest expense on sjw group's $510 million senior notes issued in october of 2019. in the first half of 2019, other income and expense included $4.2 million of interest income earned on the proceeds of the company's 2018 equity offering.
as noted above, no similar income was earned in 2020. turning to our capital expenditure program. we added $35.8 million in company-funded utility plants in the second quarter of 2020, bringing total company-funded additions for the first half of the year to $74.1 million. we are on track to add approximately $200 million to utility plant in 2020. our first half 2020 cash flows from operations decreased approximately $17.4 million over the same period of 2019. the decrease was primarily due to the authorized collection of $20.1 million in balancing and memorandum accounts in 2019, a decrease of $11.8 million due to higher unbilled revenue balances and slower collections from customers during the covid-19 pandemic, a $5 million upfront payment in connection with our city of cupertino service concession agreement and $4.4 million and a $4.4 million increase in the payment of amounts previously invoiced and accrued.
these decreases were partially offset by an $18.1 million increase in net income adjusted for noncash items and $5.8 million in the net collection of income tax receivables. at the end of the quarter, we had $163.3 million available on our bank lines of credit for short-term financing of utility plant additions and operating activities. the average borrowing rate on line of credit advances during the first six months of 2020 was approximately 2%.
with that, i will stop and turn the call back over to eric.
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jim. while there are clearly challenges resulting from the pandemic that are affecting businesses across the nation, sjw group continues to execute on our core growth strategy of investing in high-quality water systems to provide safe and reliable water service to customers and communities and earning a fair return on those investments. our capital programs continue to be the company's earnings engine, adding rate base and ensuring resilient water systems. while there was a temporary pause on some capital work in our operations, work has resumed and projects are well under way in all four states. specifically, in california, we do not anticipate any negative impact and continue to work toward achieving the $320 million three year capital program authorized in san jose water's current general rate case.
we were actually well ahead of schedule before the shelter-in-place order was issued in santa clara county, and we fully expect to deliver the ca puc-approved capital investment level. in maine, work is under way on our new $50 million saco river water treatment facility that will replace the current treatment facility, which is more than 130 years old and sits in the floodplain at the river. in fact, just last week, we held a virtual groundbreaking, which you can view on maine water's facebook page. we also received a final decision for our general rate filing for maine's skowhegan division, authorizing $198,000 in revenue out of the $200,000 requested. the case was filed pre covid-19 but was completed during the pandemic without delay, demonstrating our constructive relationship with the maine public utilities commission.
the commission's decision called for a phase-in of the increase over two years, with the company allowed to recover the associated carrying costs. four additional rate filings for other divisions are scheduled to be filed in maine before march one of 2021. in connecticut, we expect the public utility regulatory authority to rule in september on our request to merge our avon water company and heritage village water company companies into connecticut water company. the end result will be a single water utility operation in the state, which will increase efficiency by eliminating duplicate costs for regulatory filings, payroll processing, audits and other expenses associated with having three separate companies. sjwtx, our texas water and wastewater utility, continues to grow both in customer connections and rate base.
year-to-date, we've completed over $10 million of company-funded capital expenditures and accepted more than $5 million of developer-funded extensions, a new record for the company. sjwtx' connections are nearing 19,000, and its growth continues to impress, nearly tripling in numbers since the acquisition in 2006 and reflecting 8% customer growth in the last 12 months. turning to water supply. all of our subsidiaries have adequate supplies to meet current customer demand. in general, we are seeing higher usage from our residential customers and lower usage among our business customers, owing to the pandemic. we are seeing some increases in operating costs to meet the increased demands across all four states. importantly, our actual sales are tracking nicely versus authorized sales in california.
despite the lower availability of our own surface water, we continue to be able to meet demand through our wholesalers' imported and groundwater supplies. as jim mentioned, we anticipate higher water supply operating costs for our california service area in 2020 and as a result, lowered our 2020 guidance accordingly in q1. on a positive note, we do not currently expect any further impact beyond the $0.30 reduction to the 2020 earnings per share due to reduced surface water supply availability. sjw group subsidiaries also continue to execute on our integration plans and deliver the benefits of our transformative combination to all of our customers, communities, employees, the environment and our shareholders. our internal integration management team has been hard at work to leverage the merger benefits for all of our stakeholders and subsidiaries to drive us forward as a combined company.
2020 continues to be an unpredictable year with unprecedented challenges. despite the challenges, we continue to invest in our systems and in the health and safety of our people, customers and communities. our team of employees have clearly demonstrated their passion to serve customers and deliver life-sustaining water service. we honor those on the front line at our company, within our industry and across the globe for their work to deliver this essential service. lastly, on and on behalf of the board, i'd like to extend a warm welcome to our newest board member, carl guardino. carl has been ceo of the silicon valley leadership group since 1997 and is a transformational leader in silicon valley. his accomplishments are well known and too long to list. carl shares the same deep affection for the communities where we all live, work and serve.
and with that, i'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of richard sunderland with jpmorgan.
richard sunderland -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking my questions.
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. good morning, rich.
richard sunderland -- analyst
starting with the ctws integration. i think you made a reference to an accelerated process out of covid-19 or some impact there. could you speak a little bit more to that impact? and maybe how the opportunities have changed from where they were a year ago?
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure thing, richard. thanks. it's been nine months since our close, and i would emphasize the cultural aspect of the integration is really ahead of schedule. i think most would agree that the cultural integration side of a combination is just super critical to the long-term success of a combination such as this. and the fact that we've had this common cause to work together on, i think that's what's really driven forward the cultural integration and alignment across the organization.
in terms of the structural integration, it can be more challenging without the ability to travel and whatnot. but we are delivering our synergies and mitigating increases across a variety of cost streams, including the public company costs and cyber and it and water treatment chemicals and many other areas you would expect. so we feel like we're really right on track on that front.
richard sunderland -- analyst
got it. and then i believe your grc filing in california was due last month. so i just wanted to check in there kind of what you see as the major requests in the upcoming rate case. particularly, i think you alluded to, on one quarter, potentially looking to address that water supply issues that are impacting your results this year.
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure thing, richard. i'll make an initial comment, and if jim has anything he can add, that would be great as well. richard, actually, our next general rate case filing is the final filing is due on january four of 2021, and then our next cost of capital proceeding isn't until march of 2021. and so we have not yet finalized our application. that is in process. so i really don't have too much that i can comment on yet, but you did put your finger on an issue, obviously, of great concern, the whole aspect of the sort of the cost balancing approach toward our water supply mix.
there's also a proposed decision out on another matter that kind of, to our surprise and i think the industry's surprise, included discussion and a resolution on the wram that we currently don't enjoy. so we're watching that pd. we're active in providing some commentary to it. and we think that ultimate decision will color our approach in our upcoming case. so i'd just ask you to stay tuned on that. and i suspect next quarter, we can provide some more color.
richard sunderland -- analyst
thank you for the update.
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you for the question.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of jonathan reeder with wells fargo.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, good morning, eric.
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, jim. i mean, jonathan.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
good so on the $0.03 of covid expenses that you singled out, are those i was thinking you're tracking them in those memo accounts for future recovery, but until you actually get it, you just can't book the offsetting revenues. is that right?
james lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. jonathan, this is jim. that's right. in at least three of our operating utilities, we have got an authorization to capture those costs in trackers at this point. and in the fourth, we've gotten an indication that we should be tracking them so that we have an opportunity to have a discussion with the commission at a later point in time. but at this point, we are recording the expenses and not recording any associated recovery of those expenses.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. great. any updates on the ami deployment request in california? i think it was a q4 decision anticipated there, but didn't know where in the docket we were on intervenor's position, stuff like that.
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
jim, i'll start, and if you have something to add, please do. but jonathan, that proceeding, we feel, went very well. we're continuing to work on it. we are hoping and would expect a fourth quarter result. we're really pleased with our business case. we think it's exceptional. and with state water budgets looming in 2025, i think there's a clear call for this type of technology. and the proceeding was very fact-based, and we really sensed that we turned a corner this time and that it was much better received and there was interest in engaging in some dialogue around it. so feeling pretty optimistic about it, but still a ways to go. and we're going to be looking toward a decision in the fourth quarter. jim, did i miss anything?
james lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
no, i think that's right, eric. in addition to what you discussed, we do have ongoing conversations with the advocate in california regarding the program, and those have been constructive.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
so in terms of those conversations, is that potentially something that could lead to a settlement? or has the prospects of a settlement kind of passed? or was there ever the option for a settlement?
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. jonathan, there's there definitely still remains opportunity for settlement, at least with opa. and of course, there are other parties that would be involved, including the staff at the puc and wrates, a local advocacy group. so we remain very open to settlement, if that can be done. and if not, we do think we've laid out a very strong business case and the importance of this further step here. so again, remain optimistic that this time will be different.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. great. and then i think the plan in connecticut was to file a base rate case around midyear. has that been filed? or kind of what's the updated plan there?
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. we will be providing further color on that in the third quarter, jonathan. we have not filed yet in connecticut. we would anticipate filing probably in the next six to 12 months, and we're looking forward to getting that accomplished. as you know, we had a stay-out that expired on july one this past year. so from this point forward, we're in a position that we could file, but of course, we want to make sure the timing is just right and our capital program is in a good state. and we'll be providing an update in the next quarter.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then bouncing back to california. i've seen some reports about customers receiving abnormally high bills recently. any thoughts on what might be going on there? i know you've had some billing issues and disputes in recent years.
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. i can definitely talk about that and turn it over to jim as well. i mean basically, jonathan, what occurred was because of the pandemic, we put a pause on meter reading. so we estimated bills for a couple of months until we were sure that our employees could be safe out there reading meters. and as you probably know, the methodology for estimating bills is use the same period a year ago as the basis. and so 2019 was kind of a cool, wet year. so now that we've been out catching up and actually getting actual meter readings, it's really catching up. usage has actually occurred. we're absolutely sure there's no billing errors or issues. it's just a catch-up.
and our team of customer service reps are really working hard to manage that and help our customers. and we have been very clear that we're not exercising any terminations or collection activities. we're willing to work with our customers and enter payment agreements and the like. and so i think it's just a byproduct of the pandemic, and we're confident that it will be resolved here fairly shortly.
james lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. eric, i think that captures it really well.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. yes. so i mean, has that like put some additional pressure maybe on like the bad debt expense that you're tracking and stuff like that? i guess that stuff hasn't flowed through the accounts receivable enough to really do that yet, but.
james lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. so i'll start, eric, and maybe you can play follow up on some additional information on it. so in california, jonathan, we read the meters or we estimate the meter reads, as the case was during the pandemic, on a once every two month basis. and in connecticut, we actually bill quarterly. and so in our view, the pandemic kind of really took effect and hold on our folks with the stay-at-home orders that were issued in late march across the various states that we operate in and so we're just starting to see the impact of the pandemic and the follow-on impact on the economy and people's ability to pay and also increased usage as it's starting to matriculate through the different meter reading cycles across our different states.
so a little too early to see if there's been any kind of a significant trend toward activities that are going to lead to higher bad debt. we are seeing, as eric mentioned on the call, an increase in our past due 90 days. and so we're keeping an eye on that as well as activities at the federal level to either reup the unemployment insurance program or if not, what additional steps they may be taking in order to facilitate folks to pay their essential bills.
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. the only thing i would supplement to jim's comments is, personally, i've just been very, very pleased by what we've seen in terms of collections. i mean customers have really honored their part of this. and our collection activity has been our cash flow activity has been great. we arranged payment agreements for some customers. and i think the longest that was reported in our workshop last week was 12 months, but most are two months. and so anybody having a payment challenge, we invite them to call and work out the arrangements with us. but as i said, we've been very, very pleasantly surprised by the collections and cash flow. it's been very good.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
great, thank you.
eric thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i appreciate your question.
operator
[operator instructions] and there are no further questions at this time. i'll pass the call back to eric.

eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jim. welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us. as we reflect on 2020, i'd like to begin by recognizing our nation's essential workers who are bravely serving us on the front lines during this extraordinary time. from the public safety employees consisting of police, fire, emergency response, and healthcare professionals to our grocery store and other critical supply chain workers, they all deserve our recognition and appreciation for their dedicated service.
our appreciation and recognition also extends to our 700 plus employees and their utility industry peers across the nation, who we consider to be essential as they continue to deliver safe and reliable service. our dedicated and passionate water professionals met the challenges of 2020 head on to provide a reliable supply of safe drinking water to more than 1.6 million people in our local service communities in california, connecticut, texas and maine.
in my 38 years in this profession, it never mattered more. so while covid-19 dominated 2020, it did not dominate our people. i'm especially proud of our teams and their commitment to protect the health of their customers, communities and coworkers. they knew that delivering safe, clean drinking water to their customers and communities was essential to public health.
they developed protocols and procedures that protected their coworkers, so they can safely carry out their essential work. and they did it by collaborating across our expanded national footprint to support each other and build on our strengths for the good of the entire organization. and it also reminded us that human life is precious and fragile and that there is no higher calling than to serve others.
we also responded to the needs of customers and communities who were financially impacted by covid-19. since the beginning of the pandemic, we've worked with customers throughout -- through our assistance programs to help them keep their accounts current and suspended shut offs for non-payment, consistent with each state's requirements. and we increased our donations to local service organizations in 2020 to help them meet the basic needs of people in the community. it is clear that our transformative combination with connecticut water service, incorporated in 2019 made for a stronger sjw group in 2020, which benefited shareholders, customers and employees.
our 2020 corporate sustainability report, coast to coast, documents our commitment to environmental, social and governance matters. as that report was telling our story, the company was recognized with prime status by iss esg. prime status is awarded to companies with an esg performance above the sector-specific prime threshold where we were tied for the top ranking among us utilities.
we saw significant improvements in our environmental and social scores and ranked second among our utility industry peers for our combined environmental and social quality scores. our governance quality score was already at the highest level and placed us among the top within our industry. we're especially proud of the human rights policy adopted by our board in the fourth quarter. the policy affirms our conviction, the human rights are fundamental rights, freedoms and standards of treatment to which all people are entitled. it also reflects our values and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.
a team of employees with the full support of senior leaders and the board serve on our national diversity, equity and inclusion council, dei, to support and advocate for dei initiatives. we, as a company, are committed to fostering an environment where employees can bring their true-selves and feel included, welcomed and valued. we're also determined to be a force for good in the communities where we live, work and serve.
for example, in 2020, san jose water was responsible for $28.8 million of diverse supplier spend, representing 30.1% of our addressable spend there. and following connecticut water's adoption of a supplier diversity plan in early 2020, both texas and maine approved formal plans later in the year that are being implemented in 2021. we are fully committed to our diverse supplier program, and we'll continue to share our progress in the years to come. other highlights of 2020 include investing more than $199 million in our water and wastewater systems across our multistate footprint, achieving world-class customer satisfaction on a composite basis across the company and another successful year of meeting drinking water and environmental regulations, delivering on our commitment to public health and environmental stewardship.
i will now turn the call over to jim, who will review our financial results. after jim's remarks, i will address regulatory, water supply and other business matters. jim?
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, eric. our 2020 operating results reflect our first full year of combined activity with ctws. one key attribute of our merger was the diversification we achieved by expanding our geographic footprint into new england. the strength and importance of our diversification strategy were tested almost immediately by the drier than normal winter we experienced in our northern california service area, severe weather events in our texas and new england service areas and covid-19 and its impact on our customers, operations and construction activities across the united states.
in each case, the impacts of these events on sjw group's combined operating results were diminished due to our geographic diversification in the case of weather events and diversification of our regulatory and operating platforms in the case of covid-19. diversification, coupled with our strong local operations, supported by our national framework enabled us to safely deliver water service to our customers and communities, protect our employees and deliver solid results for our shareholders.
fourth quarter revenue was $135.7 million, a $9.9 million increase over reported fourth quarter 2019 revenue. net income for the quarter was $13.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share. this compares with a net loss of $5.5 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019. diluted earnings per share for the quarter reflects lower ctws merger expenses of $0.36 per share, higher customer usage of $0.22 per share and lower administrative and general expenses of $0.19 per share due to lower integration costs. these increases were partially offset by an increase in production costs due to higher usage of $0.10 per share and a decrease of $0.05 per share due to lower local surface water availability in northern california.
turning to our comparative analysis for the quarter, our $9.9 million revenue increase was primarily due to increased customer usage of $6 million and $1.4 million in cumulative rate increases. in addition, we recorded $2.8 million in customer rate credits in the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of regulatory commitments we made in connection with the merger.
no such rate credits reoccurred in 2020. water production expenses increased $3.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. the increase included $2.6 million in higher customer usage and $1.5 million for the purchase of additional water supply necessary to supplement california surface water.
other operating expenses decreased $12 million during the quarter, primarily due to lower merger-related expenses of $9.7 million and lower general and administrative expenses of $5.1 million due to lower merger-related integration costs. these decreases were partially offset by $2.5 million in higher depreciation expense. the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was a negative 7% compared to 6% for the fourth quarter of 2019. the effective tax rate decrease was primarily due to the capitalization of non-deductible merger expenses, which resulted in a decrease of tax benefits in 2019. no similar tax benefit reduction occurred in 2020.
turning to our annual results, 2020 revenue was $564.5 million, a 34% increase over the same period last year. net income in 2020 was $61.5 million or $2.14 per diluted share compared to $23.4 million or $0.82 per diluted share during the same period in 2019. the change in diluted earnings per share for the year was due to many of the same factors noted for the quarter. ctws customer usage contributed $2.83 per share and customer usage from our other operations increased $0.59 per share. due to the timing of when the merger transaction closed in 2019, we only recorded $0.01 per share of earnings from ctws in 2019. as such, essentially all of ctws 2020 customer usage is reflected as an increase as compared to the prior year.
in addition, 2019 non-recurring merger costs contributed $0.48 per share and the wcma write-off in 2019 contributed $0.29 per share. these increases were partially offset by increased production costs of $1.04 per share due to higher usage, a net increase in interest on long-term debt of $0.86 per share due primarily to merger-related debt, and 2020 note issuances and a decrease in local surface water availability in northern california of $0.58 per share.
our 2020 increase in revenue was primarily due to $111.2 million in increased customer usage, $12.2 million in cumulative rate increases and $2.7 million from new customers. these increases were primarily the result of the addition of ctws and higher usage due primarily to drier weather in our service areas.
water production expenses increased $50 million in 2020. the increase was primarily due to $33.9 million in higher customer water usage from the addition of ctws and drier weather, and a $19 million increase due to lower surface water supplies. this increase was partially offset by $3.4 million of increase in california cost recovery balancing and memorandum accountants. other operating expenses increased $33.9 million in 2020, primarily due to a $23.7 million increase in depreciation expense, $13.4 million in higher general and administrative expenses and $10.8 million in higher property and other non-income taxes. the increases were primarily a result of the inclusion of ctws operating activities. in addition, in 2019, we incurred $15.8 million in merger expenses related to the merger transaction. no similar expenses were incurred in 2020. other income and expense for the year included $13 million of new interest on sjw group's $510 million senior notes, which were issued in october of 2019 and a $50 million senior note issued by sjw group in august of 2020, as well as $8 million of interest expense on ctws financings. other expense and income in 2019 included $6.5 million of interest income earned on the proceeds of the company's december 2018 equity offering. no similar income was earned in 2020.
turning to our capital expenditure program, we added approximately $65 million in company-funded utility plant in the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing total company-funded additions to $199.3 million. our 2020 cash flows from operations decreased approximately $25.9 million over the same period in 2019. the decrease was primarily due to the authorized collection of $45.3 million of balancing and memorandum accounts in 2019, a decrease in collections of previously billed and accrued receivables of $15 million, a decrease in other non-current assets and liabilities of $12.4 million and a $50 million upfront payment we made to the city of cupertino in connection with our service concession agreement.
these decreases were partially offset by a $51.8 million increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items. we continue to monitor customer payment activity at each of our four operating utilities. and specifically, the impact covid-19 is having on our customers' ability to remain current with their accounts. in our northern california service area, where we have seen the largest increase in past due accounts, the california public utilities commission has authorized water utilities to activate their catastrophic emergency memorandum account or their sema.
the account track savings and costs from covid-19 related activities as well as uncollectible account balances beyond the authorized bad debt in our most recent general rate case. sjwc has determined that future recovery of the account is probable and recognized a regulatory asset of $2.3 million in the sema-related to covid-19 for the year ended december 31, 2020.
at the end of 2020, we had $84.9 million available on our bank lines of credit for short-term financing of utility plant additions and operating activities. the average borrowing rate on line of credit advances during 2020 was approximately 1.78%.
with that, i will stop and turn the call back over to eric.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jim. sjw group continues to deliver on our core growth strategy of investing in high-quality water systems to provide safe and reliable water service to customers and communities and earning a fair return on those investments. in the last decade alone, more than $1 billion has been invested in the local water systems of the communities that we serve. it's well documented that our nation's water and wastewater systems are in need of significant investments. utility regulators have historically recognized this need and have enabled regulated water utilities to make such investments.
in 2021, sjw group's subsidiaries plan to invest $239 million in infrastructure improvements to serve our customers in california, connecticut, maine and texas. over $1 billion is planned across the organization over the next five years. accordingly, in january, both san jose water and connecticut water filed general rate cases. san jose water's grc application proposes a $435 million capital program for the years 2021 through 2023, supported by our award-winning enterprise asset management plan.
the process is expected to take about 12 months, and new rates are anticipated in january 2022. california employs a future test year, and thus, the level of capital spend is authorized during each general rate case cycle. connecticut and maine employ a historical test year, where capital investments and expenses are recovered after they have been incurred and subsequent general rate case filings. connecticut water's grc is the first it has filed since 2010.
a primary driver of the case is the $266 million in infrastructure investments that have been completed and are providing a benefit to customers but are not yet covered in rates. the connecticut public utilities regulatory authority, pura is expected to issue a decision in q3.
earlier this year, pura approved a 1.1% increase in infrastructure surcharges through the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment program, or wica, this request covers $8.7 million in qualified infrastructure investments with incremental annual revenue of about $1 million. it will become effective on april 1, 2021.
maine water received approval in december 2020 for infrastructure surcharge increases in five divisions for eligible projects through the water infrastructure surcharge program, or wisc. the increases were effective on january 1, recognizing $3.5 million in critical infrastructure investments and increasing revenues by about $300,000. these various filings include proposed capital investments that, over the long term, benefit customers, communities and shareholders as they enhance sjw's ability to deliver safe, high quality, and reliable water service while increasing rate base, the earnings engine for the company.
in january 2021, san jose water, along with the three other class a water utilities, requested a one-year deferment on their cost of capital filings, which would otherwise be due on may 1 of this year. postponing the filing for one more year would alleviate administrative processing costs on the utilities as well as the commission staff and provide relief for both commission and utility resources, already strained by numerous other proceedings and covid-19. we will let you know if the commission approves this request.
turning to water supplies in california, we are seeing less precipitation than normal, both locally as well as in the sierra nevada snowpack, california's largest reservoir. thanks to the work of valley water, our wholesale water provider, we do not anticipate any short-term supply shortfalls as our groundwater basin remains full and can be leveraged as needed to ensure that we can meet customer demands during the upcoming year. the rainy season typically ends in late march, and we will have a complete picture of our supply status when we report q1 earnings. at that time, we also plan to issue 2021 guidance. i'd also like to comment on the very
difficult situation in texas. the combination of what has been described as a once in a century cold spell, coupled with an ice storm, a snowstorm, and rolling blackouts across the state has resulted in a real crisis affecting millions of people. our operation located in the fast-growing region in between austin and san antonio, serves 20,000 customer connections. like our utility peers, we've suffered significant operating challenges during the crisis, owing to energy disruptions, broken water mains and roads that have remained nearly impossible since sunday. we are focused on restoring normal service to our customers as rapidly as possible while protecting the safety of our employees. if we're able to do that before other water utilities in the region, we will do our best to come to their aid as well.
looking ahead, i remain optimistic about sjw group's future success. covid-19 and our shared commitment to serving customers, communities and each other has brought our four companies together in a way that we would never have imagined a year ago. our geographic workforce and regulatory diversity has strengthened our company and positioned us well for 2021 and beyond. to achieve our goals, we are working diligently to support the growth of our texas water utility, which has more than tripled in size through organic growth and acquisitions since 2006, increased our capital investments to deliver safe and reliable service to our local communities and grow the rate base for all of our operating entities and continue to seek acquisition opportunities that create value for our stakeholders.
the prudent management of our business and financial resources continues to be fundamental to our growth and ability to return capital to shareholders, demonstrating the company's strong commitment to our shareholders in january 2021, the board authorized a 6.3% increase in sjw group's 2021 dividend to $1.36 per share as compared to the total dividends paid in 2020. we're proud to have continuously paid a dividend for over 77 years and to have increased that annual dividend in each of the last 53 years, delivering value to our shareholders.
lastly, we'd like to extend a warm welcome to commissioner, darcie houck to the california public utility commission and express our appreciation to outgoing commissioner, leanne randolph for her service. we look forward to working with commissioner houck and her colleagues and their staff to address the many water-related issues facing california's regulated utilities.
and with that, i'd like to turn the call back to the operator for your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of richard sunderland from j.p. morgan.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question today.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. good morning, richard.
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
good morning.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
starting off on the water supply update, i'm curious if you can kind of frame levels versus where they were last year? or just any other color to think about where we stand now in the rainy season through the, i guess, end of march end?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll begin that and ask jim to comment as ccs fit then afterwards. but as we said, the rainy season really ends at the end of march, typically in this area. so it's far from over. if you were to compare kind of where we are this year to last year, our reservoir has about 25 million gallons less usable supply in it than it did a year ago.
so that's about 10% difference at this point. but again, we've got six more weeks plus to go, and we'll be able to provide a much clearer picture at the end of march. and just as a reminder, this surface water supply that we own is about 6% of our total water supply availability. the positive side of this, of course, is that our usage is up, and you saw that a significant impact in the fourth quarter of 2020. and i saw a statistic yesterday that was quite something. it showed that over the last 19 months, this is the third driest stretch in the san jose in history in about 120-plus years. so, it's been a very localized dry spell. but as i mentioned in my remarks, the groundwater supply here is in really great shape, and we don't anticipate any near-term supply disruptions.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. and then just following up there, i think it was some $0.50 year-over-year hit quantified on the sort of the production side. is there a way to unpack that for the usage or the supply versus what's baked into your rates, i guess, the normal level in rates versus actual 2020?
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. rich, this is jim. so interestingly enough, 2019, we had over -- we were able to produce over 5.2 billion gallons out of the watershed. so it was a significant rain year in 2019. and that followed in 2020 by about $1.2 billion that we were able to produce out of the watershed. so to give you some perspective, each 1 billion gallons, if we had to replace that, is about $4.2 million to $4.3 million from -- when we actually have to purchase that water to replace it.
and as eric mentioned, we anticipate certainly that between the groundwater basin and the actual rain that we do receive in the area as well as surface water or we call it imported water that's available from the santa clara valley water district or valley water, that we will have certainly ample supplies as we move forward. as it relates to the -- what's baked into rates per se, i believe that currently, we have about 2.5 billion gallons baked into rates. and so, that's kind of the target that we would like to achieve simply because that would make us rate neutral.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay. i appreciate the color there. and then if i could just ask one more. the connecticut rate case application, just curious, it seemed like in your release, you outlined there are a number of puts and takes to the rate impacts of that. but thinking about the sort of normal residential increase that was cited in your release yesterday, is there a way to quantify what that is on a percentage basis?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll take that one, jim. so that's a 19% increase for residential customers. i think the typical annual water rate -- annual rate for connecticut customers in that $600 to $700 range. and again, this is the first general rate filing in 10-plus years. and so when you get that down, it's about $10.50 per month or $0.35 a day.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks for the color there. that's all i had. thank you.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, richard.
operator
your next question comes from the line of hasan doza with wam.
hasan doza -- water asset management -- analyst
hi, good morning, gentlemen. hasan doza with water asset management. thank you for the color on texas. would love to understand -- i know it's early, a little bit more details about your plant operations in texas. as you know, we have all been reading about water treatment plans being off-line throughout the state. so, i would love to understand how your water treatment facilities are operating and also any additional costs that you might be incurring for things like a back-up generators and so forth. so i would love to understand the dynamic a little bit more? then i have one follow-up, please.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks. hasan, nice to talk to you, thanks for your interest. yeah, you know what this is really quite an incredible situation in texas. it's not uncommon. of course, that's some cold snaps and even the ice storms, but sort of the combination of all these events and the, frankly, lack of any real warning in terms of the power disruptions has really impacted, as everybody knows, the whole state of texas.
and it seems like water supplies, in particular, have been hit at this point. we have generators at our major facilities, and we have portable generators that we can pull out to our boosted systems out and around our service area. we did struggle early with access, comal county, which is, i think, one of the top two or three fastest-growing counties in the united states. boy, they just don't often get ice and snow there.
and so roads were impassable for a number of days and just getting our generators out to these local neighborhoods to reconnect to booster stations was impossible. and we also, as the power went out and would come back on and then drop out again, that creates pressure waves out in the system, which results in some main breaks. and then, of course, the cold weather, we've got a lot of customer services frozen as well. so we're making real progress, working hard at it. but until that weather turns, i think, looks like tomorrow, it starts to get above freezing on a go-forward basis the real recovery begins. so, not an issue with generators so much, but more getting access to facilities with impassable roads, and you need to get fuel out to generators and the like.
so it's been a real, real challenge. we have a boil water notice on in our facility just at an abundance of caution for our customers. and we'll release that boil order once we're able to confirm that all the water is, of course, safe to drink. so in that standard operating procedure and in coordination with texas environmental regulators, so a tough situation, we're working hard on it. at this point, i don't suspect we'll have material cost impacts on sjw group. but if that were to change, we'll certainly allow adequate notice to investors and our stockholders and the public.
hasan doza -- water asset management -- analyst
got it. thank you. the one remaining question i have, and wanted to get your thoughts is. how should we think about a need for equity in 2021? and the reason i ask is your filing two new rate cases and i recognize the california, you have a separate cost of capital versus the rate case. but typically, it's an optimal time to align your cap structure in line with your regulatory cap structure.
and i've been noticing your cap structure in your books, you're like closer to 60% debt and 40% equity, you typically want to be aligned like 50% equity, 50% debt at the operating companies. and so, i just wanted to get a sense, given you have two rate cases pending for our education, should we think about 2021 as your the year that you may need to come for equity to realign your operating cap structures, more in line with your regulatory cap structures?
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. hasan, this is jim. so we always take a look at the -- we start by taking a look at where we are from our regulatory cap structures. and where we have committed to be with regards to our regulators across all four of the operating utilities and endeavor to maintain as close as possible that split between debt and equity.
as it relates to the parent company, our approach is really to optimize the cap structure there in consideration of the rate filings. and so, we'll be taking a look at that but also the fact that it's a good time to be heavier on the debt side than the equity side. it's also a good time to raise equity. so, we'll explore all of the financings that are available to us as we move into the current year in consideration of where we stand with within our regulated operations. and then also, as you point out in consideration of any potential overlay of the parent company that regulators may look at as we move forward in those proceedings.
hasan doza -- water asset management -- analyst
thanks. [speech overlap] thank you.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of michael gaugler with janney montgomery scott.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
michael? michael, you might be on mute. i can't hear you.
michael gaugler -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
good morning.
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
good morning.
michael gaugler -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
sorry about that. just one question. with what's going on in texas right now. should we be anticipating essentially higher cost this quarter as a result of emergency actions?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, like i said to the earlier question, michael, i don't think that there will be material higher costs, but there will be higher costs. we've got people working on over time, fixing leaks and the like. but that's our smallest utility, 20,000 connections there, about $50 million in rate base, so compared to the total. but here's the advantage for texas. we can bring our full strength to bear to support our customers in texas.
we're actually helping field customer calls from our texas customers in connecticut. our employees there are helping. so, we think that we're doing all we can to serve our customers there and get back on track. but as i said, i don't expect at this point to see material cost increases to the group. but as soon as if that were to change, we'll be transparent about that, michael.
michael gaugler -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. my other questions were answered. so, that's all i have for you.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of jonathan reeder from wells fargo.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen. how are you doing?
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
good, jonathan. how are you?
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
not too bad, just trying to stay warm, not as dire of a situation as texas we're a little more, i guess equipped for it, you could say. so that's good, at least. but kind of curious when we look at what changed between early november when you reiterated the $1.95 to $2.05 guidance at the end of the year, the allowed results should come in at roughly $0.10 above the top end. was that just higher consumption in california due to the dry weather that they kind of surprised?
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, it's a great question. it's really due to two things. one, it wasn't just california, but it was across our service territories, where we did experience drier weather. we saw that in connecticut, in the northeast as well as texas and california, we had a longer fall, if you will, and we're able to experience dry and warmer weather in each of our service areas. and that was a big part of it.
another part of it, though, was actually because of the drier weather in connecticut, we were able to extend the construction season there essentially, and we're able to work on our network infrastructure more, which provided some benefits relative to some tax deductions that we weren't otherwise anticipating. and as you can see in my remarks, we had a negative $0.07 [phonetic] impact on taxes as compared to a significant tax expense for the same period in the prior year. that was due largely to the fact that we were able to extend the construction period. so, those were the two items that kind of merged to kind of lead to the result for our fourth quarter.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, great.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, jonathan, i'd just add to that. having worked in new england for close to 11 years, i don't recall ever seeing us laying pipe in december up there and paving roads. and so the team up there did a fantastic job. and as you know, with that repair tax adoption, you're able to benefit on the income tax side, so really unusual december.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. great. and then shifting to california, the cost of capital extension request, where do things stand? have there been any developments beyond, i guess, the consumer advocate filing that statement and opposition of the request, i guess, from our standpoint, seemingly the recent rise in rates, maybe helps to some degree with your request?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
jonathan, there's been not a peep. we have nothing new to add, but we certainly would expect to hear shortly, with that one may time line out in front of us there. so i'm sure we're going to find out pretty shortly.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, great.
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
jonathan, this is jim. i want to correct one thing i said. i said $0.07. it was actually a negative 7% in taxes for the fourth quarter as compared to 6% in 2019. so, those were percentages not pennies.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that, jim. i think that might have been on that one slide. then, i guess, in terms of the grc in california, is the $100 million ami project, is that included in the grc's $435 million capex request? or where does that ami request stand? because i was thinking maybe a decision by the end of '20 was expected, but i honestly, i haven't tracked it, unfortunately.
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. my understanding is right now, that project is still -- we're still kind of discussing that with the advocates in california. that's not included in the ask for the capex at this point. we're not exactly sure where that project is going to land. we think that likely it will be an advice letter project.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. so that could still be outside of your budget. would you say it's in that $1 billion five year or it's even incremental to that?
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
i would include it in that. i think we are anticipating that is in that amount.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then sticking with the grc, what level of surface water supply does your request look to establish?
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
i believe i'd have to get back to you on that, jonathan. i'm not going to speculate, but we were looking for a decrease from what was in the prior rate case because of our most recent experience that we've had coming out of the water shed up there. i just don't know at this point what that decrease was.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and we'll get back to you. if memory serves, and i guess there's always a risk in this. i think it's around 1.8 billion [phonetic] as opposed to the 2.5 billion [phonetic], but that's a proposal and sure there'll be a lot of other puts and takes in that process there, but we'll confirm that and let you know.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
sure. okay. but yes, you are, i guess, hopeful that you can kind of get that bar lower given some recent experience. okay.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
exactly.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. and then may be leaning eric on your connecticut experience a little bit, what's been the early feedback to that rate case filing, in particular, that request for the 50 basis points roe premium?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
the case is really just getting started. i know the team, i spoke with our president there this past week more in westbrook, and we've just begun to get some interrogatories. so, there really isn't any color i can add to the commentary here. we feel really good about the case and the overwhelming weight of it being in the capital additions already made and in place serving customers.
and so -- and connecticut definitely has had a pattern of acquiring small systems and really enhancing their quality of service. so, i think that puts us in a very good position and make a really good case for the benefits to customers in those newly acquired areas, so optimistic, but a long way to go before we get results. it's a 200-day statutory period from filing dates. so as mentioned, we'd expect results in q3.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and that 50 basis points premium, i guess there is precedent going back to like an aquarion case in like 2017, is that right?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, that's correct. i don't know if it's 2017, but i do know that aquarion benefited from that with purchase of a number of small systems in the state of connecticut.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then lastly, remind us how the allowed roe ratio is determined in connecticut. is it based on your actual equity ratio for the sub? or is it just more of a point estimate that pure deems kind of appropriate?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's based on at the sub level. and the last rate case, there was there was some controversy from -- at least from our perspective in terms of how short-term debt was calculated. i recall that we had some short-term debt there, and it was actually looked at as equity as opposed to debt. and so, we want to make sure we get the capital structure right there. i think in the last case, it was the equity levels were right around 45.7%. so, we're going to make a strong case for that needs to be corrected in this case. but it's a long process, and we'll work hard to get that balanced.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and i mean, i guess, when you go through your earnings test there, it is predicated on what is approved in the rate case, if you said it was 45.7% or whatever. and then, i guess, it's up to you to manage the sub where you want in respect to that.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. in the years that have followed, of course, the company has invested $266 million in new rate base, not including all the pipeline work that's been recovered through weca. so -- but when they look at your annual earnings, there's a -- i think that they use current equity at that time, but that's subject to check.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
yeah. no, that's what i was kind of remembering back when me and dave would talk about it. he was saying that was maybe based on the current. so that's where i'm kind of just trying to get a handle on what was last approved versus the request, which i think was 53% or something like that and where we might land. so, ok, now appreciate you guys taking the time and answering my questions, very helpful. thank you, jonathan. thanks.

eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jim. welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. i am eric thornburg, and it is my honor to serve as chairman, president and ceo of sjw group. we're now more than 13 months into the covid-19 pandemic. i would again like to thank our employees and the nation's other essential workers for their efforts over the past year to serve customers, communities and each other during the pandemic. there is a sense of cautious optimism that the worst is behind us, and we have begun planning for the safe return to our offices and work centers. over the past year, we've learned much about our teams, our culture, how we can adapt and what we can achieve through remote work. despite the challenges, our people have personified our mission, trusted professionals passionate about delivering life-sustaining, high-quality water and exceptional service to families and communities while protecting the environment and providing a fair return to shareholders. looking ahead, we are preparing for a phased return to our offices and work sites, building on our established risk-based process that has served us well during the past year. we will adhere to the safety guidelines provided by our national, state and local health authorities.
our goal remains the same as it has been throughout the pandemic to deliver on our public health mission as a water service provider and protect our employees, customers and communities. i and the rest of our executive leadership team are looking forward to the day when we can express our appreciation to all employees in-person and meet the new employees, who have joined our team over the past year without having set foot in our offices. we are committed to a safe return that seizes the benefits of remote work while providing a safe physical environment to nurture collaboration and our culture. the extreme cold and winter weather experienced in texas last february proved the benefits of a pure-play water and wastewater utility with national scale, geographic diversity and locally focused operations. sjw group was able to draw on resources from our operations on the east and west coast to assist our texas operation during the event. while our texas employees focused on system impacts, our texas customers had their calls answered in the morning by our connecticut call center and in the afternoon by our california team.
our communications teams from both coasts assisted with customer notifications as well as website, social media and news media updates, while our operations and safety teams provided valuable incident support. the direct experience of the connecticut and maine teams dealing with cold weather events added to our response. in california, the rainfall season is largely behind us. we have experienced lower-than-normal precipitation for the second consecutive year, and that is impacting available surface water supplies produced from our watershed. i'd like to now turn it over to andy gere, president and chief operating officer of san jose water company to provide more granularity on our water supply situation.
andrew r. gere -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, eric. a very low precipitation that we have experienced in the santa cruz mountains this winter has had a significant impact on our local surface water operations, both in terms of storm runoff collected at the creek intakes for immediate treatment as well as the volume of water that we've been able to impound in our lake elsman reservoir for release later in the year. for the first time in my 25 years at san jose water, we are temporarily taking our montevina water treatment plant offline due to low supply. we will bring the plant back into service when hydrologic conditions allow. to provide some perspective, the chart on slide 10 shows the historic surface water production in blue compared with the associated rainfall at lake elsman in red over the same period.
as you can see, there's been just one other year, 2014, where we saw such low levels of rainfall and surface water production. fortunately, the regional water supply picture is somewhat better, and despite the low rainfall and snowpack this winter, the total groundwater storage at the end of the first quarter remained at stage one or normal of valley water's water shortage contingency plan. based on available recharge and the current rate of withdrawal. valley water reports that it is forecasting to remain in the normal range through year-end by supplementing normal supplies with additional imported water. that bodes well for the upcoming summer months when demands are typically highest, and we anticipate adequate supplies to serve our customers. with that, i will stop and turn the call back over to eric.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, andy. as a result of the water supply situation in california, we anticipate increases in our operating costs through the reliance on purchase water from our wholesaler to meet our customers' needs in 2021. currently, every billion gallons of purchased water has an incremental cost to the company of $4.2 million more than using our own supply sources. as a direct result of the water supply outlook and in full transparency, we are announcing guidance of $1.85 to $2.05 per diluted share in 2021. this assumes no additional company produced surface water in california for the remainder of 2021. we are in the process of updating our strategic water supply plan to evaluate current and future supply reliability and resiliency. our current california general rate case proceeding will address the impact of surface water availability. the prudent management of our business and financial resources continues to be fundamental to our growth and our ability to return capital to shareholders. we are proud to have continuously paid a dividend for over 77 years and to have increased the annual dividend in each of the last 53 years, delivering value to our shareholders. i will now turn the call over to jim, who will review our first quarter financial results. after jim's remarks, i will address regulatory and other business matters. jim?
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, eric. our first quarter operating results reflect new revenues authorized by our 2019 california general rate case. water infrastructure conservation adjustment and water infrastructure surcharges authorized in connecticut and maine and customer growth in texas. these increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage, the impact of a february ice storm in texas and a decrease in available low-cost surface water due to the dry weather conditions in california that eric and andy just discussed. first quarter revenue was $114.8 million, a 1% increase over the first quarter of 2020. net income for the quarter was $2.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share, an 8% increase over net income of $2.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share reported in the first quarter of 2020. the increase in diluted earnings per share for the quarter was primarily attributable to cumulative rate increases of $0.08 per share, cumulative cost savings of $0.04 per share, a tax benefit of $0.04 per share and an increase in nonregulated income of $0.03 per share.
the diluted per share increase was partially offset by a decrease in customer usage of $0.08 per share. customer credits in texas totaling $0.02 per share issued in connection with the february ice storm, a decrease in the availability of surface water of $0.02 per share and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $0.06 per share. our revenue decrease was a result of $2.8 million in decreased customer usage. in addition, customer credits in texas reduced revenue by $700,000 and net changes in certain balancing and memorandum accounts reduced revenue by $600,000. these decreases were partially offset by $2.8 million in cumulative rate increases and $500,000 in revenue from new customers. total 2021 first quarter water production costs were slightly lower when compared to the first quarter of 2020. the minor reduction was primarily due to $800,000 in lower average per unit cost for purchased water, groundwater extraction and energy charges and lower usage, partially offset by a $700,000 increase due to the purchase of additional water supplies to supplement the lower level of surface water production we experienced during the quarter. other operating expenses increased $1.6 million or 2% for the quarter, primarily due to $2.1 million in higher depreciation related to utility plant additions, and $200,000 in higher maintenance expenses, partially offset by $400,000 in lower general and administrative expenses.
in addition, in the first quarter of 2020 we incurred $400,000 in merger-related expenses. no similar expenses were incurred in 2021. the effective consolidated income tax rates were approximately negative 52% and 15% for the quarters ended march 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the lower effective tax rate for the quarter ended march 31, 2021, was primarily due to excess tax benefits relating to share-based payment awards, state tax credits and other discrete tax items. turning to our capital expenditure program. we added $46.7 million in company-funded utility plant during the first quarter of 2021. this represents 20% of our total 2021 planned capital expenditures. from a financing perspective, first quarter 2021 cash flows from operations increased 321% over the first quarter of 2020. this change was primarily the result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8.3 million, an increase in accounts receivable collections of $2.2 million and a $1.5 million increase in net income adjusted for noncash items. in addition, in 2020, we made an upfront payment of $5 million to the city of cupertino in connection with our service concession agreement and refunded $8.4 million to california rate payers that were accumulated in our 2017 tax act memorandum account. no similar payments were made in 2021. in march 2021, sjw group issued approximately $1.2 million -- i'm sorry, 1.2 million of new shares in an offering that raised net proceeds of approximately $66.9 million. proceeds from the offering were used to repay outstanding balances on the company's credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.
in addition, in april 2021, the company's california subsidiary entered into a $140 million credit agreement, and the company's texas subsidiary entered into a $5 million credit agreement, both with jpmorgan chase bank. the new credit agreement replaced the existing jpmorgan chase credit agreements, which have been paid off and were set to mature and expire on june 1, 2021. at the end of the first quarter, we had $138 million available on our bank lines of credit for short-term financing of utility plant additions and operating activities. the average borrowing rate on line of credit advances during the quarter was 1.42%.
with that, i will stop and turn the call back over to eric.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jim. sjw group continues to execute on our core growth strategy of investing in high-quality water systems to provide safe and reliable water service to customers and communities and earning a fair return on those investments. as jim just mentioned, we have already invested approximately 20% of our planned 2021 capital spending through the end of the first quarter. we have high-quality water systems throughout our service areas and are investing to sustain them for the benefit of customers, communities and shareholders.
other regulatory developments in the first quarter include the filing of general rate cases for both san jose water and connecticut water in january. san jose water's grc application proposes a $435 million capital program for the years 2021 through 2023, supported by our award-winning enterprise asset management system. new rates are expected to be effective in the first quarter of 2022. california employs a future test year, and thus, the level of capital spend is authorized during each general rate case cycle. connecticut, texas and maine, employ a historical test year, where capital investments not otherwise recoverable through surcharge mechanisms and expenses are recovered in subsequent general rate case filings after they have been incurred. connecticut water's general rate case is the first since their last decision in 2010.
a primary driver of the case is the $266 million in infrastructure investments that have been completed and are providing a benefit to customers, but are not yet covered in rates. the connecticut public utilities regulatory authority, or pura, is expected to issue a decision in the third quarter. connecticut water rate case also includes tiered rates for residential customers that promote water conservation. in connecticut, pura-regulated water utilities are able to collect their authorized revenues regardless of usage through the water revenue adjustment mechanism, which mitigates risk of such a rate design and support state policy goals for conservation. a 1.1% increase in the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment surcharge, or wica, was authorized by pura earlier this year and went into effect on april 1. this covers $8.7 million in qualified infrastructure investments that have been completed and will provide incremental annual revenue of about $1 million.
the current cumulative wica surcharge will be rolled into base rates, and the surcharge will be reset to 0 as part of the general rate case. maine water filed a general rate case application for its biddeford saco rate division, requesting a $6.7 million increase in annual revenues with the maine public utilities commission, or puc, in march. the application is driven by a $60 million replacement of the 1,884 vintage drinking water treatment plant. maine water's application includes an innovative proposal that would spread the increase over three years in roughly equal amounts. a decision on the rate smoothing mechanism to authorize a customer surcharge, starting in the third quarter of 2021 is expected in the second quarter and a decision on the requested revenue increase is expected in the second quarter of 2022, in alignment with the completion of the new water treatment facility. these various state regulatory filings include capital investments that over the long term benefit customers, communities and shareholders as they enhance our ability to deliver safe, high-quality and reliable water service while increasing rate base, the earnings engine for the company.
we are mindful of the economic impact that covid has had on some of our customers over the past year. connecticut water is proposing a 15% discount on water bills for income-eligible customers that is similar to a program offered by san jose water since late 2005. meanwhile, san jose water anticipates proposing a debt forgiveness plan for its water rate assistance plan, or wrap, or low-income -- for low-income customers. the proposal includes tracking the forgiven amount in san jose water's wrap balancing account for potential future recovery. on april 9, sjwtx, our texas water and wastewater utility, executed the closing agreement to acquire the clear water estates water system. this is the first acquisition completed by a regulated water utility under the state's new fair value -- fair market value regulation. the acquisition added 230 new customers, gained additional water supplies to serve current and future customers and added rate base that reflects market value for future rate making purposes. more importantly, the acquisition demonstrated that the fair market value process worked as envisioned.
this was the 13th acquisition completed by sjwtx, which has tripled its customer base since 2006. the company serves two of the top four fastest-growing counties in the united states. with a diverse portfolio of letter supplies and continued additions to customer base through organic growth and acquisitions. we remain optimistic about the prospects for sjwtx and its increased contributions to consolidated earnings. we are committed to investing in our culture, diversity and the environment. our diversity, equity and inclusion council has honestly and authentically guided our commitment to further build on our diverse and inclusive culture. we strive to foster an environment where all of our employees, present and future, are welcomed and comfortable being their true selves at work.
we have goals to expand our supplier diversity programs so we can extend our efforts into the broader community. at the board level, sjw group is just one of 154 companies in the russell 3000 to achieve a gender balanced board rating in 2020. according to the 50/50 women on boards gender diversity index. we've set the foundation for creating a comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory across all of our operations, understanding where we are now will allow us to set meaningful reduction goals for the future and develop prudent plans that will serve as a road map to achieve those goals. finally, i would like to thank bob van valer for his 15 years of dedicated service to the company. bob has served as a director of the company since 2006 and as lead independent director since 2015. bob's knowledge of the water industry is second to none and his contributions to our company and stockholders are too long to list. moreover, you won't find a person in business with more integrity, character and a genuine commitment to serve our company, customers, employees and communities than bob. on behalf of the board and all of our employees, we wish him the very best.
with that, i'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of richard sunderland with jpmorgan. sir, your line is open.
richard wallace sunderland -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
hi good morning. thanks for taking my question today. turning to the california grc. just curious if you could speak more to the guardrails on the supply in rates, thinking about kind of the range of outcomes possible. is this something we should think about in terms of resetting supply mix to more recent trends? or are there other ways to address the volatility and recent low supply that you've been realizing?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, richard. i'll start, and then i'll see if my colleagues have anything to add. richard, really, the timing is ideal from that standpoint. obviously, we are just about to start our -- the actual hearings in our california general rate case. and with the experience of the last two years, it will be very compelling evidence to support our proposal to reduce the mix of company-owned surface water supply in our overall cost structure. so we have put together, i think, a very dynamic presentation for the commission and the public advocate staff to review. it shows a significant decrease in the surface water -- company-owned surface water benefit within the rate design, and so we'll have to get into hearings and support that. but clearly, the last two years provide real-time evidence that a reduction in that mix is called for. so -- and of course, with the state's overall situation, where 95% of the state is in anywhere from a moderate to an extreme drought condition, i think it provides further support for making that adjustment. conversely, i'm really pleased with the balance of our supply situation. the groundwater table is strong, and there is no indication there that we would need to ask for mandatory considerations. so we have the water, but just in our purchased water and our well portfolio -- groundwater supply portfolio. andy or jim, anything to add to that?
andrew r. gere -- president and chief operating officer
i think the only thing i would -- excuse me, go ahead, jim.
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
no, go ahead, andy.
andrew r. gere -- president and chief operating officer
the only thing i would add is, when we see a return to wetter weather with our upgraded treatment plant, we're poised to capture sort of a larger fraction of what hits the ground because of our advanced treatment capability. so we think, in the long run, that investment is going to pay off, but right now, we're working toward those lower forecasts.
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
and then lastly, richard, the only thing i would say is that we are also about to begin the process for our cost of capital proceeding. and certainly, in our request for our authorized roe, we have highlighted the incremental risk that the element of surface water has within our surface water supply.
richard wallace sunderland -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
great. i appreciate the color there. just actually following up real quick on the cost of capital point. so this sort of volatility from supply is -- gets inherent in the rate structure, and as you pointed out, is something you intend to highlight within the parameters of cost of capital. do you have any sense on how that has played out in prior cost of capital proceedings, particularly the last round versus making the argument now is certainly, the recent history has highlighted this more so over the past two years. so it seems front of mind, but just curious if you can provide any high-level color on prior conversations here.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, i'd be happy to do that. jim, why don't you start, and then i'll supplement your answer there.
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
perfect. so richard, what's kind of interesting is, if you take a look at the cost of the water supply, the cost to replace the surface water. it's gone up significantly over the past five to 10 years. and it's only been in the recent four or 5-year period where we've seen some significant variations in terms of the cost of our water supply as a result of that and the precipitation variances that we've seen coming out of the watershed. so it's really come to the forefront now. we've not included water supply in the past, to my knowledge, as an influencer, if you will, on our requested roe, but we certainly are discussing doing so in this upcoming proceeding.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. spot on, jim. i don't have anything to add to that. thank you, richard. any other questions from you?
richard wallace sunderland -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
no, that's great. thank you very much for the time today.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of angie storozynski from seaport global. ma'am your line is open.
agnieszka anna storozynski -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
thank you, so -- ok. i mean, the guidance looks bad even against, i think, low expectations. and i understand the incremental cost for purchased water. so i'm just wondering if there are any credit implications that you might see this year on the back of those low earnings and the low cash flows that you expect?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
angie, thanks for the question. jim?
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. angie, i don't think so. i believe that most of our creditors look at the company's ability to go in and recalibrate within a 3-year period within a rate case. and i think they'll understand that we're at the forefront of our next rate case and have an opportunity to address the situation as we go in. i would expect there to be more of a long view in that regard as opposed to just what has happened this and in the prior year.
agnieszka anna storozynski -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
okay. and then looking at year-over-year changes in usage patterns, i mean, i understand that covid-related restrictions are sort of subsiding or so, we hope. but are you still seeing the elevated residential usage? and is that help that you gave had, especially in the third and fourth quarter of last year? did you embed it in your guidance for '21?
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
so eric, i'll take that. so angie, if you take a look at the real weather influence in 2020, that's where we benefited significantly. there was more of an offset, if you will, last year with regards to covid between our usage at the residential level and our usage in business in terms of a drop-off in business and an increase in residential. we're actually starting to see business return a little bit, which was very encouraging, especially in california where we don't have any decoupling mechanism in place. and so when we set the guidance, we set it assuming a -- somewhat of a return to normal usage through a balance between what we will experience in our residential and what we would experience in our business usage customer -- customers.
agnieszka anna storozynski -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
so what happens -- i'm debating this myself. so if there are any sort of local restrictions or conservation calls given how dry it is, especially in northern california, how would that impact that range? and again, i appreciate the fact that the hotter than normal weather helped to drive the, i forget, $0.10 or $0.15 variance last year versus your guidance. and i'm just basically wondering if conservation were to be imposed, if it's actually -- if it could actually go the other way?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll take that first, jim. so the very conditions that have reduced our surface water benefit can drive higher sales, right? so if we continue to have above-average temperatures through the year and no additional rainfall, it's reasonable to expect that we'll see some increased usage across the state of california and through our service territory. if no drought is declared with attendant mandatory conservation, then i would expect to see our sales and production levels increase accordingly. if a drought is declared and there is mandatory conservation required, then we have protection on the downside through the wcma application with the california puc. but we wouldn't enjoy additional upside if customers complied with that request. so i think those are kind of the railings, if you will, angie, that i see.
agnieszka anna storozynski -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
okay. and then lastly, the pending grc. so you haven't changed your expected production -- self-production volumes, right? that 1.8 billion gallons still stands, which is obviously meaningfully higher than what you realized in 2020, and what you will realize in 2021. so why you should basically attempt to modify that expectation going forward? and i understand that these are two particularly dry years. but again, i mean, you have a chance to, in a sense, protect yourself in this filing, against similar outcomes from an earnings perspective as we see now in two years in a row.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. of course, remember, the case was filed back in december and january, so before the end of this rainy season. so we will have the opportunity to update our evidence and have discussions with the public advocate and with the commission and put forth the strongest case, supported by not just one years of experience, but you do to maintain some credibility here. you have to look back over a reasonable period of time as well. so we're going to do all that we can to make sure that we balance the risk and the benefits here because surface water can be a substantial benefit as we saw as recently as 2019, where we had over five billion gallons of water that we could use. and so we want to balance the risk and the benefit here and put forth a strong case to do that. so we're updating our information, angie.
agnieszka anna storozynski -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
okay. and lastly is -- i mean, i know that the connecticut rate case is still pending, but is there any comments you can offer to potential settlements, contentious points thus far in the process?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we've recently completed the first round of hearings over there. our team reported that -- felt like that process went well that there was a real interest on all -- by all parties to make sure that they understood the facts and the evidence and the like. there wasn't any tone or tenor that caused us any concern. i'd say, the big discussion is on the cost of capital that's -- it's been quite some time since our last rate case there. and so my understanding, there was a considerable amount of time spent on that testimony from our witness as well as from the consumer counsels witness. so -- but i wouldn't describe it as contentious, it was just a lot of attention paid to that particular point.
agnieszka anna storozynski -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
and i'm sorry, i forgot to ask about the cost of capital in california, given the upcoming filing. so given the experience of the last two years, will you try to ask for some sort of an roe adder, given the volatility in earnings you're experiencing for san jose water?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. we're discussing that. we haven't filed our information yet, of course. and -- but i think we can make a clear case for -- as a result of that volatility that, that needs to be addressed in our cost of capital. so we're planning a multipronged approach here in our general rate case and our cost of capital proceeding and as well working with our wholesaler and the like to address this issue.
agnieszka anna storozynski -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
great, thank you!
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, angie.
operator
thank you, our next question comes from the line of hasan doza from water asset management. sir, your line is open.
hasan doza -- water asset management, llc -- analyst
hi, good morning gentlemen. i just wanted to understand a couple of your underlying assumptions a little better. first, on the total water available. last year, you mentioned that the total water available in your california watershed was between one billion to 1.2 billion gallons. that was last year. so my first question is, how much in billions of gallons do you have right now in your watershed absent any additional rainfall?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. andy, you want to provide that?
andrew r. gere -- president and chief operating officer
yes, i'd be happy to. unfortunately, we have very little impounded. outside of some environmental pools we need to maintain for wildlife, we have about 150 million gallons available to treat.
hasan doza -- water asset management, llc -- analyst
so -- and what is the -- then what is the current surface water level at lake elsman roughly?
andrew r. gere -- president and chief operating officer
so it's about double that. so we need to leave an environmental pool of about 150 million. so we have just under 300 million gallons in the reservoir at this time.
hasan doza -- water asset management, llc -- analyst
got it. so basically, essentially, it's 0. so you'll be essentially buying what -- historically, what you had from lake elsman into purchased water. and i just wanted to find out because last year, i think you gave very specific amount of water you'd be buying. so in terms of billions of gallons, how much purchase water do you assume you will be buying in 2021 in billions of gallons?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
jim, do you have that information or at least, the incremental portion over -- yes, the surface water benefit?
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i'll take that, eric. so effectively, we had baked in about 2.5 billion gallons to our original thought process as we were looking at 2021, which is in line with what was in our rate case as well as closer to the average over an extended period. so we -- for the year, we'll be buying incrementally about two billion gallons.
hasan doza -- water asset management, llc -- analyst
so in total, you'll be buying like 4.5 billion gallons of purchased water?
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, again, we purchased a lot of water from the santa clara valley water district. and i believe about 50% thereabouts of our total supplies are purchased and 40% are pumped, from which we pay a pump tax. so all we're really talking about right here, hasan, is the incremental piece.
hasan doza -- water asset management, llc -- analyst
yes, that's what i mean. the water that you're not getting from lake elsman, you were buying. and i just wanted to understand, is that incremental purchase? is that basically 4.5 billion gallons? or is that a different number?
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
no. it would be two billion gallons.
hasan doza -- water asset management, llc -- analyst
two billion gallons. okay. and jim, a follow-up question for you on the tax rate. in terms of the tax rate for q2 and remainder of the year, do you -- should we assume a more normalized tax rate? how do you kind of think about that?
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i would assume a more normalized tax rate. we typically -- in the first quarter, that's our lowest income-producing quarter. and at the same time, it's when we are able to recognize tax credits, for example, for equity awards that are issued in the first quarter related to the prior year. and so there is this kind of a disproportionate amount of tax credits that we received in that quarter. it will average out over the remainder of the year toward a more normal rate.
hasan doza -- water asset management, llc -- analyst
okay. and i just wanted to ask one closing question for eric in connecticut. eric, given your background in the state, i'm sure you saw late yesterday the connecticut commission on a different proceeding, connecticut light and power, dealing with the hurricanes in that state, lowered the roe on a cumulative basis for connecticut light and power by about 90 basis points. so i just wanted to get your thoughts in terms of the risk on the roe in your rate case, given now that the connecticut light and power roe is closer to 8.3%. so how do you kind of think about the risk in the roe in connecticut in light of yesterday's ruling?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, hassan. yes, i would completely decouple the events. the issue involving the electric utility you mentioned, i can recall four incidents in my time associated with connecticut, where our operations were without power, some for as long as a week or more. and so my read of that situation was that pura had, had enough and decided to implement a penalty on the roe or increase it. and also, if you look back the track record with roes for water has been higher than the electrics. and i believe that, that is rooted in the view that water utilities are more of an environmental utility and that attracting and supporting capital investment in water is very important and is part of protecting and preserving that natural resource. so if anything, i feel like the connecticut regulators really understand the primacy of drinking water investments. thanks, hasan, for your questions today.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jonathan reeder from wells fargo. sir, your line is open.
jonathan garrett reeder -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
hey, good morning. a lot of my questions have kind of been asked. if i can just take the previous discussion a step further, trying to reconcile the guidance with what it would have looked like had you had that 2.5 billion. so jim, you said two billion of incremental purchased water, and that $4.2 million cost per billion gallons. what kind of tax rate should we, i guess, kind of be applying to that?
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i think our tax rate is typically between 15% and 20%, depending upon the discrete items that we are able to work through the tax provision in any one year. so i would focus on a range within that span.
jonathan garrett reeder -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
okay. all right. that's helpful. and then i may have missed -- you specifically addressing it earlier in the q&a, but any sense how you request to lower the 2.5 billion gallons of surface water, and pending grc is being received by intervenors. is that 1.8 billion being viewed as reasonable? and i know you're saying that they look at more of a five to 10-year kind of window. is the 1.8 billion being viewed as reasonable? or is there pushback still to that?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i'll take that, jim. i wouldn't comment on it today, jonathan. it's very early in the process. and what i would say is, certainly, the experience in the last two years really puts an exclamation mark on it. so i feel confident that we have a very strong case for modifying significantly the surface water -- company-owned surface water benefit in our rate design. more to come.
jonathan garrett reeder -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
okay. great. and then in maine, in that rate case, if that rate smoothing tariff is adopted, will you recognize the revenue as it's collected? or would the rate increase not be flowed through the financials until after the rate decision is received in q2 2022? is that more cash flow versus an actual earnings perspective?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, jonathan. jim, you have that one?
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. jonathan, it's more a cash flow issue. it's more easing in the incremental rate increase over a period of time and lessening the shock to the rate payers there. but we would not be recognizing that as revenue until the asset is put in -- basically, the plan is put in service, and we're entitled to begin charging a higher amount for that asset.
jonathan garrett reeder -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
okay. and then last, i know we've already danced around it, but the cost of capital and water indicated, they plan to request a 10 35 and no change in their authorized capital structure in their slide deck today. any kind of preview you're willing to provide, even if it's not on the roe at least cap structure?
james patrick lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. we're still finalizing that, jonathan. so it would be a little premature for me to talk about that at this point.
jonathan garrett reeder -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
ok got it. appreciate all the details provided in the q and a. it's very helpful.

eric w. thornburg -- sjw group
thank you, jim. welcome everyone and thank you for joining us. i'm eric thornburg and it is my honor to serve as chairman, president and ceo of sjw group. coast to coast, we are seeing extreme weather play out across our service area this summer, underscoring the importance of our environment and water resources. in california, we're seeing one of the driest summers in recent memory. state and regional water supply agencies are responding with urgent calls for conservation.
it's an entirely different story across the country in connecticut. after initial concerns of drought in connecticut just a few months ago, we have since seen nearly four times the normal amount of precipitation just this month, more than 19 inches of rain has fallen in one of our communities. people there have experienced flash floods, water log basements and unusually cool temperatures. christmas day 2020 was warmer than july 3, 2021 and all of this on top of the severe deep freeze event we experienced earlier this year in our texas operation.
rate case cycles and regulatory environments are important to our business, but there is nothing more fundamental than the water cycle and the natural environment. water utilities have long understood the importance of protecting water resources and the environment. at sjw group, our vision calls for us to view our business initiatives through a lens that includes the impact of people, communities and the environment.
our commitment to be a leader across the environmental, social and governance, esg landscape, is built on our long-standing sense of purpose and our determination to be a force for good in the communities we serve and beyond. we have employee teams working together across our organization driving this vision forward. they're working with outside experts to create a comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory for our company, so we can establish clear and measurable metrics and quantify our success going forward.
enterprise environmental, health and safety programs and metrics are also being evaluated with the intent of setting national goals and adopting common compliance and reporting strategies. as we further our efforts to meet supplier diversity goals, we're also adopting esg vendor compliance strategies to promote aligned with our company's esg policies.
we are also forming innovative partnerships with community organizations in san jose. we belong to a collaborative that created a plan to protect nearly 1,000 acres of forests in the santa cruz mountains. the collaborative was awarded a $7.5 million cal fire grant to fund a plan, which is designed to protect water sources, establish fire resilient ecosystems and promote the long-term sequestration of carbon.
in connecticut, we're in discussions with six communities about the preservation of more than 100 acres of land as protected open space. additionally, we're also evaluating and identifying opportunities to partner with local communities and land conservation organizations to establish passive recreation programs on company-owned land. our commitment to the environment and communities has never been stronger.
water resources in california continue to be impacted by the lack of precipitation. on june 9, valley water, our wholesale water supplier declared a water shortage emergency and asked its retailers including san jose water to reduce consumption by 15% compared to 2019 usage. on june 18, we asked the california public utilities commission or cpuc to activate stage 3 of our water shortage contingency plan, which calls for 15% mandatory conservation. the approval for this filing is pending the completion of customer noticing.
our current conservation program is focused on outdoor water use, which typically accounts for half of our residential customers consumption. in a related filing, we also requested the authorization to reestablish memorandum accounts to provide regulatory treatment to respond to the drought emergency. last week, the cpuc approved our request to establish the water conservation memorandum account, wcma to track the revenue impact of authorized versus actual water consumption while we have requested customers to conserve.
a water conservation expense memorandum account or wcema was also authorized to track the incremental expenses required to implement our mandatory water conservation plan. importantly, both memorandum accounts allow for potential future recovery of the revenue and expense impacts. san jose water has actively promoted water conservation for decades and continues to encourage our customers to conserve and use water wisely at all times. from complementary customer water efficiency visits, water wise gardening information, conservation tips, as well as rebates and incentives, we offer a comprehensive program to assist customers with their efforts.
we're also strongly committed to doing what we can to reduce water loss on our side through timely leak repairs and the deployment of innovative technology such as acoustic sensors and our zero waste discharge flushing truck. while we hope for improving water supply conditions in 2022, we are evaluating ways to further encourage mandatory water conservation, which could include surcharges should the water shortage emergency persist.
in connecticut, we are pleased that the public utilities regulatory authority or pura approved our request for conservation rate design. connecticut water will now be able to encourage conservation by charging a higher tariffs for water when residential customers use more than an average of 200 gallons per day. consumption above that amount is typically related to outdoor use. pura also approved our request for a water rate assistance program or rep for income eligible customers. it still provides for a 15% reduction on the water bill for qualifying customers. we believe that this -- we believe this to be the first program of its kind in connecticut and is a great addition to the financial assistance tools already available to our customers. we are working locally and within the industry to engage with administering agencies on the low income household water assistance program. more than $1.1 billion federal will be available to states to pay water and wastewater bills on behalf of low-income residents. we are closely monitoring these efforts and are working to make sure that our customers in all four states can benefit from the program.
i'll now turn the call over to jim, who will review our second quarter and year-to-date financial results. after jim's remarks, i will address other regulatory and business matters. jim.
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer & treasurer
thank you, eric. our quarterly operating results benefited from increases in customer usage in california and texas and authorized rate increases in each of our four operating utilities. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the availability of surface water supplies in our california service area due to the continued dry weather conditions, eric mentioned. in the second quarter, we also recognized a purchase price holdback from the 2017 sale of our texas water alliance or twa subsidiary to the guadalupe blanco river authority or gbra.
second quarter revenue was $152 million, a $5 million or 3.4% increase over reported second quarter 2020 revenue of $147.2 million. net income for the second quarter was $20.8 million or $0.69 per diluted share. this compares with $19.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020. diluted earnings per share for the quarter is primarily driven by cumulative rate increases of $0.14 per share, $0.11 per share due to release of the $3 million twa purchase price holdback and increased usage of $0.05 per share. these increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative and general expenses of $0.15 per share, a decrease in california surface water production of $0.07 per share and increased production costs of $0.07 per share due to higher customer usage.
turning to our comparative analysis for the quarter, the $5 million increase in revenue was primarily due to $3.6 million in cumulative rate increases, 1.3 million in increased customer usage and $0.7 million from new customers. water production expense increased $2.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. the expense increase includes $1.9 million for the purchase of additional water supply necessary to replace the low volume of california surface water and $1.8 million due to higher customer usage.
these increases were partially offset by a $700,000 decrease in lower average unit water production costs. as stated in our first quarter earnings call, in 2021, we anticipated producing 2.5 billion gallons of surface water from our california watershed, which is representative of our 10-year average surface water production and consistent with the volume authorized in our 2019 california general rate case.
for the first half of 2021, we experienced minimal rainfall and produced less than 260 million gallons of surface water. absent additional rainfall, we don't anticipate any additional surface water production in 2021. the incremental cost to supplement this shortfall was approximately $4.6 million per billion gallons. this replacement cost estimate includes the 9.1% july 1 rate increase implemented by valley water.
other operating expenses increased $5.6 million during the second quarter, primarily due to a $3.6 million increase in general and administrative expenses, a $1.3 million increase in higher maintenance expenses and depreciation expense of $800,000. the increase in administrative and general expenses was primarily due to one-time expenses related to our general rate case and cost of capital, regulatory proceedings, compensation and accounts receivable activity offset by lower accounting fees.
other income includes the $3 million purchase price holdback received from cbre in the 2021 second quarter upon satisfaction of remaining conditions on the company's 2017 sale of twa. no similar transaction occurred in 2020. the effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 14% compared to 18% for the second quarter of 2020. the effective tax rate decrease was primarily due to flow through tax benefits.
turning to the first six months of 2021, revenue was $267 million, a 2% increase over the same period last year. net income for the first six months of 2021 was $23.4 million or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to $22.1 million or $0.07 per diluted share during the same period a year ago. diluted earnings per share for the year was primarily due to rate increases that contributed $0.23 per share, the twa purchase price holdback that contributed $0.11 per share, non-regulated income of $0.06 per share and tax benefits that contributed $0.05 per share.
these increases were partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses of $0.11 per share, a decrease in california surface water production of $0.10 per share, an increased depreciation expense of $0.10 per share and a decreased production cost of $0.06 per share due to lower customer usage.
our 2021 year-to-date increase in revenue was primarily due to $6.4 million in cumulative rate increases and $1.1 million from new customers. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in customer usage of $1.5 million, winter storm customer credits in our texas service area of $800,000 and a decrease in the recognition of certain regulatory mechanisms in connecticut and maine of $800,000. water production expenses increased $2.6 million in the first half of 2021. the increase was primarily due to $2.7 million from decreased surface water in california and $1.7 million in higher customer usage.
these increases were partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in lower average per unit water supply costs. other operating expenses increased $7.2 million in the first half of 2021, primarily due to a $2.8 million increase in depreciation expense, $2.8 million in higher general and administrative expenses and $1.4 million in higher maintenance expenses. first half 2021 other income and expense included the twa holdback, which i previously discussed.
turning to our capital expenditure program, we added $53.4 million in company-funded utility plant in the second quarter of 2021, bringing total funded additions for the first half of the year to a $100.1 million. we are on track to add approximately $239 million to utility plant in 2021, consistent with our 2021 construction budget.
our first half 2021 cash flows from operation increased approximately $34.8 million over the same period in 2020. the increase was primarily due to an increase in collections from accounts receivable and accrued unbilled utility revenue of $15.3 million, payments of amounts previously invoiced and accrued of $7.3 million and an increase due to net changes in balancing and memorandum accounts of $5.7 million.
in addition, we made an upfront payment of $5 million in the prior year in connection with our city of cupertino service concession agreement that did not recur in the current year and general working capital and net income adjusted for non-cash items increased $1.5 million. at the end of the quarter, we had $121.5 million available on our bank lines of credit for short-term financing of utility plant additions and operating activities. the average borrowing rate on the line of credit advances during the first six months of 2021 was approximately 1.39%.
with that, i will stop and turn the call back over to eric.
eric w. thornburg -- sjw group
thank you, jim. sjw group continues to execute on our core growth strategy of investing in high-quality water systems to provide safe and reliable water service to customers and communities, and earning a fair return on those investments. as jim just mentioned, we've already invested approximately 42% of our planned 2021 capital spending through the end of the second quarter. our cost of capital application was filed in california in may as required. we're seeking a modest revenue increase of $6.4 million. the application also includes an increase in the return on equity from our currently authorized 8.9% to 10.3%, an increase in the equity portion of our capital structure and the proposed decrease in our cost of debt.
the cpuc see continues to process our 2022 to 2024 general rate case application that requests a $435 million capital program and $88 million increase in revenues over three years. a final decision is now expected in the second quarter of 2022. we plan to file for interim rates that would be in place on january 1, 2022 until the final decision on the grc is issued.
in june, san jose water and the public advocate's office filed a joint settlement agreement with the cpuc on our application to deploy advanced metering infrastructure. if approved by the cpuc, we anticipate a capital program of approximately $100 million spread over the next four years. a decision is expected in the fourth quarter. the california commission also authorized a revenue increase of $17.3 million effective on july 1, 2021 to recover our wholesaler's water rate increase of 9.1%.
about 48 hours ago, the connecticut pura approved an increase of $5.2 million in annual revenues, which is an increase of about 5.1%. based on the tone and tenor of the proceedings and the recommendations of the office of consumer counsel, we had anticipated a decision more in line with the typical regulatory outcomes in connecticut. we're still reviewing and evaluating the decision. as part of that review, we are assessing options for further consideration of a few tax-related items in the case.
in addition, we will pursue a regulatory strategy for timely recovery of additional water infrastructure and conservation adjustment or wica eligible plant that was not recovered in this case. the $40 million in capital investments that were removed from this case were done so on the basis of timing, not prudence. over half of the capital projects not included in rates, as part of this decision, are wica eligible projects scheduled to be completed before year-end 2021.
the resetting of the wica surcharge to zero will allow us to recover these investments in upcoming filings. our next wica filing is planned now for october 2021 and is expected to include approximately $18 million of completed projects. based on that timing, we would expect the approved surcharge to be effective in january 2022. the statute allows for filings every six months, up to a 5% increase in the annual surcharge with a 10% cap between general rate cases. through the water revenue adjustment mechanism in connecticut or wram, we are confident that we will realize the full revenues authorized in this case and subsequent wica surcharges.
there are other aspects of the decision that were favorable and significant such as the authorization of the capital structure, consisting of 53% equity. in addition, over a decade of capital investments were approved, including a number of important environmental projects such as a significant solar installation and the deployment of acoustic leak detection sensors across select distribution systems. the commission also approved our conservation rates, affirmed some of the benefits of the merger, commended us for proposing our water rate assistance program and was complementary of our operations and service.
taking into account the current decision, our forecasted earnings remain within our guidance of $1.85 to $2.05 per share, but are trending toward the lower half of the range. there has been significant progress on both the construction and the regulatory treatment for maine water's $60 million water treatment project. the new facility along the saco river will replace its 1884 vintage drinking water treatment plant.
on june 23, maine water received approval from the maine public utilities commission for its innovative rate smoothing mechanism for the biddeford & saco division that was effective on july 1. the rsm provides for a graduated transition to higher rates, helping to mitigate customer rate shock for this significant generational investment. customers will pay a surcharge in year one with those payments funding a regulatory liability account, which will later be used to provide credits to customer bills to mitigate the impacts and the full rate increase when the plant is completed and in service in 2022. consistent with the original filing in march 2021, the team is now updating its general rate case filing to recover in base rates all investment and costs associated with the new facility with new rates expected to start in july 2022.
we continue to see robust growth at sjwtx, our texas water and wastewater utility. on june 28, an application was filed with the texas public utilities commission to acquire the kendall west and bandera east utilities, which are under common ownership. the utilities provide water service to approximately 4,000 people through 1600 service connections in bandera and medina counties. if approved by the texas commission, this would be the 14th acquisition for sjwtx since 2006. through organic growth and acquisitions, we have more than tripled the number of our service connections to over 21,000. with the addition of kendall west and bandera east, sjwtx would serve three of the five fastest growing counties in the united states, comal, hays and kendall counties.
earlier this year, sjwtx completed the clearwater estates acquisition, which was the first fair market value acquisition in texas. with a diverse portfolio of water supplies and continued additions to customer base through organic growth and acquisitions, we remain optimistic about the prospects for sjwtx and it's steadily increasing contributions to consolidated earnings.
on behalf of sjw group, i want to thank our employees for their commitment to protect public health, protect one another and deliver life-sustaining water service to families and communities through the pandemic droughts, floods and storms. our people are resilient and we have confidence that their commitment to serve will overcome current and future challenges.
i would also like to thank debra man for her service to the company, its employees and our shareholders. debra joined the sjw group board in 2016 and recently announced her retirement from board's service. i will miss her counsel and contribution to the important work of delivering life-sustaining water service to our customers and communities.
with that, i'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] you have a question from the line of jonathan reeder with wells fargo.
eric w. thornburg -- sjw group
hey, jonathan.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, eric and jim, how are you guys today.
eric w. thornburg -- sjw group
we're good. thank you. thanks for the call.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
yes. no, absolutely, i appreciate all the detail provided. i did miss your commentary just a little bit around guidance. i think you said you guys are now trending toward the lower end of the range, is that right?
eric w. thornburg -- sjw group
that's right, jonathan. with the design of the rate case, with the wica, particularly excluded the wica eligible plant, there's a few extra pennies a share there that we would have hoped to have recovered with the actual implementation of rates. so, that just pushes us out just a little bit. so, if you look at a full year of the rate case, that's going to add about $0.15 a share when you take it all in, but the additional wica will come at january 1. so, we're missing that increment for the last half of the year.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. so that's related to the connecticut rate case outcome. got you, just a point of clarification, on that guidance range, the $1.85 to $2.05, is that based on ongoing or is that just kind of a full number? so like this quarter, i think you said $0.60 ongoing, $0.69 if you include the portion of the 2017 sale gain. yes, that would be for all earnings, jonathan. we haven't made any distinguishing features of that. so, yes. okay and then lastly just wanted to say, congrats on getting the wcma approved conservation memorandum account in california. when is that effective, is that effective immediately upon approval, does it help you at all in the second half of the year having that?
eric w. thornburg -- sjw group
why don't i start and jim you can supplement this. i believe it effective july 19 forward and we will make sure that we deliver authorized revenues for the rest of the year and our authorized revenues comport nicely with the 2019 period. so, it really provides a real good solid floor, if you will, for any conservation related reductions in consumption. so, we should deliver authorized revenues. jim. yes, that's exactly right, eric. and to put a point on it, our forecast -- our earnings guidance was predicated on authorized revenue.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
got you. okay. well, i'll leave it there. that's what all i have. good luck in the second half of the year as you guys wade through the california regulatory items that are on the dock at pretty important thing. so good luck with that.
eric w. thornburg -- sjw group
thank you, jonathan. yes. we appreciate that.
operator
[operator instructions] there are no questions at this time. i'm sorry, you do have a question from richard sunderland with j.p. morgan.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. just one question from me on the connecticut puts and takes here. it sounds like with the wica availability for the capital pulled out of the rate case, you essentially will catch up in the next year, but just wanted to see if the outcome itself in some of the other considerations around the case are changing your thoughts on the regulatory strategy at all in the state going forward?
eric w. thornburg -- sjw group
yes. thank you for the question. the presiding commissioner, vice chairman. betkoski made clear from the bench there that the roe in this case was really based and reflects the current economic conditions and not a reflection on the company and we of course really appreciated that comment and what i would say is as we've looked back over the last 48 hours thinking about things that i would anticipate potentially more frequent filings in connecticut rather than waiting as long as we did. we were out 11 years and for a lot of good reasons, but i think going forward, a better strategy for us would be go in more frequently for lower amounts and just continue to add it in that regard, but the wica availability in the wram features all are very capital supportive regulatory tools and so i think the one adjustment we would make. richard, based on our current thinking would be just to go in a little bit more frequently.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. appreciate the color there. i'll leave it at that. thank you.

eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jim. welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. i'm eric thornburg, and it is my honour to serve as chairman, president and ceo of sjw group. as an essential service, we deliver life sustaining water to families and communities where we lives, work and serve, whether it would be high quality water in a glass, a robust supply at the nearby fire high grant or reliable infrastructure on main street to support economic development, water is at the heart of our communities.
delivering on our vital public mission requires our leaders and employees to maintain a laser focus on the present planned decades into the future and as the past year and a half has shown, adapt to unforeseen challenges along the way. sjw group and its employees are committed to being a positive force for good in the community, protect and improve the environment support water equity have a diverse and inclusive workplace and engage vendors and suppliers that reflect the diversity of the communities we serve.
we are able to build for the future because of our solid foundation. our employee teams are working across the country and leaning in to deliver on our commitment to be a leader across the environmental social and governance landscape. esg reflects our long-standing sense of purpose and our culture of service. to that end, we are finalizing our first enterprise wide greenhouse gas inventory, which will be the benchmark for reducing our carbon footprint.
we already have solar installations in california, connecticut and maine, and we're working toward more. one promising project would eventually allow us to meet all of the power needs of our new saco river drinking water treatment facility in maine. the grounds of the new saco river facility will also feature more than two fifty acres of protected almost open space [indecipherable] a garden.
building on our twenty twenty human rights policy, every employee in our organization is required to complete training on the policy. further, as an organization, we support water equity and believe that access to safe affordable and reliable water service is a human right. we have financial assistance programs to assist customers facing hardships and we're especially proud of our water rate assistance programs in california and connecticut that provide a fifteen percent reduction on water bills for income, eligible residential customers.
more than one point one billion dollars in federal dollars is earmarked two states to pay water and wastewater bills in arrears on behalf of low income residents through the low income household water assistance program. we are actively engaged to make sure that our customers in all four states can benefit from the program. importantly, we believe our commitment to water equity includes investing in our systems, so they can deliver reliable supply of high quality water.
our subsidiaries are making consistent incremental investments in infrastructure so that customers at all income levels will have access to the quality and reliable water service they deserve with the costs and rate impacts of those investments incurred gradually. so, they can be more easily addressed by the utility and our customers. artificially keeping rates low, by deferring investment is short sighted and not sustainable and does not really serve our customers who all deserve quality water and service for the long-term.
unfortunately, the water shortage emergency declared in june by valley water, our california water wholesaler remains in place. san jose water continues to aggressively promote water conservation to its customers in order to reach valley water stated goal of reducing water consumption by fifteen percent compared to twenty nineteen. the california public utilities commission or cpuc has approved our request to establish a water conservation memorandum account to track the revenue impact of authorized versus actual water consumption while we are promoting conservation.
a water conservation expense memorandum count was also authorized to track the incremental expenses required to implement our mandatory water conservation program. both memorandum accounts allow for the potential future recovery of the revenue and expense impacts. we continue have adequate water supply to meet the needs of our california customers. just last week, some much needed rain move through the region. we're hopeful it is an early start to the traditional rainy season in the bay area.
we are committed to strong partnerships with our communities. san jose water has been recognized by american best in business awards for the company's response to covid-19, which included donating and distributing ppe to other water utilities and community organizations. the cpuc held their nineteenth annual supplier diversity on [indecipherable] titled driving and surviving during a pandemic on october fourteenth, a full day virtual event dedicated to supplier diversity.
all cpuc commissioner were present and led a conversation on supplier diversity including a recap of california regulated utilities supplier diversity results for calendar year twenty twenty. during the meeting, san jose water was recognized by the cpuc for increasing our results from twelve point nine percent in twenty nineteen, the thirty point one percent of addressable spend in twenty twenty. sjw was also recognized as one of only ten california regulated utilities to meet the three supplier diversity subgoals for winning five percent minority fifteen percent and disabled better owned one point five percent spend.
supplier diversity is a focus of all sjw group companies and another way we're having an impact for good in our communities coast to coast. building and retaining our workforce of water professionals is also critical. earlier this month, connecticut water was recognized at the state level as a top workplace and also at the national level for culture excellence by top workplaces for our professional development program, connecticut water was one of about two fifty companies at size to be recognized nationally.
cybersecurity is critically important to our industry and the country. in august, i was honoured to represent sjw group at the white house's cybersecurity summit, along with two dozen respected academics and top executives from leading firms and banking, commerce, energy and water. it was gratifying to see that the importance of water to our national security is recognized at the highest levels of government, including president biden. attendees committed to sharing best practices and in a water space, sjw group pledge to be a resource. the smaller organizations still developing their own cybersecurity resources.
i'll now turn the call over to jim, who will review our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. and after jim's remarks, i'll address other regulatory and business matters. jim?
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, eric? our quarterly operating results benefited from authorized rate increases in each of our four operating utilities. these increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage, most notably in our california utility as a result of the drought emergency declarations, by the state governor and valley water and the decrease in the availability of surface water supplies in our california service area due to continued dry weather conditions.
in addition, we experienced higher general and administrative expenses as we near the end of the third year of our three year california rate case cycle, with new rates anticipated to go into effect in the second quarter of twenty twenty two. third quarter revenue was one hundred and sixty six point nine million dollars a one million dollars or one percent increase over reported third quarter twenty twenty revenue of one hundred and sixty five point nine million dollars.
net income for the third quarter was nineteen point one million dollars or zero point six four dollars per diluted share. this compares with twenty six point one million dollars or zero point nine one dollars per diluted share for the third quarter of twenty twenty. diluted earnings per share for the quarter was primarily driven by cumulative rate increases of zero point two nine dollars per share and decreased production expense due to lower customer usage of zero point two eight dollars per share.
these increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage of zero point four eight dollars per share, an increase in administrative and generally expenses of zero point one six dollars per share and an increase in maintenance costs of zero point zero seven dollars per share. in addition, the decrease in california surface water production resulted in a decrease of zero point zero five dollars per share.
turning to our comparative analysis for the quarter, the one million dollars increase in revenue was primarily due to seven point six million dollars and cumulative rate increases three point three million dollars in the net recognition of certain regulatory mechanisms in connecticut and maine, and one point eight million dollars in the recognition of california balancing and memorandum accounts. these increases were partially offset by twelve point nine million dollars and decreased customer usage.
water production expenses increased two point four million dollars compared to the third quarter of twenty twenty. the expense increase includes seven point eight million dollars and higher average per unit cost for purchased and ground water and one point two million dollars for the purchase of additional water supply necessary to replace the below volume of california surface water.
these increases were partially offset by seven point five million dollars in cost savings due to lower customer usage. as stated on our previous earnings call, we anticipated producing approximately two point five billion gallons of surface water from our california waters shed, which is representative of our 10-year average production and consistent with the volume authorized in our twenty nineteen california general rate case. through the first nine months of twenty twenty one we experienced minimal rainfall and produced less than two sixty million gallons of surface water. we do not anticipate any significant additional surface water production in twenty twenty one. the incremental cost to supplement this shortfall is approximately four point six million dollars per billion gallons.
other operating expenses increased six point seven million dollars during the third quarter, primarily due to a three point two million dollars increase in administrative and general expenses, one point eight million dollars in higher maintenance expenses and depreciation expense of one point four million dollars. the increase in administrative and general expenses was primarily due to regulatory proceedings in california, connecticut and maine and compensation increases. in addition, in twenty twenty administrative and general expenses benefited one point four million dollars from the adoption of a new accounting rule on the credit losses. and maintenance expenses benefited from the cost recovery of our previously reserved capital project. no similar benefits occurred in twenty twenty one.
other income in twenty twenty included a third quarter gain on the sale of real estate of one point one million dollars and no similar transaction occurred in the third quarter of twenty twenty one. the effective income tax rate for the third quarter was thirteen percent compared to fifteen percent for the third quarter of twenty twenty. the effective tax rate decrease was primarily related to flow through tax benefits.
turning to our year-to-date results, twenty twenty-one revenue was four hundred and thirty three point nine million dollars a one percent increase over the same period in twenty twenty. net income for the first nine months was forty two point five million dollars or one point, one point four three per diluted share compared to forty eight point two million dollars or a one point six eight dollars per diluted share for the same period a year ago. the change in year-to-date diluted earnings per share was primarily driven by rate increases that contributed zero point five three dollars per share, decreased production costs due to a decrease in customer usage of zero point two two dollars per share and favorable changes in balancing and memorandum accounts and other regulatory mechanisms of zero point one five dollars per share.
in addition, the twa purchase price hold contributed zero point one one dollars per share. an increase in flow through tax benefits contributed zero point one two dollars per share, and new customers contributed zero point zero eight dollars per share. these increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage of zero point five three dollars per share an increase in general and administrative expenses of zero point two nine dollars per share and an increase in average per unit water production cost of zero point two four dollars per share.
in addition, the decrease in california surface water production impacted earnings by zero point one five dollars per share. and depreciation expense increased zero point one six dollars per share, while maintenance costs also increased at zero point one two dollars per share. our twenty twenty one year-to-date increase in revenue was primarily due to fourteen million dollars in cumulative rate increases two point four million dollars in the net recognition of certain regulatory mechanisms in connecticut and maine and two million dollars from new customers.
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in customer usage of fourteen point two million dollars and winter storm credits in our texas service area of eight hundred thousand dollars. water production expense in the first nine months of twenty twenty one increased five point one million dollars. the increase was primarily due to six point three million dollars in higher average per unit cost for purchased water and ground water and three point nine million dollars from the california surface water decrease, partially offset by a five point eight million dollars savings due to lower customer usage.
other operating expenses increased thirteen point nine million dollars year-to-date, primarily due to six million dollars in higher administrative and general expenses, four point two million dollars as an increase in depreciation expense and three point three million dollars in higher maintenance expenses. the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to the same items noted in the discussion of our quarterly results. other income for the first nine months of twenty twenty one included the twa hold amount, which i discussed during the second quarter earnings call.
turning to our capital expenditure program, we added sixty nine point one million dollars in company funded utility plant in the third quarter of twenty twenty one. bringing total company funded additions for the year to one hundred and sixty nine point two million dollars we are on track to add approximately only two thirty nine million dollars in utility plant in twenty twenty one consistent with our twenty twenty one construction budget.
for the nine months ended september thirty twenty twenty one, cash flows from operations increased approximately twenty nine point seven million dollars over the same period in twenty twenty. the increase was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and accrued unbilled utility revenue collections of fourteen point eight million dollars. payments have announced previously invoiced and an accrued of seven million dollars an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items of five point four million dollars that was due to deferred income taxes, and general working capital items, which increased three million dollars.
in addition, in the prior year, we made an upfront payment of five million dollars in connection with our city of cupertino service concession agreement that did not recur in the current year. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in income tax receivable of five point five million dollars. at the end of the quarter, we had one hundred and thirty seven point nine million dollars available on our bank lines of credit for short term financing of utility plant operations and operating activities. the average borrowing rate on our line of credit advances during the first nine months of the year was approximately one point three four percent.
with that, i will stop and turn the call back over to eric.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jim. sjw group continues to execute on our core growth strategy of investing in high quality water systems to provide safe and reliable service to customers and communities and earning a fair return on those investments. we have invested seventy one percent of our planned twenty twenty-one capital spending through the end of the third quarter. our board has authorized a two twenty three million dollars capital spending plan for twenty twenty-two. nearly half is allocated to pipeline replacement projects.
california's forward looking capital spending authorization and the wica and wisc infrastructure recovery mechanisms in connecticut and maine minimize regulatory lag on these infrastructure investments. as mentioned in last quarter's call, on july twenty eight, the connecticut public utilities regulatory authority or pura approved an increase of five point two million dollars in annual revenues, which is an increase of about five point one percent.
on august eleventh, twenty twenty one, connecticut water filed a petition with pura for reconsideration of the rate case decision related to the treatment of excess accumulated deferred income taxes. pura issued a draft decision on october twenty fifth, that would allow the company to increase annual revenues by an additional one point eight million dollars from the amounts previously authorized in july. the company appreciates the time or pura commissioners and staff invested in understanding this complex tax matter and in reaching a fair draft decision.
a final decision on the matter is expected on november ten with new rates affecting as of that day. if the final decision is unchanged from the draft, the result from the general rate case will be a total increase in authorized revenues of seven million dollars or a six point eight percent increase in base rates. the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment was reset to zero as part of the july twenty eight twenty twenty one general rate case decision.
this week, connecticut water filed for a wica increase for approximately twenty two million dollars and completed wica eligible projects. many of the projects were those that were not considered by pura and the general rate case because of the deadline for capital additions. if approved as submitted, (cwc) [phonetic] expects a wica surcharge charge of two point five percent to be added to customer bills in january twenty twenty two. that would generate two point six million dollars in revenue.
between the anticipated resolution of the general rate case reconsider and the wica filing, connecticut water expected to generate revenue increases of one point eight million dollars and two point six million dollars respectively by the first quarter of twenty twenty two. the total increase including the five point two million dollars addition from the general rate case, final decision in july is nine point six million dollars in total. the combined outcome is near what was anticipated in the company's original rate case filing.
san jose water company's twenty twenty one general rate case application for new rates in twenty twenty two through twenty twenty four is pending before the cpuc. the application seeks an increase of nearly eighty eight million dollars in the revenue requirement over the three year period, authorization for a four thirty five million dollars capital budget and request to recover eighteen point five million dollars from balancing and memorandum accounts.
new rates are anticipated in the second quarter of twenty twenty two. however, the company will file for rates to be effective on january one twenty twenty two. sjw sees advanced metering infrastructure application is also pending before the cpuc. of all parties settlement agreement was submitted to the cpuc for adoption that would authorize capital investments of approximately one hundred million dollars over the next four years, with the development of ami outside of the capital budget requested in the twenty twenty one general rate case. a final decision on the settlement agreement is anticipated in first quarter of twenty twenty two.
the twenty twenty two through twenty twenty four cost of capital proceeding is also pending before the cpuc. the application requests increases in revenue and return on equity and adjustment to the proposed capital structure, and a decrease in the cost of debt. if improved new rates are expected to be effective in the second quarter of twenty twenty two. taking into account these current developments, our forecasted earnings remain within our guidance. of one point eight five to two zero five but as stated last quarter are toward the lower half of the range.
on september eighth, twenty twenty one main water company filed a supplemental application with the main public utilities commission or mpuc for the second step in the rate plan for the biddeford-saco division. main water requested a six point nine million dollars in new base revenues related to the construction of the new saco river drinking water treatment facility. this is a sixty million dollars generational investment to replace a vintage facility that has been in service since eighteen eighty four. a decision is expected in the second quarter of twenty twenty two in alignment with the completion of the new treatment facility.
beginning july one, main implemented an innovative rate smoothing mechanism authorized by the mpuc. the rates moving mechanism mitigates customer rate shop by providing a more gradual ramp to new rates driven by the completion of the saco river facility. customers will pay a surcharge until june twenty twenty two with those payments funding a regulatory liability account which will later be used to provide credits to customer bills to mitigate the impacts of the full rate increase when the plant is completed and in service in twenty twenty two.
our third and final step filing associated with the new treatment facility is expected to be filed in the second half of twenty twenty two after the plant is in service and operating costs are documented. before the end of this year, main water will file for two point four million dollars of investment recoverable through the water infrastructure surcharge. the company also expects that by march one of twenty twenty two that will have filed rate increase applications in four of its divisions.
the rate filings are a condition of settlement in the twenty nineteen tax cut and jobs act quarter. we continue to see a pipeline of growth opportunities at sjwtx, our texas water and wastewater utility. on july twenty third, sjwtx filed for authorization with the public utilities commission of texas to serve canyon lakes states which is next to its existing service area. on august eighth, the company filed a change in ownership application with the puct to acquire texas country water. a decision on that application is expected in the first quarter of twenty twenty two.
decisions on the previously filed applications to acquire the kendall west and bandera east water utilities are anticipated in our fourth quarter of twenty twenty one. combined, these pending applications would add more than one thousand five hundred service connections. sjwtx has more than tripled its customer base over the past fifteen years, and now has approximately twenty two thousand connections, providing service to about sixty five thousand people. within the company's existing service area are comal and hays counties, which are two of the four fastest growing counties in the nation. the addition of kendall west would add kendall county, another fast growing county.
sjwtx has been successful at securing water supplies and building economies of scale that enable organic growth and acquisitions. we are bullish on sjwtx and its increasing contribution to consolidated earnings. on behalf of sjw group, i want to thank all of our employees in all of our states for their commitment to protect public health, protect each other and deliver life sustaining water service, to families and communities.
with that, i would like to turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and first question comes from the line of angie storozynski from seaport. angie, your line is now open.
angie storozynski -- seaport -- analyst
thank you. so, i wanted to ask about the pending rate case in california. i heard in your prepared remarks, comments about how important upgrades. so, water systems are, which and sorry from that that there is pushback to the capex plan as you've published, we're hearing some opposition to the fixed charges that you guys have proposed in the filing. also there seems to be some pressure on allowed roes or we're about to see it in the lot of roes in the pending cost of capital proceeding. so, talk to us about, what are your expectations for the earnings power of your-of san jose water in california?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, angie. thanks for joining our call today. i appreciate your question. i'll provide my perspective and then of course, jim has anything to add jump right in. we're in the midst of actually settlement discussions with the office of public advocate. we think those discussions have been very productive and we're progressing through those, i think really well. i think we are optimistic that we'll have the majority of issues settled.
and as you know in california, the items that you don't settle in are open and subject to litigation and the actual hearing process. and so, we should know fairly shortly just how many issues would proceed on to litigation if any and i'm actually optimistic that we're going to achieve a real fair resolution for our customers and for the company. so, stay tuned, hopefully, we'll add some news in the next quarter or so.
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. and eric, the only thing i would add is on the cost of capital proceeding. there have been some procedural delays on that. so, we've not yet started down the path of processing that proceeding, but we'll certainly keep folks updated on that as we embark on that.
angie storozynski -- seaport -- analyst
okay. and now you mentioned the connecticut rate case and the twenty twenty eventual increase of nine point six million. can you remind us, what's the level which this nine point six million dollars to which the nine point six million dollars will be added still? so, what's the revenue level for connecticut water in twenty twenty one?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
jim, do you want to add, at the top your head?
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
i believe the authorized is, there about around twenty nine million dollars, i'm sorry. in revenue no, let me get that for you by angie and then i can intervene while we're answering questions.
angie storozynski -- seaport -- analyst
okay. this is, i'm trying to remember, when you guys were merging what connecticut water that is expectation in the long-term growth or earnings growth of about five percent and granted that the weather has interfered with this trajectory, but given the settlement discussion in california and the outcome of the connecticut rate case, do you see, do you continue to see this five percent earnings trajectory? i mean i'm talking about basically normalized cagr?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, has continued to remain our guidance overall that over time, that's what we'll achieve and if you think about this year, the value of having the combined company has really been evident because of the water supply challenges we've had in california, the contributions of our new england companies two earnings this year have really been important. so, our goal main goal was to provide the diversity of regulatory exposure and utilities across the country, and we feel really great about having achieved that that's been usually helpful to us here in twenty twenty one and to a great step last year as well as we navigated through the water supply challenges in california. there's nothing like a drought to sharpen the focus of all people on the importance of adequate water supply and that's true of our company employees and regulators as well. so, i remain cautiously optimistic that we're going to be in a much better place next year.
angie storozynski -- seaport -- analyst
okay. and the last point. so, i understand it's the last year of the current rate cycle in california hence some inflation and operating expenses. but we are seeing actually the opposite trend with some modern utilities given that we're in the covid environment and there's these corporate overheads, a lower interest expense is lower again, at the corporate level. so, are you not seeing similar offsets to those inflation pressures that you see for the rest of the business?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
there's certainly as you point out some synchronizing with our current rate cases, that's part of the part of the process. we're very proud of our expense control over time. connecticut water hadn't been in for rates for over a decade. and so, but when we do go in, we needed to synchronize expenses with what we would expect to see going forward and same is true in california. we've had an uptick in maintenance costs in california with the drought that's kind of a natural situation your experience angie when to get the drought and the ground gets hard and dry and starts to move a bit, we've had more main breaks than typical and that's contributed to some of the higher maintenance expenses we seen. but overall, we're really pleased with our overall cost efficiency and what we presented to the commissions. we think we compare very favorably when you look at our total o&m costs across on a per customer basis. so that's been our experience. jim, would you have anything to add to that?
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i think that's exactly right. eric, we have started to see a little bit of price increases in some of our capex spend, especially in the area of pipe and other areas where there's a little more short supply out there right now, but as it relates to our o&m expense, eric is spot on angie that revenue number is one hundred and ten million dollars.
angie storozynski -- seaport -- analyst
okay. and just last one. so, as you negotiate the settlement in california. and i know that we're not yet in the rainy season even though it seems like it is, we have started it. i mean, again, it's guess and gain probably at this point, but any sense of how your water procurement will differ-in twenty twenty two will differ from what will be reflected in your rates from the grc? i mean, we already feel like you haven't been sufficiently conservative, and you asked in the pending rate case?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
angie, i'm going to defer that answer till we complete the settlement process out of respect to it. but like, i mentioned earlier, there's nothing like a drought to really focus everybody's attention on it. and so, we're pleased that the public advocates office and our the regulatory step at cpuc recognized the issue. and so, we're all working together to make sure we do our best to address it. so, i hope we'll have some updates here in the next quarter.
angie storozynski -- seaport -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. thanks james.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, angie.
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you.
operator
next question comes from the line of jonathan reeder of wells fargo. jonathan, your line is now open.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey good morning. how are you guys doing today?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
oh good.
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
hey jonathan thanks for dialing in today.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you for asking.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks. just to build on angie's [technical issues] a little bit in the grc process, is there a statutory requirements at the 10-year average your service water production be embedded in the case? is that very much negotiable items?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
there's no statutory requirement is but the evidence is extremely important, of course that experience. and so, but there is the opportunity as well negotiate that in a settlement agreement process just as part of the overall settlement. so, there's puts and takes in any settlement negotiation of course.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay i guess maybe maybe ask slightly different or get little insight. what would the 10-year average look like? basically, rolling forward to three years including this year extremely low production. how that compares to that two point five billion dollars.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
jonathan, i don't have that just at my fingertips here, but candidly, what had been previously in rates of two point five billion dollars was pretty close to that average. as i recall, but subject to check, but of course, the last two years we'll have pulled that number down. but over time, the two point five million dollars has been a pretty good average. but if you look at the trend, it's well above the trend.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
yes that's just kind of [indecipherable] nineteen, if i recall is a really surface water for you guys and then obviously twenty twenty, twenty twenty one, those were very bad. so didn't know how that affected the early years that would be rolling off of that ten year average so, ok. on the q2 results, just to be clear, they didn't include any benefit from the wcma or the wema memo accounts approved by the cpuc is that right?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, that's right. jonathan, we have not yet met some of the accounting requirements in that regard. and so, we have not reflected any of the benefits of the two mechanisms and recall that the wcma was really effective as of august one. i think it was passed in july-mid july seventeen, but the true impact would have been measured from august first going forward.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
yes. so, based on that just for effective date is there like a retroactive when you meet those accounting requirements, are you able to extensively in q4, book it retroactively to that august first effective date then?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, we would be.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. okay. and so that's in part factored into, i guess the reiteration of the guidance range the lower half of it or whatever?
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, it is.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. okay. no, that's key to me. all that zero point two dollars delta and was kind of wondering about that. so ok, i think that's all of the questions that i have. angie asked a few of the other ones i had. so, appreciate that and good luck with the california settlement discussions.
eric w. thornburg -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey johnathan, appreciate it.
james p. lynch -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, john.

eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. i'm eric thornburg, and it is my honor to serve as chair, president and ceo of sjw group. it is my pleasure to be joined on this call by jim lynch, chief accounting officer; and andrew walters, chief financial officer. i'm pleased to report that 2021 was a strong year for sjw group.
our talented and passionate employees and leaders rose to the challenges, and positioned us well for 2022 and coming years. we were solid in the key areas of our long-term growth strategy, delivering a reliable supply of high-quality water and world-class service to customers, investing in drinking water and wastewater systems to serve customers and communities and seeking a return of and on that investment, focusing on drinking water and wastewater continuing to acquire water and wastewater utilities, maintaining constructive relationships with our stakeholders and adding shareholder value through prudent growth. in 2021, we delivered earnings of $2.03 per share, invested more than $230 million in our water and wastewater systems, successfully processed our general rate case in connecticut, obtained approval for a step 1 of a multiyear rate plan for the new water treatment facility in maine, and grew our customer base in our texas operation by 20% through acquisitions and organic growth. in january of 2022, we reached a constructive settlement agreement with the public advocates office and our california general rate case.
our success has its roots in our culture of teamwork and service, and the commitment to excellence in environmental, social and governance strategies. our teams collaborate across our national footprint and are passionate about serving customers efficiently and sustainably. we view all aspects of our operations, planning and construction through an esg lens. in 2021, we had an emphasis on supporting the drive of our people who understand our social and environmental responsibilities and wanna be a positive force for good in the communities where we live, work and serve.
we intend to emphasize this even more in 2022. our accomplishments have been recognized with prime status by iss esg. among our u.s. water utility peers, sjw group is tied for the lead in overall social score from iss, and tied for second in the overall environmental score.
the company has the best overall governance score possibly. sjw group's 2021 corporate sustainability report, which is now available on our website, demonstrates how esg is reflected throughout our organization, our diversity equity inclusion efforts are a good example. sjw group has signed on to the ceo action for diversity and inclusion. by signing on to this commitment, sjw group has pledged to take action to cultivate a workplace where diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected, and employees feel encouraged to discuss diversity and inclusion.
we embrace each person's unique background traits and personality so that they will bring their true selves to our teams. we have a commitment to supplier diversity. our efforts in california were recognized by the public utilities commission. and u.s.
veterans magazine honored sjw as one of the nation's top supplier diversity programs in 2020. with california as the model, programs have been implemented, and supplier diversity goals established for our operations in other states. sjw group also adopted a vendor code of conduct that applies our values across the supply chain. likewise, we've been committed to being responsible stewards of the environment by sustainably managing and protecting water resources, which is critical to maintaining adequate supplies of high-quality water.
we know that focusing on water resources is no longer enough. that is why we've committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, 50% by 2030 when compared with a 2019 baseline, a science-based target that aligns with the paris agreement to limit the warming of the planet. it's the right thing to do, and we will report on our progress. we are seeing extreme weather across our operations.
a year ago, our texas operation experienced ice, and prolonged temperatures below freezing causing widespread power and water outages. in connecticut this summer, we saw tropical storms and record rainfall. in california, we experienced extreme dry conditions into last fall and the early part of 2022. precipitation in california has since we saw between above average and below average.
we plan to issue 2022 guidance after the rainy season has concluded on our first quarter financial results call. there was enough precipitation in late 2021 to bring our montevina drinking water treatment facility back online in mid-december 2021. we're hopeful that california's reservoirs continue to replenish through the rainy season. our customers are still under a mandatory conservation order that requires a 15% reduction in water usage compared with 2019.
we will continue to promote water conservation aggressively in our california operations as long as necessary. water conservation memorandum and water conservation expense memorandum accounts have been established that allow for the potential future recovery of the revenue and expense impacts of such water use reductions. we offer and actively promote financial assistance programs to customers in need. our utilities work with customers experiencing onetime or ongoing financial hardships through bill forgiveness, flexible payment arrangements and in california and connecticut through our water rate assistance programs that provides a 15% reduction on water bills for income eligible customers.
sjw group is also committed to ensuring that our customers are aware of state and federal assistance programs such as the federally funded low income household water assistance program. in california, we applied for funds on behalf of our customers in need and received a check for almost $10 million from the california water and wastewater arrearage payment program that will provide immediate relief for our customers who have been in arrears. we believe that customer assistance programs and innovative rate-making are at the core of water equity. artificially keeping rates low by deferring investment is shortsighted, and it's unsustainable and does not really serve customers who all deserve quality water and service for the long term.
our subsidiaries will continue to make investments in infrastructure so that customers at all income levels will have access to the high-quality and reliable water service they deserve. through prudent planning and rate-making, such as the low income rates, the cost and rate impacts of these investments will be incurred gradually so they could be managed more easily by the utility and customers. building and retaining our workforce of water professionals is also critical. we invest in the training and development of our people so they can have rewarding careers at sjw group utilities.
they are the foundation. our success is built on. we strive to provide a safe and productive work environment, support the training and development of our teams and measure employee satisfaction and engagement through independent surveys. earlier this month, connecticut water was recognized as a top workplace in the united states, one of just 1,100 companies across the country to achieve that distinction.
i'll now turn the call over to jim, who will review our financial results. and after jim's remarks, we will address regulatory and other business matters. jim?
jim lynch -- chief accounting officer
thank you, eric. our 2021 operating results benefited from authorized rate increases in each of our four operating utilities. these increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage, most notably in our california utility as a result of the drought emergency declarations by the state governor in valley water, our local wholesale water agency, as well as a decrease in the availability of surface water supplies in our california surface area. in addition, we experienced higher general and administrative expenses, due primarily to rate case activity in three of our four water utilities, and increases in other operating costs.
also, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we benefited from property sales in california and recorded a long-lived asset impairment in texas that together provided a net benefit to our reported results. diversification, coupled with our strong local operations, and supported by our national framework, enable us to provide high-quality water and reliable water service to our customers and communities, protect our employees and deliver solid results for our shareholders. fourth quarter revenue was $139.7 million, a $4 million increase over reported fourth quarter 2020 revenue. net income for the quarter was $18 million or $0.60 per diluted share.
this compares with net income of $13.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020. diluted earnings per share for the quarter was primarily driven by cumulative rate increases of $0.34 per share, decreased production cost due to lower customer usage of $0.30 per share, the sale of nonutility property of $0.29 per share, and recognition of the impact of our california water conservation memorandum account, or our wcma, of $0.12 per share. these increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage of $0.40 per share, an increase in per unit production cost of $0.20 per share and the impairment of a long-lived asset of $0.09 per share. in addition, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $0.14 per share related to flow-through items and the impact of such items on lower fourth quarter pre-tax earnings.
no similar rate impact occurred in 2021 due to higher fourth quarter pre-tax income. turning to our comparative analysis for the quarter. the $4 million increase in revenue was primarily due to $10 million in cumulative rate increases and $3.4 million in the recognition of balancing and memorandum accounts in california, which includes $3.2 million attributable to the wcma. these increases were partially offset by a $10.5 million decrease in customer usage.
the cumulative rate increases include the impact of final decisions on our general rate case and reconsideration proceeding in connecticut, which we received at the end of july and november of 2021, respectively. while these decisions occurred later in the year than we anticipated, when coupled with our wica, or our wica filing, that was approved by pura in december of 2021. our connecticut utility will benefit from an increase in our annual revenue requirement by approximately $9.9 million beginning january of 2022. water production expense decreased $1.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
the decrease included $7.8 million due to lower customer usage partially offset by $5.3 million in higher average per unit water production cost. other operating expenses decreased $1.5 million during the quarter, primarily due to a gain on the sale of nonutility property of $7.5 million, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses of $1.6 million and the recognition of an impairment on a long-lived asset of $2.2 million. the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the cost of rate case proceedings in the three of our four operating utilities, as well as higher compensation, consulting and insurance costs. the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15%, compared to net negative 7% for the fourth quarter of 2020.
the higher effective tax rate in 2021 was primarily due to the impact of flow-through items on the change in profit before income taxes as compared to 2020. on november 17, 2021, sjw group entered into an equity distribution agreement whereby the company may offer the sale of shares of its common stock from time-to-time in at-the-market offerings. sjw group sold and issued approximately 355,000 shares of common stock with a weighted average price of $70.4 per share, and received approximately $24 million in net proceeds under the agreement in 2021. proceeds from the sale of the shares were used to finance the acquisitions of kendall west and bandera east water utilities in texas, which closed on december 17, 2021.
on december 1, 2021, san jose water company issued $50 million in its series o senior notes. the notes are unsecured, accrue interest at 3% and mature 30 years from the issue date. in addition, on december 1, connecticut water company issued $50 million of its series 2021 senior b notes. these notes are also unsecured, accrue interest at 3.10%, and mature 30 years from the issue date.
turning to our annual results. 2021 revenue was $573.7 million, a $9.2 million increase over the prior year. net income in 2021 was $60.5 million or $2.03 per diluted share, compared to $61.5 million or $2.14 per diluted share in 2020. the change in diluted earnings per share for the year was due to many of the same factors noted for the quarter.
cumulative rate increases contributed $0.86 per share, decreased production costs due to lower customer usage added $0.51 per share, and the sale of nonutility property contributed $0.28 per share. in addition, various regulatory mechanisms and balancing and memorandum accounts added $0.21 per share, and the recognition of the california wcma contributed $0.12 per share. these increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage of $0.93 per share, a production cost price increase of $0.44 per share, and an increase in administrative and general expenses of $0.25 per share. in addition, depreciation expense increased $0.20 per share.
california surface water production resulted in a decrease of $0.15 per share and the long-lived asset impairment in texas decreased earnings by $0.08 per share. the 2021 increase in revenue was primarily due to $25.2 million in cumulative rate increases, $2.5 million in the net recognition of certain regulatory mechanisms in connecticut and maine, and $3.9 million in the recognition of balancing and memorandum accounts in california, including $3.2 million attributable to the wcma, and $2.9 million in revenue from new customers. these increases were partially offset by $24.7 million in decreased customer usage. water production expenses increased $3.3 million in 2021.
the increase was primarily due to $11 million -- $11.6 million in higher average per unit water production cost, $3.9 million due to a decrease in surface water supply production, and a $1.3 million increase in california cost recovery balancing and memorandum accounts. these increases were partially offset by $13.5 million in lower customer water usage. other operating expenses increased $12.4 million in 2021, primarily due to $7.6 million in higher general and administrative expenses, $5.1 million in increased depreciation and amortization expenses, and $3.9 million in higher maintenance costs. as noted earlier, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized an impairment on a long-lived asset of $2.2 million and a gain on the sale of nonutility property of $7.5 million.
the change in other income and expense for the year was primarily the result of the $3 million twa holdback amount, which i discussed during our second quarter earnings call. turning to our capital expenditure program. we added approximately $64.1 million in company-funded utility plant in the fourth quarter of 2021, bringing total company-funded additions to $233.9 million for the year. our 2021 cash flow from operations increased approximately $26 million over the same period in 2020.
the increase was primarily due to an increase in collections of previously billed and accrued receivables of $13 million, an increase in general working capital and net income adjusted for noncash items of $6.8 million and a $5.2 million decrease in the payment of amounts previously invoiced and accrued due to lower fourth quarter activity. in addition, in 2020, we made a $5 million upfront service payment related to a concession agreement amendment that did not recur in 2021. these increases were partially offset by an increase in the crude water production costs of $4 million. at the end of 2021, we had $197 million available on our bank lines of credit for short-term financing of utility plant additions and operating activities.
the average borrowing rate on our 2021 line of credit advances was approximately 1.32%. with that, i will stop and turn the call back over to eric.
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jim. sjw group continues to deliver on our core growth strategy of investing in high-quality water systems to provide high-quality water and reliable service to customers and communities and earn a fair return on those investments. in 2022, sjw group's subsidiaries plan to invest $223 million in infrastructure improvements to serve our customers in california, connecticut, maine and texas, more than $1.3 billion in infrastructure investments as planned across the organization over the next five years. connecticut water's 2021 grc concluded in the fourth quarter in san jose water and the california public advocates office have reached a settlement agreement that was filed with the california public utilities commission last month.
andrew walters will discuss the results of the connecticut case, the highlights of the settlement agreement in california and rate cases in maine and our texas growth story and provide an update on our california water supply. andrew?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, eric. our board has authorized a $223 million capital spending plan for 2022. nearly half of it is allocated to pipeline replacement projects. the plan includes budgeted investments of $115.1 million in california, $61.4 million in connecticut, $21.8 million in maine and $24.5 million in texas.
the wica and wisc infrastructure recovery mechanisms in connecticut and maine, respectively, and california's forward-looking capital spending authorization, as well as the growth in customers in texas minimize regulatory lag on these infrastructure investments. san jose water company's 2021 grc application for new rates in 2022 through 2024 is pending before the cpuc. the application seeks an increase of nearly $88 million in the revenue requirement over the three-year period, authorization of a $435 million capital budget over the three years, and recovery of $18.5 million from balancing and memorandum accounts. sjwc filed for interim rates to be effective on january 1, 2022.
the settlement recognizes the need for continued investments in the water system to deliver high-quality and reliable service for customers and communities served. additionally, it further aligns authorized and capital -- authorized and actual consumption, particularly for business customers, addresses our water supply mix challenge and provides greater revenue recovery in the fixed charge. a final decision is anticipated in the second quarter of 2022. the 2022 through 2024 cost of capital proceeding for all class a utilities is pending before the cpuc.
the application requests an increase in revenue to support a return on equity of 10.3%, an adjustment on the proposed capital structure of 54.55% equity and 45.45% debt, partially offset by a decrease in the cost of debt to 5.48%. the decision is expected in the third quarter of 2022. san jose water's advanced metering infrastructure application is pending before the cpuc, an all-party settlement agreement was submitted to the cpuc for adoption that would authorize infrastructure investment of $100 million over four years, outside of the capital budget requested in the grc to deployment of ami. a final decision is anticipated in the second quarter of 2022.
in connecticut, the connecticut public utility regulatory authority issued a final decision in november of connecticut water company's request for reconsideration, which was the last outstanding piece of the company's 2021 grc. the final decision allows cwc to increase annual revenues by an additional $2.1 million above the $5.2 million originally authorized in the july 28, 2021 grc decision for a total of $7.3 million authorized through the grc. pura also authorized a wica of 2.44% effective on january 1, 2022. the increase was for more than 2020 -- was more than $22 million in completed wica projects, many of which were not considered by pura in the grc because of the deadline and the grc proceeding for pro forma capital additions.
the new wica is expected to generate $2.6 million in additional revenue. between july 2021 and january 22, the authorized revenue for cwc increased to $9.9 million through the grc, request for reconsideration and the wica filings. maine water company's previously received approval from the maine public utilities commission for an innovative reits moving mechanism that provides a more gradual ramp to new rates, driven by the $60 million project to replace a 138-year-old treatment plant in the biddeford/saco division. a supplemental rate application for $6.9 million is pending with the mpuc, which would be the second step in a multiyear rate plan for the project.
mwc has entered settlement discussions with the office of public advocates on this application, and a decision is expected in the second quarter of 2022. a third step filing associated with the new treatment facility is expected in the second half of 2022 following the completion of a new saco river drinking water treatment facility. maine water received mpuc approval for a 3% increase in wisc, effective january 1, 2022, for a $1.9 million infrastructure project in the skowhegan division. the company also expects that by march 1, 2022, it will have filed rate case applications in four of its divisions as required as a condition of settlement agreements for the 2019 tax cuts and jobs act order.
we continue to see a pipeline of growth opportunities at sjwtx, our texas water and wastewater utility. in the fourth quarter, sjwtx closed on the acquisition of kendall west and bandera east water and wastewater utilities. the company also closed on the acquisition of texas country water in january of 2022. combined, these completed acquisitions added nearly 1,800 service connections and expanded sjwtx's service area.
overall, the company serves more than 24,000 service connections between austin and san antonio, and three of the five fastest-growing counties in the united states, which include comal, hays and kendall counties. sjwtx has more than tripled its customer base over the past 15 years, providing service to about 70,000 people today. with a diverse portfolio of water supplies, a growing wastewater business and continued additions to the customer base through organic growth and acquisitions, we remain optimistic about the prospects for sjwtx and its increased contributions to consolidated earnings. surface water supply in california improved in the fourth quarter.
as shown on the chart, we have experienced a significant increase in levels at our elsman reservoir in the santa cruz mountains due to higher-than-average rainfall in october and december, which allowed san jose water to put montevina water treatment plant back online in mid-december, as eric mentioned earlier. the current level at elsman will support approximately 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion gallons in production during the balance of 2022. for production year to date, water produced from san jose water company's surface water supplies was approximately 350 million gallons, which was generally from runoff until recently supplemented by releases from elsman. while there has not been significant rainfall since december, the traditional rainy season continues through the end of march, which could positively impact the runoff and storage in 2022.
with that, i will turn the call back over to eric.
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
thank you, andrew. the prudent management of our business and financial resources continues to be fundamental with growth and our ability to return capital to shareholders, demonstrating the company's strong commitment to our shareholders. in january of 2022, the board authorized a 5.9% increase in sjw group's 2022 dividend to $1.44 per share as compared with the total dividends paid in 2021. we are proud to have continuously paid a dividend for over 78 years, and have increased the annual dividend in each of the last 54 years, delivering value to our shareholders.
we would like to extend a warm welcome to the california public utilities commission president alice busching reynolds and commissioner john reynolds; and to express our appreciation to outgoing commissioner martha guzman aceves and president marybel batjer for their service. we look forward to working with the new commissioners and their staff to address the water-related issues facing california's regulated water utilities. and lastly, i'm pleased to welcome becky armendariz klein to the stw group board of directors. she has an impressive background of service and extensive experience with water and utilities.
becky is the principal of an energy and water consulting company in austin and past chair of the public utilities commission of texas. with that, i would like to turn the call back to the operator for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from angie storozynski from seaport. your line is now open.
angie storozynski -- seaport global securities -- analyst
thank you. ok. so i wanted to just clarify one thing i heard from andrew about the water production volumes. the 1.3 billion gallons you mentioned, is it inclusive of the 350 million year to date you mentioned around 350 million?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
no. it's exclusive. so it does not include that. 350 million is produced and the 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion is based off the storage that you see in the chart that we presented.
angie storozynski -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok. that's great. and then, so we're waiting for the guidance to be issued on the first quarter earnings call. hopefully, by then, we will have a commission's decision on new settlement, but we won't have any visibility into the cost of capital proceeding, i guess, unless it's settled by then.
so could you give us a sense, especially given what we've heard from the consumer advocate on the cost of capital side, how that could -- what will basically translate into your future earnings power and any potential sensitivity associated with the changes in the cost of capital?
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
yeah, angie, thanks for joining us today. i appreciate your questions. i really don't have too much to add here. i don't want to speculate necessarily on the outcome.
but if you do look at our proposal that if it's approved as filed, does result in a very modest $1.50 per month per customer increase. and so, that reflects sharing the reduction in debt expenses that we've created through our innovative financing, and yet still achieving a higher authorized return on equity. so we're just going to have to play it out, and continue to put forth the best evidence that we have available to us. i don't know, andrew or jim, would you have anything to add to that?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
no. eric, that sums it up perfectly. 
jim lynch -- chief accounting officer
yeah, i think that's right. go ahead, angie.
angie storozynski -- seaport global securities -- analyst
no. please, please go ahead.
jim lynch -- chief accounting officer
no. no, no. that -- everything that eric said is -- that is our approach. we have gotten a testimony from interveners now.
so the process is moving forward, but we still got a ways to go.
angie storozynski -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok. and then, moving back to grc. again, it does seem like you would be issuing guidance before the settlement is approved. but given your current expectations of water production volumes, would you be roughly in those stated quotas that the grc includes for this year at least?
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
thanks, angie. yeah, it's -- looking at the settlement agreement itself, it reduces the amount of company-produced surface water from the 2.65 billion gallons, down to 1.8 billion. so that's a real win for customers and for the company if that is approved. it certainly is very reassuring to us that, right now, looking at the surface water picture through 2022, we're going to be right in that general vicinity as well.
so i'm really pleased for that because i think helps as well, get the settlement ultimately approved by the commission. so we should be in a pretty good place, even though we won't necessarily know if the commission has approved the settlement agreement. but we're hopeful that they will, and particularly given the strong approach taken as we work with the public advocate, i think it's a very compelling settlement for customers and for the company. so i think, it's all good.
angie storozynski -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok. and lastly, just looking at your core earnings, excluding those -- that one-off transaction that happened last year, can you give us a sense of what percentage of those ongoing earnings came from texas? like roughly?
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
jim, earnings from texas? would you want to run at that?
jim lynch -- chief accounting officer
i believe -- i would have to get back to you on that, angie. i don't have it broken down by subsidiary at this moment. so why don't i circle back with you? i know that they typically are right around 10%, but i would like to confirm that before i lock and load on it.
angie storozynski -- seaport global securities -- analyst
thank you.
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
thank you, angie.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our next question comes from jonathan reeder from wells fargo. your line is now open.
jonathan reeder -- well fargo securities -- analyst
hey, good morning, team. angie stole some of the -- a couple of my questions there. the only one that i have remaining, the cost of capital, what do you think a final decision would be realistic if it is fully litigated? just given the track record in california, the case backlog and like that.
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
yeah, jonathan, fair question. we continue to be hopeful that we'll get something by the third quarter. but we'll have to watch that. we don't control it, but we'll manage with it.
so best we can tell.
jonathan reeder -- well fargo securities -- analyst
ok. well, great luck in the months ahead as you got some very important proceedings coming to a head. so looking forward to some good outcomes. 
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
yeah, i appreciate the comment there, jonathan. i think, if you look back over the last -- this past year. we worked through very successfully navigating the majority of our regulatory calendar. so with the settlement agreement in place, we are optimistic for the grc's outcome in california, then the maine rate case looking good.
and so, just get through the cost of capital proceeding, and we'll be on our way. so appreciate your questions.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from richard sunderland from j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question today. just thinking about the 4q water backdrop in california relative to the overall water challenges in the state. could you frame a little bit of the progress made with the rainfall last quarter, and just how to think about the water -- the state's water situation in the next year or so?
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll go ahead and start on that, and i'll see if my colleagues have anything to add that i missed. well, i'll tell you what the december was really an extraordinary month of rainfall for us. you can see on the chart that andrew shared.
how that we just took off in december, and that was set up by a very favorable october where we were able to get some ground saturation in our watershed up in the mountains. so that when we had the significant precipitation levels in december, we didn't have any -- that was going to recharging the groundwater if you will. it just ran off and we were able to capture that in the reservoir. and yeah, just as strong as december was january was the opposite.
it was the -- i believe the all-time record, essentially zero precipitation in san jose in the month of january. so our joy was a little bit reduced because we thought, wow, we're really on a roll here. when you look around the state, the major reservoirs around the state definitely received some significant increases in their overall supply, and the snowpack was also quite significant. but as we move into february and march year, normally, we would expect to see even more precipitation.
so you know what, right now, i would say, thank goodness for december. it certainly relieved some of the anxiety we were all feeling around overall water supply. and -- but we're still needing a significant amount of precipitation to put this thing to an end on a statewide basis. so we're not out of the woods by any means, but we certainly got to retrieve for 2022.
andrew or jim, anything to add?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. i would just add that if you take a look at the california data exchange center under the department of water resources that gives you a good overview of where the reservoirs are, and they're still below the historic average for this date in almost all cases. so as eric highlighted, we still got some room to go in the overall state picture, but certainly relieve where our local picture goes, and that's the key about the weather patterns, and specifically our own water is it's very much a micro climate.
jim lynch -- chief accounting officer
yeah. i don't have anything else i don't have anything else to add to that. great december. it's been pretty dry since then.
we were well above average at that point and the reservoirs were lining up quite well at that point. but since then, we've kind of worked to -- below our average numbers for this time of year. so looking forward to some continued rain, potentially a miracle march, who knows. but we're sitting pretty well with regards to our own resources as we move through the year. 
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. thanks for the color, and that's all i had for that. thanks.
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
thanks, richard.

thank you. and we have a follow-up question from jonathan reeder from wells fargo. your line is open.
jonathan reeder -- well fargo securities -- analyst
just figured i would ask, anything additional kind of circulating on the m&a front, should we be expecting any future deals to be concentrated in texas? or are there some other states either existing or new that we should be looking at?
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
thanks for the follow-up. andrew, do you want to address that?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. we continue to remain focused on texas, where we have seen a good transaction activity with our two most recently announced transactions. as it relates to future activity, we remain open on finding good acquisition targets. texas will remain an area that will feature heavily in that.
but as we also look beyond texas, as those opportunities come about. we will evaluate those. and i think, the key that we always do is we focus on those acquisitions, which will be accretive to our shareholders and improve the diversification for our company and benefit our customers. so those are the things we'll continue to evaluate.
and obviously, we can't comment on things that we're specifically working on right now, but we will remain focused on the areas we have.
jonathan reeder -- well fargo securities -- analyst
great. appreciate you taking the follow-up.
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
of course. thank you, jonathan.

i will now turn the call over to eric thornburg. eric? 
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president, and chief executive officer
welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. i'm eric thornburg, and it is my honor to serve as chair, president, and ceo of sjw group. it is my pleasure to be joined on this call by jim lynch, chief accounting officer, and andrew walters, chief financial officer. after my initial remarks, jim will review our financial results for the quarter that delivered $0.12 per diluted common share compared to $0.09 in the same period last year.
andrew will then discuss our california water supply status later in the call. he will also provide an update on regulatory developments and share our financial guidance for 2022. we're fortunate to lead the employees of sjw group across all of our four states who are passionate about delivering a reliable supply of high-quality drinking water and wastewater services for the families and communities that we're privileged to serve. our people continue to deliver for customers, communities, shareholders and each other.
in early 2022, we focused on laying the groundwork to deliver our 2022 financial and esg goals successfully. some of our achievements include reaching a settlement agreement in san jose water's 2022 general rate case with the public advocates office and receiving approval from the maine public utilities commission on the settlement agreement between maine water company and the public advocates office for the biddeford-sacos division new $60 million drinking water treatment facility. through the winter months, we continued investing in drinking water infrastructure. just this week, connecticut water filed an application with the connecticut public utilities regulatory authority to begin recovery of $10 million in completed drinking water infrastructure projects.
andrew will discuss this later in detail. we strengthened governance around our esg commitments through the creation of an esg council. the council is made up of executive leaders, state presidents and senior managers representing esg initiatives within the organization. it will provide the framework for the prioritization and reporting on delivery of projects, initiatives and investments as related to environmental, social and governance initiatives and will track our progress toward established esg goals, such as our pledge to reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 using a 2019 baseline.
we will hold ourselves accountable to report on existing commitments and create meaningful new goals. our esg scores are strong. iss rates our governance at its best rating. among our water utility peers we're tied for first in social and tied for second in environment.
one example of our esg commitment is our new saco river drinking water resource center in maine. we've set aside 250 acres of land near the facility has protected open space and conducted wetland restoration on the property. agreements have been executed for the installation of a solar photovoltaic array that will offset 100% of the energy needs of the new facility. development is underway for a pollinator garden and a trail for passive recreation.
the facility itself was designed using the envision framework, a joint collaboration between the softness program for sustainable infrastructure at the harvard university graduate school of design and the institute for sustainable infrastructure. i'm also quite proud of our dei progress. we've been successful in recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce throughout the organization. of our 771 employees, approximately 35% of our employees are people of color, nearly two-thirds are under the age of 50, and women are about one-third of our total workforce.
our supplier diversity program has also taken root. building on our successful program at san jose water, our diverse spend across all four states continues to increase with more than $55 million placed with diverse suppliers in 2021, which is 21% of our addressable spend, great progress and our strong commitment to continue this important work. i'll now turn the call over to jim, who will review our financial results. jim?
james lynch -- chief financial officer
thank you, eric. our first quarter 2022 operating results reflect new revenues authorized in each of our four operating utilities, new customer growth, primarily in texas and increased customer usage when compared to the first quarter of 2021. in california, we experienced an increase in residential customer usage due to lower-than-normal precipitation coupled with warm temperatures. business usage in california was lower by 5% compared to the first quarter of 2021.
in california, we continue to follow the mandatory call for conservation declared by valley water, our wholesale water supplier for a 15% reduction in water use compared to 2019. also in the first quarter, we benefited from the recognition of a property sale, partially offset by the onetime impacts of depreciation in our california concession assets, expenses related to our 2018 billing order instituting investigation, or oii, settlement and certain deferred and acquisition-related tax expense true-ups. first quarter revenue was $124.3 million, an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2021. net income for the quarter was $3.7 million or $0.12 diluted earnings per share, which is a 43% increase over the first quarter prior year net income of $2.6 million or $0.09 diluted earnings per share.
the net change in diluted earnings per share for the quarter was primarily attributable to cumulative rate increases of $0.06 per share, new customers of $0.03 per share and increased customer usage of $0.02 per share. in addition, we recorded a nonrecurring gain on the sale of nonutility property of $0.07 per share. these increases were partially offset by an increase in production costs due primarily to unit price increases of $0.05 per share, increased depreciation of $0.05 per share and other expense items of $0.07 per share. our first quarter revenue increase was primarily the result of $5.2 million in cumulative rate increases, $2.5 million from new customers and $1.8 million increase in customer usage.
as eric mentioned, we have filed a settlement on our california general rate case. we expect to receive a decision in the third quarter of 2022. once received, we will apply the grc decision retroactively to january 1, 2022, as provided for under our approved interim rates decision. total 2022 first quarter water production costs increased $2.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2021.
the increase was primarily due to $4.5 million in higher average per unit cost for purchased water, groundwater extraction and energy charges partially offset by a $1.8 million increase in surface water supply production. andrew will talk about our surface water outlook a little later in our call. other operating expenses increased $3.3 million or 3% for the quarter, primarily due to $4.2 million in higher depreciation related to utility plant additions and our california concession assets. higher administrative and general expenses of $3.3 million, primarily due to increases in labor and pension expenses, and increases in maintenance and taxes other than income taxes, totaling $1.2 million.
these increases were partially offset by the recognition of a $5.5 million gain on the sale of nonutility property, no similar gain occurred in the first quarter of 2021. the increase in maintenance expense reflects approximately $400,000 of expenditures on projects constructed pursuant to a settlement agreement approved by the california public utilities commission on february 27, 2020, in connection with the billing practices oii issued by the cpuc in september of 2018. the settlement includes a requirement for the company to invest $5 million in utility plant that has not allowed an investment rate of return or rate recovery. the company's investment will focus primarily on ghg projects, specifically in the area of solar panel installations.
we expect to incur $2 million of additional project costs related to the oii settlement in 2022 and the remaining balance in 2023. the effective consolidated tax rates for the quarters ended march 31, 2022, and 2021 were approximately 22% and a negative 52%, respectively. the higher effective tax rate for the quarter ended march 31, 2022, was primarily due to discrete tax expense items, including a true-up of certain deferred income taxes. turning to our capital expenditure program.
we added $43.7 million in company-funded utility plant during the first quarter of 2022. this represents 20% of our total 2022 planned capital expenditures. from a financing perspective, first quarter 2022 cash flows from operations increased 36% over the first quarter of 2021. this change was primarily the result of an increase of $6.9 million in regulatory assets, primarily due to balancing the memorandum account activities.
payments of amounts previously invoiced and accrued increased $5.2 million and other changes increased a net of $2.8 million, primarily due to funds received from the state of california water and wastewater arrearages payment program. general working capital and net income adjusted for noncash items increased by $2.6 million. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in collections of accounts receivable and accrued unbilled utility revenue of $3.4 million and a decrease in the net collection of taxes receivable of $2.2 million. at the end of the first quarter, we had $184 million available on our bank credit lines for short-term financing of utility plant additions and operating activities.
the average borrowing rate on the line of credit advances during the quarter was approximately 1.64%. with that, i will stop and turn the call over to andrew.
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, jim. our board has authorized a $223 million capital spending planned for 2022. nearly half of it is allocated to pipeline replacement projects. the plan includes budgeted investments of $115.1 million in california, $61.4 million in connecticut, $21.8 million in maine, and $24.5 million in texas.
the wica and wisc infrastructure recovery mechanisms in connecticut and maine, respectively, and california's forward-looking spending authorization, as well as the growth in customers in texas minimize regulatory lag on these infrastructure investments. san jose water company's 2021 grc application for new rates in 2022 through 2024 is pending before the cpuc. sjwc and the public advocates office filed a settlement agreement resolving all issues in the proceeding on january 13, 2022, which will be considered by the cpuc for adoption. the settlement provides a revenue increase of approximately $54 million over the three-year period with an increase of approximately $25 million in 2022.
the settlement also recognizes the need for continued investments in the water system to deliver safe and reliable water service providing authorization of a three-year $350 million capital budget. additionally, it further aligns authorized and actual consumption, particularly for business customers, addresses our water supply mix volatility and provides greater revenue recovery in the fixed charge. the decision is expected in the third quarter of 2022. with interim rates in place, we will be able to apply the rate increase adopted in the commission's final decision retroactively to january 1, 2022.
the 2022 to 2024 cost of capital proceeding for the four large class a california utilities is also pending before the cpuc. the application requests an increase in revenue to support a return on equity of 10.3%, an adjustment to the proposed capital structure of 54.55% equity and 45.45% debt, partially offset by a decrease in the cost of debt to 5.48%. the decision is expected in the third quarter of 2022. san jose waters advanced metering infrastructure application is pending before the cpuc as well.
an all-party settlement agreement was submitted to the cpuc for adoption that would authorize infrastructure investments of approximately $100 million over four years, outside of the capital budget request in the grc to deploy ami. the decision is anticipated in the second quarter of 2022. in connecticut, we filed an application with the connecticut public utilities regulatory authority on april 26, 2022, requesting recovery of approximately $10 million in completed projects through the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment mechanism. if approved by pura, as proposed, the new wica would be effective on july 1, 2022, and would generate about $900,000 in annualized revenues.
in maine, on april 5, 2022, the maine public utilities commission approved a stipulated agreement between the company and the office of public advocate that recognize all project costs, set a 9.7% return on equity across all of maine waters division and a $6.3 million increase in annual revenues in the biddeford-saco division july 1, 2022. the settlement agreement was the second step in a multiyear rate plan that gradually raises rates for the new $60 million drinking water treatment facility in the biddeford-saco division. the new facility is scheduled to go online in the coming weeks and will replace a 138-year-old treatment plant. the first step of an innovative rate smoothing mechanism that was approved by the mpuc last summer, the third step and last filing associated with the new treatment facility is expected to be in the second half of 2022.
maine water received mpuc approval for a 3% increase in wisc effective january 1, 2022, for skowhegan division. in february 2022, the company filed a rate case application in four of its divisions. we continue to see a pipeline of growth opportunities in sjwtx, our texas water and wastewater utility. on january 20, 2022, sjwtx closed on the acquisition of texas country water in january 2022.
overall, the company now serves more than 24,000 service connections between austin and san antonio, and three of the five fastest-growing counties in the united states, comal, hays, and kendall counties. sjwtx has more than tripled its customer base over the past 15 years, providing service to about 70,000 people today. with a diverse portfolio of water supplies, a growing wastewater business and continued additions to the customer base through organic growth and acquisitions, we remain optimistic about the prospects for sjwtx and its increased contributions to consolidated earnings. the traditional rainy season in california has ended.
after a promising start and late fall of 2021, we experienced unusually dry weather through the rest of the season. while drought conditions persist, the current level at lake elsman with additional inflows throughout the year will likely support approximately 1.8 billion gallons in total production for 2022. as shown on this chart, lake elsman is slightly above the five-year average and significantly higher than the same period of 2020 and 2021. this should bring total surface water supply production in 2022, close to or at the volume in the grc settlement.
we are announcing 2022 guidance of $2.30 to $2.40 per diluted share. our guidance assumes cpuc approval of san jose water's general rate case settlement agreement, implementation of maine water's mpuc approved stipulation agreement for the biddeford-saco division on july 1, 2022, and completion of the four other divisional grcs in maine in 2022. finally, it also assumes an equity issuance of $30 million to $40 million in 2022. with that, i will stop and turn the call back over to eric.
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president, and chief executive officer
thank you, andrew. it's with deep appreciation and respect that sjw group bid farewell to board member katharine armstrong, following her 13 years of dedicated service to the company. since joining us in 2009, katharine has guided our investments in her beloved state of texas, as well as elevated the company's commitment to the environment and community engagement. on behalf of the board and all of our employees, we wish her the very best.
in summary, sjw remains an attractive investment with a focus on designing, building and operating high-quality regional water service platforms that we believe will sustain attractive, long-term returns for our shareholders. our investments are smart and enduring, and we are confident over the long haul that the investments we have made will contribute to growth in profitability, earnings and dividends. with that, i'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of richard sunderland with jpmorgan. your line is open.
richard sunderland -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you for the time today.
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
hi, richard. good morning.
richard sunderland -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
i wanted to unpack guidance a little bit in some of the assumptions there. and maybe starting with cost of capital, is the debt reset contemplated in guidance? and how are you treating the roe assumptions in there?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
richard, that's an excellent question. as it relates to the cost of capital, the debt reset is contemplated in the guidance because that's what we've asked for. so we don't expect to get anything more than we've asked for. as it relates to the roe, these are under ongoing discussions, so i won't comment, but we have not added anything specific to that.
richard sunderland -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. and then, thinking about some of the moving pieces on the quarter and how they relate to guidance as well. could you speak to, i guess, the gain on sale and the oii settlement expensing, if those items are in or out of guidance? and then, i guess, similarly, the onetime items called out as well in the aggregate.
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. so i'll take that, rich. and basically, the items that we have included in our guidance include all the onetime items that have been incurred up to date. they also include the oii that jim mentioned earlier in the call as well.
so it should be reflective of everything that we know of as of today.
richard sunderland -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. so that's very helpful. so just to put some numbers around this, i guess, the gain on sale is $5.5 million and then it sounds like the oii in the aggregate for '22 would be a $2.4 million offset, as well as the $0.03 of onetime items, i guess, to the positive. is that -- am i thinking through the pieces correctly? or maybe if you could just run through the math for me, that would be helpful.
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. and i might also ask jim for anything that i missed here. but first of all, starting off with the $5.4 million related to the sale that is offset by -- at least not in the earnings, i'm talking about for the guidance. there's the $2.4 million that was related to the oii, of which $400,000 was already accounted for in this first quarter.
and that $0.03, so there's a remaining $2 million to be incurred for the rest of the year and that $0.03 was the positive after the offsets for depreciation and some of the other items that jim had highlighted in his discussion earlier. i don't know, jim, if you want to comment on anything specifically to the other offsets.
james lynch -- chief financial officer
yeah, richard, this is jim lynch. so in terms of the actual quarter, there were a couple of items that were onetime in nature. one was a depreciation charge that related to our 2022 -- well, they're related to our lease concession in california. and then, another had to do with some tax true-ups that we needed to do relative to deferred taxes.
so those have been baked in both to the quarter results and the guidance that andrew was referring to earlier.
richard sunderland -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. understood. very helpful. maybe one last one from me, just around the '22 equity.
any sense on timing or how you expect to address that?
james lynch -- chief financial officer
yeah. we have the atm in place right now, and we're certainly going to look at the needs of the company and when they're kind of directing us toward that type of an issuance. but we'll also be watching the market. we want to make sure that when we do raise that equity it's at a time when the stock is performing at a high level at a comfortable level.
so we have some flexibility in terms of the timing there.
richard sunderland -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. great. i appreciate the color today. thank you.
james lynch -- chief financial officer
thank you, richard. appreciate the questions.
operator
next question comes from the line of hasan doza with water asset management. your line is now open.
hasan doza -- water asset management -- analyst
hi. good morning, gentlemen. a couple of questions. the first is, i heard your commentary about the water purchase or storage embedded in the new grc settlement.
that makes sense, the 1.8 billion gallons. that i understand. but my question is, currently, before the new grc is implemented because the decision probably comes out in the third quarter, but obviously, we are going to be in the summer beforehand. and if i'm not mistaken, currently in your rates, the amount of gallons embedded is about 2.5 billion gallons, not 1.8 billion.
so my question is, before the grc is implemented in the summer, how much water do you expect to purchase in thousands or millions of gallons relative to the existing threshold that's in your rates, which i believe is 2.5 billion gallons. that's my first question.
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
hasan, can i just make sure i understand your question and for jim too. are you asking for what next year -- next quarter's purchase of water is going to be specifically before we come to a final decision potentially by the end of the quarter?
hasan doza -- water asset management -- analyst
in the event of any delays in the cpuc, there's no guarantee that when the cpuc will have a decision. but you will be -- i mean, am i right? i mean, the cpuc decision could move one month, two-month, whatnot. what i'm trying to understand is, forget about -- forgetting about the new grc because we don't have real visibility on the timeline, that could shift. what i'm trying to understand is, based upon your available water storage, do you have a plan as to how much water you're purchasing going into the summer? that's kind of the essence of the question.
how many thousands or billions of gallons do you expect to purchase in the next three, four months going into the summer?
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president, and chief executive officer
thanks, hasan, for your question and the clarity helps. we don't forecast that. we haven't disclosed any numbers on that. but i think what's most important is that the settlement agreement includes a full cost balancing account for water supply.
and if approved, that would be retroactive as well to january 1. so we've successfully negotiated a reduction in our supply mix from the 2.5 billion of our own surface water production to the 1.8 billion, which we believe is really beneficial to our shareholders, but also to our customers because in the years in which we do have abundant rainfall and even perhaps just slightly above normal, then anything there would be a balance between shareholders and customers reflected. so we're really -- ultimately would be agnostic as to what that water supply number was as a result of the settlement. so that's the best way to think about that is that it will be reflected back to january 1.
hasan doza -- water asset management -- analyst
ok. my two remaining questions. the second one is, what is the tax rate assumed in the guidance? because i know the first quarter tax rate is a little bit hard to understand. so i'm just trying to understand kind of a normal tax rate for the year? and what's kind of embedded in the guidance? that's my second question on tax rate.
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. hasan, we typically don't necessarily forecast all the details around the tax rate because there are a lot of different moves throughout the year, but we're at 16% in our forecast for now.
hasan doza -- water asset management -- analyst
got it. and my final question, just as a follow-up to the first question where you were answering the gain on sale and the other onetime items. my quick math, as i was following your answer, it comes out to about $0.10. you have about 30 million shares outstanding, roughly speaking.
is that a fair ballpark estimates in terms of, if i add up the gain on sale of $5 million, then subtract the $2 million net oii and a couple of the other depreciation items, i get to about a $0.10 positive impact from those items. is that a fair ballpark calculation? and if not, what is the right eps estimate, specifically onetime items?
james lynch -- chief financial officer
yeah. so on the onetime items, there was also, as i mentioned, the deferred tax item that was driving the tax rate up above the 16% that andrew just mentioned to 22%. we did state, both in our earnings release and on the call this morning that the onetime items basically netted to a $0.03 delta. and that from a recurring basis, we were at a $0.09 -- as compared to $0.09 in the prior year.
also, i would remind you of the statements that we made earlier on our call that the rate case in california has not been baked into the results in the current year. so we are experiencing 2020 expenses and increases related to 2022 -- i should say, 2022 expenses and the increases related to our operations that occur in 2022 without having the income recovery from that. so that's how i'd kind of think about one where we wound up in the first quarter and what we will be looking at as we move into the second quarter.
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
and hasan, just to kind of make it very easy to think through it. if you take the $0.03 that jim talked about, and then you also talked about the ongoing $2 million from the oii, that's what you would look at from what's been done to what's included in the -- in our guidance. so all the onetime items are already included, plus an additional $2 million is included for the oii.
hasan doza -- water asset management -- analyst
ok. thank you, everyone. appreciate it.
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
you're welcome. thank you, hasan.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from jonathan reeder with wells fargo. your line is open.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. i guess i'll try to ask hasan's last question just a little differently. what would the $230 million to $240 million guidance range be if you just exclude all the onetime items that are known and/or anticipated throughout the year?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
go ahead, jim.
james lynch -- chief financial officer
i would suggest that you would take the $0.03 a way to get it to the $0.09 for the quarter. if you take a look at for the year, you would add back the $2.4 million on the oii cost of capital. so that would be adding back an additional roughly -- i'm going to say it's $0.03 for ease of discussion. so it would be right about -- right around the $243 million, $244 million, $245 million range, on the upper range and the same on the lower range at roughly $0.03 to $0.04.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and then, i guess, i'm confused. the $5.5 million gain, like how does that translate into only $0.07? like that's $0.18 on a pre-tax basis, i believe.
james lynch -- chief financial officer
yeah. so in that particular part of the discussion, we're referring to a comparison between the prior year and the current year. and that comparison is done on an earnings per share basis. so recall that we had a pretty big swing in taxes.
and so, that's showing what the actual tax impact was to that $0.14 to $0.15 pre-tax per share gain. or item, i should say, not gain -- or gain.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and then, i guess, last question, i guess. i think you kind of already answered this, but the $0.09 from continuing ops, that doesn't reflect any assumed benefit from the pending grc settlement right?
james lynch -- chief financial officer
that's correct.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. any way to tell us how much that would have added if we would assume that's in there, or?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. it's a great question. if you look at it, the -- it obviously depends on the allocation through the year, but i would add from a revenue perspective, approximately $4 million. the key to focus on is you got $25 million for the year, and it's just based off the allocations.
but based on where we are, it'd be about a $4 million add.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. all right. thank you. appreciate it.
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
you bet.

eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us. i'm eric thornburg, and it is my honor to serve as chair, president and ceo of sjw group. it is my pleasure to be joined on this call by jim lynch, chief accounting officer; and andrew walters, chief financial officer. we thank our 700-plus employees for the passionate and commitment to clean drinking water and delivering world class service to customers, communities and each other.
they are the backbone of our local water and wastewater utilities. our people responded head on to the challenges of 2022 and the second quarter. drought. we're experiencing drought across all of our operations from exceptional drought in texas to extreme drought in california as well as moderate levels in connecticut and maine.
our people are managing water resources, operations and supporting customer conservation measures. they are also planning for system needs as we are all facing a warmer climate with more extreme weather events. regulatory changes and delays. revenues for the quarter were impacted as a result of a change in the approved water revenue adjustment mechanism in connecticut to update the timing of consumption, resulting in a revenue shift from the second quarter of 2022 to the second half of the year.
in california, san jose water company is expecting a decision in its 2021 california general rate case in the fourth quarter of 2022. as a settlement agreement filed with the california public utilities commission last january been approved, revenues for the quarter would have been higher. we will discuss this later in greater detail. supply chain.
we're seeing longer lead times for ordering pipe and other products necessary to invest in building and maintaining our water systems. our scale and proficiency with advanced planning and procurement are making a difference in keeping our capital spending plan on track. inflation. the water industry is seeing the impacts of inflation from fuel to labor.
our leaders are working with their teams to blunt the effects of inflation by leveraging our scale and obtaining competitive pricing on key items while scouring budgets for opportunities to absorb increased costs without compromising on water quality or service or being good stewards of the environment. and interest rates. as the financial markets are changing and interest rates rising, our finance and accounting teams have worked to secure financing at very competitive rates. our financial results in the second quarter are within our expectations, given these challenges and the lengthy general rate case and cost of capital proceedings in california.
we reaffirm our 2022 guidance of $2.30 to $2.40 per share. andrew will speak to this and regulatory matters in greater detail. now, jim lynch will discuss our financial results.
james lynch -- chief accounting officer
thank you, eric. yesterday, at the close of business, we released our second quarter 2022 operating results, reporting net income for the quarter of $11.6 million or $0.38 per diluted share on revenues of $149 million. this compares to 2021 quarterly net income of $20.8 million or $0.69 per share on revenue of $152.2 million. our quarterly operating results reflect the impact of a change at our connecticut water utility, connecticut water company, or cwc, and its approved water revenue adjustment mechanism or wra, to update the timing of consumption, resulting in a shift of $3.8 million from the second quarter of 2022 to the second half of the year.
the total 2022 authorized revenue in connecticut, including the $3.8 million second quarter shortfall will be fully recovered in 2022. in addition, our california water utility, san jose water company, or sjwc, is expecting a decision in its general rate case or its grc in the fourth quarter of 2022. in a separate proceeding, the california public utilities commission approved interim rates, allowing the company to fully recover revenues authorized in the grc proceeding retroactive to january 1, 2022. at terms of the grc settlement agreement reached with the california public advocates office, then adopted in the cpuc decision, quarterly revenues would have increased by an estimated $6 million or $7 million.
also recall that in the second quarter of 2021, the company recognized a $3 million gain on the release of a holdback on our 2017 sale of texas water alliance or twa. no similar gain was recorded in 2022. the change in diluted earnings per share for the quarter was primarily driven by cumulative rate increases of $0.27 per share, a $0.25 per share production cost savings due to lower customer usage and $0.07 per share from an increase in california surface water production. these increases were offset by production cost increases of $0.24 per share, a decrease of $0.24 per share due to lower water consumption, a $0.16 per share decrease as a result of changes in the wra in connecticut and $0.09 per share related to the twa holdback release that was recognized in the second quarter of 2021.
turning to our comparative analysis of revenue for the quarter, the $3.2 million decrease was primarily attributable to $7.5 million in cumulative water rate increases and $400,000 due to new customers, offset by a $6.6 million decrease in customer usage and a decrease of $4.6 million related to connecticut's wra mechanism. as noted during our first quarter earnings call, in california, we are operating under a mandatory call for conservation declared by valley water, our wholesale water supplier. the declaration calls for a 15% reduction in 2022 water consumption as compared to 2019. andrew will discuss the regulatory mechanisms in place to help manage the drought impact in his comments to follow.
water production expenses decreased $1.3 million compared to the second quarter of 2021. the expense decrease included $6.9 million in lower customer usage and $1.8 million due to a production increase in california surface water. these decreases were partially offset by $6.6 million in higher average per unit water cost and an $800,000 decrease in cost recovery balancing and memorandum accounts. other operating expenses increased $4.4 million during the quarter, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense of $1.7 million and a $1.9 million increase in general and administrative expenses, primarily due to increases in labor and group insurance costs.
the change in other income for the quarter reflects the 2021 $3 million twa purchase price holdback, which i discussed earlier. the effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 17% compared to 14% for the second quarter of 2021. the effective tax rate increase was primarily due to discrete tax items. turning to the first six months of 2022.
revenue was $273.3 million, a 2% increase over the same period last year. net income for the first six months of 2022 was $15.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share compared to $23.4 million or $0.79 per diluted share during the same period a year ago. our year-to-date results reflect the impact of the previously discussed change in cwc's wra to update the timing of consumption, which resulted in the shift gain of $4.6 million from 2022 year-to-date revenue to the second half of the year. again, the total authorized revenue in connecticut, including the $4.6 million year-to-date shortfall will be fully recovered in 2022.
in addition, had a decision in our california rate case been approved by the cpuc, consistent with terms of our settlement agreement with the california public advocates office, year-to-date revenues would have increased between $12 million and $13 million. also, the 2022 year-to-date results reflect a $5.5 million gain on the sale of nonutility property, whereas no similar sale occurred in 2021. in 2021, we recorded the $3 million gain on release of the twa purchase price holdback, whereas no similar release occurred in 2022. the change in diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2022 was primarily due to cumulative rate increases of $0.50 per share, a $0.28 per share in production cost savings attributable to lower usage and a nonrecurring gain on the sale of nonutility property of $0.21 per share.
in addition, the increase in california surface water production added $0.14 per share and new customers added $0.11 per share. these increases were primarily offset by production cost price increases of $0.43 per share, an increase in depreciation of $0.23 per share, a $0.21 per share decrease in the net recognition of the wra regulatory mechanism in connecticut, and a decrease of $0.19 per share in customer consumption. in addition, general and administrative expenses increased $0.14 per share and cost recovery balancing and memorandum accounts decreased $0.10 per share. lastly, the twa purchase price holdback that was discussed previously resulted in a $0.09 per share gain in 2021, as i discussed earlier.
our 2022 first half revenue increase was primarily due to $12.7 million in cumulative rate increases, $2.9 million in revenue from new customers and $754,000 in balancing and memorandum accounts changes. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the net recognition of connecticut's wra mechanism totaling $5.4 million and a decrease in customer usage of $4.8 million. water production expense increased $1.4 million in the first half of 2022. the increase in water production expenses was primarily due to $11.1 million in higher average per unit water supply cost and $1.2 million in cost recovery balancing and memorandum accounts.
these increases were partially offset by a $7.2 million decrease in customer usage and a $3.7 million increase in our california surface water production. other operating expenses increased $7.6 million in the first half of 2022, primarily due to a $5.9 million increase in depreciation expense, $5.2 million in higher general and administrative expenses, including $1.6 million related to cost recovery balancing and memorandum accounts and taxes other than income taxes, which increased by $1.2 million. in addition, in 2022, the company recorded a $5.5 million gain on the sale of a nonutility property. the change in other income and expense was primarily attributable to the twa holdback, which i discussed previously.
turning to our capital expenditure program, we added $57.9 million in company-funded utility plant in the second quarter of 2022, bringing our total company-funded additions for the first half of the year to $101.6 million. our first half cash flows from operations increased approximately $16.5 million over the same period of 2021. the increase was primarily due to an increase of $25.5 million in regulatory assets, primarily due to balancing and memorandum account activity. partially offset by a decrease in general working capital and net income and adjusted for noncash items of $5.1 million.
in addition, taxes payable increased $2.7 million and payments of amounts previously invoiced and accrued, including the crude production costs decreased by $1.2 million. at the end of the quarter, we had $118.7 million available on our bank lines of credit for short-term financing of utility plant additions and operating activities. the average borrowing rate on line of credit advances during the first six months of 2022 was approximately 1.44%. with that, i will stop and turn the call over to andrew.
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, jim. san jose water's advanced media infrastructure or ami application has been approved by the cpuc. the approval paves the way for infrastructure investments of approximately $100 million over the four years to deploy ami. ami tracks water usage and provides near real-time water usage data that will enhance customer experience and supports sjwc's commitment to preserving and protecting the environment.
this is an additional investment outside of the capital budget request in the grc. we expect the majority of the investment to occur between 2024 and 2026. the 2022 to 2024 cost of capital proceeding for the four large class a california utilities is pending before the cpuc. the decision is expected in the third quarter of 2022.
san jose water company's 2021 grc application for new rates in 2022 through 2024 is also pending before the cpuc. the settlement agreement between sjwc and the public advocates office was filed in january 2022 that solves all issues in the proceeding. if approved, the settlement provides a revenue increase of approximately $54 million over the three-year period with an increase of approximately $25 million in 2022. the settlement also recognizes the need for continued investments in the water system to deliver safe and reliable water service, providing an authorization of a three-year $350 million capital budget.
additionally, it further aligns authorized and actual consumption, particularly for business customers, addresses our water supply mix volatility and provides greater revenue recovery in the fixed charge. a decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022. with interim rates authorized, we will be able to apply the revenue adopted in the commission's final decision retroactively to january 1, 2022. sjwc received authorization effective july 1, 2022, to increase revenue requirement by approximately $25 million or roughly 6%, the majority of which related to an annual increase in purchased potable water charges.
the groundwater extraction fee and purchase recycled water charges from its whole water wholesalers and the remaining to an advice letter project. in connecticut, the public utilities regulatory authority authorized recovery of $10 million in completed projects through the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment mechanism. the increase in the wica surcharge was effective july 1, 2022. the cumulative wica is now 3.26%, which is expected to generate approximately $3.4 million in annualized revenues.
on january 8, 2022, pura approved the acquisition of the assets of the miami beach water company in old line. this is a water system for a small beach community that serves approximately 120 customers, but has an estimated capex need in the neighborhood of $6 million that will be reflected in the future capital planning for cwc. a closing on the acquisition is expected in august. as jim noted previously, revenues for connecticut water company were adjusted to reflect current consumption patterns.
the table below highlights the differences between the previous revenue allocation and the updated revenue allocation. our new $60 million saco river drinking water resource center went online in june and is now serving our customers in the bedford saco division. eric will speak more about our new facility. on july 1, 2022, new rates went into effect to support the generational investment in the water resource center, which are expected to generate annual revenues of $6.3 million.
this was the second step in a multiyear plan that gradually raises rates in the division. the first step was an innovative rate smoothing mechanism approved by the maine public utilities commission last summer, the third step and last filing to reflect the operating cost of the new treatment facility is expected to be submitted in the second half of 2022. in june, maine water filed the second half of a two-part water infrastructure charge application with the maine public utilities commission for an additional wisc increase in the skowhegan division. the first half authorized by the mpuc went into effect on january 1, 2022.
the second part is approved as filed, the wisc surcharge in skowhegan would increase by an additional $50 million. the decision is expected in q3. also pending before the mpuc our general rate cases filed in february of four main water divisions for a total of $532,000. a decision is expected in the fourth quarter.
in june, the public utilities commission of texas approved a new water pass-through charge for canyon lake service area of sjwtx subsidiary. the decision retroactive back to march 1, 2022, is expected to generate more than $400,000 in annualized revenues. sjwtx now serves more than 25,000 water and wastewater connections between austin and san antonio and has service areas in three of five fastest-growing counties in the united states. sjwtx has more than tripled its customer base in the 15 years, providing service to about 72,000 people today.
with a diverse portfolio of water supplies, a growing wastewater business and continued additions to the customer based through organic growth and acquisitions. we remain optimistic about the prospects of sjwtx and the increased contributions to consolidated earnings. drought conditions persist in california service area. the current level at lake elsman will likely support approximately 1.8 billion gallons in total production for 2022.
as shown in this chart, lake elsman is slightly below the five-year average and higher than in the same period in 2020 and 2021. this should bring total service water production in 2022, close to or equal to the volume in the grc settlement. we are reaffirming our 2022 guidance to $2.30 to $2.40 per diluted share. our guidance assumes cpuc approval of san jose water's general rate settlement agreement and contemplation of the four other divisional grcs in may in 2022.
on april 6, 2022, maine water entered into a credit agreement with a commercial bank pursuant to an existing master loan agreement under which the commercial bank issued maine water, a promissory note on the same date to an aggregate principal amount of $15 million at a fixed rate of 4.54% due may 31, 2042. proceeds from the borrowings were received on may 13, 2022 and on june 28, 2022, connecticut water entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which connecticut water sold an aggregate principal amount of $25 million, a 4.71% senior notes due december 15, 2022. the closing of the note purchase agreement is expected to occur in december 2022 and is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval. and finally, on july 14, 2022, sjwc entered into a note purchase agreement with certain affiliates of new york life, metropolitan life, northwestern mutual and john hancock.
pursuant to which the company will sell an aggregate principal amount of $70 million of its 4.85% senior notes. the closing is expected to occur in january 2023 upon satisfaction of customary closing conditions. with that, i will stop and turn the call back over to eric.
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
thank you, andrew. yesterday, we had the privilege of being in biddeford, maine to help dedicate maine water's new saco river drinking water resource center. joining us was governor janet mills, local community leaders, regulators and many other dignitaries. they reaffirm my view that investing in drinking water infrastructure is vital to customers and communities and worthy of celebration.
the new center replaced an aging facility on the bank of the saco river and i'm not exaggerating when i say aging. as the old facility went online in 1884 before electricity was available in biddeford and yet has served the community exceptionally well over the last 138 years. the new resource center is safely out of the rivers flood plain and will reliably and efficiently deliver clean water to customers and communities in the region into the next century. i'm proud of how our maine team worked with community leaders to build support for this generational investment, which has been a high priority for maine water from the day it acquired the biddeford saco water system in 2012.
due to the values of maine water and sjw group, our team viewed the project as an opportunity to be a force for good and exceed expectations. an innovative rate smoothing mechanism was created and approved by regulators that is providing a three-year ramp to new rates that supports the $60 million project. at the end of three years, customers will still only be paying about $0.01 per gallon of high-quality drinking water. sustainability and resiliency were at the forefront of the project, including relocation out of the flood plan, which is the main climate-related risk and an on-site solar array that will offset 100% of the energy needed to operate the facility.
the natural environment has been preserved and will be an educational resource featuring 257 acres of protected open space with plans for hiking trails, establishment of a pollinator garden and the restoration of wetlands areas. the efforts of maine water and its project partners were recognized by the institute for sustainable infrastructure with an envisioned silver award, the first awarded to a project of this kind in the new england region. i'm proud of what our people have accomplished and their commitment to our core values of service, in the communities where we live, work and serve. our environmental, social and governance or esg scores continue to be strong.
we are at or near the top of the iss esg ratings among water utility industry peers. in addition, sjw group has the distinction of having a gender balance board, an achievement that can be made by just 9% of the companies in the russell 3000. with that, i will turn the call back over to the operator.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from richard sunderland. your line is open.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for the time today. 
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
hey. hi, rich. thanks for checking us in today.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
let's see the california cost of capital proceeding, could you just walk through functionally how you true up cost of debt? and that is, is that already filed in the proceeding? or is there were a true-up when the final order comes out? also curious if you have any thoughts on just sort of the direction of interest rates here and how that could feed into roes?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
hi, rich. this is andrew. excellent question. a couple of things that i'll highlight.
so once approved, the cost of debt will be part of the overall cost of capital, and it would be theoretically reduced at that time. the question that we have to understand before us is really when the timing of that will happen, whether that will be the timing of the decision or at some point earlier. so in terms of the interest rates and how that impacts the roe, certainly, if anybody is listening and looking on around them at what is happening with interest rates, you would expect that there should be some additional thoughts that would go into your thinking on how you would address roes for utilities that are needing to fund their investments, compete for capital in the market, as well as, quite frankly, cover the cost of inflation in their existing systems. so how that gets baked in at this stage, it is part of the process, and we're hopeful that the cpuc will take those factors into account in their final decision.
does that answer your question?
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
no, that's great. appreciate the comments there. sticking with california, the grc tracking 4q now, do you have any insight into the timing change and just how the process is in form 4q versus 3q prior?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, it's a great question. our understanding is this really relates to the workload of the -- our partners at the cpuc. and so there's simply a delay due to that workload.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's easy enough. and one more from me while i'm here. the inflation backdrop, just curious if you could speak to any cost pressures you're seeing this year? and then, i guess, particularly with the rate activity, how that might flow through the various rate proceedings on a go-forward basis?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. so a couple of items to keep in mind. so for the historic test year states, there is no adjustment in those cost factors. and so that covers maine, texas, and connecticut.
texas, we're lucky to have sufficient growth that will continue to help us not only offset the cost increases, but also to provide growth in earnings per share. as it relates to california, the first phase is obviously to get the rate case approved. in the forward-looking years following that, there are adjustments that are provided by california for expenses, and those rates are to be determined, but they are tracking various indexes and it's not uniform rate, but the point is that it does give us an offset to the expense increases that we're currently experiencing. so as you kind of think about it from an overall perspective, we are absolutely experiencing expense impacts in our business.
certainly, labor will be a place that has -- we've already seen impacts in that area, and we'll expect to continue to see impacts in that. as well as some of the expenses that are related to or associated with any of the energy volatility and then also metal. and that's really been driven. so pig iron in ukraine has also driven expense increases in the pipe, but that probably is more related to our capex as it is to our o&m expenses.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thanks for the time today.
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from angie storozynski of seaport research. your line is open.
angie storozynski -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah. thank you. so andrew, just one follow-up on the cost of capital. so what's the status? i mean, i saw that all of the water utilities asked oral arguments and that request was opposed by the interveners, but what's the status? are you going to get those oral arguments?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
no, we're not successful being able to get those oral arguments.
angie storozynski -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. and then you mentioned that it's unclear when there's going to be a true-up in the cost of debt. is this something new? because i thought that it was -- i mean, it's a 2022 cost of capital proceeding. so i mean, that's typically is retroactive to january 1, 2022, now both for the equity and the cost of debt, you know?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes, that's correct, angie. at this point, that is the typical practice is to have a true-up at the point that it's decided for the year that it's supposed to go into effect. that includes both the cost of debt as well as the cost of equity.
angie storozynski -- seaport research partners -- analyst
and so you mentioned that you're hopeful that the final decision will have in this cost of capital proceeding, will have some recognition of the current interest rate environment. so is it fair to say that this proposed decision will not reflect the current market conditions, and it will just reflect the current record in this case, i.e., that we should brace for that to post decision?
andrew walters -- chief financial officer and treasurer
i think it's early to tell kind of where that will come out. again, i wish that we would have like complete insight and be able to give you a complete view on how the thinking will be impacted. the baseline is that they are supposed to reflect what's in the record and that's what they follow. but obviously, there's quite a big difference of what's in the record of what we've asked for and what the advocates have asked for.
so as you are somebody that's looking at that and you think about the reasonableness of what somebody is asking for relative to the market conditions, you would expect that would take an impact on their decision process.
james lynch -- chief accounting officer
yes. angie, this is james. i would just like to remind you of one thing in that this is a forward-looking proceeding. and in the forward-looking proceeding, we estimated what future rate interest rate increases would be along with our future financing requirements.
and on andrew's call, he mentioned that we had already locked in a number of our financing requirements for 2022. and so the real test here will be taking a look at how those rates compare to what is finally approved by the commission in the cost of capital proceeding over the next three years. so i think we've made some good progress in terms of aligning the proposed decision with where we are right now as it relates to interest rates, at least in this first year out.
angie storozynski -- seaport research partners -- analyst
but it's mostly on the debt side, right? i mean it's kind of tough to say what's the cost of equity. is that fair?
james lynch -- chief accounting officer
yes, that's fair, angie.
angie storozynski -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. and then...
james lynch -- chief accounting officer
angie, on the cost of equity, one thing just to keep in mind is there is a tracker in the cost of equity. and as interest rates are where they are, that is something that, while it's not impacting us now, it certainly would be something that would likely take effect if trends are where they are.
angie storozynski -- seaport research partners -- analyst
right. and then just wondering -- i was just actually looking at your effective tax rate. and do you think that there will be some impact on your company from that proposed 15% minimum tax rate that looks more likely at this point? would that change for instance, your financing plans plus equity needs, given any potential impact on operating cash flows?
james lynch -- chief accounting officer
well, obviously, we're taking a look to watch as that minimum tax rate is kind of making its way through the regulatory process. and clearly, in some of our current operating utilities on an individual basis, we have rates below 15%. we also have rates that are above 15%. and what we're going to need to do is to see how our combined rate as a combined filer in the federal -- for purposes of federal taxes levels out relative to what ultimately gets passed by congress.
angie storozynski -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. ok, i understand. and then lastly, on the grc. so before you reflect it in your earnings, you have to have the final decision, right? i mean, this is the basis for any adjustments that you're going to make.
so that's where we need to track for. any sort of -- any comments from either the commission or a proposed decision is not enough to reflect those changes as far as the balancing accounts for purchased water costs, again, we have to wait for the final decision?
james lynch -- chief accounting officer
that's right. and it would be a final decision. but remember, we do have that settlement and the settlement does address a number of the issues, including the full cost balancing account, which you're mentioning with regards to our production cost. and so we are expecting that that we get that decision at this point in the fourth quarter, and it really depends on the commission and their workload, as andrew mentioned, as to when during the fourth quarter that occurs.
angie storozynski -- seaport research partners -- analyst
again, we're clearly struggling with the quality distribution of earnings this year. so basically, we're assuming that there is just flat revenues for california in the third quarter year over year with those adjustments that you mentioned for connecticut with this big quarter than happening in the fourth quarter?
james lynch -- chief accounting officer
that's correct. and again, i do want to emphasize that we are viewing this as a timing issue and nothing more.
angie storozynski -- seaport research partners -- analyst
awesome. thank you, guys. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from carol wallace of sjw group. your line is open.
eric thornburg -- chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
