[operator instructions] and your first question will come from will jellison from d.a. davidson.
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon, will.
operator
mr. davidson, you may be on mute. i mean, mr. jellison.
will jellison -- d.a. davidson companies -- analyst
thank you for that. i was on mute. good afternoon.
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon. how's it going?
will jellison -- d.a. davidson companies -- analyst
well, thank you. thank you for taking my question. my first one relates to the raw material prices and the price increase that you are implementing in january. do you think that those two forces combined, you can sustain that 30% gross margin level you've seen for the last few quarters?
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
that is the target. and if our planning comes out in accordance, yes.
will jellison -- d.a. davidson companies -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thank you. and then you mentioned some opportunities related to the the covid filtration and equipment upgrades. do you have any sense right now of what proportion of new orders that opportunity represents for you?
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
you know i didn't do it that way. but what i did do, i maintain very close relationship with sales channel partners. i talked to a sales channel partner that had a job bid two weeks ago -- two weeks ago on tuesday. this particular school district has a $1 billion bond issue and this was the first project for that bond issue. the school district has extensive installation of aaon equipment, so they listed aaon as their basis of design, they had two other manufacturers as alternates that had to be listed separately how that affected the project cost. when they put all the coronavirus mitigation devices in the unit that they wanted, this was the higher level of filtration, uv lights and the bipolar ionization.
for the first time that we've seen this kind of configuration go head to head in that regard, aaon was actually the most attractive not only in value, but in absolute price. they had an extensive list of bidders that listed aaon as anywhere between $50,000 and $100,000 less cost on this project, which was maybe, i'm going to say that bill of materials had closed in on $2 million. so that's inconsequential in percentage. but the thing is, is that the school district was accustomed to paying 10% to as much as 15% premium for aaon. so when you put these mitigation procedures in the unit and they have to be factory installed, all of a sudden that gap narrows considerably. so they were able to get all the value features that they had traditionally awarded aaon contract at a premium, they were able to get those at a level price.
so i think that news will travel fast and i think that on these new project installations where people want to have all of these mitigation procedures installed that they'll find out that they get those at little to no cost premium, maybe no cost premium and that they get all of the other value features that they're accustomed to paying a premium for aaon. so i think that bodes very well for us.
will jellison -- d.a. davidson companies -- analyst
got you. thank you. i appreciate that color. that's all for now. i'll jump back in queue. thank you.
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, will.
operator
[operator instructions] okay. you have a follow-up question from will jellison from d.a. davidson.
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
all right, will, what's the follow-up here?
will jellison -- d.a. davidson companies -- analyst
hello, again. i'm wondering, toward the beginning of the call, you gave some really detailed dialog, frankly much of which is over my head about the engineering behind the stance in some of your products. and you mentioned that they have a significant advantage over competitors. i'm wondering just with the economics of that product, what is stopping your competitors from creating something that can compete with your product?
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
that is a great question, will. our inherent manufacturing culture and technology was to use software-driven sheet metal manufacturing equipment. this dates back to 1997, when norm first put in a salvagnini machine and this salvagnini machine took the place of various individual station machines such as shears, nc punches, press brakes and so forth. so this made it affordable to have that kind of flexibility. well, as you evolve the product, then it's a slight software change in that sheet metal configuration that allows this to be done cost effectively. the most of our competition from, i would say, certainly 20 tons and below, but maybe even as much as 40 tons in some instances, they use a preponderance of hard tooling to obtain their efficiency in sheet metal manufacturing. so they buy a very expensive tool, a dye and have a press that punches out very cost efficiently sheet metal, but has no flexibility to it.
so when they want to change the configuration of the unit to accommodate something like this fan, then it is a major retooling and the other thing is they've got all of these big giant presses that operate these dyes that are just not conducive to that kind of flexibility. so it would take a major structural change in manufacturing thought process and technology for them to cost effectively put that fan in. well, up until recently, they had a strong market for the people that had no need for this kind of fan or no real appreciation for it. so now with this pandemic and everything, it's changed the focus on the type of fan that you have, what the efficiency of it is, and how it operates. so there is a lot generated by this that i would say our strategy of product design all along has been to accommodate the more stringent applications, not the more ordinary applications. so when you go from that more ordinary application and you try and add to it these recommended mitigation strategies, then they just don't fit well for them.
does that all make sense to you?
will jellison -- d.a. davidson companies -- analyst
yes, that's helpful, thank you. that's a pretty clear picture of the advantage that you have. i have one more question related to the capacity increases that you talked about earlier. do you have a sense for how much quarterly revenue threshold do you have with that new capacity if they were to be fully utilized?
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
well, yes, i have a sense -- at this moment -- i understand -- i continue to add capacity, so i'm going to give you a snapshot in time, snapshot in time being today. but i'm still adding capacity. snapshot in time today is between what we did in q3 and what we were capable of doing by just adding headcount, because our headcount is stable with a year ago, i mean almost identical to a year ago, almost to the person. and so if i was to add headcount, i could probably add 20% to 25% more output right now today with the physical plant that i have, but i continue to add more physical plant here within the tulsa facility and in longview, i'm going to double that. i've already got the building built, and we're going to have a certificate of occupancy next month on that building. so longview -- do we separate out exactly how longview comes out for them. no, so longview runs about 12% of our finished goods, that's roundabout right, scott?
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
yeah, right.
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, about 12%. and we had 234,000 square foot down there, but that also manufactured the coils that come up here and the finished goods equipment. so to manufacture that 12% of finished goods equipment probably takes up maybe 40% of the manufacturing space and i added a 100% addition to what's there in total. so in other words, we have about 150% increase in capacity coming online, physical plant capacity coming online in longview.
now, we don't look to have a consistent run rate to require that. what we do look at is that product that we manufacture in longview is very sensitive to lead time, very much appreciated when you have a quick-ship availability and so the peak that you build on any one day, week or month really dictates what's the ideal physical plant size. so you may not have the same utilization of that equipment in longview that we do here in tulsa because we're a little less prone to that sort of peaking activity, but that's very good business to have and so we have built it with that in mind and so to give you an overall sense, we have at least 25% more physical plant capacity than what you've witnessed thus far. we're bringing on another 20% to 25%. so we can easily in the physical facilities that we currently have raise our revenue in the 50% range without too much effort.
will jellison -- d.a. davidson companies -- analyst

operator
and you have a question from matt mcgeary from eagle asset management.
matthew mcgeary -- eagle asset management -- analyst
hi, good afternoon guys.
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon, matt.
matthew mcgeary -- eagle asset management -- analyst
could you give some more color on the water source heat pump redesign to address the aftermarket, when will that be ready to go and do you have the relationships with the appropriate distribution avenues to address that market in the way that you want to?
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
i'll divide those up. first thing is that the products from 0.5 ton through 6 ton, which is the primary need for that backwardly compatible water source heat pump for retrofit installation. it will be ready for production no later than april 1st, that's a very conservative date at this point in time. vast majority of it's completed now, but there is no sensibility to piece-mealing that next generation out to the sales channel. it would just be frustrating. so we are going to have the complete line from 0.5 ton through 6 ton ready to go no later than april 1st.
then the next reason -- the thing that we missed -- when we designed our product, we looked at what was most desirable in the new construction environment because those are the people that we were accustomed to working with and talking with, we had not yet built a competent sales channel in the retrofit market and didn't have the real expertise and input from the retrofit market going back to 2015 when we designed the product we have. so a lot of the characteristics we have are very desirable people like them. that's why it's taken off as well as it has, but it did not fit in a backwardly compatible environment.
so things that were critical with regards to where electrical panels were placed, so that you had proper service clearances in this retrofit environment, those were overlooked. so now we've taken looked at it and figured out how to maintain our most desirable upgrade characteristics, while also making it backwardly compatible. so it will still have the same high desirability on new construction that will be much, much more friendly application in the retrofit.
then the next thing is, as we got into the water source heat pump business, we recognized that our sales channel partners were not focused on the retrofit, they were focused on new construction plants that kind of work, and so we started working with them going back at least four years ago on how to develop an effective sales and marketing strategy to do that. a lot of that included them building some warehouse space and having units in stock because in the retrofit market, a high percentage of it is not planned, so if someone's unit breaks down and they decide that it's cheaper to put a new unit than to repair the unit, they don't want to wait days or weeks to get a new unit. so our sales channel partners had to build out some, and become basically to some degree a distributor in addition to a traditional manufacturer's rep.
well, over this four-year period of time, we've seen a [indecipherable] with that. i don't know exact percentage right now that are stocking water source heat pumps, but i would say it would approach half that are stocking heat pumps now with more committed to coming online, as we get a product that's more ideal. we've also engaged a couple of veterans from that market, from that service retrofit market to lead our sales management efforts and both of these gentlemen are very well respected in the industry, they are respected by our sales channel partners and they are helping craft and implement operating plans for these folks to become proficient in this. so this will be a good opportunity for us to get the water source heat pump business growing again and i have confidence that it will occur. the timing of it is somewhat subjective. but i think we'll see good progress in '21 with the implementation of the new more desirable retrofit type product along with the strategy that they've been putting in place.
matthew mcgeary -- eagle asset management -- analyst
great, thanks a lot. appreciate that.
operator
and i have no further questions in the queue.

operator
good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to aaon inc. third quarter sales and earnings call. there will be a question-and-answer period after management's brief presentation. this call will last approximately 45 minutes to an hour.
i would like to turn the meeting over to mr. gary fields. please go ahead, mr. fields.
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon. i'd like to read a forward-looking disclaimer to begin. to the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act of 1995. as such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside aaon's control that could cause aaon's results to differ materially from those anticipated. please see the risk factors contained in our most recent sec filings including the annual report on form 10-k and the quarterly report on 10-q.
so one of the first things i'd like to do is, thank all of our employees for their diligence to maintaining a safe work environment here at aaon. coronavirus has been very challenging for all employers, but especially those that have to work in close proximity in a manufacturing environment. they've done an outstanding job of maintaining masking, social distancing, cleaning, temp scans and wellness check-ins when they check-in for their shift. we've done very well with that, and we so much appreciate them being diligent in maintaining that safety.
so with that, i'd like to turn it over to scott and he will talk about the financial performance.
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
thank you, gary. i'd like to begin by discussing the comparative results of the three months ended september 30th, 2020 versus september 30th, 2019. net sales were up 18.7% to $134.8 million from $113.5 million. net sales for the quarter are up due primarily to our increased sheet metal production from the additional sale from salvagnini machines that were put into operation during the year. our gross profit increased 49% to $40.8 million from $27.4 million. as a percentage of sales, gross profit was 30.3% in the quarter just ended compared to 24.1% in 2019.
we continue to see overall raw material costs decrease. the company has improved its labor and overhead efficiencies through increased production and-absorption of fixed costs. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 18.9% to $14.7 million from $12.4 [phonetic] million in 2019. additionally, as a percentage of sales, sg&a remained steady at 10.9% of total sales in the quarter just ended and in 2019. sg&a is up due to increases in profit-sharing and other employee incentives related to increased earnings.
income from operations increased 73.9% to $26.1 million or 19.4% of sales from $15.0 million or 13.2% of sales in 2019. our effective tax rate increased to 21.8% from 4.9%. the company's estimated annual 2020 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events is expected to be approximately 24.4%. 2019 had the benefit of a positive return to provision adjustment related to our research and development credit along with additional credits we were able to capture upon amending our oklahoma returns.
net income increased to $20.5 million or 15.2% of sales compared to $14.3 million or 12.6% of sales in 2019. diluted earnings per share increased by 46.2% to $0.38 per share from $0.26 per share. diluted earnings per share were based on 53,151,000 shares versus 52,722,000 shares in the same period a year ago.
now for the comparative results of the nine months ended september 30th, 2020 versus september 30th, 2019. net sales were up 14.7% to $397.9 million from $346.8 million. net sales for the quarter are up due primarily to our increased sheet metal production from the additional salvagnini machines that were placed into operation.
our gross profit increased 46.8% to $121.9 million from $83.0 million. as a percentage of sales, gross profit was 30.6% in the quarter just ended compared to 23.9% in 2019. as already noted, we have experienced decreased material costs and improved overhead absorption.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17.7% to $45.9 million from $39.0 million in 2019. additionally, as a percentage of sales, sg&a increased to 11.5% of total sales in the quarter just ended from 11.2% in 2019. income from operations increased 73.8% to $76.1 million or 19.1% of sales from $43.8 million or 12.6% of sales in 2019.
our effective tax rate increased to 21.1% from 16.8%. the company's estimated annual 2020 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, is expected to be approximately 24.4%. as already discussed, in 2019, our tax rate benefited from additional credits we were able to capture.
net income increased to $60.1 million or 15.1% of sales compared to $36.4 million or 10.5% of sales in 2019. diluted earnings per share increased by 65.2% to $1.14 per share from $0.69 per share. diluted earnings per share were based on 52,955,000 shares versus 52,645,000 shares in the same period a year ago.
at this time, i will turn the call over to rebecca thompson, our chief accounting officer and treasurer.
rebecca a. thompson -- chief accounting officer and treasurer
thank you, scott. looking at the balance sheet, you'll see that we had a working capital balance of $164 [phonetic] million versus $131.5 million at december 31st, 2019. unrestricted cash totaled $70.6 million at september 30, 2020. our current ratio is approximately 3.7:1. our capital expenditures were $49 million. we expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $73.2 million with $41.3 million directed to our new facility in longview, texas. the company had stock repurchases of $21.4 million during the nine months ended september 30th, 2020. shareholders' equity per diluted share is $6.51 at september 30th, 2020 compared to $5.51 at december 31st, 2019.
i'd now like to turn the call back over to our ceo and president, gary fields.
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
i'd like to have a brief discussion about the current building readiness situation. so ashrae, american society of heating, refrigerating and air-conditioning engineers has put together a group they call the epidemic task force. they published a building readiness guide of which they've updated numerous times throughout this event of coronavirus primarily. most recently, it was updated on the 20th of october. some of the key things that it talks about in there are related to building operating strategies such as pre-purge and post-purge, meaning in the unoccupied mode of operation that you purge the building. well, there are some -- certain things that have to be considered there, temperature and humidity control. so most buildings when they go into this purge have the ability to either heat or cool in order to keep the building in an acceptable temperature range. one of the key factors that ashrae points out that maintaining the humidity ratio of 40% to 60% is ideal for minimizing the spread and propagation of viruses. so if you're in the northern latitudes and you purge this building in the winter mode like from right now going forward, then you'd have a very low dew point. so you'd have to add a lot of humidity. so that's onerous to the operating characteristics.
if you're in the southern latitudes, in tulsa today, we're at 75 degrees, and if we were to purge the building tonight, we'd have dew points that would be well above that 60%relative humidity, if we didn't control it. so basic operating strategy that aaon brought to the market many years ago and is deemed the gold standard for controlling humidity. so this is something that's inherent in our characteristics in just this operational strategy that this epidemic task force has recommended.
and the next thing, they divide this from building operating strategies to actual hvac equipment configurations. in this, they give extensive discussion to increased filtration. vast majority of buildings use anywhere between a merv 4 and a merv 8 filtration level, which has always been acceptable for containing and filtering out your normal average particulates in the air stream, but with this virus, they have recommended going to a minimum of merv 13 and even higher, possibly a merv 14. well, when you do this, then the air pressure drop across that filter increases substantially, well, in packaged rooftop units, particularly those 40 tons and smaller. in aaon's basic inherent design, we have accommodated that very well with a backwardly inclined direct drive fan. first off, this fan's speed is easily changed because we have either a ecm motor or a variable frequency drive motor. this is a programming change to change the speed, provided it was selected with some adequate safety margin between operating rpm and potential rpm, which is again an inherent characteristic of the way we provided software selection advice.
so the vast majority of the time, an existing installation of an aaon unit, they can change the filters from these lower merv levels to the higher merv levels with a simple adjustment of the fan speed. the efficiency of aaon's basic inherent design of the backwardly inclined fan is much, much better than our typical competitors with their forward curve fans, especially their belt drive forward curve fans. so we have a basic design characteristic that's been in place for many, many years, with aaon, with these direct drive backwardly inclined fans, so those bode very well for this increased merv level filtration that this epidemic task force has recommended.
the next thing that they recommend is uv lights and bipolar ionization. again, aaon has a basic design characteristic of the units that has ample space in a standard unit to allow these things to be added. so if the unit was purchased and put in the field and that option was not selected at that time, it's easily added by our sales channel partners with their service operations and we've seen a fair amount of that occurring.
one of the things that is a very desirable characteristic of aaon is that we have this electronic selection program with a myriad of selectable options to handle all of these various characteristics. so we offer factory installed uv lights -- factory furnished and installed uv lights, factory furnished and installed bipolar ionization devices. so when you look at the total product -- project cost, having all of this contained in the unit is very desirable characteristic. now once we pass 40 ton units, then the competitors tend to have a little more space, a little more flexibility with their fan design, by the preponderance of units between 2 tons and 40 tons, aaon absolutely dominates that characteristic of the market in our basic inherent design that's been in place for decades.
so the next thing i want to talk about is raw material pricing. scott mentioned that in the quarter versus the quarter a year ago that we had seen some decline in material pricing. we have a very progressive and aggressive purchasing group that caught a little low price on primarily copper and steel and got us some contracts that mostly serve our needs through q1 of '21, maybe a little ways into q2, but they began to notify me here recently that this low they had caught was behind us, that when they started looking at stretching out contracts further that there was a fairly significant increase in cost of both steel and copper.
so we're going to see material cost on our plant floor increase around the first part of q2. well, to counter that, we had a price increase announced recently and it goes into effect the first part of january and with our now very attractive lead times in our backlog in a much more manageable position, then that price increase that goes into effect in early january will actually be on the plant floor sometime in mid to late march, but totally on the floor in april. so the increased material cost, of course, 2021 salaries and wages are also going up a bit. so all of this will be well positioned with this price increase that we just put in effect.
we're beginning to see the the new construction market has tightened up. architectural billing index has got maybe seven months in a row, scott?
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
yeah.
gary d. fields -- president and chief executive officer
i believe it's seven months in a row and it normally takes somewhere around eight or nine months for that to manifest itself for us. well, i think a combination of the election and the concern over what direction the country is going to go there, coronavirus and this lower abi, it's not out of the question to believe that we'd challenged on new construction in particular. we're seeing a rise in our success on replacement market, however.
as of today, well, as of the last day of the quarter, let me rephrase that, so as of -- that would be what, september 31 [phonetic], correct? our bookings for 2020 trailed 2019 bookings by 3.5%. that gap has been closing because at the end of q2, that number was closer to 12%. so we have been closing that, so our efforts for the replacement market are beginning to materialize a bit. our water source heat pumps, that's a business that i envision struggling under the circumstances of we were positioned primarily for new construction. last time i got a data point on this, we were at about 78% new construction and 22% replacement. we analyzed why that was occurring because we believe that it should be the inverse of that, should be more like 25% new construction, 75% replacement. and our product development group did a very, very good job of analyzing what that was. they are deep into the design of the next generation of water source heat pumps that will address that. those will be on the market in time for the big surge in replacement market activity. so i think that we're kind of in a not really a holding pattern, but we're not in a really aggressive growth mode with water source heat pumps at the moment for the reason that the new construction market for water source heat pumps has substantially decreased and our desirable product for the replacement market is soon to be released.
our commercial and retail, interestingly enough, we're having very good luck with our national account customers that do more of the big box style retail environment and that's going well. we're still doing good steady business with our other customers that are in say foodservice and things like that. but overall, i'd have to say the commercial and retail is somewhat less than what we expected it to be. office buildings are very much less than we expected them to be, prior to this coronavirus.
one of the hopes on the horizon and we've seen this materializing with some very good opportunities that have been turning into orders and there is a pipeline full of opportunities for it is medical and healthcare. coronavirus exposed the weakness in the medical communities, physical facilities with those being primarily outside the urban areas. when you get outside the urban areas, you get into suburban and rural areas, for healthcare facilities, those become very, very much a target where aaon is very much appreciated in that market. we have very good application opportunities for that.
education opportunities are an interesting one. we continue to see some parts of the country go forward with bond issues that they had previously issued and they go forward with their construction. we've also seen some that have pulled back a little bit. i'd have to say overall at this point in time, no, we're about even on that that market is not really -- we've had as many gains as we've had losses.
another market for us that has seen acceleration and looks like it could continue to accelerate is manufacturing. we've seen a good increase in our orders for manufacturing. lodging has been a bit surprising to me. i continue to see orders on a regular basis go into lodging facilities. it looks like that these are biased more toward the replacement market than they are in the new market. so i think a lot of people are upgrading their facilities to be in -- maybe in compliance with ashrae's recommendations or their engineering firms have given them good recommendations on that. when you have this increased ventilation, when you have the increased filtration requirements, those fall well for aaon. so i am still seeing a fair amount of orders for lodging and like i say, this was a bit surprising to me. so that's kind of our outlook on our various market segments.
now, our backlog at september 30th, 2020 was $84.9 million, that was down from $165.3 million a year ago. well, $165.3 million was actually a bit troublesome for us because that extended our lead times out where it was very unattractive. and so at this time last year, we were just beginning to get accelerated manufacturing capacity put in, so that we could start burning that backlog down. we have successfully deployed considerable expansion of manufacturing capacity. we have more manufacturing capacity coming on board. we have a new building in longview that comes on board for manufacturing first week or two of january. so we're going to be able to shorten the lead times on the products that we're manufacturing in longview considerably with that.
in tulsa, we were able to add quite a lot of salvagnini machines, we were able to repurpose some areas to more efficient manufacturing processes and the vast majority of those are completed, there is a few of them that are still under way with commissioning and utilization coming on board in the next few weeks. so we've brought our lead times down a lot and we've won a lot of projects because of that attractive lead time. so aaon had an attractiveness to it that we were able to fulfill, that's what caused the backlog to go up. and now we can fulfill that need for the production. so we're in balance at this moment, but we need for orders to strengthen a bit more because now we've created a lot of headroom between manufacturing capacity and bookings receipts.
so this is where we design the program to have additional manufacturing capacity and we've proven that and you saw the numbers this month or this quarter, i mean, considerable increase over anything we've ever done in the past, both the number of units and in dollars. so we're going to be managing this capacity increase very -- we've got a very efficient strategies, a lot of metrics that we look at on how to maintain the efficiencies that we have and i'm confident in my operations team that they will manage to this slight softening in bookings.
now, i will say that we're trailing 2019 bookings by 3.5% right now and the forecast from our sales channel partners is that by the end of the year, we very probably could match 2019 bookings. they are actually a little more optimistic than that, but i'm not so certain about it. there is still a lot of tumultuous things going on right now.
going into '21, we won't have the backlog that we had coming into '20. so that's going to put some constraints on us for a quarter or two until the momentum gets going back in this economy and until our sales channel is able to recover that momentum.
so that's what we're looking at right now. the next thing is we have not been able to give our people a holiday break shutdown for the four years that i've been here. this is the first time that we've had production has caught up and gotten ahead far enough to where we can give these people some rest and let them have a holiday shutdown. so we're going to shut down for the christmas to new year's holiday this year, because we are very well ahead of our commitments. so that's kind of what we're looking at. q4, like i said, we came into it with a lower backlog than we did in q4 of '19. so we're going to be slowing production down just a little bit here to make sure we maintain this efficiency.
and with that, we're open to questions.

hey. good afternoon. i guess a few things here, gary. yes, some pretty significant escalation in steel. copper is on the other inputs. you talked about the price increase. i guess a two-part question. are you evaluating another price increase just given what we're seeing here year-to-date? and then what -- how should we think about the impact to margins through the first half of the year as you're catching up to that?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
so we had enough steel contracted at a stable price, much lower than today's spot market price that would carry us all the way through q2. so it's not going to have any effect on the first half of the year at all. our anticipation is that once this surge kind of subsides a little, it's a little bit like our price increases. there's a surge of buying for steel because a lot of industries are coming back online. and our anticipation is that before we need to go into the market and contract for more steel, that those prices might have moderated a bit. if they don't, then we'll have to consider something different. but we've got plenty of time to evaluate that because of the amount of steel that we've already got contracted and in-house. so i don't see it as being anything that's a management issue. so we're not considering another price increase at this point because we can't foresee anything to cause that relevant to our purchasing practices.
brent tillman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. perfect. the new water-source heat pump products that become available kind of spring, maybe early summer, will you have all of your available capacity to potentially produce those new products?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
i have surplus capacity. when we built that line, we built it for a run rate that's about maybe three times what we're running now, three, three and half times what we're running now. so yes, that was one of the key things. i mean the pressure to that is i'm paying depreciation expense on that stuff, and i'm not getting the production out of it currently. so i'm very excited about getting these other products put together, so i can absorb that depreciation expense more efficiently. but what we have done is we have run this line at the fastest speed we can run it to see what we could do, then we have trimmed the number of days that we run it. because as you're aware, we manufacture 355 days a year on a normal year, seven days a week. so we've proven what that capacity is. it's not a speculative how many units can we build. and all we have to do to ramp up that production at this point is just add days that we turn the switch on.
brent tillman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. did some of the areas that you've talked about seeing better signs, data centers, warehouses, i guess, in particular, and i guess, in some sense that those areas were pretty good for you through 2020? maybe i'm wrong, but maybe what's causing the pickup there?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, they were good for us, but they're picking up, and i think it might just be that as the virus comes a little more under control, and they can actually get out on these projects and do some work, that's probably what's happening. i think the desire to build those projects was there all along. but i don't know that they could man the projects. and that appears to be what's improving it. one of the large online retailers, they want a very aggressive lead time, but it's interesting that they take weeks and weeks and weeks of speculating when to turn the switch on to do that. and i think that was them getting construction crews put together. but once they get that done and they turn the switch on and say go, it's a very short lead time. and so this capacity that we've built into this business over the last two or three years accommodates that very well. the first three projects we did for them, we -- this one particular online retailer, we were able to deliver each one of them one week early. and so that made quite an impression on them. and that might be the other reason that, that particular customer is giving us more attention now.
brent tillman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. and any -- on the indoor air quality opportunity, i've been hearing more and more about that around the industry, and you obviously are well aligned to it. any particular wins you can point to? i'm just trying to think about how quickly that peak is kind of growing for you.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, i will. so there was a school district in texas that i had mentioned before that they bought 567 units from us last year. and they were putting some of these mitigation procedures in before we'd even heard of coronavirus because their orders took place -- or their setup for the orders took place in the fall of '19. and the orders themselves didn't come in until like february of '20, but they already had the mitigation procedures put in. so they -- i don't know what kind of crystal ball they had, but it was a good one. that same school district awarded us 811 units the other day. and again, that was because of our ability to provide these coronavirus or -- i just call them virus mitigation because it's all virus, it's not specific to coronavirus, but the virus mitigation procedures that we're able to put in the units for them. so that awarded us 811 units on that one particular project, that one school district. they're in north texas. so we're very proud that they've come back. they've been buying units from us. i know for certain, 12 years. and they prefer us, and we have delivered for them this past year, delivering those 567 units. it was a very critical, very short time frame. and we were able to meet all of their needs, and we received a lot of accolades for that as well. so that's one in particular. there's others that are similar. people in chicago, people in colorado and people in pennsylvania have all told me similar stories.
brent tillman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. thank you very much and [indecipherable].
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from julio romero with sidoti.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
good afternoon, julio.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, gary. good afternoon, scott. my first question is just on the trend of inquiries. i think you mentioned bookings are up 6% year-over-year, but could you speak to inquiries and how those trended throughout the quarter?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. so q4, they were up 6%. currently, they're up quite a bit more than that, but i can't really analyze that correctly because of that pull forward from the price increase. we had sales team meeting yesterday afternoon to get an update on that. and the inquiries are surprisingly stronger than what we had anticipated. if you go back to when we were putting our budgeting process together back in the fall, we didn't anticipate as strong as what they're telling me the pipeline is now. now that pipeline is not an order in my book. it's either an order in their book or a potential, a high-value prospect for them. but our sales channel is surprisingly pretty optimistic.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. i wanted to dig a little further into that commentary about why your product portfolio is translating into good orders for education. i think you talked about maybe your -- some of your products, in particular, are conducive to mitigation strategies. and maybe speak to that? and does that give you any advantages into other subsectors of nonresidential construction?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, potentially, julio. let's look at the education first. so education has always been a very good audience for aaon equipment. they own and operate those buildings for a long time. so the value proposition that we put forth to them, they analyze those very thoroughly. and we've been working on the sales channel for several years now and improving their best practices, implementation, sharing best practices. and part of that is what are these values that these school districts see in the aaon equipment? and how do we get more and more people to hear that story and understand that story? so i think that you start off with the fundamental of aaon was always an appreciated value provider to those kind of purchasers, then you more capably share those best practices as to how you present that. and we have modeling tools and things that help with that. so the sales channel themselves have become more efficient at telling that story. then you add on to that. so every manufacturer that we compete against has the same mitigation strategies available in portions of their product portfolio. but in particular, in the smaller tonnage units, these 2- through really 20-ton units is kind of a focus for those. we're the only ones that have a broad line of very capable equipment with no modification to our basic approach in order to put these strategies in. if you were to take the majority of our competitors in their 2- through 20-ton units, it's fairly onerous for them to put all of this in, in an efficient manner. they can put it in there, but it's not in an efficient manner. so again, when you get to someone that's value conscious, they're looking at their operating costs as well as their earning cost of the units as far as how long they last, so it all factors into the total owning cost experience, and it just favors us substantially. and that's just the innate design of the equipment that norm and the team before me built into this. it was the strategy all along, not necessarily thinking that we would have these mitigation strategies, but this was an approach that gave a much better energy efficiency utilization of the air-moving component of the unit.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. maybe i'll dig in some of the line item guidance you gave. you mentioned sg&a, expect it to be up a little bit because of the insurance premiums. should i think about that as up on a percentage of sales basis or by some dollar amount? any additional color there would be helpful.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
i'm going to let scott do that one, if you would, please.
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance and chief financial officer
well, as we mentioned, we got a large insurance settlement last year, and we had to go out and get renewals. and so our renewals were significantly more steep than they had been in prior years. so it is a noticeable amount. we're talking roughly about $2 million of additional premium that we're going to be seeing due to the higher cost for ensuring a property as well as liability, etc. and that's not even counting what might ultimately flow through from medical expenses this year.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. and then i guess just on the capex guidance, $70.7 million. just thinking about cash flow, i guess, in general. i mean maybe can you talk about how you -- what you're expecting cash flow for the year? and if working capital can be a usage of cash? and if so, some kind of idea?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, we're able to fund all of this from the cash flow. as you saw, we had, what, $79 million in the bank at the end of the year. and i think we've got that treasure chest a bit more since then. that would have been after we paid dividends and had all of our bonus accruals taken out and all of those things. so that was kind of the lowest part the bucket was going to be for a while. so the profits from operations is going to go into that bucket. and looking at the way we've got everything budgeted, i think that we're looking at ending the year very similar cash quantities, as i recall.
rebecca a. thompson -- chief accounting officer and treasurer
right, yes.
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance and chief financial officer
with some additional growth. and -- but during the course of the year, one of the things which would, to your point, the working capital will go up because our receivables are at probably the lowest point they've been in many years right now. so we are going to be seeing some uses of cash during the year, but those will eventually flush out.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks for taking my questions. best of luck in 2021.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from jon braatz with kansas city capital.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
good afternoon, gary. how are you?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
i'm good.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
[indecipherable] there is a school going up -- a great school going up three blocks from me. i expect to see aaon equipment in there.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, i'm going to call james herman when this is over with at vcs and makes sure he got it sold.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
all right. good. good. say how much was the price increase effective january 11?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
4% across the board.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
i'm sorry, 4%?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, sir, across the board.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
okay. okay. and when you look at some of the other items, maybe component costs, freight and so on, are you seeing -- i assume you're seeing inflationary trends in that area, too. and when you look at all your components, all your costs, let's say, beyond steel, where do you think you might be most vulnerable to some additional cost increases over the next couple of months?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
so our purchasing department, we've got some personnel that -- at a higher level in purchasing that came on board over the last year or two. and they had some ability to provide me visibility to these costs, probably more clearly than what i had in the past. it could be that i just learned how to read what they were giving me. i'm not sure. but there are nine components, materials, components, however you want to term it, that comprise about 70% of everything we purchase. and they keep a spreadsheet in front of me that they update monthly. and it tells me what the forecast cost of these things are for the next six months out in front of me. and right now, that thing is flat. so when i look at those nine materials that comprise 70%, that's like galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper, coils that we build, coils that we buy, motors, compressors, those are kind of those components. heat exchanger tubes, i think, is one of them. i mentioned copper, yes. so anyhow, there's nine of them that's 70%. the other 30% are two smaller buckets to really get a trend on them. so what they do is when some of these smaller buckets, when they get any notice of it, of course, they make me aware of it. but the way i looked at it was of the price increase, let's say, the 4% price increase, probably something less than half of that price increase is going for the materials. another component was going for salaries and wages that we adjust those in the fall.
and then the other part was to help with absorbing some of the overhead. and yes, like the insurance. so we believe that the 4% price increase will be largely on the plant floor in q2. in times past, it's been horribly painful because our lead time was a blasted loss. but now with our lead times so good, we're probably averaging, i'd say is a complete tranche, maybe eight, nine weeks. and so if it went into effect january 11, let's just even put 10 weeks on it, that means that q2, i ought to see, by and large, the new price on the plant floor in both plants. well, that being the case, some of these material costs don't hit me until late q2, the changes. so i think that's what i was speaking to earlier that the timing seems to be just about right as far as when i have any additional pressure on pricing and when i get a price increase. so i think we're poised well. like i said, we've got a good six months of visibility out in front of us, and that's always rolling six months. every month, they update it and keep me six months in the -- knowledgeable. well, when i announce a price increase, i normally give about 90 days notice so that those people aren't caught with bids out there that they haven't secured at a price. so i try and protect that side of the business as well. and so then if i do that, and it takes them 90 days and then give them that 90 days and then i've got lead time that sub-90 days, see, that's why the six months is so important.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
yes. so am i understanding correctly that in the fourth quarter, you weren't really impacted much by the cost increases?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
just slightly by -- salaries and wages, were -- they were adjusted, what, october, weren't they?
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance and chief financial officer
correct.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. so salaries and wages got is. and that was probably -- what would you figure, about 1% of sales?
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance and chief financial officer
about.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. so we probably lost -- in q4, we probably lost 1% of gross margin or margin. then the real problem with q4 was that we had to slow the production down just a little bit, a lot of things to catch up. so we just couldn't amortize those fixed cost out as well.
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance and chief financial officer
on likelihood, jon, at the beginning of april, when we get the month of march closed up and we can see a good period of time with the price increases, our cost structure in place operating smoothly, presuming there's no natural disaster in the month of march, we'll be in a much better position to evaluate what we look like versus what the costs are that we see on the horizon and any action that we need to take. but that won't be until we get into the beginning part of april.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
okay. okay. one last question, again, surrounding steel. we've heard in some instances that -- i don't know, maybe it's true, maybe it's not, but that some steel consumers may be put on allocation and or may or already are on allocation. are you hearing any possibility that steel -- there may be an allocation, and you may not be able to get as much as you would like? any conversations around steel allocation?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
no. and when i read that -- i believe i read that in the wall street journal a month or two ago, and in a really brisk pace, trotted down to purchasing and said, ""tell me about this."" and they said, ""gary, you don't have to worry about a thing because we already own enough steel to go through q2, that these people actually bring the steel in and warehouse it for us."" now we keep several million pounds of steel on premises at -- between our two locations. in each one of these coils are steel weighs in the range of 45,000, 48,000 pounds. and there's quite a few coils of steel sitting here. so i know it's in the low millions of pounds on premises. well, then you figure what we've got stocked in all the towers. how many million pounds you think we have, rebecca? give me a good flag. got one?
rebecca a. thompson -- chief accounting officer and treasurer
i can't even.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
it's multiple millions of pounds, ok?
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance and chief financial officer
the big one is 250,000?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, 250,000.
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance and chief financial officer
this is just in one storage.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. yes. so we have a lot of steel on premises, and then they have a lot of our steel that we've already contracted for and bought in their premises, right. there's 18-wheeler flatbed pulling up here a couple of times a day, at least, dropping -- because they only carry one coil of steel on each one because they weigh 45,000, 48,000 pounds. it's kind of funny looking to see a big 53-foot-long trailer with about a -- what is it, about a 10-foot diameter, those coils? 8- to 10-foot diameter coil, 5-foot wide, that's all that's on it, but it weighs 48,000 pounds. so we have a couple of those back up to the dock every morning and set those off. but no, we're not finding any problem with that, at least on the foreseeable future for the next several months. now if we were to get -- again, we're thinking that there's a lot of surge because people are starting back up, and they're buying more cars and all these kind of things that's using the steel up. and that surge is probably going to normalize before we need to be back in the market and before we need to worry about getting more steel. that's our anticipation.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, john.

now our next question comes from chuck myer with myers family office.
chuck myer -- myers family office -- analyst
hi, guys. thank you so much for taking my question.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
certainly.
chuck myer -- myers family office -- analyst
i just wanted to clarify on the working capital for this year. what are your expectations on how much free cash flow might be eaten up by getting working capital back to normal this year by the end of the year?
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance and chief financial officer
well, we haven't provided that information, and i don't have it handy at the moment.
chuck myer -- myers family office -- analyst
okay. because i was just trying to triangulate what was said in terms of cash at the end of the year being sort of similar to cash at the beginning of the year. and if i put together the pieces of net income plus d&a this year of, i don't know, $28 million, $29 million, i'm not sure if that is right or wrong, and then the $70 million of capex that you laid out, and then let's assume that working capital build eats up $10 million this year to throw out a number, that sort of gets us to, if we keep cash flat from now until the end of the year of earnings of around $50 million to $55 million or about $1 a share, am i triangulating that correctly based on everything you've told us today?
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance and chief financial officer
well, i think there are a lot of other factors that will go into our cash position by the end of the year in terms of buyback activity that occurs through our 401(k) plan, the dividends that we pay out and what those might potentially be during the course of the year that are not yet determined that leave us with some level of uncertainty as to exactly what that would be. we expect that if we perform as well as we anticipate that there would be some growth in our cash position by the end of the year. it is not exactly a flat figure. so we don't try to give forward projections on our earnings expectations.
chuck myer -- myers family office -- analyst
got you. okay. thank you so much, guys. appreciate it. i guess just before i run, one more quick question, i was trying to triangulate also the reasonably strong bookings related to the price increase in january with your thoughts on the first half being just weak because of abi and what's happening in the economy and such. when i think about first half, it seems to me like having sort of flat q1 and q2 from this quarter we just ended, it seems like the most reasonable outcome and then sort of an acceleration to the second half of the year. is that sort of what you're implying as well?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes.
chuck myer -- myers family office -- analyst
okay. okay. so the $116 million, $117 million of sales is sort of reasonable, it sounds like, for the next two quarters, accelerating into the end of the year, and net of the insurance proceeds, we did about $0.27 a share in earnings given the 29% gross margins, etc. that all sounds like it's in line with what your view is.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, i'm thinking q2 is going to be a bit stronger than what you just portrayed.
chuck myer -- myers family office -- analyst
okay. so might the -- acceleration might happen into q2 versus q1. okay. great. thank you so much, guys. good luck.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you.

and our next question comes from jerry levine, a private investor.
jerry levine -- private investor -- analyst
well, thank you, scott, gary, rebecca. i hope you guys are all well and safe and healthy and so are your families. after 19 years of listening to questions, i'm now able to ask one. so i am going to ask one, but i think it's relatively simple. but my best to all of you guys, and i don't know if norman is on the call or not, but send him my regards, if you will.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
he's sitting here. you know he is.
jerry levine -- private investor -- analyst
okay. norm, i hope you're well. i hope your family is well.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
all good.
jerry levine -- private investor -- analyst
the question i've got, gary, is, would you discuss a little bit about the representatives' effort on the retail side? i know it was off to a good start last year. and then, of course, covid came along. how does it stand now? and what are your thoughts for the rest of this year? it's a very small contributor, as everybody knows, to the top line but it's a very profitable business. how does that shape up right now?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, some of our national account customers that are involved in retail have remained fairly stable. the retail sector that i see that softened up a little bit is the more sporadic retail purchaser. so again, when we look at these national accounts that we've had, some of which we've had for many, many years, they're relatively stable. i don't see any problem with them whatsoever. the fact is one of them has already got as much orders in here in 2021 as they did for the last half of 2020. so they're accelerating, and they told me it was because they could finally get jobs built. there were places that you'd see signs, this is coming soon. and they used to tell you, spring of '21 or dates like that. now there's signs, they're coming soon. and they don't know what that means because they couldn't get construction crews on site. now they're starting to get them on site and they're starting to accelerate. so at least one or two of our national account retail customers is in that boat. but the more broadly looking at retail is what i'm looking at being a little softer than what it has been historically and a little smaller component of our overall efforts.
jerry levine -- private investor -- analyst
okay, gary. what i also was referring to was the effort on the part of the reps to open up their own retail stores or...
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
oh, the parts store. yes. yes, that's coming up...
jerry levine -- private investor -- analyst
go ahead. i'm sorry.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
that's coming along nicely. the -- i don't have a number of how many parts stores were added in 2020, but it was several. and there were commitments to add several more in 2021. additionally, we put on some more personnel in the sales management and sales support to support that business. in fact, is earlier today, i was visiting with the director of sales, and he's going to reach out and make an offer to a person that is significant -- with a significant experience in the parts sales business he interviewed in the other day, and he's going to reach out for an offer to this young man. and so we're going to continue to put more and more effort and focus into that because it's materializing nicely for us. and our representatives are very appreciative of the support we give, the guidance we give. and this is another one of those share the best practices and share the stories of those that are winning with that strategy. and it's a very well-adopted strategy.
jerry levine -- private investor -- analyst
thank you. you guys, stay safe. will you?

good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. welcome to aaon, inc. fourth quarter sales and earnings call. there will be a question-and-answer period after management's brief presentation. this call will last approximately 45 minutes to an hour. i would like to turn the meeting over to mr. gary fields. please go ahead, sir.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
good afternoon. i want to read a disclaimer to begin with, forward-looking disclaimer. to the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act of 1995. as such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside aaon's control that could cause aaon's results to differ materially from those anticipated. please see the risk factors contained in our most recent sec filings, including the annual report on form 10-k and the quarterly report on form 10-q. so i want to thank all of the employees of aaon for their safe behavior and due diligence with regards to coronavirus. we have done temperature checks and wellness exams as well as when they clock in, they certify that they are safe and symptom-free. so again, we want to thank those employees because we've had very, very good success with our experience with the coronavirus. i want to turn the call over to scott asbjornson, our chief financial officer.
scott m. asbjornson -- vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thank you, gary. i'd like to begin by discussing the comparative results of the three months ended december 31, 2020 versus december 31, 2019. net sales were down 4.8% to $116.7 million from $122.6 million. net sales for the quarter are down primarily to our plant -- tulsa's plant shutdown during the last week of december 2020 for plant and machine maintenance as well as for a deserved employee holiday break. our gross profit decreased 6.8% to $33.9 million from $36.4 million. as a percentage of sales, gross profit was 29.1% in the quarter just ended compared to 29.7% in 2019. due to the plant shutdown in tulsa, we saw an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses, along with lower overhead absorption. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11.5% to $14.6 million from $13.1 million in 2019.
additionally, as a percentage of sales, sg&a increased to 12.5% of total sales compared to 10.7% in the same period in 2019. sg&a is up due to increases in profit sharing and employee incentives due to the increased earnings. income from operations increased 10.7% to $25.7 million or 22% of sales from $23.2 million or 18.9% of sales in 2019. income from operations is up due to the $6.4 million pre-tax gain as a result of the insurance proceeds received in november 2020. our effective tax rate increased to 26.6% from 25.6%. net income increased to $18.9 million or 16.2% of sales compared to $17.3 million or 14.1% of sales in 2019. net income included $4.1 million related to insurance proceeds. diluted earnings per share increased 6.1% to $0.35 per share from $0.33 per share. the insurance proceeds mentioned previously amounted to $0.08 per share.
now for the comparative results of the year-ended december 31, 2020 versus december 31, 2019. net sales were up 9.6% to $514.6 million from $469.3 million. net sales for the year are up due primarily to our increased production of rooftop units and full realization of price increases put in place in prior years. our gross profit increased 30.5% to $155.8 million from $119.4 million. as a percentage of sales, gross profit was 30.3% in the year just ended compared to 25.4% in 2019. we have experienced decreased material costs and improved overhead absorption. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16.2% to $60.5 million from $52.1 million in 2019. additionally, as a percentage of sales, sg&a increased slightly to 11.8% of total sales in the year just ended from 11.1% in 2019.
sg&a expenses are up due to increases in our profit-sharing program, employee incentives and a onetime donation of $1.25 million to winifred public school in honor of our founder, norman asbjornson. income from operations increased 52% to $101.8 million or 19.8% of sales from $67 million or 14.3% of sales in 2019. our effective tax rate increased to 22.5% from 19.9%. in 2019, our tax rate benefited from additional credits we were able to capture. net income in 2020 increased 47% to $79 million or 15.4% of sales compared to $53.7 million or 11.4% of sales in 2019. diluted earnings per share increased by 46.1% to $1.49 per share from $1.02 per share. at this time, i'll turn the call over to rebecca thompson, our chief accounting officer and treasurer.
rebecca a. thompson -- chief accounting officer and treasurer
thank you, scott. looking at the balance sheet, you'll see that we had a working capital balance of $161.2 million versus $131.5 million at december 31, 2019. unrestricted cash totaled $79 million at december 31, 2020. our current ratio is approximately 3.7:1. our capital expenditures were $67.8 million, up 82% from a year ago. we expect capital expenditures in 2021 to be approximately $70.7 million. the company had stock repurchases of $31 million during the year-ended december 31, 2020. shareholders' equity per diluted share is $6.61 at december 31, 2020, compared to $5.51 at december 31, 2019. i'd now like to turn the call back over to our ceo and president, gary fields.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
good afternoon. so i'd like to talk about sales. so aaon products, by the primary design, are much more conducive to adding improved indoor air quality measures, such as merv 13 filters, uv lights and bipolar ionization. all three of these technologies have been recognized by the ashrae pandemic task force to be contributory to mitigating airborne viruses such as coronavirus. we've had some pressure on raw material pricing. we have materials purchased on contract that are in good lockstep with our recent price increases as far as when that equipment hits the plant floor. so they were both coincided to merge together. we believe that our price increase that went into effect january 11, for the foreseeable future, handles the known price increases that we see coming q2, q3. water-source heat pumps, we still had pressure on our business because our original design product, which is a very fine product, is really positioned well for new construction but not positioned as well for replacement.
a lot of the units that need to be replaced are configured slightly different. so we have designed a whole new line of water-source heat pumps to supplement what we currently build that are more compatible with the current installation configuration. it's looking like somewhere between late april to early june is when those products will be out in the marketplace ready for installation. so we've been working on updating design on products. that's a constant endeavor. we've introduced more and more variable frequency drive compressors into units, primarily into rooftop units. and one of the key areas that we're focusing on is the electrification movement that's taking place across north america with regards to heating. so we're very close to having air-source heat comps available in a huge range from two tons to 230 tons, and they'll operate at very attractive cops at very low ambient temperatures.
so the water-source heat pump, we're working on the same variable frequency drive compressor technology in those. and we have already introduced some of these sizes, and we're introducing more. we believe that air-source heat pump and water-source heat pump technologies are going to be more widely used by a bigger base of installations than has ever occurred in the past. in longview, we doubled the production capacity with the addition of a 220,000-square-foot building to add to the existing 234,000-square-foot building. and when we did this, our sheet-metal production equipment was about 125% increase over what was in the original installation. i just received the photo about 15 minutes ago of the first finished unit coming off of the new line in the new building. so we're terming this soft start-up in that we're running duplicate manufacturing processes, the old building and the new building.
and this allows us to vet out the new building without compromising our commitments for delivery, which we've been meeting relatively well with the existing building. but what we've found is the demand for the products therefore exceeds the capacity of the older existing building. so the timing for the new building is, i would say, none too late or none too early. it's just about right on time. demand is considerable for that product, and we're really proud to have this new manufacturing facility coming on board in alignment with that demand. looking at various business segments. commercial and retail, we've seen some pressure on those. we've seen some pressure on office buildings, but we've also seen some improvement in medical and healthcare. and surprisingly, education has been good for us. i see lots of indicators from dodge and abi and other places that say that education, particularly k-12, is not got as much going on.
i think that our equipment, being more desirable than most of our competitors with regards to the coronavirus or virus period mitigation procedures, the way they integrate so nicely into our equipment is bringing more opportunities to us for education. we've already seen considerable orders for those. and our sales representatives tell us their pipeline has a very robust supply of education opportunities. manufacturing is holding about steady for us. don't see anything really material as far as up or down. lodging is materially down, and new starts in particular. we are seeing a fair amount of replacement and upgrades. there's a couple of other areas that we're seeing a decent amount. i don't know that you would categorize it as entirely material, but a decent amount of acceleration in the vertical market, and that's data centers and grow facilities. recently, the election this past fall, there were additional states that enacted marijuana laws, whether they were medical or recreational but there was additional state, and there's already been business come in the door for us relevant to grow facilities to serve those states that have that new law.
so at december 31, our backlog was 74.4 million versus 142.7 million a year ago. a lot of that reduction, it was kind of lines going in different directions. production was coming up considerably. our production rates and production capabilities were substantially greater than the year before, and bookings had slowed down. although q4 bookings were 6% above 2019 q4 bookings, so we did see it begin to turn around. we had a price increase that went into effect january 11. any time we have a price increase, we always see a pull forward of orders, a surge, if you will. and it usually takes about 90 days to see that ripple settle out. and so here we are at 60 days, and so i don't think it's entirely settled out yet, but it's looking pretty good. as of february 1, our backlog was 103.8 million. we've seen consistent decreases in abi, although what came out yesterday had strengthened a little bit over december and the inquiries had strengthened for a couple of months. so the other thing i want to mention is that the normal correlation between abi and our activities has been historically very relevant, but we're not seeing quite the relevance now. and i think a little of this has to do, and i've talked to quite a few people. there were a lot of projects that were designed, but when coronavirus hit, the pandemic hit, they hit the pause button. and recently, several of these projects, they've hit the go button.
well, that doesn't necessarily generate a billing from an architect because it was already designed. there will be some architectural services that will be billed, but it might not be in accordance with normal practices. so we're seeing those projects come off the shelf, and that's been a nice pleasant surprise for us. now our lead times are about as good as they've ever been, and that's due to the increased capacity. here in tulsa, we've added several of our salvagnini sheet-metal manufacturing machines. as scott mentioned earlier in his part of the presentation, we had some holiday shutdown for maintenance, and we were able to get some heavy-duty maintenance on some other machines. so our fleet at salvagnini is in the best position it's ever been in for production, number of sheet metal parts we can make on a daily basis. what we've been doing is managing that production capacity versus what we believe would be the peak demand.
and the goal was that we could produce in accordance with the peak demand and not extend lead times. while we're currently in that position and things look good through '21 and with some additional machinery that we're installing here, plus bringing the new building online in longview, we see the ability to stay ahead of that curve for everything that we can foresee for at least the next two years. the remainder of '21, on a high-level basis, i believe that this quarter, again, the price increases is probably altering what we would normally see. so it's looking very nice right now, but i expect that to soften just a little bit due to the fact that a lot of these orders were pulled forward. when i talk to the sales channel about their pipeline, there's a lot of optimism out there, but it's looking more like second half of the year is when we might be on a path to something that's worthy of discussion. in the meantime, we're just going to kind of move through here, and we've got a nice backlog right now, so we can run at a nice clip. sg&a in 2021 is going to be up a little because of insurance premiums. i think that there was a lot of property casualty loss in the entire industry. as scott mentioned, we had a claim for hail damage on our roof that was considerable. and so our insurance went up considerably. we weren't able to travel much in 2020. so we'll be traveling a bit more, and we'll have some pretty robust marketing events going on. so i look for sg&a to be up just a little bit. the weather that we had a week or so ago in tulsa and in longview caused us to have some shutdowns. i mean we had no power, and people couldn't get to work. i mean there was ice on the roads and very dangerous conditions. so in total, that looked like about nine days of -- with the capacity management, the maintenance event and the snow, about nine days in tulsa. and i think longview was similar, maybe just a little bit less. so we're probably going to have our sales affected by that a little bit this quarter, although we're at full throat right now. and the -- we had a senior leadership team meeting yesterday, and we're looking at a little stronger production toward the end of the quarter. it won't make up entirely for what we lost, but it's not going to be considerable. so just to kind of wrap that up. i think that should help some of your modeling purposes, but i'll open it up to questions now.

thank you, presenters. [operator instructions] we have our first question from brent thielman from d.a. davidson. your line is open.
brent tillman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. hey, gary, you talked about the increase in the replacement orders and i was curious if you had any sense of how much of that could be related to some of the stuff you're just talking about the air upgrade, circulation, medical related upgrades for system? is there any way to tell from that?
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
it's a little difficult to give a real highly qualified definitive number on that. you can have a sense of what's going on, brent, and it looks to me like we're up 20% on bookings over last year and i would say that a significant amount of that is attributable to the indoor air quality, the virus mitigation procedures. because last year, q1 was a very nice bookings quarter, very much within our what we had anticipated and it had the normal replacement business for school. for this year to be up this substantially in bookings, it really feels like a big part of that accretive bookings number is related to the virus mitigation procedures and people getting on top of that.
brent tillman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. gary, i'm assuming this equipment has more bells and whistles to it in order to meet those sorts of standards. is there a way for us to think about the higher average value per unit for something like that to address the sort of things that [indecipherable] is talking about?
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
well, that's the wonderful thing about the aaon unit, these things are very inexpensive for us to add our units. what it has done is our units themselves are much better value to address these things. so, we don't have to do very much at all. so, for instance, our units are double-weld steel panel. the interior panel of our unit is solid steel and it's washable. so, you don't get bacteria and viruses attaching to a fiber glass line or like the majority of our competitors have. they don't have a steel liner and that's inherent in our units from 2 tons, all the way up to 240 tons.
the next thing is that our fan will overcome the additional pressure drop of these higher rated filters. while the difference say merv-8 filter, which has been the most common filter used up until now, and merv-13 filter, which is pretty much what everybody is wanted to do, the cost that filter is insignificant. maybe in the 2-ton unit, it's $20 and in 100-ton unit, maybe it's $300. so it's not significant, but what is significant is that our unit was designed in it's fundamental design to overcome that additional pressure drop in a very efficient manner.
so, we can put these filters in. we can have this nice clean interior that doesn't collect bacteria and virus and allow it to accumulate. they can clean these units easily. then when you start putting infrared lights in there, again you're talking in 2 ton to 10 unit, which are lot of these school units. that's their range. you're talking $125 on a several dollars unit. now the one thing that does cost a little money and we're not seeing a lot of it, but we're seeing a little bit is the bipolar ionization. that seems to be a small percentage of our customers who want the better filtration. they want the lights and then they want the bipolar. it's a very small percentage that want to bipolar.
brent tillman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay, thanks for the color. obviously, we see what's going on with steel and copper market out there. it sounds like you guys are getting ahead of it. the one question i had was any issues just getting the materials and components you need? it seems like there's a lot of supply chain challenges around the industry.
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
it's an interesting conversation. the board met for our audit committee meeting a couple of days ago and every one of our board members was present, even though they're not all on that committee, they still read into it. there was a discussion about our inventory levels. our inventory is running about 15% to 17% of revenue and if you look back historically, it was closer to 10% of revenue. they said, do we see a time when we might lower that inventory level and get back into that historic ratio and i said, gentlemen and ladies, we're blessed that we have this inventory. because it's keeping us from having supply chain issues. we have an abundance of materials in here. we struggle for some small things from time to time, but my purchasing department says that while it's a little extra work, they've not caused us to miss any shipments or commitments for shipments because of that. this was kind of a blessing in disguise that we had this.
the other thing is, is that my pricing was more stable. because we had a lot of these materials bought at a better price, so as things are escalating, one thing you're proud of as you got a big inventory of lower priced materials. i was able to get my price increase extended out further, june 1st, and i won't be buying materials at that higher price until after that price increase actually hits the floor. so, we're in real good shape with supply chain. i'm very proud of this team that we have here and how aggressive they are in doing that. for us, at this point in time at least, it has not been an issue.
brent tillman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah. very good. last one from me would just be, gary, when they can come back to the synopsis of what you're seeing out there in the market and it seems to be a true reacceleration in orders. i guess as we sit here today, i mean, it looks like go through 2q, 3q, we should see some favorable topline comparisons based on what you can see right now?
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
yes. q4 is coming somewhat into focus, now it's still just a little fuzzy. it's out there far enough that it's just a little fuzzy, so i don't want to absolutely commit that q4 is not going to rollover on us. but again, q4 of 20 was substantially lower. it kind of resumed that bell's curve that we've had in the past. it was much lower than q3. i don't remember the exact numbers now. you remember what the percentage reduction was? anyhow, we're going to have favorable comps going forward. this q1 was anticipated to be lower. it's very tough comp with q1 of 20, because we had such a huge backlog coming into 20 and we knew this was going to be tough. we told you folks about it last quarter or even before that. going forward, i think, we'll have some favorable comps, brent.
brent tillman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. well, very good. best of luck here in this quarter.
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer

we have our next question from julio romero from sidoti. your line is open.
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
good afternoon, julio.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, gary. good afternoon, rebecca.
rebecca thompson -- chief accounting officer & treasurer
good afternoon.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i guess just on that last question, want to just kind of stay on price cost and just thinking about price increases. can you give us a refresher of maybe how often you reprice in a given year and do you think it's more likely than not that we see a few more price increases in the third and fourth quarter?
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
well, our purchasing group keeps a 6-month forecast of material cost in front of me at all times. so, i have a rolling 6 months in front of me at all times. again, going back to that higher inventory level that's what allowed me to have a good visual on 6 months out. i can respond quick enough that i can give our sales channel partners very good notice, so that they don't get trapped with bids at a price that they can't afford due to a price increase. knowing the cadence, all those years i spent on their side of the table, i know of their activity from bid day until they place an order with us. so, i try and keep that in mind and then with our lead times now under very good control, i know exactly how long it takes to get from the date we book an order at the new price to get it on the plant floor and all of that is inside of the 6 months. so, every month, i'm looking at the 6-month outlook on these material cost. if there is any change within the month, then they raise the flag quicker, but otherwise, our normal activity is once a month. they furnish me an updated report that gives me the next 6 months. it's a calculus is to how we do this and knowing all of the timing events. then we have this so that we can do it.
what i have as of today, doesn't give me any indication for the next 6 months that i would have another price increase. i have the one coming june 1st that covers everything that i know for the next 6 months plus. because we announced that 2 to 3 months ago at the beginning march, a couple of months ago, that we announced that and so now i've got, let's say, 8 months runway that things are stable. there's been no changes in our outlook for the last 2 months. everything that i got on this latest report was captured the same 2 months ago. to your point, could we see other price increases? as of today, i don't see the necessity for that, but this could easily change if we have another big vessel lodged in the suez canal and can't get something here. i mean, all kinds of things could happen quickly, but what i'm most proud about this team is that they now have very, very good data points that they utilize to provide the calculus for a necessity for a price increase. hopefully, that answers your question.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
it does and i appreciate the color. hopefully, we don't see another blockage in the suez canal. but you're right, anything like that could happen. one other thing you mentioned i think is you called out k through 12 is something that you're seeing picking up on the new construction side. what about on the replacement side, is that something that should pick up in the summer time? some of the schools are out of session and are you seeing that in your bookings at this point in time?
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
we are, so k through 12, historically for us has been about 50% planned replace and 50% new. a lot of these bond issues, that we are beneficiary of, they will do some wing additions to schools to expand the school itself. they'd do some updating modernization of some existing schools and then they usually throw in building 2 or 3 new schools. we got an order and we're really thrilled with this. this particular school district has now been purchasing equipment from us on an annual basis for 13 years straight. they're in north texas. they purchased 811 units to be installed in '21 and this time, they were about 70% replacement and 30% new construction and that's why i am saying, it looks like our replacement is a bit higher than our new construction ratio that we were historically seeing.
that's only one school district, but i've seen a multitude of others and i was made aware at this sales conference last week of numerous school districts that had bond issues from last fall until as recently as 2 weeks ago out to the voters and all of these are being unanimously approved and the format of a lot of these bond issues is more replacement than new construction. i think that favorability of our equipment for that kind of end user is well recognized. i believe that our percentage of replacement business versus new construction will continue to grow on the replacement side, even though this new construction market might be somewhat depressed. we're going to do real well with this replacement. we're already doing real well with it.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. i guess you talked about you expected sequentially next quarter's gross margins to be closer to the mid-point of your 28% to 32% targeted range, is that all kind of related to volume absorption or is there any sales mix component?
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
it's mostly absorption, julio. it's mostly absorption. i mean you've got depreciation and things that are fixed cost. there're so many fixed cost that now our run rate, as we've added all of this production capability, it comes with a penalty called depreciation and we just put that new building in service in longview. that one's hitting us pretty good on that line and we're yet to recognize the revenue from that new building that it's capable of. now, i will say that the revenue from the longview manufacturing has continued to grow as a result of the new building and as a result of the efficiency gains that this traveling team from tulsa has been able to help collaborate with them on. their latest monthly revenue numbers are up, they've had a 21% increase in revenue as a result of the improvement in technique and the improvement of the new building. that's what we've recognized already, 21% over the best month that they never had prior to these things occurring. we believe that there is a whole lot more to be had.
bear in mind, we put over 100% more physical capability in place. you've got to get the people, you got to get them trained, you've got to get them to a level of efficiency, and that's why i say, it will take all year long to even approach what we dream is possible there, what we actually know is possible because of how we've done it before.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. then just last question for me here is just on the sg&a is up as a percentage of sales, which was expected. i think you called that out on the fourth quarter call, but is that kind of 150, 160 basis point or so increase representative of what we should expect throughout the year?
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
well, bear in mind that it could be higher actual dollar number and will be because of profit sharing, because that's in sg&a and recognized that in q1. we just issued profit sharing announcement yesterday and it was lower than any quarter in 2020 and so we're looking for a comparable, favorable q2 versus 20 favorable and should that occur, then the actual dollar spend on sg&a will be higher. now, as a percent of revenue and i haven't done the math on that.
rebecca thompson -- chief accounting officer & treasurer
yeah, i mean, i do think, it'll be up a little, mainly driven by our insurance premiums. since those went up $2 million year-over-year. so that will be a driver of our sg&a. then also looking forward into the second half of the year as the country opens back up, we anticipate our selling expenses in our travel will increase as well.
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
i'm proud to say, rebecca, it's already started. because i've had 3 major customer visits this week and i have one more today. we haven't had 3 customer visits in one week in over a year and these people are coming in 6, 8, 10 at a time and of course, we put them in hotels. we take them to dinner and there's expense with that. on top of the fact that we just had this sales retreat last week, we weren't able to have one in 2020, we had to cancel it.
rebecca thompson -- chief accounting officer & treasurer
right. sales expenses in 2020 were extremely low, just because we didn't have any of the normal activity that we will this year.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
makes sense. appreciate the color and thanks for taking the questions.
operator
we have our next question from jon braatz from kansas city capital.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
good afternoon, gary, rebecca. a question, gary, on the water source heat pump, when you started with the water source heat pump, the thought was that you're getting into a market it's maybe up to $500 million or something like that and the hope was to really take some share of that and i think last year, we did about $20 million in revenues in the water source heat pump. where do you stand today in terms of market opportunity, market potential of the water source heat pump? it just hasn't been fulfilling the expectations that we had earlier, but where do you stand at this time in terms of what's possible?
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
well, i haven't seen a summary of what today's current market dollar volume is. the number of units on ahri are down a few percentage points. so, the dollars, have to be down too. our number of units has been pretty steady. in fact, just the last month or two, it's grown just a bit and so we had validated a little over a 5% market share last year and i believe we're holding steady at 5 plus now and could be breaking through 6%. i won't see the final numbers on that for a few more days, but it's still in that mid-single digit range. it's not the 20% that we believed we were capable of obtaining. our biggest miss on that business was our marketing intelligence was what people want and everyone we were listening to was expert in new construction and our sales channel just was not expert in replacement. we positioned this product very well for new construction, it's very much appreciated. we've had that steady business. it grew at a very brisk pace at one time. then kind of leveled out and then the new construction market itself went down. for us, to stay steady, tells me we're getting an even higher percentage of the new construction business.
however, this replacement market, our sales channel partners were not well attuned to that market and so we've put in several support services to help them with that. we've hired 3 people in the last couple of years, 2 of them in the last year, they are expert in the aftermarket business. that's what their whole career has been. they're people i've known most of my career and have great respect for them. bringing those resources and to help the sales channel partners develop this, all the sales channel partners are with very little exception are dedicated to an aftermarket strategy and they are putting their resources behind this and so i believe that when our new product that is designed with the aftermarket in mind, the replacement market, when we get that product introduced to them, i believe, will resume growth and we'll catch up relatively quickly to the expectations.
again, we made a mistake there. we admit that mistake. i'll tell you, there is no sin in my book for making mistakes. there is a sin in my book of substantial note of not admitting them and not correcting them. while we've admitted the mistake, we've corrected the mistake and we're on the cusp of introducing that correction and seeing exactly how well that performs.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
okay. with those changes, that correction, do you think as you look back at 20% market penetration, do you think that's still a reasonable possibility?
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
it's absolutely reasonable. there is nothing changed in my mind on that. the reason is that the sales channel partners, the commitment they've made and the success that they've had thus far, tells me that it's very much in our grasp.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
okay. then the timeline, when do you think we might see some evidence of those gains?
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
we're not anticipating having a material impact on the number of units going out the door until q4. that might even be just a little early to be very optimistic about. the new product will be available on q4. there are a lot of them that have said that they want to have an immediate stock in their inventory of that product, because they think that's a good investment for them. so, we would very likely be building units that we sell to them. we don't inventory of them ourselves. we sell those units to them. we could be filling their stock in q4 and that's why i think there is a good opportunity to increase our number of units substantially and then there could be a little low because they stopped all their warehouses and then they've got to go out there and get their momentum going. so, it could be that we have a kind of the in-rush q4, a little bit of a low q1, and then we resume a good steady pace of business q2 next year. if we look at the year 2022 in whole, then we can look for some good solid double-digit percentages of growth like what we had the first 2 or 3 years that we were in this business. i mean the first 3 years, we were like a 100% growth year-over-year and then 77% and 57% and so we've seen how we can do that and we can supply that
a major difference now joh, is a lot of our early on time was learning how to use this manufacturing facility. so, now we've got a few years of using it. this product is a different configuration, but it's not a different manufacturing process.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
okay. when you look at it, i don't know if you can look at it in isolation, is up until this point is the water source heat pump paying its way?
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
no. that'll be foolish to say it was. when i look at it, no, it's not paying its way yet. i mean it is profitable, it's not a loser. but it is not at benchmark margins. because we don't have the volume to offset the depreciation cost and the fixed cost of that facility. if we were to double the volume, we would triple the percentage of net profit. because a lot of that profit comes at no additional fixed cost expense. so, we have to double that volume to get these things close to benchmark margin levels. the good thing about it now is even though the margin percentage is lower. it's not that big of a volume to where it's that big of a burden.
the other thing that i'll point out is when i came here, i had 30 years of experience in the sales channel. i've been selling aaon since 1990 and i did a pretty good job of it and so did my company, but because we were so mature with our presentation of aaon equipment in the markets that i really could visualize what the growth potential for those legacy products was in reference to my experience in my company.
while as i began consulting for aaon, i began to realize that substantial number of the sales channel partners were nowhere near that mature in their markets. but i didn't know exactly how that was going to come along and it's come along very nicely. my efforts in consulting back there in 13 to early16, those have all manifest themselves. the changes that i've made in the sales channel since i came on board here, the first of 16, those manifested themselves.
when i first came here, we had 6 regions and the different performance versus expectations was the lowest region was only reaching 65% of expectations. the highest region was about 5% over expectations. today, the range runs from 122% of expectations to 129% of expectations at this point in time. it is very much, very uniformed effort and results across all of north america right now. this sales channel improvement that we have been working on going all the way back. i mean, norm worked on it before me but i put my effort into it, starting in 2013. i mean it has paid off.
we have a good uniformed performing group across north america and by the way, every one of them is growing.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst

rebecca, floor is yours.
rebecca thompson -- chief accounting officer & treasurer
thank you, gary. i'd like to begin by discussing the comparative results for the three months ended march 31, 2021 versus march 31, 2020. net sales declined 15.8% to $158 million from $137.5 million. the first quarter of 2020 benefited from a high backlog that allowed the company to run at full capacity and set all-time record highs for net sales in the first quarter. the order intake began to slow in late 2020 and the company intentionally slowed production to keep its backlog at a healthy level. the year-over-year decline in net sales is primarily due to lost production days in january for planned maintenance and in february, due to impacts of bad weather. our gross profit decreased 22.8% to $33.2 million from $42.9 million. as a percentage of sales, gross profit was 28.6% in the quarter just ended compared to 31% in the first quarter of 2020. the production days we lost in the quarter resulted in an unfavorable labor and overhead efficiencies, including the company's ability to absorb certain fixed cost increase in our gross profit. selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 3% to $14.7 million from $15.2 million in 2020. as a percentage of sales, sg&a increased to 12.7% of total sales in the quarter just ended from 11.1% in the first quarter of 2020.
the increase in sg&a as a percent of sales was due to an increase in insurance premiums and salaries and benefits. income from operations decreased 33.6% to $18.5 million or 15.9% of sales from $27.8 million or 20.2% of sales in 2020. our effective tax rate decreased to 11.4% from 21.5%. the unusually low tax rate was mainly related to a $1.8 million increase in our excess tax benefits associated with stock awards. the company's estimated annual 2021 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, is expected to be approximately 27%. net income decreased to $16.4 million or 14.1% sales compared to $21.9 million or 15.9% sales in the first quarter of 2020. diluted earnings per share decreased by 26.8% to $0.30 per share from $0.41 per share.
turning to the balance sheet, you'll see that we had a working capital balance of $178.7 million versus $162 million at december 31, 2019. our unrestricted cash totaled $97 million at march 31, 2021. our current is approximately 3.7 to 1. our capital expenditures were $16.4 million for the quarter. we expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $70.7 million. the company has stock repurchases of $5.2 million during the 3 months ended march 31, 2021. shareholders' equity per diluted share is $6.93 at march 31, 2021 compared to $6.67 at december 31, 2020.
i'd now like to turn the call back over to our ceo and president, gary fields.
gary fields -- president & chief executive officer
good afternoon. overall, we're happy with the first quarter performance. it was in line with our expectations. unsurprisingly, sales were down year-over-year. but compared to fourth quarter, if you'll recall, when we had those announcements, i said that a good benchmark accomplishment for q1 would be if we essentially duplicated q4. because i had good visual of the backlog. so, we slowed the production down, probably the intentional portion was the longer shutdown around the holidays and that allowed us to get ahead on some pretty heavy-duty maintenance, but then we had to adverse weather. so, we ended up a little bit lower in revenue than what we actually thought we were going to do as a result of that weather shutdown too, but after the moderation in bookings in the end of 2020, the bookings began to pick up sharply right after the first of the year.
now, we did have a price increase that went into effect on january 11, 2021. so that's not unusual for january or any time to pick up bookings cadence right ahead of a price increase, but the fact that the bookings increase stayed very robust throughout the quarter told me that it was genuine growth in bookings. normally, the pull-forward from a price increase runs in the range of 30 to 45 days, and then it begins to kind of stabilize and see what the actual run rate is. so, i think, our bookings were up around 21% to 22% in q1 of '21 versus q1 of 20. that q1 of 20, bear in mind was largely unaffected by coronavirus. because the virus didn't really start slowing anything down until q2. so, this is a very strong indicator of our bookings performance for '21 and that booking performance has continued on that same trajectory up until right now. i mean it's still continues. it hasn't slowed down at all. so, they are strengthening a fair amount.
we're looking at backlog, on may 1st, 2021, it was $104.5 million. you got to recognize that we've got production turned up pretty good too. we're maintaining a really nice balance here between production levels and backlog levels. going back a few quarters, i said that the ideal backlog should be when we got our production capacity where we had planned it should be real close to $100 million. so, we're running along at just almost exactly the perfect backlog right now.
replacement business at this time of year is always stronger than new construction. this year is taking shape same as what we expected. lots to k through 12 schools are in the books right now being built. but on the new construction side, we're seeing a fair amount with data centers, large air condition warehouses for online retailers. some of that stuff is really picked up and there is quite strong. so, the growth business, agricultural growth. some of you might know, it is the cannabis business. it's what primarily what it is. additional states approved some measure of cannabis legalization back in the fall and responding to that were more of these facilities being built in more states and we are one of the companies that provided best practice hvac equipment for that industry several years ago now and we maintain a very strong position in that industry.
so architectural billing index had several months. i don't have in front of me, but it's somewhere around 10 months that we're below the benchmark of 50, which said that they had lower architecture billings. this normally translates into a slowdown in business for us. while we're not seeing it quite like the historic. because what causes billings to go down was not a normal activity. it was a very abnormal activity. what we have witnessed for certain and we've just concluded a sales conference with our leading representatives last week and validated this further. numerous projects in early to mid-2020 were put on pause, various reasons, some they couldn't man the projects because of coronavirus, some states wouldn't allow them to work, some they just we're uncertain what the outcome was and they had the opportunity to hit pause.
while those projects were designed, the plans were on the shelf ready to be utilized. they have hit the go button on numerous of those projects and that doesn't necessarily generate an architectural billing. so, this architectural billing index doesn't have the exact correlation that it does in normal times. so, we've seen a lot of projects come off of the storage shelf, put into the market, and these have resulted in orders for us. i do believe, at some point in time, that we're going to see a bit of dip because of the architectural billing index, because they just didn't bill work for a while. it has to show up, but it's not showing up in its traditional down mode for the indicator. architectural billing index has turned back positive the last month or two for sure. it's been above the benchmark of 50. i think this last one was when they close to 53, 52.8 or something like that. i think it was -- so, it's beginning to strengthen.
our sales channel partners tell us that their pipeline is very robust and that the orders coming to us are going to be steady. we had anticipated maybe orders would peak sometime in q2 going into q3, causing q4 to slow down as we've traditionally seen with our seasonality. we're not certain at this point in time if that's going to happen. because the pipeline seems to be pretty robust at this point now. that could change at any moment. but this is what we're looking at today.
looking at our various business segments, surprisingly, we've had some commercial and retail business that i frankly wasn't expecting. grocery stores continue to build and update and remodel. convenient stores continue to do the same thing. office buildings have been a bit soft, although non-existent, medical and healthcare are definitely picking up. go back early in the coronavirus occurrence when it was identified that the rural communities, the outlying communities, were very deficient in their capacity for healthcare. a lot of those facilities have been mothballed or the region expanded may had not yet supported them with localized healthcare. we're seeing a very nice influx of business due to that.
again, i had some customers in here just in the last day or two that we're focused on healthcare. these were end-user owners with their engineers and our sales channel partner representatives here and they're our west coast operation and they were planning a lot of facilities and they were here to look at our equipment and they left here with a very favorable impression. i expect that to turn into something good for us.
in the education market, i already spoke to k to 12, is very, very strong. one of the things that we're seeing, there has been some bond issues recently in various regions, as recently as a year ago, some of these were challenging to get past another passing easily and one of the key things in these bond issues is updating the hvac systems to be in accordance with best practices for virus mitigation indoor air quality. these are things that are very favorable for with the equipment that we manufacture.
manufacturing has really not had any material change to it. we still continue to supply equipment for manufacturers. it might be slightly curtailed or curved but not much. on the lodging front, we're seeing some replacement business, but not so much new business. not seeing a lot of new hotels built, a few here and there, but mostly we're seeing people pull forward on updating their hvac systems. again, they want to put these virus mitigation procedures into the units and the best way to do that oftentimes is update the unit.
that's kind of where we're at with our markets right now. again, just to recap, grow facilities and large warehouse air conditioning, both of these are stronger than what we've seen in the recent past. raw materials and component prices are definitely on the rise. we got a price increase in effect january 11. we have another one that goes into effect june 1. each one of these was 4% across the board and these were put in place to manage our expected material and component price increases and we believe that we are in a favorable position to offset all of those material price increases.
we continue to improve productivity here in the tulsa facility. we're operating now at about the most efficient, turning metal into profit that we've ever done. very proud of this team. they've worked very hard and we share the team here that accomplished that with our other primary manufacturing facility in longview. we got the new facility up and going about 60 days ago now. that's when we manufactured the first products in that and it has quite a ways to go to reach the efficiency that we believe were capable of, but the same team that helped identify all the practices that enabled this wonderful efficiency we have here in tulsa, they go down on a weekly basis. in fact, there's a group of them there today and they go down on a weekly basis, a whole group of them does, and spend one day and help that team down there and we've seen very nice results from that and we look forward to continuous improvement throughout '21, in both revenue production and efficiency.
both of those are going to improve in that facility throughout '21. i don't see us reaching the levels that we believe were capable of prior to the end of the year. our sales rep network, i mentioned earlier, we had a somewhat of a sales retreat last week, brought in a lot of the key sales channel leaders and the overall tenor of the meeting was very upbeat. they had very positive attitudes about the way we were doing business, the way we were supporting them, are shorter lead times. we very much appreciated. obviously, we've seen an improvement in quality over the past few years. you see that the warranty expense has continued to go down and stabilize. it's been very stable for about a year and a half now. they recognize that that makes their jobs lot easier.
bringing the lead times down to very attractive levels has afforded them opportunities that they wouldn't have otherwise and the overall tenor from the sales channel is very good and that's why i temper that going into this year, our expectations with q1 would mirror q4 of 20, but then that bell's curve of q2 and q3 being up and q4, maybe being back down a bit in relative terms. what they're lead me to believe is, if we do have a lower demand in q4 in production, it might not be substantially as we first anticipated. it's a little stronger out there than maybe what we anticipated back in the fall, when we were doing our annual planning.
the water source heat pump business is pretty stagnant for us right now. the product and we've talked about this before, but the product that we have is very favorable for new construction. we continue to have a steady demand for that product. but it is not a good fit for retrofit when there is a couple of manufacturers that had a very dominant position for 20 plus years and their units are the ones that are wearing out, needing to be replaced. our unit is not a wonderful direct replacement for it just due to its configuration. so we have designed a complete line of units to be 100% backward compatible with this huge installed base and we are optimizing that. it's probably well along toward completion and introduction. it will occur later this year and we believe that that will allow us to regain our growth position with water source heat pumps. because the dominating factor of the water source heat pump market today is replacement, not new construction.
our capex investments remain as we have talked about before, just a bit over $70 million. i believe that around $40 million of that $70 million is for accretive capacity and $30 million of that is for replacement, maintenance, and worn out things. i'm looking across the street today and beautiful things occurring. we have a crane over there, setting new aaon units on our eastside factory to be ahead of the curve and keep our employees well-conditioned and these all have the latest indoor air quality virus mitigation procedures installed in them.
indoor air quality and virus mitigation procedures remain a topic of conversation with every customer that comes in contact with us today. i think that when [indecipherable] published their best practices guidelines last summer and revised it two or three times with little tweaks, that everyone took notice of that. so, all replacement and all new construction, they're at least giving it the credence of thinking what should we be doing and it looks to me like a great many of these projects that they are including some form, if not all forms, of the best practices for virus mitigation.
we're optimistic heading into the second quarter. we're in the second quarter now. things are running smoothly. orders are coming in the door nicely and we believe that we will be in our best ratios for absorption of overhead and where we had said we want to manage our gross profit between 28% and 32%, in q1, we were just slightly above that 28%. i believe as we go through to second quarter here with better revenue, better production out the door, that we'll have better absorption and therefore we will be closer to that bullseye target of 30% or so.
with that i'm going to open up the call to any questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of julio romero with sidoti & company.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. so i guess my first question is just on the increased volumes in the quarter, the increased production. could you rank order the -- you talked about the return to historical employee historical employee levels and increased manufacturing capacity. can you just kind of rank order the two of those and talk about how they impacted volumes in the quarter?
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. well, first off, the new longview facility is so much more ideal than the old facility was that we're producing i think casual math said around 27%, 28% more with the same number of people. now we have more people there, so we're producing even more than that. but we've had a very nice gain in our longview facility with the new plant. and that is primarily related to the infrastructure and the arrangement. now we have added a few people in view versus a year ago. they are in the positive range by maybe 20 to 30 people, i think is what it is. in tulsa, however, we're down probably 30 or 40 people versus last year on the plant floor. and yet we're producing at a very, very high level here as well. and that is an attribute to the manufacturing engineering group and the manufacturing group that have separately gone through and refined all of our processes cleaned up a lot of [indecipherable] things that we knew were beneficial to the company that would make us more efficient.
so we're several percentage points more efficient with that labor here. we measure it on dollars of revenue per person on the plant floor and that dollars of revenue per person on the plant floor let me had to calculate it here real quick, and i'll give you a percentage on that because i know what those numbers are. it's about 8% in revenue dollars on the plant floor, and this is absent of the price increase. i took that into account in that calculation. this is actual material going out the door. so to answer your question, if we had more people, we would go up linearly because the infrastructure is in place, everything is here. we could use about 200 people in tulsa and about another 50 in longview, and we would generate very nice revenue with those very nice profits because we absorbed a lot of the fixed cost.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. and just thinking about the order growth, it's it's very robust, obviously, sequentially for the last two quarters. and you touched on the increased manufacturing capacity, how labor stands today? i guess, given all that, how do you see orders trending sequentially throughout the next few quarters?
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, i think the rate that we're booking will maintain relatively steady for the next couple of quarters according to the intelligence we've gathered from our sales channel partners and what they tell us is in the pipeline. there's many drivers to that, but one of the key drivers is our lead time, whereas a couple of years ago, our lead time is very onerous to our efforts. and our sales channel partners told us we lost over $100 million in bookings opportunity because of that poor lead time. they had to turn that many orders down. well, this year, we're not up $100 in whatever million in bookings, but we're approaching that. we're somewhere around $80 million above last year, i think.
rebecca thompson -- vice president of finance, chief financial officer & treasurer
yes, i think, yes.
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
and so i think lead time has been a very motivating factor to that. now there are people that have always wanted aaon equipment, and we're even willing to pay for it that they weren't willing to wait for it. that's the people that are different this year than we're a couple of years back. so we have a handle on the production needs. we have surplus capacity in the infrastructure. and now that we have behind us the federal government subsidy to people not working seems that we're maybe gaining a little ground on that. that only ended about five weeks ago here in oklahoma and also in texas. it was right at the end of june. but we've seen a very noticeable increase in applicants and qualified applicants. so i have great confidence that we will continue to service our market with acceptable or even appreciative lead times. people appreciate the lead times that we have.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. and just to clarify, the rate of bookings could continue to rise sequentially?
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
the rate of bookings, i believe, is going to stay relatively steady. so if we would look at our rate year-to-date on bookings, then it looks like that stays relatively steady. unlike normally, about this time of year, we see a decline in bookings rate. but at this point in time, we've not seen a decline in bookings rate and the pipeline is telling us it's going to remain at this steady rate.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
and you're looking at that from a year-over-year basis or
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
i'm looking at that for the past six months basis for a rate.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. okay. i guess i'm missing what could go wrong? i mean everyone is suffering from industrywide supply chain -- constraint [indecipherable] i don't know.
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
but what could go wrong list -- that's extensive. i mean, we got this delta variant that's going around. one of our plugs of 2020 that could come into a blessing of 2021 is we had a significant number of our people on the plant floor that had coronavirus in 2020. if you'll recall from about mid-june to mid-july we lost hundreds of people that either had it or thought they had it and decided to stay out. the other thing is that we had vaccinations available here at the plant. we had a healthcare facility that brought mobile vaccinations into the plant, and we had several hundred people that took advantage of that.
so i don't know what our percent vaccination is out there. but if i was to make just a little bit of [indecipherable] math guess and say between those that have had the virus and that have been vaccinated, i'd say we're -- we've got hard immunity, we're looking real good. we do have a spot here and there where we've got a couple of people out even at this point in time. but something like i could definitely rear its ugly head again. supply chain, we are in a very, very good position. i sat down with that group earlier this week to review everything. we have an unusually large inventory right now. if you look through the [indecipherable], you'll see what's our inventory, $83 million, $87 million, something like that. $87 million, that's not ideal in terms of best use of cash, you'd like for that to be more like 10% of revenue, it should be down in the $50 million, $60 million range.
but i'm going to tell you, in 2021, i'm the proudest guy on the block to have $87 million because i can build equipment. and we've had some irritants from supply chain, but we haven't had anything that's plagued this and shut us down and some of these things. but there's a myriad of things that are going out there that are you've never seen before. maybe you've seen them and they came back. but we have a high level of confidence. we went through 2020 with around 10% growth in the face of all of our competitors essentially were down 15%, 20%, 25%. so we operated navigated through that very nasty rough condition better than most. and so i think this team is very strong, very capable and that we are continuing to navigate through all those obstacles with great skill.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
and just last one, i just -- you mentioned $87 million of inventory. i imagine all things considered in this environment, you've got to have a little more inventory than you need than not. i mean how are you thinking about those inventory levels?
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
absolutely. i went through there. we have not had any supply chain issues that have slowed us down we have had a buffer. so when we had one of our suppliers of compressors that was having problems getting some insignificant little component that kept them from completing a compressor for instance. and they said, we're going to be delayed two, three weeks on this next shipment. well, i had four months of inventory here of that particular compressor. and so that two or three weeks didn't do anything to us, it was [indecipherable]. these people that are running closer to just in time on their inventory, they're sitting there looking at a bunch of units they can't build.
so i'm very proud of what our our purchasing department and logistics control department has done in keeping us ahead of these issues. steel is another one. i hear people talking about, oh, i can't get steel. we don't not only have this place full fee on warehouses full of steel, already paid for waiting on us. so we're in very good shape.
julio romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. i'll hop back into queue and thanks for taking the questions.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of jon braatz with kansas city capital.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
good morning everyone. gary, i have a question maybe norm can chime in, too. we saw a dramatic shift in the mix in this quarter to a lot of lower-priced units. i guess, historically, have you seen such a shift before? and is it being driven by the replacement market? business being so strong?
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
it's being driven by two things, jon. and it's being driven this quarter that we just ordered was driven by the k-12 school business. and a significant portion of that was replacement versus new. so what happened there, in my opinion, was the demand for better indoor air quality. the things that are added that aaon has a very, very strong capability of our inherent design, very desirable. a lot of schools said we're going to replace our units. and we want aaon units, and we had lead time available. we have the kind of equipment that they wanted available, and we were able to service that. we got one order from one school district in north texas that was 811 units, and there were only like five skus whole thing. this is what generated more of those small units was that k-12 business that we serviced.
norman h. asbjornson -- founder & executive chairman
we don't get [indecipherable].
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
all right. the -- would you -- gary, would you expect that to continue that at mix?
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, i think the mix will bounce out to more traditional going for the rest of the year. it's still going to be biased somewhat toward the smaller units for a little while, but it will start swinging back toward midsize to larger units as a higher percentage of the mix the balance of the year because we've completed delivery on the vast majority of those schools. now a lot of that delivery took place in july and august, so the first 1.5 months, two months of this quarter. and that's why i say it's beginning to swing now. when i look at the line rates for the various manufacturing lines that make the different size units, i'm seeing the smaller unit line, the daily rates slowed down just a little, the midsize and larger line pick up a little. so this is kind of a balancing quarter right here. in q4, i think, will be spot on normal from everything i can see.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
okay. okay. secondly, last night, i went back and looked at some of the early things i made -- i wrote on the water-source heat pump. and at the time when it was first introduced the opportunity was around $100 million, and that was over a three- to five-year time frame. and gary, we're sitting at $25 million now maybe for the full year. i think that's sort of what my numbers show. manufacturing doesn't seem to be a problem anymore. how is is it going to -- what is it going to take to get the $100 million. is that still a goal has things changed maybe competitively or anything like that, that maybe is going to make it tougher to get to that $100 million? is that really still an opportunity?
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
it is absolutely still an opportunity, and i've described it for the past two or three quarters. what we did was we sat down and went for a clean sheet design, took all the input from the market on all the desirable features and characteristics that they wanted. and that's what we designed and introduced and we were a bit naive to the fact that about 75% of the overall market due to 75% is replacement market. and when they replace these the configuration needs to be as near identical as possible because they have minutes or hours to replace these things, not days and weeks. and so we didn't take that into account with our initial design. now our initial design has maintained a very nice rate of sale where we have people that like all those characteristics we designed into it.
so we're going to continue to offer our initial design because it is very -- like you said, about $25 million a year. but in order to get to that bigger part of the market, and those numbers work out exactly right. if it's 25% new construction and 75% replacement market and we need to be at $100 million, we're at 25% of that. like 80-something of our units are going in new construction near -- i mean, near all of our units are going into new construction. so we have -- we're closing in on finishing the design testing implementation of a backwardly compatible ideal replacement unit. we're having a sales meeting in early october in great line, texas. it's our intention and our goal to introduce that new line to our sales channel partners there.
we only have a national sales meeting for two or three years. we make sure that when we do that we've got a significant number of advancements and new things to share with them. and so that's where we're at this year. and this water source heat pump line will be shared with about 1,000 sales channel partners, individuals in october, if that's a three-day sales meeting. and i look for 2022 to resume the growth of the water source heat pipe business.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
okay. so the design and the manufacturing is all completed or nearly completed so that you'll be right to do beginning of the year?
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. i checked in on that again earlier this week to make sure that our october sales meeting, we would have all the testing, all the data, all the marketing materials, everything for a full rollout. we will have a full rollout in early october, if that sales may be complete, ready to go.
jon braatz -- kansas city capital -- analyst
okay. alright, gary thanks very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david derman with green summit.
david derman -- green summit -- analyst
i wanted to make sure i understood your thinking in terms of how much backlog in terms of weeks of revenues you're looking to keep. i don't remember exactly. i think in the past, you had wanted to keep maybe somewhere in the round of eight weeks of capacity in backlog, but it seems like that's a moving target as you ramp up your capacity and your production and efficiency. so could you update us on that, please?
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, your numbers are almost exactly right. ideal backlog would be about eight weeks because our production continues to increase. now we've got substantial infrastructure in place that we don't have enough personnel to fully utilize. so our ramp-up is much quicker now than it has been in the past. three, four years ago, we were behind on infrastructure. and that's why we built the new building in longview, which was a three-year endeavor start to finish. and that's why we went through and cleaned up the tulsa facility and added a lot of production here. so we can ramp up faster than we could in the past. but our ideal backlog right now would be eight weeks. now i will tell you there's a little peril with eight weeks across the board. your high-volume moving products. they're smaller-sized units.
that's not a problem whatsoever. six weeks, eight weeks is all the same. it's fine. but when you start getting into the larger-sized units that you have lower volumes, then it's really hard to have an inventory, some of the unique parts that it takes to build those units. and the supply chain being a little cloudy right now for some of those low-volume components makes it a little more difficult. i will say as a total tranche eight weeks is ideal. but if i divided that up from product lines, the smaller lines would be six weeks and the larger lines would be maybe 10 or 12 weeks.
david derman -- green summit -- analyst
okay. so at [indecipherable] right now, you look like you're about call it, 12 weeks on back of the envelope math where backlog and sales are roughly similar right now?
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so right now, our published lead times across the border with rare exception or 10 weeks. and the reason for that is project planning. so some of this backlog we have due to project planning they have the order in here, but we allow them to put a date that's longer than lead time so that they get their spot in the waiting line. we've got some projects that have been delayed because they can't staff them, so they've moved a little bit. but if you looked at it in simple, like you said, back of the envelope math, it does look like somewhere around 12 weeks. but when you look at it on our production schedule, you'll see that we've published in 10 weeks and everything is in the green, very little in the red as far as being tardy versus commitment.
david derman -- green summit -- analyst
got it. and if i understood your comments earlier in the call appropriately, your looking for your orders signed to continue at roughly at a similar pace in the second half of the year that they signed in the first half of the year. and very simple math, you signed about $320 million in orders in the first half of the year. so if i assume something similar in the second half, it's another $320 million, you thought your sales may maintain at roughly their current rate, which is, call it, $280 million, $290 million. it seems like another $30 million or $40 million of backlog might accrue. so your backlog might end up. it seems like closer to 11 to 12 weeks, if i'm understanding.
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
we've got the bookings a little off. looking today, august 5, year-to-date total is $335 million.
david derman -- green summit -- analyst
that is through august 5th. that's really helpful.
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. yes, that's through august. so i think when you go back and cycle that through, let's see here, that's -- i don't have -- i've got a month-to-date average, but i don't have a year-to-date average. i see that, that's plus $91 million versus a year ago. i don't know how many days in the year there is to august 5.
david derman -- green summit -- analyst
it's 217 days. so if i'm just doing simple...
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
35 divided by 2017. give me that one, while you're doing the math.
david derman -- green summit -- analyst
sorry, yes, i took the $365 million on 2017 gets you to -- if i'm following orders signed of, call it, $615 million or so.
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, it's $335 million, not $365 million.
david derman -- green summit -- analyst
i was doing strict days [indecipherable]
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
i got you, i got you. okay. well, and we only have 355 days. we have 10 days of holidays that we don't book.
david derman -- green summit -- analyst
okay. okay. so if i call it $600 million plus or minus of bookings, revenues to date are, call it, $260 million plus you're thinking you might do roughly another $290 million in the back half of the year roughly. would get you to about the [indecipherable] it would be roughly equivalent, i guess, for the back half where you wouldn't really expand dramatically.
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
that's what i -- that was my math.
david derman -- green summit -- analyst
i really appreciate you helping me.
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
yeah.
david derman -- green summit -- analyst
yes, there's a lot -- obviously, you guys are ramping pretty rapidly. so it's helpful to understand. well great, thank you.

good morning, ladies and gentlemen. welcome to aaon, inc. second quarter sales and earnings call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the meeting over to gary fields, ceo and president. please go ahead.
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
good morning. thank you for joining us. [operator instructions]. today, joining me on the call, our executive chairman, norm asbjornson; and our chief financial officer, rebecca thompson. rebecca will open by reviewing our financial performance. rebecca, please?
rebecca thompson -- vice president of finance, chief financial officer & treasurer
thank you, gary. i'd like to begin by discussing the comparative results for the three months ended june 30, 2021 versus june 30, 2020. net sales increased 14.6% to $143.9 million from $125.6 million. the year-over-year increase was driven by a robust replacement demand broadly across our nonresidential building market. higher production rates were also a contributing factor as we did not experience covid-related absence employee absences like we did in 2020. also the percent price increase we implemented in early january was a driving factor. all these items are partially offset by changes in the product mix to lower-priced units.. our gross profit increased 10.4% to $42.1 million from $38.1 million.
as a percentage of sales, gross profit was 29.3% in the quarter just ended compared to 30.4% in the second quarter of 2020. the slight decline in gross profit was mainly related to higher material costs. billing, general and administrative expenses increased 6% in to $16.9 million from $15.9 million in 2020. as a percentage of sales, sg&a decreased to 11.7% of oil in the quarter just ended from 12.7% in the second quarter of 2020. sg&a as a percent of sales decreased as we did not have the $1.25 million donation we made in 2020 to winifred public school. income from operations increased 13.6% to $25.2 million or 17.5% of sales from $22.2 million or 17.7% of sales in 2020. our effective tax rate was decreased to 18.3% from 20%. the lower tax rate was mainly related to lower corporate income tax rates in the state of oklahoma that were signed into law during the quarter.
this resulted in a onetime benefit of $0.8 million. the net estimated annual 2021 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, is expected to be approximately 25%. net income increased to $20.6 million or 14.3% of sales compared to $17.8 million or 14.2% of sales in the first quarter of 2020. diluted earnings per share increased by 11.8% to $0.38 per share from $0.34 per share in 2020. turning to the balance sheet. you'll see that we had a working capital balance of $180.6 million versus $161.2 million on december 31, 2020. unrestricted cash totaled $111.4 million at june 30, 2021, up from $79 million at the end of 2020. our current ratio is approximately 3.3:1. our capital expenditures were $33.2 million for the six months ended june 30, 2021.
we expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $70 million. the company had stock repurchases of $10.3 million during the six months ended june 30, 2021. shareholders' equity per diluted share is $7.14 at june 30, 2021, compared to $6.67 at december 31, 2020. i'd now like to turn the call back over to our ceo, president, gary fields.
gary fields -- president, chief executive officer & director
i'd like to start off by saying that the second quarter was a bit better than we expected. organic sales were up year-over-year, nearly [indecipherable] and this is quite noteworthy for us because we're not facing the same easy comparison to 2020 that some of our nonresidential market competitors experienced. a great deal of the competitors peers in the hvac market were down in the 20% to 25% range in 2020. so it's an easy upside for '21 for them. on the other hand, we were up 5% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the year before. so compared to our second quarter of '19, which is where i'd really like to go back and talk about because that takes us pre-coronavirus. our sales in second quarter '21 were up over 20% versus '19. looking at it the same way the industry sales as an industry were down either flat to slightly down versus 2019.
so this is quite an accomplishment that we've achieved. the other thing is we ended the year with our backlog at a lower level than was ideal. we had ramped up production significantly, which was a great thing, and the orders had slowed down a bit. while orders resumed right after the first of the year on a brisk pace. the backlog on june 30, 2021 is $138.1 million, up 35% up year-over-year and 43% up over the end of the first quarter. the orders are up year-over-year 70% in the second quarter. so we see no demand slowdowns whatsoever. talking to our sales channel. the pipeline is very robust. and so we're in real good shape going forward. [indecipherable] backlog was only slightly down from the end of june, but they still in the $130 million range. i think it was $134 million. so we're maintaining a brisk pace of manufacturing as evidenced by the record quarter bookings are very brisk back is very robust.
and so going forward, the rest of the year, we're looking at things to stay steady to maybe slightly strengthening. if the labor market was just a little more favorable for us to get more people then we would be prepared to accelerate even more. but we're in a very tight labor market right now. and i think that's industrywide. i hear a lot of people talking about it. so i want to say that the replacement market demand has been much, much stronger. historically, aaon had been about 50% replacement, 50% new construction. thus far this year, we're running in the low to mid-60% range, i think 64% to 68% swinging back and forth through there on replacement. and this is been a dedicated of ours that we put in distinct sales channel guidance to and support to make this happen and we're seeing the results, and we're very pleased with that. now the new construction outlook is bright as it's been in a very, very long time. architecture billing index index construction starts, all of these indexes are up substantially.
architectural billing index has been up for several months in a row now. i think it's approaching five months that architectural billing index has been up. and i think that dodge analytics support that it's actually getting into construction. so we're looking at all of our segments as we normally distribute the commercial and retail is actually a little better than we anticipated. office buildings are not horrible. they're not great. medical and healthcare is much, much stronger than it's been in the past. of course, education has always been a very strong thing for aaon, continues to be. and with the focus on indoor air quality and some federal funding to help them with that, we look for that to continue and accelerate manufacturing has been just kind of decent, i won't call it good or bad. lodging, again, has been a bit of a surprise. not only if we renovated through the replacement market, a lot of lodging facilities, we're actually seeing a few new ones being built.
so that's kind of where our markets are not. i guess i left one out, the growth facility market. that's been more robust in '21 than it had been in the recent few quarters. so our margins continue to march on. we were 29.3% versus 30.4% a year ago. it was a little softer than we hoped. but over considering inflationary pressures, i think we did a very good job where we have materials that were costing us more, we gained labor efficiency, manufacturing efficiency. the way we measure our manufacturing efficiency inside here, we picked up several percentage points of improvement. the cost of goods sold materials components were down year-over-year 1%. the june and september price increase -- those have positioned us to maintain or possibly improve our gross margin in the second half. we expect most of that to happen in the fourth quarter and going into q1 of '22. so our timing typically, because our lead times average somewhere around eight weeks, maybe 10 weeks.
so when we have a price increase, it takes eight to 10 weeks to flush the existing backlog through and get the new backlog on the plant floor. so just tying that june 1, we had the price increase. so about today would be about when we would start seeing that price increase hit the floor. so roughly half of q3, you'll see that 4% price increase. we did have some pressures with some additional wage wages increase. we did this to maintain a competitive position in the labor market. we have had some success with that, and i look for continued success. i think we're doing an excellent job of managing sg&a. it's just up 6% but 15% sales growth. so that was not a linear tracking. it was less than that, which is always a great thing. both tulsa and longview have seen general productivity improvements. the ad headcount across both operations combined is down about 5% year-over-year. the longview headcount is up.
the new building that we put in, we were able to get ahead of the curve and get some people in, and tulsa's headcount is slightly down. so we've seen market share gains in multiple areas. our water-source heat pump sales were up 69% versus this time last year. we got the newest ahri data just yesterday, and it showed about 1.5% of the market gain. so we were going from about 6% to 7.4%, i think is what it was. parts sales. this is another wonderful occurrence for us. this was a very focused activity along with our replacement market. we've put in some very nice enhancements for the sales channels and support structures and some planning structures. so parts sales are up 42% year-over-year. now last year, parts sales were down at this time, people weren't working on the building so much. so i don't have how that's relevant to 2019 other than i can tell you that parts sales are at a record level.
so i know that we're well ahead of '19 and '20. air handlers and condensing units the sales were up 38%. this is reflective of a couple of things. one is our product has become more and more appreciated because we have air source heat pump that has some very, very good operating characteristics to control humidity as well as be a heat pump in some larger sizes. the other thing is the new facility that we built in longview has given us the capacity to meet the demand. we are ramping up that facility and doing quite well with that. so we're going to continue to invest. i think rebecca said that we expect to spend $70 million in '21, and we were in the mid- low to mid-30s -- 33 at this point. so that will be both refreshing some equipment that's a little slower or on aged out and also a little bit of accretive manufacturing capacity. so heading into the second half of the year, we're quite optimistic.
orders and backlog trends are strong. while there's some inflation headwinds that are a little bit of a challenge, we think we're ahead of that with our team. and so we believe that our margins will improve slightly throughout the year and end the year just slightly above our traditional target. in general, we expect sales and earnings to improve all through the second half of the year and going into the first part of next year because the 5% price increase across the board goes into effect september 1, and we're not going to see that in the plant floor until the very end of core, and it will be more material in q1 of '22. unlike most years where we've had a little bit of a bell curve, where q1 and q4 were down several percentage points in revenue versus q2 and q3, we're looking for q3 to be at least comparable to q2 with a slight increase.
and we're looking at q4 to -- in all likelihood be comparable to that. so we've kind of hit a rhythm here that we're looking for two, three and four to be a stack up relatively close to each other with maybe slight undulations but nothing substantial. it won't be because we don't have the orders and the bookings that will be things that are totally outside of that, like q4 has more holidays in it than q3. so we'll be one or two days short of manufacturing because we do manufacture seven days a week in that will affect it by a few dollars. but otherwise, i think we're in very, very good shape. so we will take any questions now.

operator
[operator instructions] first question from the line of julio romero. your line is open.
julio alberto romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
so just to start on the labor front. at tulsa last quarter, i think you mentioned you were down 30 to 40 employees year-over-year. where do you stand today in terms of year-over-year headcount at tulsa?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
exactly flat in tulsa. so we've gained those 30 or 40, and we're plus 12% in longview.
julio alberto romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. great. and on the price increases, i think year-to-date, you had january, june and september 1. did you have another increase post september one take effect?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
no. you're correct. they were january 11, june 1, september 1, taking effect. we announced one in late september that takes effect january one of '22.
julio alberto romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. understood. and i guess it looks like your lead times extended somewhat, but on a relative basis, it looks like the delta between your lead times and your competitors has widened since last quarter. is that a fair characterization?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
absolutely fair. so a couple of things to bear in mind. if you look at the production rate and you looked at the absolute backlog right now, our lead times would reflect a little longer than what we're actually doing. the reason for that is some of the projects can't receive the equipment in accordance with our lead time. we're quicker than the projects. there's a lot of trouble out there in the world right now getting projects to a point where they can accept the units. so we do our best to accommodate that. so it spreads our backlog out a little more than you just can't take the backlog, divide it by the production number and come up with the actual lead time. but we are running 10 weeks on a lot of units, 12 weeks on some more units. i'd say probably 12 weeks categorize as the majority of our production for rooftop units. we're probably closer to 10, maybe eight to 10 weeks on our longview products. this compares to some of our competitors, all of them are well into the 20s and 30s, and we've even heard 50 weeks from some.
julio alberto romero -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. that's good color there. and i guess just last one for me here is the orders have continued to be strong and that's kind of in line with last quarter's commentary that you expected orders to trend steady. and it sounds like the outlook isn't really unchanged. so i guess how long do you think you continue this trend of really robust orders?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, we had this sales meeting, as i spoke to you about earlier here so to the group earlier. we had 500 sales channel partners attend that meeting, and the consensus among them was it's never been better. their pipeline is absolutely robust. the fact that we have products that are now attractive for the cold climate that are decarbonized, 100% electric, that is a motivating factor. this new water-source heat pump that addresses the replacement market was a motivating factor. the support that we've given, the marketing tools that we give them are all motivating factors. and they said their pipeline is very robust and they expect a high percentage of closure rate on that pipeline. so given that, we're forecasting things to stay really strong. so our total bookings year-over-year are up about 66%.
operator
[operator instructions] next question from the line of brent thielman. you line is open.
brent edward thielman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
gary, i guess just following up on that. given i'm trying to think about this in a sense given the sort of the shorter-term challenges that you're dealing with and everybody else is dealing with. i guess when does this cause you to pull the reins in at all, at least temporarily in terms of orders? or is it just the fact that the lead times in the industry are so far out you can still capture market share and continue to take orders at the pace you are? i just wanted some more color there.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
i don't have any tendency to pull back on the reins. i have a tendency to figure out how to using the horse analogy, which you know on the horseman. i have a tendency to lay the spurs to the production facility and get it to catch up. we've made a lot of strides in that regard. the one critical thing was back in '18 and starting into '19 when we had these similar issues where we had a large backlog and we had production that was not meeting expectations, it was generated by infrastructure issues. we didn't have enough salinity machines. we didn't have a lot of organizational things. we spent a lot of time correcting that. you saw that in q4 of '19, where we rebounded.
we came all the way through '20 very nicely. so our infrastructure still has surplus capacity beyond what our backlog is with ideal lead times. so we have the manufacturing capacity. we've had a change in recruiting practices. we've had a change in leadership of bhr department with some fresh new ideas. and we're making headway with that. i mean when you say, well, we were down 30 or 40 people and now we're just up flesh with a year ago, we got those 30 or 40. i promise you i have friends and other manufacturing industries that would love to be flush with how many people they had a year ago or two years ago. so we're making headway with that.
and we believe that we'll have adequate head count. our concerns for -- that impacted q3 and will impact q4 just slightly were supply chain. and they were last-minute notifications of supply chain issues, but given the effort of the purchasing department, coupled with the engineering department to qualify some additional vendors, those were resolved. so it's a matter of those new vendors that we attained spooling up. now they've all sent sample materials in here to be tested, and that was part of the qualification. so that's all completed now. so we have small shipments coming but accelerating. so throughout q4, we'll accelerate that supply of things that were interrupted and will be fully recovered on that by the end of the year.
so that's why we're saying, first off, q4 has a few last production days due to all the holidays than does q3. and then october was somewhat impacted by this supply chain little interruption. and so q4 is probably going to look pretty close to q3 on revenue, plus or minus a little bit. and -- but the margin will be better because the backlog had better priced equipment in it. so going into q1, i'm very, very happy with what's going on. and we're thinking that q1 will be back in our target range plus on margins, and we'll be back to increasing revenue. and so we're pretty bullish on it.
brent edward thielman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
well, that was my next question. so you got that one. i guess just so i understand it, i mean i think you talked about steel in one component of this. what are some of the big ticket items that have been challenging from a supply chain standpoint?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, copper tubing. that's the one that did it. so we manufacture our own coils, and we manufacture those in longview. and we have a copper supplier that stub their toe. and we used a different copper supplier for our tulsa facility. and when we presented them the opportunity to also supply our longview facility, they stepped up and said, yes. and so then we found a couple of additional suppliers beyond them so that we had back up to the backup, if you will. so there was a backup plan there. it's just that we would have appreciated a little notice that they were going to have trouble delivering, not the day it's supposed to be here, say, oh, it's not coming.
brent edward thielman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. what about trucking and freight?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
i'm not hearing anything that's problematic. i think they would let me know if it was. we have -- the vast majority of what we ship, we ship on -- we contract for the freight, and we add it to the invoice for the the product we ship. we ship nearly everything truckload, probably a small percentage of less than truckload. normally, it's mixed. it's not a dedicated truck. it will all be aaon units, but it might be two or three locations that it's going to. so that company, we've had a 20-plus year relationship with, and they have performed marvelously for us.
same thing, we send them to pick up a lot of our materials. so we use -- actually, it's two trucking companies, but one is more predominant than the other one. we have controlled that very well, long relationship. i don't know how they're treating their other customers. they're a very, very high character, high integrity company. so i bet their treatments all the same. but they've told us, we have to pay a lot more for truck drivers now than we did. so this really goes back to early 2020. they had to raise their rates to truck drivers. i don't want to be quoted for sure on it, but i think it was in the relative order of 25% that they had to increase their rates that they were paying their drivers. and of course, that passed on to us, and we were able to pass it on, but we're not having any issues that i've been made aware of.
brent edward thielman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yes. okay. maybe the last one. i mean i know you've got the new introduction on the water-source heat pump side, which is pretty exciting. any -- i mean, any qualitative or if you want to quantitative thoughts and targets for '22 for the business? how you think about that?
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
it's too early to talk about what that's going to do. now that we have it out there, i'd really like a quarter to see how that soaks in. this is a real good time right now to have them -- i mean it was key that we had this thing ready to go here right away. and so we'll probably be better prepared to talk about how those orders are coming in. so i know that our backlog is up 30% year-over-year on water-source heat pumps. so something is already trending in the right direction. and i don't know that there was that many days that we made that product available that, that could impact it. but i'd really like to hold off on forecast and not because i don't want to miss the market, right now, the target is too blurry.

rebecca a. thompson -- chief financial officer
thank you, gary. i'd like to begin by discussing the comparative results of the three months ended september 30, 2021 versus september 30, 2020. net sales increased 2.8% to $138.6 million from $134.8 million. the year-over-year increase was fully driven by price increases and a favorable product mix, partially offset by unit volumes, which were down approximately 11.2%. the decline in unit volumes is mainly a result of a very tight labor market that limited the company's ability to ramp up production. our gross profit decreased 11.8% to $36 million from $40.8 million. as a percentage of sales, gross profit was 26% compared to 30.3% in the third quarter of 2020. the decline in gross profit was related to increases in material costs and wages rising quicker than our price increases could counter act. inefficiencies caused by minor supply chain disruptions and covid-19 absenteeism in the quarter, which reduced our production of coil.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% to $15.9 million from $14.7 million in 2020. as a percentage of sales, sg&a increased to 11.5% of total sales from 10.9% in the third quarter of 2020. sg&a as a percent of sales increased primarily due to the lower unit volumes. income from operations decreased 22.9% to $20.1 million or 14.5% of sales from $26.1 million or 19.4% of sales in 2020. our effective tax rate increased 22.5% from 21.8%. net income decreased to $15.6 million or 11.2% of sales compared to $20.5 million or 15.2% of sales in the third quarter of 2020. diluted earnings per share decreased by 23.7% to $0.29 per diluted share from $0.38 per diluted share in 2020. turning to the balance sheet.
you'll see that we had a working capital balance of $196.4 million versus $161.2 million at december 31, 2020. cash and cash equivalents totaled $101.8 million at september 30, 2021, up from $79 million at the end of 2020. our current ratio is approximately 3.6:1. our capital expenditures were $42.6 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2021. we expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $60 million. the company had stock repurchases of $15 million during the nine months ended september 30, 2021. shareholders' equity per diluted share is $7.46 at september 30, 2021, compared to $6.61 at december 31, 2020.
i'd now like to turn the call back over to gary fields, our ceo and president.
gary d. fields -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, overall, as far as sales and earnings go, 3q performance was disappointing. labor shortages, supply chain constraints both restricted our ability to ramp up production as much as we would have liked. this resulted in lower unit volumes and inefficient leverage of our fixed cost. material inflation also challenged our margins, but the production constraints really magnified the effect of the higher cost. all in, the top line was softer than expected due to various production constraints, which resulted in the weaker-than-expected margins. backlog at september 30 of $181.8 million was up year-over-year, 114% and up 32% from the end of the second quarter.
what's really astounding is orders up year-over-year 60% in third quarter. this is really impressive, especially when considering our orders were up year-over-year 18% in third quarter of 2020. most of the industry saw much easier comps than we did. we see no sign of the demand slowing. the replacement market demand is very strong. new construction actually has hit the lowest point of its -- since the pandemic started in this quarter. but on the positive outlook is architectural billing index, dodge index, construction starts, all the various indexes we look at are all very, very positive. and we're looking at the new construction market to rebound.
but we have gained a tremendous amount of market share as the year has gone on here. we're seeing this fairly well distributed across all of our traditional markets. we've seen a little more strength in medical and healthcare and in growth facilities than we have in the previous past year or so. we want to give you an update on the sales channel and talk to you about some product introductions. we hosted a national sales meeting in october. feedback from the sales channel was it was the most appreciated and best sales meeting that aaon had ever conducted. i think this tells you a whole lot about the marketing tools that we have been building to strengthen our marketing efforts. one of those, we displayed our new mobile marketing unit, which is an 18-wheeler style truck and trailer, very much in alignment with what you'd see at, say, a nascar event in their merchandising.
the trailer expands on both sides. it will accommodate about 40 people inside in an air conditioned environment. it's got a 26-foot long touch screen in there that we display videos. we did extensive work with a company to develop videos that will display both our -- well, multiple things, but our manufacturing style and manufacturing facilities. but most impressively, our norman asbjornson innovation center. that is our r&d laboratory that we're quite proud of, and it displays all of that. aftermarket parts and services continue to strengthen. that's another tool that we have worked with our sales channel. and our training programs are very much appreciated and they're gaining momentum, and we're seeing a lot of benefit from the training programs we've had in place for now five years.
as far as new product introductions, we've spoken quite a lot about the next generation of water source heat pump. now this is not to replace the original generation. this is to supplement it. so now we have two complete lines of water-source heat pumps. one, our original one, we have named ecofit because it has the best performance in the industry for its type of unit. this new series that we introduced, we call profit because it fits in a retrofit environment like a pro. it's a drop-in replacement for the vast majority of units that are out there. our sales channel partners were introduced to that at the sales meeting we had last month. and they said that we hit the bull's eye with it. they're very, very excited about it.
the other thing that we've been working on extensively, we've talked about a little bit in the past is our air source heat pumps in package rift configuration. we have accomplished two tons through 60 tons packaged rooftop units that are capable of satisfying the load and the energy requirements in cold climates, down to 0 degrees fahrenheit at this particular time. we're very excited about that. we have development going to expand this all the way to 240 tons and will be complete with that development by the end of '22. we have prototypes in testing now. so some of the operations at both tulsa and longview, we've had some productivity issues, as you can see from the numbers in the third quarter. headcount was still slightly down in tulsa. it is grown in longview.
we've been able to attract more people there. but we're turning the tide on that. we've made some changes in our hiring processes, our wage rates. we've revamped our hr department entirely with new leadership and brought in some fresh views on how to get people, and we're beginning to see an improvement in that. we had some supply chain issues that actually continued into and through october. we have resolution for most of these, and we're hopeful we're going to see improvement going forward. but there remain uncertainties out there.
one of them that caught us recently, they have been giving us all green lights on everything telling us we were fine. and then suddenly one day they called and said, we're not fine. so we're finding other vendors to fill that gap. we've already secured those, and so it was a temporary problem, but it really affected our coil production. the covid instances that we had, while on a companywide basis, the absenteeism was not a high percentage like we experienced back in 2020 at the peak of this problem. however, it was every bit as burdensome because it was focused in a particular area of the company that made components internally that are distributed both for longview and tulsa. and so we ended up with a shortage of those components for a period of time, and that's why we struggle to get more units out.
this has been resolved. the absenteeism right now is back to historic normals. so we're in real good shape. sales for network -- sales rep network is strengthening quite a lot. they're getting market share gains. i will say that not only did the innovation of our products have become more attractive, in addition to that, our lead times are the most attractive in the industry. so people that would traditionally think of us as a niche player may be at a premium cost are now looking at us because we can satisfy their delivery requirements. even with the little production constraints that we've had, we've been able to meet our commitments on these, and we've been able to deliver projects that many of our competitors just did not have the ability to get anywhere close. another interesting aspect of our business is parts sales are up year-over-year 15%. that was an all-time quarterly record for the second straight quarter in a row.
now in 2020, parts sales were a little down from the fact that there were a lot of buildings that were not accessible. but if you look at it in absolute dollar volume, these are still record numbers for parts sales. so all the efforts we've put into strengthening this aftermarket aspect of our business are beginning to show -- manifest themselves nicely. water-source heat pump sales were down 23%. and we really believe that, that was fueled by two things. first off, the new construction being down in that product that we had available at that time, not being particularly attractive for retrofit. the next thing was is people that would begin stocking units were waiting for that ideal retrofit unit so they may have hit the pause button on restocking some of their warehouses, waiting on this more attractive product.
air handlers and condensing units were up 8%. and again, a high percentage of those are air source heat pump. we build these for light commercial and small industrial applications, and that's been a really strong growth opportunity for us. our capex investments, as you saw, we're a little behind the spend that we thought we were going to spend. we were forecasting spending a little over $70 million this year, and it's looking like it's going to be $60 million. this was constrained by the supply chain as well. i mean people just can't get materials to us to build some of the things we were going to build or some of the things that we wanted to put in place. none of this really puts us in a bind. some of it was for additional marketing tools, and they would be nice to have, but they're not slowing us down.
the sustainability of aaon is a really interesting story that we're just now beginning to learn how to tell the story. i've been here running this company for five years now. and i saw plenty of evidence of great sustainability, esg, things going on, but we were doing a very poor job of communicating. we added some very key staff that this was absolutely in the wheelhouse to be able to create that communication and learn how we gather the information in a very objective manner. so we just produced our second sustainability esg report. that should have been out on the wire in the last couple or three weeks, as i recall. a lot of companies are talking about innovation of energy-efficient equipment, but that is the backbone of aaon.
it's our unique semi-custom production that's allowed us to lead in energy efficiency. our marketing department recently did a comparative analysis of all of our key competitors, rooftop units, their best effort offerings next to our best effort offerings. we won that battle in every comparative instance, everyone. we have the absolute highest energy-efficient rooftop units on the market. and these are all ahri certified. so this is certified data. we have a very diverse and inclusive workforce. we were just recently awarded multiple awards actually by the state of oklahoma, tulsa county, the city of tulsa. so we're being recognized for this. so esg is something we focus on a lot, and we intend to share more going forward to help all of you investors fully understand what we do. but i encourage anyone who's interested in is yet to do so to read the report that we just put on our website.
now outlook. orders and backlog trends are strong as we move closer to the end of the year. historically, we see a drop off in orders somewhere toward the end of the second quarter entering the third quarter. we have not seen that. the near-term biggest concern is going to be with production. the positives are that headcount is improving. price cost should improve as we work through the backlog because the backlog has an improving margin profile due to the previously announced and effective price increases. some of the production inefficiencies goes away as we solve these minor irritants of supply chain interruption, which they have not manifest themselves into a major disarray. they've just been but some of them last for a few days.
some of them have lasted for a week or two, but nothing has been extensive. but as those go away, we have the manufacturing infrastructure, we have the headcount capable of producing in excess of expectations. but some of these production constraints did carry into october. we're seeing them resolved at this point and being resolved with further resolution later this month. so our fourth quarter and early 2022 outlook is compared to the third quarter, we anticipate the fourth quarter sales to be slightly down and expect gross margins to be modestly up. so i want to mention that we had a sales meeting in 2020 then we had this one here in 2021. so we're going to have probably $1 million plus sg&a burden in the fourth quarter. that won't reoccur in '22. we only have a major sales meeting every year or so. so i'm just stated that we did not have one in '20. this was the one that we had last month. so as we move through the first half of the year, we anticipate production to accelerate.
we have a higher headcount, and we're gaining on that. we believe that our supply chain issues are being resolved there's still unpredictability, but we believe that we've got a pretty good outlook on that. so with the rising production rates and the price increases we implemented including we have another one coming up on january 1. it's already been announced, but it's effective january 1. we did anticipate the gross margins to expand on the improvement that we expect in the fourth quarter. long term, we've never been more optimistic. with all the initiatives we've taken with our product portfolio and strengthening of our sales channel, we're positioning the company from being a niche player to a mainstream player.
so we're very confident in what we're doing, had some struggles that i think pretty much the whole industry dealt with in the third quarter, maybe burdened us a little bit more than we thought. but if we look back to 2019 and see what our performance was then, you'll notice that 2021 q3 is 22% better than '19. now it wasn't a whole lot better than '20, but it was 22% better than '19. i think if you look at the industry as a whole, you'll find that the majority of the industry, if you compare q3 '21 to q3 '19, you'll find something closer to 11% or 12% difference, maybe 14%, but you won't find '22. so with that, i'm going to open the call up to questions.
