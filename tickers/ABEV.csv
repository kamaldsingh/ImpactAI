[operator instructions] our first question comes from marcelo recchia, credit suisse.
marcelo recchia -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, jean. hi, lucas. thank you for taking my questions. the first one would be about the tax credits.
if i understood correctly there are more 1.9 billion tax credit to collect overtime, correct? so do you have any visibility on timing for that an top of that will -- would you -- will it be reasonable to accept a risk statement of brazil beer sales of 2020. this is the first question. the second one, if i may. with the redesign in agreements between the coke bottlers and heineken announced it yesterday, one of the main concerns of the market has been about competition identification, particularly in the premium segment.
so my question is what can we expect from ambev as mitigating levers for,let's say this potential higher competition? thank you very much.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
ok. hi, marcelo. thank you for the question. with the tax credit, marcelo, there is no clear timing yet as it relates to the one point nine billion of potential tax credits that we disclosed in our footnotes to our financial statement.
this really is because this is dependent on the judicial system in brazil. so we still await the judicial decisions that will give us reasonable certainty to be able to to to record and recognize its credit. so it's really depending on the course of the judicial dispute in respect to this amount.
marcelo recchia -- credit suisse -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
and about the deal, heineken and coke. brazil has always been a very competitive market and it's too early to say something about how this deal will unfold. for me, it's a little bit -- it's highly anticipated this type of move. and what i can say is that for a while now two years -- from two years ago we really started to transform big time our route to market.
and it remains unparallel and we believe that we are getting a new edge on that. we have to remember that third 30 percent of our volumes are distributed by 150 wholesalers. that's that's where they are with fast for 20 years and they are going through a business transformation adopting, some of them adopting delivery too. the remaining 70 percent is distributor -- distributed by approximately 200 direct distribution centers.
and we are betting big time on the thing about technology on the dtc and on the bees that we believe that it will be the edge of -- and the many possibilities of hypersegmentation of supporting a broader portfolio, launching innovation, is with this type of platforms like this that we are seeing that in the past, we had sales rep going to a customer, and they -- he would have like seven minutes, they can order. now because of our platform in the wholesales, in the our customers, they are staying 30 minutes a week in the platform, looking innovation, learning about marketing campaigns, connecting. so in the end, we have our strategy of transforming our company. we are pretty much sticking to -- investing on that.
and the deal, i think, is highly anticipated, let's see how it unfolds. ok.
marcelo recchia -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you very much, jean and lucas.

excuse me. our next question comes from andre hachem, itau.
andre hachem -- itau -- analyst
hello, jean, lucas. thank you for taking my qeustion. i have basically two questions here. the first one is regarding the 10% volume increase you mentioned this year.
could you just provide us a bit more breakdown in terms of regions and mix and how that's been developing? we're curious, especially because of the end of the government aid program. so especially in north and northeast, we were wondering if you have been seeing, let's say, lower volume recoveries than in the other regions. the second question is relating to your digital initiatives. could you guys comment a little bit on minor.com it's been evolving quite well.
i know it's been, let's say, a big bet in terms of the cash and carry or fighting off the cash and carry. so what is the strategy on that front? and how do you see this developing going forward?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so let me start with the volumes. so i've been saying -- i use -- we use it to say that we lost close to 10 million hectoliters in brazil beer from our peak volumes in 2014, and we have been working to get this 10 million back. 2020 alone was a year where we were able to recover 4.5 million hectoliters since the low point that was 2018.
and that was possible because we created -- it was less about the industry and more about our ability really to create new occasions for in-home consumption. we revolutionized the way we connected with our consumers. 2020 marked a moment where we can say that pretty much all the additional volumes sold in the industry was redriven by ambev in a holistic play on portfolio technology lives rtm marketing. and so these things are pretty much structural.
and that's because of that, that we see the momentum that we still have in jan plus feb in 2021. and so that's it, we are pretty much investing in the things that we can control, and we are excited about these new things. the scenario is still very fluid. we don't know how this is going to evolve.
but a big part of our volume, there is a part of it that really are market share gains. when you talk about the acelio and the northeast. so we have a lot of market share gains in the north and in the middle east, too. so it is something that we are pretty much looking at volumes that were generated by our occasion expansion, industry expansion and market share gains.
so that's pretty much it. so having said that, the world is transforming. it was amazing how we see the digital platforms really been adopted exponentially. it was really something that we didn't -- it was like a five year plan that helped -- that happened in five months.
so we are -- with ze delivery for a while now, and it really exponentially grew last year. bees is something that is more recent, is something that we are working for 18 months and then, but it is really -- it was an explosion of adoption with our customers during last year. and in the end, a big difference of all the things combined in our rtm is really the -- so the digital hook and the deliveries. and so in the end, it's -- so this is type of service that we are able to do from the highest north of [foreign language] is really -- our network is really granular.
and i think this is a different animal when we compare with the other options or the what other industries are doing in terms of cash and carries or even other industries trying to get that reach. i think that's how the world will evolve. we have to be prepared with technology, with the evolution of the rtm, and we are very excited about it.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
just 2, andre, just to supplement, specifically to your question around menu.com. this was an investment that we made a few years ago. we found a group of entrepreneurs that we were very impressed by and decided to partner together with them to develop a marketplace in the brazilian market. and i think 2020 was another year where they consistently managed to expand their presence in the market.
and the more we work with them, the more opportunities we see to leverage the scale and the infrastructure of the broader ambev organization, to help improve service level to clients across the country. so this is not just about menu.com and bees and ze delivery. we also have donus, which is our fintech start-ups that we've been investing behind as well. so we're really trying to create a menu, no pun intended, but a menu of options to serve better on the logistics side, on the financial side, on the products availability side.
so that we can ultimately deliver tangible benefits to our clients and our consumers. it's about an ecosystem. it's not just about one or the other.
andre hachem -- itau -- analyst
perfect guys. very clear. thank you.

our next question comes from thiago duarte, btg pactual.
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
hello, jean. hello, lucas. good afternoon everybody. i have three questions, two of them focus on the digital initiatives and last one on the market.
the first one, if you could talk a little bit about the bees, particularly the bees service and how that affects our commercial and go-to-market strategy. i get the benefits of scalability, use of big data and the amount of services that you can put together to customers. but i was wondering, in the past, our understanding was that one of the competitive advantages that ambev had with the in-person presence in the point-of-sale was in terms of the competitive advantage that you built relative to the competition. so my question is how going digital and that platform may eventually cannibalize or even enhance the direct route strategy, whether it's detrimental or incremental to that, that will be an interesting discussion.
the second question is on ze delivery and the dtc initiatives, right? i know you're focused more on nominal dollar growth than margins, right? but you mentioned that one of the reasons for the increase in sg&a expenses in brazil was because of the expenses related to this dtc initiative. so can you talk a little bit to us about how this platform stack up against your regular off-line business in terms of gross margin and sg&a, that would be an interesting point as well. and the third question is in your earnings report, you mentioned or you show in that chart that in brazil, the share of off-trade channel in brazil beer is back to 2019 levels. so back to pre pandemic levels.
so can you talk to us a little bit about how that normalization of sales channel reflected in your packaging mix and brand mix or weather packaging and brand mix is also more normalized in the fourth quarter. thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. many questions here duarte, let me see if i get all of them and if i miss something, you -- i can add on the end. so the bees, so -- and there was the question about menu first that i didn't get it right. so bees and menu are two strategies, two ventures that we are really working together to get this rtm revolution that we are proposing.
there is a nonlinear transformation of the rtm, thinking 10 years ahead and not the way we think it should be, ok? so bees and menu, both are working helping us on that direction. having said that, we don't forecast for now to lose the human contact with our customers. i think -- so what we are working very hard right now is really to upgrade and to evolve and to transform the role of the sales representative that it was in the past, pretty much order taking and some type of execution to a more business representative that has a lot of data in his hand and really can help our customers in category management, in more profits, in innovation, on technology adoption. so in the end, we are pretty much worked on a new approach, there is an evolving approach from we have today, but we continue with the human contact on the bees, ok? just talk about bees a little bit.
it centralized different services. there's a 20-hour seven days platform that creates customized touch point and it's really improved service level, and it's really helping to really digitalize our customers. and it's something that we thought it would take much more time, would be much more difficult. but the adoption and with the sales representative there, the way we are -- we have been able to put the apps in our customers and made them use and then we have metrics about usage.
so how many minutes you stay there in the loyalty programs and how many orders do you and if you follow delivery and we are really amazed by the way we were able really to make our customers pretty much adopt big time. bees is already a business, if we look at that business alone or that -- or the channel or business, it's already with a gmv of brl 20 billion annualize it when you look at that as -- this is one thing. second thing, it is about the ze. so in the end, so we are talking a lot about ze.
i think ze is something that is nonlinear for the brazilian community in terms of beverage delivered. it solve many pain points. it was really something that -- it really fits with the problems that we have in the pandemic, people looking for convenience, need to stay in that home. it has a great proposition.
and in the end, so we really believe that it's going to be a very accretive for our business because you have data, we have frequency. you have all the information that we have. and then we are in a moment that in this expansion, there is some customer acquisition on this expansion that impacts us a little bit. but going beyond that part, we really believe that ze is the way for us really to connect and get frequency.
it's amazing how we are seeing. we really thought at some point in time that ze would be occasion-based push. and what we are seeing is that when the customer really go in, it became a frequent customer that orders six, seven times a month. it's really something about recurrence, big time, and we are very, very exciting about it.
so the last question, it was about rgb in off trades, rgb and channels, is it? so q4, we saw a gradual reopening of the country. in reality, this has been back and forth. so it's some areas are reopened, some areas shut down. we are seeing this back and forth, most of the time.
and in this scenario continues very fluent with the restrictions, and this is on the municipality level. it's important to note, however, then the on-trade channel continue to reopen and channel mix is closer to pre-covid but that consumption occasions are still very impacted. it's not because the bars and the mom and pops, they are open that four friends can go around the table and really get that occasion, there is socializing out-of-home. that occasion is still very impacted in the market.
we don't see it coming. but we see bars, moms and pops really transforming themselves. we are helping them on this project -- on this process. we are -- so ze is an app that we do through our customers, through the retail, supermarkets more market.
so it helps them -- our customers to do this transformation. another thing is that we are really expanding this rgb 300 ml is small bottles on a to-go strategy for the always more on trade of brazil. so this is helping a little bit. but the point it is, we still see many opportunity to see the location independent on the channel, that is socialized outside of home that is very accretive for us to come back.
so this is still very limited.
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
amazing, jean. thank you so much.

our next question comes from lucas ferreira, j.p. morgan.
lucas ferreira -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, jean. hi, lucas. good afternoon, everybody. you're giving a guidance of 20% increase in the cogs per hectoliter.
so i have two questions about underlines on the p&l for the year. so jean just discussed that ze delivery is still a client acquisition phase for -- to support its growth. so wondering if you guys can comment about the sg&a trends for this year? if you still think that you should trend maybe slightly above inflation or relative to your -- your regular revenues, how that should behave if you have room to some savings here and there. or in future bringing new brands to porto alegre, you're going to have to speed up the marketing for those.
how to think about that g&a? and the other question is on corn pricing. first of all, how you see your price -- the price point of your main brands relative to competition? do you believe that there is room for some catch-up there or not? and how do you see the overall pricing for during brazil this year given that not only you but everybody should be facing corns pressure. so my question is that do you believe that we should be able to see cost growing above inflation this year. or are you see any inflation as your target? thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so i'll get the last one first and then we go back to sg&a and a little bit of the cogs. so as you know, we have been much more flexible, nimble and agile in implementing revenue initiatives and to approach market conditions to pursue healthy revenue. in the end, that's the objective, healthy revenue, combined with sustainable volumes.
and with this approach, our net revenue per hectoliter growth of 8% in brazil beer in q4. it was something that was based on this new strategy. and it can be broken down in three parts. so we really started to taking price to recover inflation in q3, end of q3, in this process, it was rolled out through q4 faced by 10 regions and packs.
so this is something that it was an ongoing process during q4. we believe that by the end of q4, the relativities were pretty much on the historical range. but this process was something that we are really getting it phased in and nimble and flexible and agile. on top of that, we had a smarter way to do promotional activities.
it was -- we used a lot this new -- this concept of occasion based activations, cross promotions for consumers in different channels, and we are very happy because it was really effective in our q4. and finally, we have -- so this q4, we had improved brand mix that it was really driven by, first, the sustained resilience of our core brands. so that's something that we have to talk about. it is -- so when you -- we look like lasko to end up the year with flat volumes, it's really something that it was a drag in the past and it's really helped us when you stabilize the core.
we need to get all the innovation and all the premium has been accretive. so a part of it, it was really improved brand mix. with the innovations, global brands growth. so in the end, so that continue to be the tone for 2021 where we have to approach the market in the same way.
so the price is pretty much there when we connect with inflation and relativities the mix is -- continues to be strong and the occasion based promotion activities, if we will be more nimble. it depend -- depending on how these things would evolve. so having said that, so let's talk a little bit about the margin side. so i just want to narrow more the margin discussion on beer -- on brazil, we are looking at last in kaki already with recovering margins.
in 2021 brazil is really the issue with the cash cogs of the low cranes that we just gave the guidance. it's really about the currencies that we already talked about, the other commodities that really accelerated in brazil. and the way for us really to manage that. is really to continue this growth momentum.
so this net revenue strategy that i've been talking around the own trade reopening is really something that we believe that in h2, more in h2, it's going to be something more resilient. the occasion, not the reopen, but the occasion, the socializing. and talking about sales and markets. so we are not going -- lowering down our financial disciplines on cost and expenses.
there are some bads. for example, ze is a bad, but in the end, we are being much more effective on other fronts that are front more related with all this digital platform that we are creating on top of ze. there is, for example, that we just saw now that we're going to broadcast nba and going to have all the data of everybody that has the passion for basketball and budweiser will own this. so it's a much smarter way for us to do this type of market.
and then we believe that this -- that we'll be able -- we'll not put lower the guard with sales and market. we're going to invest on the right things, but there are a lot of initiates for us to take moving forward outside of ze, that's really a bad that we are doing.
lucas ferreira -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you, jean.

our next question comes from rob ottenstein, evercore.
rob ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. great. thank you very much. a couple of things.
one, i wonder if you can give us a little bit more detail on how your premium portfolio is evolving and the strategy there and your ability to maintain or gain share in premium? and then the second, you talked a little bit about how you're helping your customers digitally, but i'm also wondering, a lot of the bars, restaurants, obviously, have been hurt badly because of covid. are there things that you've done in terms of perhaps temporarily loosening up terms, working capital, assistance, any other assistance of a sort of a financial sense to perhaps strengthen your relationships and create greater degrees of loyalty. thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
thank you, robert. so first of all, premium is really a long-term strategy in which we have to be patients -- have to have patients, really to build brands and to invest on brand power, brand equity, and we are taking a view, a strategy of a portfolio to do this as an important revenue stream for the future. in this full year, our global brands, 2020, continue to -- with a very good momentum. it was a double-digit growth.
it was a growth that we are comfortable in good, if we really make it for some years on that type of growth. so there is a combination of global brands here. if i would take out, for example, corona, that it was a brand that we are, for a while, we investing that we were a little bit concerned because of the pandemic and the name and everything is really resilient and growing much ahead of our average of global brands. beck's is really something that's doing very well, tripling and we had a lot of adoption on a lot of acceptation.
so i really am excited with our strategy. colorado is another brand that's doing very well to -- if we take out the impact of the colorado bar, so the brand is growing very well, very fast as a national craft that we have leader on the craft on the super premium side. so we had an issue this year pretty much on the domestic premium brands, pretty much sertanejo, original, that the brand skol puro malte, really toward these brands -- their own trade occasion really connected it suffered a little bit more on that. but in the end, we are very excited about the consistency, the long-term view and the portfolio strategy approach that we are having with premium.
i'm really excited about it. we're going to talk about it for a long because it's -- i would be very consistent on that. so having said that, talking about restaurants. and yes, so it's a channel that it's really suffering.
we really collaborate the most we could during the year with the national bar association with our customers have been flexible on payment terms, on delivery on healthy -- kits -- we gave some healthy kits for our restaurants, bars to be able to work safely. we elected one brand that was bohemia to help on get a better margin for the trade. so it was the brand of the reopening to give a little bit more room for the profitability of bars. we are helping the restaurants with our digital platforms, big time.
so ze delivery is connected with 2,000 small clients, sometimes that's a bars, sometimes a restaurants. so we help to make to -- for them to have orders. we are creating this -- that i mentioned the are promotions for their bars and restaurants have a good strategy of to go to take away. so the rgb 300 ml.
so we really believe that we are in a good moment. when we measure the customer satisfaction of this small trade, even though with all the service level that we had last year. and we still have because we are selling more than -- less than we should because the supply chain is really stressed. when we measure the nps, it was really something that changed big time from 2019 to 2020.
so the feedback that we received from our customers, they are more -- i have a better net promoter score with my customers this year than last year.
rob ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you very much.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
go back to the -- robert, sorry, just before you go. on your first question, if we just expand beyond brazil, i also think it's worth kind of noting that our premium brands and the portfolio word approach that we're developing in other markets, right, also had a very good year in 2020. so if you go to places like canada, right, where corona and stella artois had a very solid performance on the brand power side and on the market share side. if you go to central america and the caribbean, where you have corona, modelo especial in some markets, michelob ultra also playing an important role of allowing consumers to trade up and increase the weight of premium volumes, right, as part of our total business in these markets.
so it's -- obviously, brazil is key to our business. but the focus behind our above core, core plus and premium, is not limited to that. and i think the good news is that over the course of 2020, we managed to also build momentum in premium in other markets where ambev is present.
rob ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
get one or two more questions and -- two more questions and it's over. two more.
operator
our next question comes from olivier nicolai, goldman sachs. lucas.
olivier nicolai -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, jean, lucas. thanks for taking the question. two questions, please. after the very strong volume score that you have in brazil beer in h2 and also the strong start that you have indicated for q1.
could you please give us an update on your capacity utilization in brazil? and then just...
operator
olivier, your line is open. you may continue.
olivier nicolai -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hello, can you hear me now?
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
we can listen to you now.
operator
olivier, excuse me, you may continue. your line is open.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
may be it's because it's 1:30.
operator
ok. we lost connection with olivier. our next question comes from joao soarian, citibank.
joao soarian -- citi -- analyst
can you hear me ok?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
yes.
joao soarian -- citi -- analyst
ok. great. just a very quick one on my side. jean, lucas, when i look into the cash cogs per hectoliter guidance that you gave, the 20%, 23%, i just wanted to understand how conservative that is in the sense that we should expect that a mix shift back toward the rgbs.
and if i recall correctly, the third quarter, you mentioned a very big impact, right, double-digit impact alone just from the mix shift. so i understand if there is any upside that cash cogs and could it be smaller depending on the way that the mix shift behaves? and another question linked to that. i remember that you talked about launching more rgbs into the off-trade and trying to kind of change the mix of the off-trade with innovation, with product launches in a way that you have been doing in your overall strategy. so just trying to understand those two points.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
what was the second one? so the first one, it is that -- so yes, in terms of transparency, we decided to give a guidance that's a guidance that through everybody kind of put that on the models. and is the best number that we have. when we look today moving forward, it's true that is more related with fx and commodities. and of course, if depending on the change in the recovery in the mixed channel, this can be better or worse.
but we believe that this is the best forecast that we can do right now with the available information that we have. so having said that, so we are working big time on -- if you think about, first of all, we are working big time to maintain our bar customers alive to transform them into a -- in platforms that can be much more than the physical place. and they can deliver through them, they can have their to-go strategies, take away strategy. and we have a big plan for returnable bottles in the half 3q on the -- what we can call small of trade or moms and pops that has this occasion that is something that we are betting that it should continue to gain traction throughout the year.
so that's what i can mention about about the mix and the of it.
joao soarian -- citi -- analyst
great. that's great. thanks guys. thank, jean.
operator
the question-and-answer session is now finished. now i'll turn the conference over to mr. gene jereissati for final remarks. please, sir.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you very much to be with us today. to wrap up, i just want to say that i'm very confident about our future. and i could mention three things, three reasons.
although transformations takes time -- take time and the remaining -- and the environment remains challenging, our 2020 performance shows how fast we can adapt and our agility to get things done in the middle of a transformation. so i was very excited. so it was a year that we kind of did three years in six months. our portfolio is in a much better place.
we have momentum. so brand power of our portfolio is healthy and growing. innovation pipeline is strong. and our route to market is in a different place in terms of transformation, digitalization.
so this is -- it will be -- continue to be a competitive advantage edge that we want to continue to bet really digitalizing the platforms and really scaling all these digital efforts in a very quick way. another thing it is that cash generation remains strong, even though with all the ecosystem collaboration in all the -- so the help that we did with suppliers and customers at some point in time during the pandemic. but in the end, our cash generation remains very strong, and we remain committed to do the right things on the transformation with financial discipline to transform ambev a better company in the future. so that was pretty much it.
thank you very much to you all and have a good day.

lucas lira, cfo and investor relations officer. as a reminder, our silds presentation is available for downloading on our website, ri.ambev.com.br, as well as through the webcast link of this call. [operator instructions] before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the safe harbor of the securities litigation reform act of 1996. forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of ambev's management and on information currently available to the company.

jereissati, you may begin your conference, please.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
good morning, good afternoon. thank you very much for joining our call. 2020 was unforgettable in many ways, what a year, on one side, all the sadness, hardship and challenges that covid-19 brought. on the other, i praise the resilience of our team and respect their commitment with the profound transformation our company went through last year.
ambev made a positive impact in society. ecosystem collaboration for a better world was the tone of 2020. we launched meaningful innovations to from cusqueã±a in bolivia, to the most commented sparkling wine, lp qtp in argentina. our innovations grew our portfolio and expanded our reach in terms of new propositions to consumer.
in brazil, brahma duplo malte was the star of our pipeline. thanks to an innovative development process, singular, liquid and a disruptive marketing launch, the beats franchise revamp with gt and zodiac also brought us a breath of fresh air with the new generation. ambev's technology platforms were exponentially adopted chuã­ in 2020. digital businesses are here to stay and platforms like ze delivery and bees, our super app, were at the right place in the right time.
as for the fourth quarter, we build on the commercial momentum from q3 to deliver a good finish to the year. more importantly, the success of our commercial strategy in the quarter also positioned us well for 2021. and here's why. beer volumes continued to recover and grew year over year in seven out of our top 10 markets, led by our double-digit growth in brazil, in chile, guatemala and paraguay.
it was also important to see our beer volumes in the dominican republic recover strongly despite the covid-related restrictions. we have been strengthening brand equity and power of our portfolio and gaining market share in most of our key markets. in canada, for instance, our portfolio grew share once again. in brazil, beer volumes grew almost 12% despite a still very volatile environment, despite the supply chain constraints that impacted us, our service level, the lower government stimulus and our price increase rollout.
on top of all of that, our global brands outperformed the total industry and had a solid growth in brand equity and power. bohemia and brahma duplo malte finished the year as the top two leader brands in the underdeveloped core plus segment and still have plenty of room to grow. in the core segment, after years of volume decline, we stabilized our brand performance, thanks mainly to the expansion of the 300 ml returnable glass bottles in moms and pops and the takeaway of our strategy that we implemented. we strengthened our value portfolio with the launch of two more regional brands, beer hero in poe and esmera in goiã¡s.
and finally, we delivered a strong net revenue per hectoliter, thanks to a successful implementation of our price strategy that was built around a more flexible approach, a positive mix, driven mainly by innovation, the innovation performance and revenue management initiatives, including a smarter occasion based promotional activity that it proves very efficient. we continue to transform our business to quickly respond to consumer and customer needs and solve their pain points. today, i would like to share more details about the role technology is playing in this process. in our dtc and b2b platforms are the best examples worth talking about.
so let's start talking about ze delivery in brazil. ze's value proposition is really simple. your favorite beverages at reasonable prices, cold in 35 minutes. this is simple, but very, very powerful.
ze is present in more than 200 cities in all 27 brazilian states. and in 2020, delivered 27 million orders with the equivalent of one order per second only in q4. it also delivered a rich assortment of products from over 40 partners, fmcg companies and was rated the best delivery app on the app store and android. it's a strong relationship with more than 2,000 retail partners, such as small and large supermarkets, moms and pops and bars is essential to ensure a high net promoter score currently north of 80 for both consumers and customers.
ze's focus in 2020 was geographic expansion and improvement of the operational model. for 2021, it will focus on increasing penetration, retention, frequency and assortment in order to continue the journey to fulfill its full potential consumer by consumer occasion by occasion. now, let's talk about bees, our super app, our b2b marketplace platform. bees is designed to provide our customers more convenience in terms of 24 hours, seven days a week order taking and delivery tracking.
and also serves as a marketplace that provides a broader assortment, additional logistics and financial services. it aims to be the one-stop shop solution for the retail, with a transformational opportunity for allowing ambev to develop a closer and more reliable relationship with our customers' ecosystem. it's about better quality of interaction. and as we listen more and have more data to work with, we can ultimately offer a better service level to our partners.
the platform was developed in the dominican republic, where 90% of our customers already adopted it. there, our marketplace service already offers a broader assortment, and we are into eight different categories, with 70 different skus that go beyond our beverage portfolio. going into 2021, we expect another challenging year. covid is still very real, and we will face larger cost pressures with cash cogs per hectoliter in brazil expected to increase in the low brl 20s.
that said, our commercial and top line momentum built last year is also real. in fact, our top line performance will be one of the most important things to watch as we work to partially offset the cost headwinds. and the good news is that we are off to a good start, with volumes growing above 10% in brazil beer so far despite carnival cancellation. also, pricing performance should benefit from mix continuing to play in our favor and a smarter promotional activity remaining in the full year, taking into account the market environment.
i have no doubt that we are starting this year much more prepared than we were in 2020. our portfolio is in a better shape, our brand power is healthy and growing, innovation pipeline is strong, and our route to market was transformed through all this digital platform that scaled very fast. on top of that, cash generation continues strong, and we remain committed to invest ahead of the curve. so that was pretty much it.
thank you very much for your time and attention. i will handle this to lucas. 
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
thanks, jen and hello, everyone. let me start by talking about the tax credits in brazil. given that they were so impactful in the quarter. we recognized 4.3 billion reais in tax credits, 2.5 billion reais were recorded in other operating income and 1.7 billion reais were charged to our financial results.
these credits result from a 2017 brazilian supreme court decision on the merits that declared unconstitutional the inclusion of the icms state tax in the taxable basis of the pis and the cofins federal taxes. as further disclosed in our notes to the financial statements, with the support of counsel and external advisors, in december, we concluded the estimation with reasonable certainty of the amount to which we are entitled. given the nature of the dispute, these tax credits are technically part of our normalized results from an accounting standpoint. however, given the materiality of the amount, and to ensure greater transparency of the underlying performance of the business, we decided it was appropriate to do two things: one, disregard these tax credits for purposes of calculating our organic performance and treat them as a scope change.
and two, we updated our accounting policy to record all extemporaneous tax credits under other operating income instead of the p&l lines that were originally impacted in the past. if it weren't for the scope adjustments, our nominal normalized ebitda for 2020 would have been nearly 19.5 billion reais with an ebitda margin of 33.4% and normalized profit would have been approximately 8.2 billion reais. there is still ongoing litigation in this matter, and we will keep the market updated as things progress. and any potential further tax credits will be recorded when the prospects of their recovery are practically certain from a legal perspective and the amounts to which we are entitled can be estimated with reasonable certainty.
it is important to point out, however, that even if we disregard the impact of the tax credits, the financial performance in the quarter was actually good given the circumstances. we delivered a consolidated top line growth of 13.4%, with a healthy combination of 7.6% volume growth and 5.3% net revenue per hectoliter growth. gross margin and ebitda margin improved sequentially once again on a consolidated basis, and net-net, ebitda declined only by a slight 0.1% year over year. this performance in the quarter allowed us to deliver 4.7% top line organic growth for the year, while ebitda declined organically 11.1% in 2020.
in addition, full-year cash flow from operating activities actually grew 2.6%, and we managed to further strengthen our solid liquidity position, which proved critical in the very volatile operating environment of 2020, which we expect to continue into 2021. capex totaled 4.7 billion reais for the year, and we returned 7.7 billion reais to shareholders in the form of dividends and ioc. switching gears to 2021. the challenge around improving our profitability remains front and center.
margins will once again be under pressure given significant fx and commodity headwind. for instance, our average hedge rate for the brl versus the u.s. dollar for 2021 was 5.29 reais, which represented over a 30% increase year over year. the brl showed high volatility in 2020 and was second only to the argentinian peso in terms of depreciation relative to the u.s.
dollar among major latin american currencies. although we expect to see a correction in the future, this is definitely the biggest hurdle we need to overcome this year. in addition, unlike the past, when we saw some negative correlation between commodity prices and the brl devaluation against the u.s. dollar.
commodity prices have actually trended against us, particularly barley and corn, not all of which we have the ability to hedge. as a result, we currently expect brazil beer cash cogs per hectoliter to grow in the low 20s for the full year. and to tackle this challenge, we will basically have to get two things right. first, deliver a solid top line performance and second, successfully implement several mapped blends and initiatives around productivity and keep our financial discipline with respect toward management of our costs and expenses.
as i have mentioned in the past, there's not going to be an easy solution, and there's not going to be a silver bullet. and it's difficult to predict exactly how much of the margin pressure we will be able to offset through these levers. but we remain fully committed to continuously and consistently improve our results during the course of the year without, however, losing sight of the longer term. as jean mentioned, we are on a journey to transform the company, and we must do so while investing behind the long-term sustainability of our business.
and speaking of sustainability, today, i also wanted to share some brief highlights on the progress we've been making on this front. in 2018, we announced our sustainability goals for 2025, which were broken down into five pillars: water, climate and energy, circular packaging, sustainable agriculture and smart drinking. and i am happy to report that in 2020, we made progress on all fronts even during these challenging times. and we remain on track to deliver our goals by 2025.
for instance, in terms of clean energy, in chile and argentina, we are already operating with 100% renewable energy and we expect to have more than 90% of our brazilian breweries supplied with renewable energy by 2023. in addition, we are extending the supply of renewable energy to 100% of our distribution centers in brazil, which we'll be able to charge our delivery fleet comprised of at least 50% of electric vehicles by 2023. as a final note, i wanted to share the news that gilliam acacia is succeeding cha oliver as our head of investor relations. yakka, as he is also known, joins us from budweiser apac where he spent the last seven years leading the fp&a agenda for the region.
live meanwhile is taking over as head of m&a for ambev. i wanted to thank levi for his work in ir over the last two years. and wish both the best of luck and success going forward. with that, let's go to q&a.
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from marcel moraes with santander.
marcel moraes -- santander global corporate banking -- analyst
good afternoon. good morning, everyone. congrats on the impressive results for the first quarter. my question relates to market share trends per segment.
so you mentioned you gain -- especially in brazil, where you gained share in all segments. can you give us a little bit of color on the super premium and the premium plus core value segments? what's going on over there?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you for the question. so yeah, we feel that our portfolio is much more prepared. we went through a big renovation, launching of new brands, resource allocation, betting on brands that really could drive the future.
and our performance of global brands, specifically, they were quite -- double digits. so it was close to the 20s, and this is what we believe it is the -- above the performance of the premium segment, overall performance. so that's why we mentioned that. we have been investing for a while in budweiser and in stella artois.
and more and more, we are seeing beck's with a very strong performance, and we are seeing corona doing very well, too, and colorado. so these are our top five brands that we are really investing for the future, and they are really doing well. specifically, beck's is going triple-digits growth. corona is going on the 50s, colorado doing very well on the in-home occasion too, still suffering a little bit in bars, but doing very well on the from the off street.
and on top of that, we -- on top of market share, something that we are looking a lot now is really equity of our brand that we really have to push equity ahead of market share, push to make the pool and to build brand equity. and brand equity of premium brands are really moving much faster than the market share and than our plan. so that's an important kpi for us that we are very confident.
marcel moraes -- santander global corporate banking -- analyst
jean, what about the core segment? any color on that?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
yeah. so the core segment since the beginning of the pandemic, i have been -- that was information that i brought to you all that the core has been very resilient. and we've been really reorganizing our portfolio, creating the core plus segment, really launching pack innovation and different packs on the core segment. and after years of volume decline, our core segment was really marked by resilience with brahma, skol, and antarctica families growing by high single digits.
so this is the combination of the rgb 300 ml bottles that we are really focusing during the pandemic as the pack that moms and pops and bars can do the delivery, can do the takeaway. so it's an important part that's really accelerating the core brands. and on top of that, the normal price strategy that we have been following. so core brands really bounced back.
on top of that, the core plus segment, there is brahma duplo malte. that's bohemian. they are really on fire.
marcel moraes -- santander global corporate banking -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.

the next question comes from carlos laboy with hsbc.
carlos laboy -- hsbc -- analyst
yes. good afternoon, everybody. congratulations on really strong results. i'm wondering, what have you learned about brahma duplo malte through this period? and how do you drive that brand going forward? what consumer insights have you gleaned as you sit back and reflect on everything you've learned here for what's next there?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so thank you for the question, laboy. brahma duplo malte, we stated that was really the brand that -- the product that we took one year to develop. it was really, really tested with all the consumer sites.
so we had that mindset of really get superiority on all the analysis that we were doing, comparing with the core and really get inspired by another categories like, for example, whiskey that has the double malt, the single malt and everything. it was amazing how the brazilian consumer got -- sticked with the concept of duplo malte or two malts that they combined. and we were able really to develop a liquid that it really calls attention on the mouth and on the eyes because it's really creamy and has a mouth -- a great mouth taste. and all this process has been like for one year, we've been doing that.
and then we decide really to, first, to bet on the flagship brand. so we are really talking about brahma, that had chopp brahma, brahma duplo malte and brahma under the family umbrella. so we are really -- brahma is the brand and brahma duplo malte is the flagship product. and we went bold on that.
so we really got -- in terms of resource allocation. so we picked the passion point, the brazilian passion point that's more relevant for brazil today. we have two, football and country music. we connected brahma duplo malte with these, both important passion point that we had.
and we have been able to work as a family. and the good news is that brahma is peaking back and is growing together with brahma duplo malte that at some point in time we would think about some type of cannibalization, but the whole assembly is really moving up and we are very excited about it.
carlos laboy -- hsbc -- analyst

the next question comes from rob ottenstein with ernst young.
rob ottenstein -- ernst & young global limited
robert ottenstein with evercore. thank you very much, and congratulations to -- for a great start of the year. a couple of sort of follow-up housekeeping items. number one, it looks to us, lucas, that you didn't reiterate the guidance on the cogs being up 20%.
is that correct? or am i missing something? so that's number one. two, just a follow-up on the brahma duplo malte and that is i believe that got launched last year, biggest innovation you've had. where are the comps toughest for you on that launch? so just kind of two housekeeping items there. and then kind of the bigger-picture question is how do you see the beyond beer market and business developing for you? it was a big theme for brito on the abi call today.
obviously, a lot of interesting stuff going on, on that side in brazil. love to get a little bit more detail on your thoughts on that as well.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so thank you for the question, robert. so yes, about the cash costs, our guidance was in low 20s for brazil beer, for the full year. this -- so this quarter, we had higher than the full year, but it was already expected given the curve of the hedges that we have in brazil.
for q2, we will continue to see cash cogs above the full-year guidance for the same reason, but we are not making any changes to this guidance, ok? so this is one thing. the second thing, it is brahma duplo malte. let me give you a higher view on that. so what we are aiming is really to have a pipeline of innovation that really can transform my portfolio in the future, and it's already been transforming the company.
so one kpi that i looked big time, it is what is the percentage of my net revenue that comes from products that did not exist three years ago. so it was -- this number was 5% in 2018. it went to 10% in 2019, and we reached 20% in 2021. and we are looking at this number for us to continue this trajectory with a strong view about where -- what are the spaces, what we want really to create.
it's not just about any type of innovation. so we have a framework with five avenues that we want to launch and maintain this momentum of 20% of our net revenue coming from products that didn't exist three years ago. so we have -- so one more information. so the tough comps of brahma duplo malte, the peak, it was really the q3, where it was really the moment that we are freight loading and putting everything on the market.
and -- but what we see is that this number of innovation, overall, it should not change. this 20% that i want to go move it forward. so we have a pipeline that they are coming. so brahma duplo malte still has some geographical rollout in some new packaging -- packages, new occasions for us to work on that.
and there is one important product on the core plus side that we have been piloting, and we are very excited, and it's really coming to the rollout phase right now, that is one international brand. having said that, beyond beer, it's really something that we are into it we are very excited about our beats brand in the partnership with fundita. we just launched it. we launched gt under beats, and then we launched beats zodiac.
and there is a family of brands that they are very accretive, very incremental, doing very well. and we have three or four pilots happening right now for us to learn and decide where to launch. so we are testing our sales. we are in the pilot phase.
we are testing mike's hard lemonade. there is something that is a little bit with this juic'd and natural points. and we are testing the femsa cocktails in cans. so there are -- in beyond beer, we have like four avenues that we are on full speed on beats, and we are on the pilot phases on the other three.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
and then just to add something here on our international operations, robert. beyond beer is already a reality in canada, for instance, and the quarter showed very good results yet again from our beyond beer portfolio, not only thanks to nutrl, right, which we partnered with last year and showed consistent growth throughout last year. but in the quarter, we launched in canada, bud light seltzer. early days, but off to a very good start as well.
so i think that's one additional benefit that we have to be able to learn from the canadian operations and roll out these learnings to other ambev markets.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
to give a little bit more information, robert. so you know that we acquired a winery in argentina last year to build and have the capabilities of play with grapes, with winery. so it's a business that in argentina now is growing 16%, 16, 1-6, compared with what we bought. and now we are really building the capability of putting wines in cans and really testing this across the board in south america.
rob ottenstein -- ernst & young global limited

the next question comes from thiago duarte with btg pactual.
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, everybody. i have two questions on the revenue per hectoliter in beer brazil and then a third question on brand portfolio. so the first question is, can you talk a little bit more about how you manage the decision on the discounts in the brazilian beer division? since the third quarter last year, we've seen discounts coming down considerably.
it's certainly been an important push to revenue per-hectoliter growth. so i'm just wondering how you -- what were the conditions that allow you to more aggressively cut back those discounts during the pandemic when it comes to channel, package and the competition changes that the pandemic brought to the business? so i think it would be interesting to hear. the second question is if we -- as we look into the revenue per-hectoliter growth in brazil beer, 12.6% year over year. can you help us break it down in terms of some of the impacts that you had on a year-over-year basis? i'm specifically looking to hear in terms of the impact of the carnival or the lack of carnival this year and the digital initiatives such as ze delivery and bees would be nice as well.
and the third question, jean, you mentioned in your opening remarks that the brand health of the portfolio has improved across the whole portfolio. so if you can elaborate a little bit more on what sort of metrics you're looking at when you make that statement, and how your brand preferences stack up against market share in each segment, that would be interesting, too.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so let me -- give me one minute for me to kind of put this on the paper for me to -- i lost track of the points.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
the second one is breakdown by driver. net revenue per-hectoliter beer. and the third one is brand portfolio, elaborate power versus shift by segment.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so if i miss some of the questions, we go over it, ok? so yes. so for a while, i've been mentioning previous quarters that over the long run, overall prices should grow in line with inflation. and there we are talking big time here on shelf prices. and then plus and minus, you have efficiencies on discounts.
you have brand and channel mix, and then we have the impact of our portfolio strategy, mainly through innovation, ok? so these are things that we break down prices like that. and we have been much more flexible, nimble, agile in terms of revenue management to react to market conditions. so we are in the middle of a pandemic still. so channels are really changing different, what's growing, so transformation going on that you have to support.
and so we really went deep on revenue management. and specifically, this piece of discount i think some things happen. first of all, bees is helping us big time, ok? so granular, we have a big chunk of our volumes already through bees. you have like better algorithms.
we have better price trees because everything is really digitized and centralized. so it's really -- creates a framework, a easy framework for us to really understand the listing and the discounts and everything. so this is one thing. second thing, we are more linear because of that, ok? so we are kind of more less concentrated and preparing for everybody to have some access to the return in terms of discount.
so we are trying to get this a little bit with more standards, and we were able to make it. so we really moved this vision of a lot of discounts to trade in to a much more discounts connected with sellout and connected with occasions, ok? so we are really with a strategy where, for example, brahma duplo malte, so the promotions should be correlated with barb q, and it should be the discount in this specific occasion in all -- for all the products. so we are really narrowing the brand building and expanding occasions and giving discounts on that direction. that is helping us to be much more effective, ok? so these three things, i would say that they were the drivers for us to really upgrade our discount management and our discount efficiencies, ok? so talking about brands, talking about the brand.
so the metric that we are really looking into it is really power. so it's a combination. so it's a proxy of -- it's more than preference because it's a combination of -- it's a proxy for the market share of the future, ok? and we have a big portfolio and we decided to kind of really elect inside this portfolio, which are the brands that we are really concentrate efforts for the long-term for them really to become, to become leaders. and we are with the strategy of really concentrating and bet on some brands and we have been able -- we need to drive the brands that we believe that they will win in the future big time.
so it's -- we are very excited that brahma duplo malte is doing very well. it's bringing brahma together. we are excited that skol kind of stabilized at some point. i mentioned this in terms of volumes.
we understand it in terms of on the brand side, too. and then we have the premium business, as i mentioned before. so the combination of the five brands that i have, they are really moving ahead of my market share. so really beck's is doing very well, colorado is doing very well, corona.
so when we put these things, all these things together -- so with a total portfolio of abi is gaining in this metric that we are looking there is power with the focus brands really gaining even more. and in the brands that were suffering the past they are kind of stabilizing. so this is the type of equation on the equity that we are seeing in the market.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
and then, thiago, and this is valid across segments and also, if you look at the film since last year and not only the quarter performance, right, i mean, brand building takes time, right, requires consistency. and one of the things that we're seeing is really this gradual, right, improvement in our brand power across segments for the portfolio ever since last year.
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
perfect. that's very helpful. and jean, just one part of one of my questions. is it fair to say that carnival should have had an impact in terms of how you translate revenue per hectoliter on a year-over-year basis?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so if i had carnival, i would have a net revenue debt to equity that was smaller than that. so that's the question?
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
yes.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
let me see. i think if i had carnival, i would have a mix of packaging that it was worse than what i have today because it's more concentrated on weekends. so i don't see an impact on the pricing side. if i had carnival, i would have something around 1 million hectoliters of cans selling in the market.
i think that's how we should approach carnival.
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
yes. that's a good exercise.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
that's about price and more about packaging mix.
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
thank you.

the next question comes from marcella recchia with credit suisse.
marcella recchia -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, jean. hi, lucas. thank you for taking the questions. i have two questions.
first, it's about pricing. listening brito at abi conference call earlier, he mentioned about price increase for brazil beer in june. so my first question is, if you could elaborate a bit on your pricing tensions and the magnitude over the coming quarters, in light of recent commodity cost pressure, but also in light of the commodity cost outlook next year. that will be my first question before -- i will wait before moving to the second one.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so brito mentioned that, marcella, and as we have been mentioned in previous quarter. look, over the long run, overall prices should grow in line with inflation. and i'm talking pretty much about shelf prices. and then on top of that, you have the discount and then you have plus and minus brand and channel.
but there is this reference of shelves that on the long term, should grow with inflation, and you know that we have been very flexible, nimble and agile in a way to react to market conditions, where we can go and move back or it can stick. so we are really taking every opportunity that we can, but it's really something that is very fluid. and so having said that, i would say that we cannot comment on pricing moving forward. i would just comment that this scenario that we are living in brazil is a more inflationary scenario that we have to understand that got worse than we had in the past.
and looking here, look, i'm really looking to the consumer. i'm not looking for my -- specifically for my costs. my cost, i already -- my cogs, cash cogs, i gave the guidance already. i'm talking really about the basket of the consumer and the inflation that we have over there and how we are -- we get better prepared for them, ok? so i cannot comment much further than that, just that we are in an inflationary scenario that end of the year, inflation was smaller than it was right now.
and we have to find a way to adjust to it.
marcella recchia -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and my second question is about the sg&a. you mentioned on the outlook for this year and also in the call, that you expect higher sg&a because of the bonus provision, right? so just to understand if you can comment something about the outlook of this increase for this line this year, if you -- what can we expect on that?
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
yes. marcella, this is lucas. thanks for the question. so for sg&a, in q1, the biggest impact was indeed the provision for bonus, ok, based on our stronger-than-expected performance to start the year.
should we remain on track or ahead of our expectations from a budget perspective, we will continue to accrue bonus provisions throughout the remainder of the year. so that -- it's reasonable to expect some additional, right, higher sg&a as a result, ok? the second biggest impact that we are seeing so far this year is regarding distribution expenses, and that's mostly a function of volume growth, right? so as volumes grow, our variable logistics cost also tends to grow. the good news there is that there is a benefit in the top line and the net -- it's a net positive at the end of the day, ok? so the higher sg&a in the distribution side is compensated, is offset by the improvement in net revenues. and finally, the third bucket is sales and marketing.
in q1, there was lower sales and marketing versus last year, but this was mostly due to phasing, particularly in brazil, as a result of the restrictions that came back in march. so we obviously had to adjust our sales and marketing spend, given that restrictions were in place. so going forward, as we recover, as cities reopen and the on-trade recovers, we are going to adjust our sales and marketing spend accordingly, ok?
marcella recchia -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you so much.

the next question comes from lucas ferreira with j.p. morgan.
lucas ferreira -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. congrats on the strong results. i have two 2 questions.
sorry if they are kind of too technical around your forward-looking statements. the first one, you guys mentioned that you already kind of envisioned turning to the prepandemic ebitda, right? so assuming the 2019 number, for instance, but i assume that your profitability will still be back up. my question is, is there anything structural that you see in the industry in the recession, the cost structure of the industry that -- in the company that would impair you to come back to the prepandemic profitability. so in 2019 guidance, ebitda margin of roughly 42%.
so is there anything that you guys think that would be impairing you to return to this level? and if for some reason, considering the pricing power, considering the reopen that you're seeing right now, you kind of already envisioned that this could be seen at some point -- at some point in time in the foreseeable future. so that's my first question. the second question is around the same topic. and looking at the second half of the year, if you guys are reiterating the guidance for the cost per hectoliter, i would assume that your kind of cogs curve is more skewed to the first half of the year, considering you cogs per hectoliter is up at 25% this quarter.
so in terms of, let's say, margin comps, are you seeing an easier second half than first half?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
yes. so let me tackle this one, and then lucas can help me. so we are in the middle of a pandemic, ok? so this is -- i think this is what we should talk about. since the beginning of last year, when we saw the scenario of bars shutting down, bars closed, mobility restrictions at some extent, sometimes more, sometimes less.
so all these things happening, we brought -- so we went to this vision of transforming the company toward the future. accelerate the things that we have been cooking during the pandemic, but really accelerate toward the future. and i've been mentioning that -- so i want to really recover top line on fee. and i really wanted to recover volumes for the big volumes that we had in 2014 that we lost 10 million hectoliters from that point on.
and we are being very consistent on that since looking for new occasions, the consumers. i'm now having 100,000 more customers that i had before. we were very happy to develop this relax-at-home occasion with our brands. that's something really the future now is something.
that's more developed and mature markets. so we were really with this mindset of let's get back in fee for the top line that we had at some point in time and really less follow the consumer, ok? so what i mentioned today, it is that. so we are confident on that. we are very proud about the things that we achieved on the top line side.
we see momentum. i think it's time for us to go back and say, look, so if the -- for the recovery of the bottom line. so where -- when would we make it? and what i mentioned it is time for us to look of the bottom line that we had before the pandemic and magic. so i really don't see nothing structural that will not make us in this journey continue to converge the top-line growth with the bottom-line growth.
but in terms of the perspective of the pandemic and with this journey, we really decided to do one first -- one big thing first and then the other. the next step will really be to talk about margin expansions. the good news is that really, if you look at how we are -- one big part that we are suffering with this margin contraction is really the currencies. and if you look at -- we are, in 50% of my costs, they are in dollars with fx related.
and in the currency that i have in 2021, i mentioned that before, it's 530 i'm hedged this year. this connects with that guidance that i gave of low 20s in cash cogs. so it's 529 to be more specific, the fx that i have today, if you look at the market today. so this is exactly the fx that we have today.
so looks like this problem that i'm having today is kind of stabilized on this level of 529 that is already in my base. so i don't see on the fx side, exactly, nothing more structural than that. we could decide to hedge everything on that. and then i would not have a problem with that, but nothing that i'm going to do.
and then we have the commodities that really picked up in the short term, but we really have to understand how these things are going to evolve moving forward. the other piece is that really, as i mentioned, we understand this inflationary scenario. we have been nimble and agile for us really to get all the opportunities that we have, and really guarantee the momentum of our top line moving forward.
lucas ferreira -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
sorry to insist on the second point that you see the second-half margin comp side here, considering your new level of prices and considering the cogs guidance kind of more skewed to the first half.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
yes. so lucas, as i mentioned in my opening remarks, in terms of cash cogs per hectoliter for brazil beer, right, which is the guidance, we anticipate that the pressure will be greater, right, in q2, ok, followed by kind of less pressure in the second half of the year, ok? if you take a step back and look at the rest of the p&l, right, just if we go back to our performance during 2020 right? i think it's -- you can see that recovery driven by the top line was very strong in the second half of 2020, which means that we have a tough comp in terms of top line going into the second half of the year. ok? and as i mentioned before, sg&a, we do expect it to be higher, primarily due to the higher provision for variable compensation.
lucas ferreira -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks, lucas.

the next question comes from isabella simonato with bank of america.
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much, jean and lucas, for the questions. can you elaborate on the soft drink outlook in brazil? and also how do you expect cost pressure to come on that line of business this year? and if you could give us a little bit of more color about the quarters as you gave for beer, that would be very helpful. and also on the international part on last, top-line performance has also been quite strong, but the measures in terms of restrictions and etc., have been more volatile, right? how you're seeing the beginning of q2 and the evolution throughout the year?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you for the question. our net performance volume overall, it was an improvement in q1 2021. so we have a 0.8% growth.
it's really -- so we are still with a lot of restrictions, an important occasion on the soft drinks, it really is on the go. and so mobility really connects with nab industry, and we are still limited on that. but even though, we were able to get to slightly positive volumes. the brand is really what antarctica is coming back, getting performance better than it had before.
so it has been good. energy drinks, they are doing good, too, when we talk about the full portfolio. and all of these partially offset by the occasions. the mix, there is an important thing for the profitability of soft drinks through the smaller packs, the channels, the on the go in the end was -- it's better than we expected, but it's still not there.
and we believe that will get better as the vaccination move forward and the restrictions go down, ok. so this is nab. when you talk about cac, yes, so --
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
las.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
las. when we talk about las. so las was an important quarter for us. it was a great performance, i believe.
so we had -- we felt the restrictions more in brazil on march. we are feeling restrictions in chile now, a little bit on paraguay, too. when we go to argentina -- so talking overall about las. so it was a solid performance on argentina, chile, and paraguay, mainly driven by corporates and premium segments gaining market share in all of these countries, argentina, chile and paraguay.
bolivia is a place where we feel still under pressure over there, uruguay, too, but argentina, chile and paraguay with a very good performance. yes, we saw some restrictions moving forward over there. but as you see, fluid, like the pandemic, it comes and it goes. so we are excited because las, we made -- we had some important changes over there.
there is -- chile is really being, we have a structural change and new combination of partnership with coke over there. that's really bringing us some different capabilities and possibilities. so it's really something that we are very excited that we are able to gain market share on the own trade segment. that's something that we have been struggling in the past to do, so volumes very strong, very, very excited.
argentina too, we see the portfolio is really more -- it is stronger. and this year, we were able to be -- to the government and all the things we have been more flexible with more freedom for us to work on the revenue management side on discounts and on everything. so structurally, i believe that i'm really excited about las. in a pandemic yes, we saw some restrictions, but it's something that it comes and goes.
it's fluid.
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
sure. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from joã£o soares with citibank.
joao soares -- citi -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everybody. thanks for taking my questions. i have two quick questions.
the first one, you had a very interesting discussion on the discount, but it's interesting to see that you're using your online channels to enhance your intelligence, right? and i imagine that, especially through the dtc, you've been gaining a lot of intelligence on the consumer. so if there is anything, jean, that you could share with us regarding consumer behavior trends, possibly capacity to absorb further price increases and how they connect to the recent trends that you've been seeing, like the fact that brands that suffered in the past are now stabilizing. so anything that connects with the consumer behavior that you can you can share with us would be very, very interesting. so that's my first point.
and the second point, you talked a lot about -- you already talked about the commodity cost pressure. we are already almost halfway through the year. aluminum prices have been going up. so if you can talk about any initiatives ongoing, apart from the revenue management that you've been doing, to maybe mitigate this potential cost pressure going to next year would be very interesting as well.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so let's talk about consumer behavior and revenue management first. so consumer trends. so we are seeing this thing about the in-home consumption.
and so it's really -- so how the whole pandemic was really about how to win in the in-home occasion and consumption. so that was the most important thing for us, too. and i think we reacted very fast, and we had a lot of learnings on that. we know that the occasion in home is more about relaxation.
it's more about mondays and tuesdays and frequency much better than before that was very concentrated. and now people is more willing to like watching tv, livestream, relaxing. so this is important that for us to win, you have to connect brands in roic market and be profitable on this occasion. so we are working a lot on that.
we know that consumers are convenience. it's convenience, it's everything isn't it. so consumers are really looking for convenience. so they are buying locally.
so they are buying in moms and pops close to their home, in e-commerce, in the delivery. so they are -- moms and pops and bars, they are transforming really to become small takeaway supermarkets of some things. so there is this thing that we are that's, for example, for you to know. so we are betting on the rgb 300 ml bottles as the pack that really can -- that's leading the takeaway occasion for all the bars and moms and pops that they are transforming.
so if they cannot deliver it, they have to have a takeaway strategy. and this strategy is really working very fine because we designed so the pack is a good pack for us to do that. so the price point is designed for that. we are doing most of it -- of the places, six bottles for brl 12, so it's a good price point for six units that people can take.
the customers are really adopting because they need this takeaway because this pandemic is truly -- they open and close, so they need something for people to take away. so this is something that is really working from our side. so ze delivery, i don't have to mention again. we have been talking a lot about it.
so it's really about convenience. it is something -- bet on that. we know that there are two occasions that we are developing to. there is this thing about signature beer.
we have another strategy that is the seprecada, where we have like signatures for the whole year. that's same price, that's number of beers every month in your home. so this is -- we have been investing in brazil. this is exploding in argentina is really something we've got traction there.
so ze delivery is stronger here. seprecada is stronger in argentina. so we have to find the value proposition, the prices for that. we are developing apps for pantry-loading parties.
that is not about the ze delivery, is about big party that you want a discount for big. so we are really working on these missions and occasions that are enabled by technology for us really to be ahead of the time on that. so all these learnings and all the technology that we have, we are betting big time to be ahead, to be ahead of the game. in talking about offset costs of commodities headwinds? yes, that really [technical difficulty] are we still here? yes.
so as anticipated, so this year was a year that we faced transactional fx headwinds, given the depreciation of real, 50% of our cogs is dollar rated. and now we are seeing these commodities that is something that is coming to the table. but the things that we are doing are very consistent. and it's really about this do not lose this momentum, the going growth continuity is really something that help us big time sweat the assets and have a better vlc logistic cost and have a better operational leverage when the volumes go up.
so i'm really -- we are really excited about more toward the end of the year, about the vaccination. that is really something that we believe that rgb 600 ml bottles and the socialized out-of-home occasion is really something that will pick back. we are preparing for that. so we think some euphoria we're going to have around that.
if we are -- we have a much broader base of clients. so the prices are well set that we are prepared for when this moment happen. so this innovation strategy that we have that is really like driving mix and prices through new products. so this core plus, the premium portfolio, all these adjacencies.
so duarte asked here about the carnival. in carnival, i sell a lot of that products that we have there is a beats that is so accretive for the company. so that product is really designed for parties in its kind of -- so this occasion, big parties, outside events is depressed. and we believe that if it doesn't come in q4, it will come in q1 of next year.
so this innovation, vision of occasions and missions are helping and will help us big time. and we will not lower the guard. so financial discipline is still there around cost -- around costs, around expenses. so the capex is really about strategic investment.
so we are really concentrating capex on the technology piece, on the footprint for us to really have the better service possible for customer and consumer. so this part here, there is a lot of learning because consumers are really paying for convenience. so they pay in the ze delivery. so there, our customers are beginning to pay for more days of delivery as a service.
so we -- so understanding the missions in these demands, we are really being able to have some additional revenue on services, too, ok? so that was pretty much it that i could mention on the commodities mitigation.
joao soares -- citi -- analyst
great. great vision. thanks for the call.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so i think that was the last one, we have one more? that was the last one. i really want to thank, first of all, my team that is here working on ambev, working for ambev. so team is working very hard to have this quarter for one year inside the pandemic to achieve these results, to have this great start in a very challenging environment.
i also want to thank you all, the analysts, everyone who joined the call for the time and attention. and to wrap up, i'm really confident about the future for some reason. so we are on the path of a very good commercial momentum. i think this is -- has been confirmed quarter by quarter here with you all.
not only brazil, but we are really picking up international operations like argentina did very well. chile, we are so excited about chile. cac, we are beginning to see that once the vaccination in u.s. is really moving forward.
so this summer in cac is already the hotels are already booked and everything. so we are really seeing this momentum, not just in brazil, but international operations. although transformation, that big bet on technology that we are doing takes time, and the environment remains challenging. we can see contributions of our digital efforts.
so bees is like bringing a lot of possibilities for us. ze delivery is doing great. so we have another effort on that side. this portfolio is stronger.
our portfolio is much better than it was like two years ago. high-end brands are really gaining equity. beck's is there. corona is doing very well.
colorado, doing very well. budweiser is a brand very important for us. that's growing, too. so we see brand power.
the core plus segment, it was something that we get it right, and we want to continue to bring new news on that with innovation pipeline. and one thing that we don't talk that much, but cash generation, it is really something that is really structurally solid at ambev because we have been prepared for that. these channels somehow, they help us on this core working capital. so my cash generation is really solid when you look last three years and this year, and we remain committed to transform the company and invest ahead.
so that's it. thank you very much. thank you all, and thank you. yes.
just get in touch with lucas and the team, and then we can continue the conversation.

good morning, and thank you for waiting. i would like to welcome everyone to ambev's first-quarter 2021 results conference call. today with us, we have mr. jean jereissati, ceo for ambev; and mr.
lucas lira, cfo and investor relations officer. as a reminder, a slide presentation is available for downloading on our website, ri.ambev.com.br, as well as through the webcast link of this call. [operator instructions] before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the safe harbor of securities litigation reform act of 1996. forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of ambev's management and on information currently available to the company.
they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions because they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of ambev and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. i would also like to remind everyone that, as usual, the percentage changes that will be discussed during today's call are both organic and normalized in nature. and unless otherwise stated, percentage changes refer to comparisons with first-quarter 2021 results.
normalized figures refer to performance measures before exceptional items which are either income or expenses that do not occur regularly as part of ambev's normal activities. as normalized figures are non-gaap measures, the company discloses the consolidated profit, eps, ebit and ebitda on a fully reported basis in the earnings release. now i'll turn the conference over to mr. jean jereissati, ceo for ambev.
mr. jereissati, you may begin your conference.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
thank you very much for joining our call. in february, i mentioned that 2021 would be a challenging year and covid-19 pandemic was still very real. after that, we saw a steep deterioration of the sanitary conditions in brazil, coupled with increased mobility restrictions, which impacted our people, customers, suppliers and consumers. at the same time, we were better prepared this time around.
as a result, we delivered a great start of the year. we grew ebitda by 23.8%, driven by double-digit volume and double-digit net revenue per hectoliter growth in brazil, cac and las. consolidated volumes were 5.4%, above q1 '19, and we were able to get back to flattish ebitda versus q1 2019. this was another quarter we saw clear signs that our commercial strategy is working and that momentum continues.
i was very happy to see the strong performance of our international operations, and brazil continues to show that we are in the right path. we delivered volume growth in eight of our 10 markets and market share gains in seven of these markets. we saw a solid net revenue per-hectoliter growth in the quarter, driven by a more flexible and efficient revenue management initiatives, including occasion-based promotional activities. we continued to strengthen our portfolio as we launched innovations across our markets, to name a few, golden extra in panama, bud light seltzer in canada and michelob ultra in the premium segment in brazil.
las delivered strong volume growth in the core plus and premium segments with a great performance of corona. in argentina, we had an outstanding volume performance and improved net revenue per hectoliter, delivering top-line growth of 67%. cac restrictions were partially lifted during the quarter that, combined with the good performance of our above core portfolio and effective revenue management initiatives, delivered a top-line growth of 28%, led by dominican republic and guatemala. canada gained market share and grew volumes despite a tough comp in q1 2020.
growth was led by hard seltzers and the above core beer portfolio with michelob ultra and corona. brazil beer volumes grew 16% despite carnival cancellation in february and tougher mobility restrictions imposed in march. according to our estimates, we gained market share while growing volumes in all segments, with a special highlight to our global brands that had a solid high-teens growth and brahma duplo malte that continued its growth momentum. green health of the portfolio improved once again in all segments this quarter, and our digital initiatives continued to expand.
ze delivery fulfilled 14 million orders in this quarter, reaching an all-time high in march. net revenue per-hectoliter growth was strong again. this growth was mainly driven by effective revenue management initiatives. this also had positive impact as it helped to standardize and increase efficiency across our portfolio.
today, i would like to further focus on bees, our super app for our customers. we believe that bees has been important to deliver a strong commercial performance as it digitizes our route to market, enables our customers to place an order in three clicks at any time of the day and offers assortment selections to pocs using algorithms. on top of that, bees offer other services, such as financial services, scheduled delivery, rewards programs and other products via marketplace, providing a full e-commerce experience to our customers. since our decision last year to launch bees in brazil, we managed to roll it out to all our ddcs and wholesalers.
as a result, we now reach more than 65% of our active customers in brazil via bees, accounting for over 550,000 customers. and we generated more than brl 6.5 billion in gmv. given this promising early results and to further boost the platform, in march, we announced that menu.com, a start-up marketplace for bars and restaurants that had been accelerated by z-tech for the past two years, will be integrated into bees ecosystem. today in brazil, we offer more than 100 skus from approximately 31 partners in 380 cities already, reaching more than 5% of our net revenue in some of these locations.
our platform's scale will open many new opportunities for us to grow together with our customers and our partners. our digital platforms will be fully connected throughout our operation, integrating with and leveraging on our existing supply chain, logistics and sales capabilities. as our digital transformation evolves, we will enhance each step in our supply chain and become more flexible, efficient and integrated with our partners, customers and consumers, improving our nps throughout the ecosystem. as for the rest of 2021, our outlook remains unchanged, and we continue to expect a challenging year.
covid-19 is real and around us, and cost pressures will continue, mainly in brazil, not only thanks to fx, but also to commodities prices. with that said, i remain very confident in our people, our capabilities and plans for 2021. overall volumes at ambev continued its performance in april, and net revenue per-hectoliter performance will remain a focus, especially in brazil, given the inflationary scenario we are living. we expect our top-line performance should continue to drive our recovery, growing ahead of bottom line as we work to get back in the full year to the normalized consolidated ebitda of prepandemic levels.
thank you very much. thank you for your time and attention. and i will hand this over to lucas. 
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
thank you, jean. hello, everyone. this time last year, our financial performance was marked by declining net revenue, declining ebitda, declining normalized profit and declining operational cash flow generation. what's worse, we were still in the early days of the covid-19 pandemic.
what a difference a year makes. in q1 2021, net revenue grew nearly 28%. ebitda grew almost 24%, normalized profit grew close to 125%, and operational cash flow grew close to 84%. brazil beer performance was strong, and the growth of our international operations was even stronger.
just to put things into perspective, all these indicators are either at or above 2019 levels in nominal terms. and in terms of outlook, even though covid-19 is still around, i believe it's fair to say that things are not as gloomy as before. quite the contrary, we expect recovery to continue as vaccinations pick up. so i'm proud to see that not only have we navigated the crisis well so far, but more importantly, that the commercial momentum we started to build in q3 2020 has continued to translate into consistent improvement in our financial results quarter after quarter.
we have two big priorities on the finance side, number one, continue to protect liquidity, given the still volatile environment; and number two, improve our return on invested capital. the team has done a great job since last year in terms of protecting our liquidity position, which remains solid in each of our markets while still investing about brl 1.3 billion in capex in the quarter. most of this investment was directed toward increasing our brewing and packaging capacity, particularly in brazil, to support our innovation pipeline. and the second biggest bucket of investment was in technology, such as our erp integration designed to, among other things, support our b2b and b2c platforms.
and in terms of roic, there's a lot of work going into improving resource allocation, as well as improvements in working capital, but there is no doubt that one of our biggest challenges remains the recovery of our profitability. fx headwinds will remain as our biggest hurdle throughout the year, particularly in q2, whereas one-way package mix and commodity pressures should also be a factor. in addition, cash sg&a was higher in q1, mainly due to provisions for variable compensation, given the stronger-than-expected start to the year. since 2020 was a 0-bonus year, should our performance remain on track, provisions for variable compensation should continue to impact our year-over-year sg&a performance going forward.
on the other hand, the stronger-than-expected top-line performance should help offset higher sg&a for the remainder of the year, and we will keep focusing on our productivity initiatives and typical financial discipline regarding costs and expenses management. yes, we will continue to work hard on improving our profitability, but we will not lose sight of the long term. the sense of urgency is there, but we have to be disciplined and stick to our commercial plan, which, after all, has been working. for us, the name of the game still is continuous and consistent improvement of our results.
we have been on this improvement journey since the second half of 2020, and q1 was another important step. so there's definitely more to come. finally, a quick word on esg. in june, we plan to host a webinar to focus specifically on how we have been working to embed esg into our company model.
i hope to see you all there. thank you. and now let's move to q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from marcella recchia with credit suisse. please, marcella, go ahead. [foreign language]
marcella recchia
hi, jean. hi, lucas. thank you for taking my questions. i have two questions here.
first on brazil beer. could you explore a little bit more about the strong top-line growth we have seen now for a few quarters in a row and your expectations to sustain this momentum going forward? i'll wait that before going to my second question.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so, yes, brazil beer has been with good momentum for a while right now. we know that last year, in the pandemic, the comps are all over the place. but if you look at a cleaner reference that is 2019, you can see clear how brazil is still with gaining momentum quarter after quarter. ambev is accelerating, too.
and i think this is based on many decisions that we took all over the past year, that it was really a mindset of being the leader in expanding the industries. and the industry had this opportunity to develop the in-home occasion, increasing -- helping to increase frequency. a lot of the mindset on innovation where 20% of our revenues are really coming from india, brazil, from products that did not exist three years ago. and this is a pipeline of brands that they are coming quarter by quarter, and they are maintaining their performance.
so i'm very excited about that. there is one information, too, that we have here in brazil about the brand equity, the brand power of our portfolio. and when we compare h2 2021 with h2 2020, we gained 3 million new fans of our brands. so that's a kpi that we focus and we follow very close.
so consumers that they really elect one of our brands as their preferred brand. so this number is really increasing. our portfolio is really stronger. and moving forward, i think somehow the good news will come as the vaccination come back.
with the reopening, we come back to our stronghold. there is really this socializing out-of-home occasion. so somehow i feel very confident that we are with a structural moment on our top line, with momentum. that, i'm very confident of.
marcella recchia
perfect, jean. my second question now is more sort of an update about your vendor initiative, menu.com. could you share with us more about the recent developments on this business line?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
menu?
marcella recchia
yes.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
the marketplace. right?
marcella recchia
exactly.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so that was a start-up that we accelerated two years ago. we grew 60 times their gmv with us. and then we make a decision to -- when we accelerate menu, we didn't have this developed. and then now we decided to combine these initiatives.
and then the marketplace and the new assortment will be leveraged by the audience of bees. so we are migrating these platforms. we have this view of customer community. and then we are adding technologies for this customer community.
and bees will lead that. and so menu now is inside bees. the founders are leading the way with that, and we are really putting all together. so mentioned -- and then going to bees.
so now we have 70% of our active buyers already purchasing through the platform. that was like 20% like one year ago. the gmv, when we put our beers, is really accelerating, so brl 9 billion now. and the nps that we measure about the usage of the app, the delivery is really all-time high.
and we are, with all the team of menu, using this platform to develop the partnerships, the relation with the different industry, the knowledge about everything together. so bees and menu, they were integrated.
marcella recchia
perfect, jean. thank you so much.
operator
our next question comes from carlos laboy with hsbc. please, carlos, go ahead.
carlos laboy -- hsbc -- analyst
yes, everyone. good morning. lucas or jean, can you please share with us how your digital capability and your upgraded approach to the business, your upgraded values are changing the way that you impose price discipline across the marketplace? in other words, how you resist maybe the impulse or temptation for discounting. and i'm speaking about both the will and the capabilities for achieving superior pricing discipline and how you link that then to both your brand development and your market development.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. i'll take that one. laboy, thank you very much for the question. so if you look back on this -- on our journey of becoming more digital and in our vision of moving from a beverage company into a platform where we have two big communities, there is a consumer community that ze leads and the customer community that now bees leads.
we are in a long journey of building this capability and this muscle. we acquired back two years ago [inaudible]. that was really the company that helped us in the beginning, and then we internalized. and then we invested on bees and now in ze delivery.
now we have something around 2,000 coders working with us, really with this mindset of being able to get digital products and not just beverage products in the market. and bees and ze, both, they give us a lot of visibility, a lot of granularity for us to increase big time our revenue management capabilities. so i'll talk first about bees. now 70% of our customers, they are there.
and so we know when they buy, we are really learning that they prefer to use the app during weekends and do not wait for the sales rep, and then the sales rep gets there. and there is the learning that something that we didn't figure out before that they buy. b2b business is made of impulse, too. so they buy in different days if you have good promotions.
and we can add different products to a basket if you really have the insight about the basket of our customers when we add different information. so bees is a completely different muscle animal that will help us have a lot of insights on our pricing strategy, much better that we had before. and bees helped us already. if you see our discount optimization big time this year where we are much more linear, much more in terms of acquiring new customers.
so we are with 10% more customers that we had before the pandemic. and this type of granularity and artificial intelligence is really helping us really to be efficient with discounts and to do a smarter pricing and smarter revenue management. and ze is another thing. so ze, we have a 5 million consumers community that they use the app.
and we are just targeting now 1 occasion that is this thing about ultra convenience, 20 minutes, 30 minutes beer at home with supermarket prices. but then there is a lot of room for us really to follow all the consumer journey, think about when our consumers, they have a party to anticipate that and have a different type of revenue management for that occasion. and we are -- and we have the opportunity to increase big-time signatures, too, where we have another app. and ze delivery came at some point in time decide if it goes for this new mission.
and all these missions, we can go very granular. you can really decide in a smart way what's the revenue strategy for it. so we are in a completely new moment in terms of capabilities of using data to decide our revenue initiatives.
carlos laboy -- hsbc -- analyst
so you have more tools and capabilities for protecting the value of your brands by offering a point of sale on array of other areas and services where you don't have to give away value in your brands, essentially. right?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
that's it. because we are -- we add convenience. we think about missions. we understand our consumers.
and with a broader portfolio, we can -- when we put all these four levers together, we can really go to a different level of revenue management with the technology that we just added.

our next question comes from thiago duarte with btg pactual. please, thiago, go ahead.
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
hello, lucas. hello, jean. hello, everybody. thanks for the opportunity.
i'd like to ask three questions, actually. the first one is, if you can help us navigate through the sg&a, particularly in beer brazil, but i think it goes for the rest of the -- of geographies. but particularly in brazil, i mean, it's clear the year-over-year pressure on g&a coming from bonus accruals. but it also feels like that there is more to it.
and i was wondering how much that's coming from the digital initiatives and the last mile logistics that is arguably impacting your cost there, particularly coming from bees and ze. so if you can help us through -- navigating through it in terms of how we should think of it in percentage of revenues going forward for sg&a, that would be nice. the second question is on bees. and you mentioned the brl 9 billion gmv in brazil and how 70% of your clients are already active in the platform.
but can you help us or can you detail a little bit more on how that gmv breaks down between ambev's products and third-party products? or in other words, how much your clients -- of those 70%, how much of their purchases they are doing effectively from the platform? and that will be nice to hear as well. and the third question, can you talk a little bit, i think, more to industry? can you talk a little bit more about the resilience of the beer industry? you already discussed in a previous question about the momentum that you guys have built over the last four quarters -- four or five quarters. but can you talk about the industry itself? because it really looks like the industry -- ambev is stronger than the industry now, but it looks like the industry is strong on itself. so can you talk about bees in terms of the demand and in terms of how the occasions have built during the pandemic and how you expect this normalization to affect your mix in particular? because it also looks like premium has gained more ground on the back of these changes provoked by the pandemic.
so if you could elaborate on that, that would be nice.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. good questions, thiago. thank you for the questions. i will start backwards.
we start with the industry, then bees and then we'll go for sg&a. ok? so industry, first of all, yes, we are seeing a resilient industry. we always mentioned that our industry is a resilient one. and the point there is that it's like we really made this decision a little bit before the pandemic to -- as a leader company to really bet on that.
we studied a lot the difference of industries and performance of brazil and mexico to get our approach down in here in brazil. and then when the pandemic came, we really decided to really accelerate toward the future, toward what's going on in a market that's maturity two and goes for maturity three and what's our approach for channel and innovation and occasions. so we really went bold on that. a big part of the industry expansion, probably all of the industry expansion, is really coming from our volumes.
and what we have seen, it is that i think -- is that beer in brazil, it is something that is very healthy in terms of consumer approach. so it's not losing share of growth. it's very healthy. it's a category that we see as very healthy.
the interest, the concept about new liquids and the meaning of the brand. so everybody is still very important in the culture and the people's lives. so this is one thing. the second thing is that we always knew that moving forward to a more mature market, new occasions would come, and then we have this view of a big part of the increase in the industry in brazil coming.
it's coming from frequency. it's coming from in-home. it's really coming from mondays and tuesdays relaxation mindset. so that's what we see.
and we believe this is something that we see coming in all the markets, and it was just accelerated by the pandemic. and we believe that the residual of that will maintain. and then with the vaccination and the restrictions really being lifted, we will go back to the other occasion that are really our stronghold, the bars and the socializing out of home. so in the end, i believe that the combination of like ambev really putting industry as a priority in the learnings of mexico and the innovation that address occasions and address new consumers who, for example, stella sem gluten is really -- so it really add consumers for the industry.
i really believe that the industry will keep strong. so that's my view on that. i believe that with vaccination and with all the things that we did, i think we want to have -- i'm optimistic in terms of industry about h2. in reality, a surprise for us, it was more than the high end what we saw.
it was really innovation in core and the resilience of the core, really making a big part of this growth of the industry that we navigated very well. high end is something there is more structure, is more long term. so this is -- we know that's the one coming. the difference that we really saw in this last year, it was really innovation in core that drove a lot of the changes in the industry.
ok? so this is one thing. so second thing about bees. so first of all, we -- the vision is to digitalize our customers and then to have beer as their backbone. so they have to download the app, the bees.
they have to -- the usage has to be good. the nps has to be high. and we should be able to do it by ourselves, like beer, thinking about the new role of the sales representative, how they will be in part of that, how we're going to bring all this e-commerce experience for our b2b. and this is where we are.
so we are guaranteeing that this is -- so we are aggregating now our wholesalers. so bees is now a platform that we're going to be in 100% of direct distribution centers and wholesalers. so we will be all over brazil. and then with that, we begin to aggregate partners.
ok? so this brl 9 billion is pretty much our beer gmv. when we put at ambev today, information that i can give you is that we are close to brl 100 million of products that didn't -- are part of our portfolio. this is growing very fast as we continue to expand our e-commerce portfolio. now we are with around 300 skus that -- they are not from our portfolio.
they are now, but they are not produced by us. thirty-one partners, and we are in 380 cities offering this new portfolio. and so this is the type of numbers that we have. so brl 100 million ambev, not just beer brazil that -- with products that are not from our portfolio and growing very fast.
when we go for sg&a, i think we have to break it down. it's hard for us to talk about sg&a combined because they have very different dynamics. sales and marketing is pretty much what we've seen this quarter, maybe a little bit of phasing from things that we didn't do in q1 because of carnival that we invested more in the premium now. but overall, in the long term, they should be like in line a little bit below our top line.
when we go for distribution, what came above our volumes, performance, and normal inflation? there is a half-half performance on this innovation that we just launched, and then the supply capabilities, they are coming. so we launched it, for example, now a brand called spaten. so it is starting through breweries, and then we move it a lot, and then we catch up to producing more breweries. so there is a piece of it.
and a piece of it is really the transformation, the last mile, the ze. so when we look at these numbers in the past, what goes beyond the volume and the inflation, there is a half-half. there is a lot of efficiency for us to do on these two fronts. the supply capabilities of innovation, they are accelerating.
and ze, the last mile, there is a lot of opportunity for us. and bonus is really that we didn't have last year. and once we decided that the role of this year was to have a v-shaped recovery on the top line, so in the end, this is something that we are delivering, and we are accruing the bonus for that. there is above last year and above a normal average that we had in the past.
but i will ask lucas to give a little bit more insights on the sg&a, please?
lucas lira -- chief financial and investor relations officer
ok. thank you, jean. thanks for the question, thiago. so i think on sales and marketing, right, i think the way to think of it, ok, is really around sales and marketing, which is what we saw in h1.
right? we saw net revenue growth ahead of sales and marketing. ok? so i think it's -- we're not targeting specifically any sort of trend going forward. but if you look at the performance over the last few quarters, that's what you've seen. ok? in terms of distribution, i think the way jean broke it down makes sense.
ok? so i would look at it on the variable side really linked to volume growth and also mix of returnable glass bottles on the one hand. ok? and so as volumes continue to grow, it's reasonable to expect distribution expenses to also grow. and as returnable glass bottles recover, likewise, some increase in distribution per hectoliter as a result. and then on the other side of distribution expenses, we have the innovation, and we have initiatives like dtc.
innovation, there's opportunity for improvement as we bring online more production capacity spread out around the country to really avoid the need to ship product long distance as the footprint improves for innovation. and as jean mentioned, regarding dtc, the reality is that ze is still not at scale. and so as it continues to scale up, we do see more opportunity for efficiencies on the distribution side of the dtc platform. ok? and then finally, on admin, the bulk of the organic variance year over year is indeed coming from variable compensation that explains more than half of the increase.
and that's a function of the fact that recovery is better than expected, right, as we went into the year. so if we continue to deliver better-than-expected results for the remainder of the year, we should continue to accrue for bonus going forward. ok?
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
great answers. thank you so much, guys.

our next question comes from isabella simonato with bank of america. please, isabella, go ahead.
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everyone. jean, lucas, thank you for the call. my question is on the cost side, right? i remember, lucas, you mentioned last quarter that q2 was likely going to be the peak when we think about cost per hectoliter.
and in reality, it was better than q1. right? and at the end of the day, you're keeping the guidance for the year. so i was wondering, what exactly changed this quarter, right, and how you're facing this for the second half of the year?
lucas lira -- chief financial and investor relations officer
ok. hi, isabella. thanks for the question. you're right, we had a positive surprise in q2 on the cogs per hectoliter -- on the cash cogs per hectoliter performance.
that improvement came mainly from mix. ok? and the reason for that improvement is really better-than-expected returnable glass bottle volumes, which recovered much faster than we anticipated. ok? and so -- and that's good news for the remainder of the year as we continue to work behind having returnable glass bottles, continue to gain weight as part of our mix. ok? and the reason why we are maintaining the full guidance for the year is because you may remember that in q1, i referred to the fact that part of our commodity costs are not hedged.
right? and given the way that commodities have continued to trend since then, the commodity cost pressure, the unhedged portion, right, is actually continuing to become more of a headwind. ok? net-net, we think it's going to be pretty much awash, meaning the higher unhedged commodity costs are going to be pretty much offset by better mix, right, which allows us to reiterate the guidance of cash cogs per hectoliter in the low 20s for the full year. ok? but that's the dynamic, better mix, offsetting higher unhedged commodity costs.
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's clear. thank you very much.

our next question comes from ben theurer with barclays. please, ben, go ahead.
ben theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
thank you very much, jean, lucas. congrats on the results. just wanted to follow up a little bit on the strategic initiatives around the dtc and the b2b business and how that is aligned with your more flexible pricing strategy, and how you think of the back half of the year and then into 2022 in regards to potential price initiatives, and how you think you can leverage what you've established on the dtc and b2b business. thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
yes. so let me try to give you a broader answer on that. so, yes, we are reviewing upgrading our strategy moving forward. we have this business vision that we are much more than a beverage company.
we want to transform into a platform with inspiring brands that really connect people in the ecosystem so that we can all grow together. and so there is a big bet on the tech piece on really upgrading the company into a platform where we have two communities that we really have to serve perfectly the customers community and the consumer communities. and then ze is addressing consumers. and then we're going to think about how to add more technology to that, more missions, more occasions, more -- ze should be more omnichannel.
and then bees is really about customers. and then we should like integrate it more with donus and really upgrade bees to a technology that serves ambev customers, but should move into a broader portfolio that we already talked in the scope. but then moving then into a fintech that has this opportunity to really solve financial problems, financial services of our customers with credit and with pos machines and everything. so we are really going in these two directions.
and the possibilities that we have in revenue management, they are transformational. so if you think we are, long term-wise, piloting discounts more as cash backs in the financial deck, in the financial -- in the fintech combined with bees, so we are really thinking about -- so we are learning a lot with this granular, big assortment. a lot of customers' information that we have, that we are using artificial intelligence. and the algorithms, they are upgrading.
and we are getting better and better on adding more portfolio to the same clients, on adding portfolio that is not from our breweries that -- but they are very essential to our customers. and so there is a lot of this new muscle of revenue management that we have on the customer side and on the consumer side. and at some point in time, these things will be really fully connected. so we give the discount to a consumer that goes in a customer that has bees.
and these things connect and they match each other at this rapidly. so it's going to be a new muscle that we want to -- that we are working very hard to be a competitive advantage for us. and we believe the things that we are learning this year, they will really help us in 2022 because they are really a transformation. and they are really good, not just from our perspective, but in the way we settle the things with customers, in the way we target consumers and get more discounts for consumers on a occasion based on missions.
so i really believe this muscle will be very important for us for 2022. it will help us on the top line. and other thing, it is that the best thing that we have, so we are living on an inflationary scenario here in brazil still. and in the end, so we have to make the decision on the price increases that usually comes on september, in the middle of september.
and the good thing is that we are seeing momentum, and it will be september, october in our business. we see momentum in our business, and this is very important to make these decisions because we feel comfortable to take risks. and we are seeing the vaccination numbers where brazil can be with like 80% of the population fully vaccinated by october, november. so it looks like we want to have a good end of the year with good momentum and with new tools and capabilities for us to really live in this inflationary scenario that we've been living in the last couple of quarters.
ben theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
ok. which in turn then should also help you to offset some of the incremental raw material cogs pressure you most likely have locked in for, what, at least the first-half '22. correct?
lucas lira -- chief financial and investor relations officer
yes. hi, ben. yes. this is lucas.
i can take this one. i think the answer is yes. it should help partially offset that. and remember that given our hedging policy, right, of course, we still have pretty much half of the year to go in terms of hedging.
but what we're seeing now is that looking into 2022, the pressures that we face for 2022 are far lower than the headwinds that we are facing in 2021. right? remember that given how the brl and the argentinian peso trended in the last 12 months, right, the bigger portion of our cost headwind this year is coming from fx. right? and looking into 2022, that's not the case so far this year. right? there's still half of the year to go.
but so far, we're at a much better place on the fx head side going into 2022 as opposed to where we are today. ok? and on the commodity side, yes, we do face higher commodity headwinds going into 2022. but the net-net combination of fx hedges and commodity hedges are at a much lower level than the type of headwinds we're facing in 2021.
ben theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
ok. perfect. well, fingers crossed for the second half, and thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from joao soares with citibank. please, joao, go ahead.
joao soares -- citibank -- analyst
thanks. yes. good morning, everybody, jean, and lucas. i just have two quick ones on my side.
the first one, i just wanted to understand -- with the vaccination accelerating in key cities here in brazil and the on-trade recovering, i just wanted to understand -- i mean of course, you're developing very well on bees. and of course, we're very close to that client throughout the most critical moment of the pandemic. so i wanted to understand how your share, how should we imagine ambev's overall market share in the on-trade once things recover fully? so that's my first question. the second question, yes, i know bees is developing very well, and thanks for sharing that information on the gmv and the color on the 3p.
but i wanted to understand about competition, looking more into the long term. do you identify any potential competitive pressure coming from potentially wholesalers developing their own online businesses that compete with the b2b clients and bees? so just wanted to understand more of the long-term outlook for bees.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so first, let's talk about the market share reopening in the on-trade. i think our -- so based on our information, so our market share, it's very strong. and so we have -- if you think about the last quarters, so i -- this q2, it is something that we are with very good market share, that something that we begin to build. and we really are on -- as i mentioned in the beginning, it looks like brazil is in a new level of volumes and market share on this q2, and i believe this.
if you think about channel mix, if we really can maintain the market share that we have channel by channel, and if their on-trade recovers this occasion of socializing out of home, so usually, this should be positive for us because it's the occasion that we really over-index. so somehow, i'm optimistic about the market share. and so let's see how it goes in h2. but theoretically, the trend should be in our favor.
and on top of that, so there is a lot of thing that is really structural. so the brahma brand is much healthier than before. brahma duplo malte helped the whole category, so the whole family. so all the brahmas helped big time on there and growing a lot on equity there.
so this is an important point on the consumer side. so my rtm is really structurally better than before. i'm reaching more customers. my service level is all-time high.
so the digitalization is bringing a completely new features and opportunities that we have, that they are liking so much, the adoption was so high. so somehow, i'm very confident on that matter. when you think about -- when we talk about wholesalers and bees, i believe somehow we are ahead of the game. so we were really -- we started this in the right moment.
if you are talking about my wholesalers, my wholesalers, they are really inside my ecosystem, very excited and aligned with the bees platform. so my wholesalers, that they are -- so my rtm is really 100% with bees. when we look about other beverage companies and other fmcgs, looks like we are pretty much ahead in the game. i know some competitors, they are trying here and there.
but i don't see that much coordination on that matter. so i think we are ahead in the game. and i think the marketplace, i think the competition is more on attack alone on these things. but in the end, there's a lot of opportunity.
so this market is so fragmented. so the leader in this industry has 3%, 4% of market share. so it's really a place where competition is very fragmented. and somehow, we bring a service level and a capability of delivering and reaching that unparallel.
so somehow, i think this is the things that i could mention about your question.
joao soares -- citibank -- analyst
thank you, jean. just to be clear, i was referring to the players [inaudible]. but i think you had answered the question. thanks.
lucas lira -- chief financial and investor relations officer
yes. we think the total addressable market is huge, and this industry is very fragmented. so we see plenty of opportunity. that's the bottom line.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
and i think it's less about competition in -- because it's very fragmented. it's really about underserved customers, that they are really in need in this moment, that all the small retailer need productivity to go over this pandemic in the future. they are in need of some company or some app that really solve their problems. and i think they are really underserved today.
so that's the view.
joao soares -- citibank -- analyst
understood. thanks.

our next question comes from alan alanis with santander. please, alan, go ahead.
alan alanis -- banco santander -- analyst
thank you so much. hey, lucas and jean. congratulations on the results and then the innovation and the strategic direction of the company, particularly in the [inaudible]. just a couple of quick questions.
one of them tactical, the other more strategic. the tactical one, could you help us understand the 4% sequential decline in pricing in beer in brazil from the first to the second quarter? how much of that is product mix, brand mix, channel mix, and so forth? and the strategic question has to do with chile, if you can give us an update in terms of your relationship with the coca-cola system over there. i understand that it's working very well. what are the lessons that you have learned? and what are the opportunities for those partnerships in other parts of latin america?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
thank you, alan. let me get this one. so the price reduction quarter over quarter, if you look back in the past, so it usually occurs mainly because of region mix and a little bit of channel mix. so it's something that is a little bit more structural than decision.
it's -- most of the years, it's there. it's around seasonality and mix, in general, of regions and channels. ok? so there is no big deal on that. it's not something that was a decision.
it's something that is more normal. ok? when we go to chile, so -- yes. so the good part of that is -- looks like -- and [inaudible], as they mentioned to us, it's very happy. we are very happy.
it looks like coke company is happy, too. so it's a deal that like it's -- there were a lot of value that we are properly sharing, and everybody is in a more nurture is -- looks like is happy. and it's a platform where one plus one is more than two, isn't it? because -- so we have the leading brand in terms of equity in chile. there is corona.
they have the leading platform of distribution. and we were trying to put these things in parallel when we decided to go together. the governance is working. and it just makes us confident to have more alliances in general, wasn't it? so bees all over the place is a technology where we are building a lot of alliances and partnerships.
and so i think this concept of alliances, they will be on the next level. in the past, it was just alliance on exclusive distribution. now -- and we are very happy with chile. but then we have to think alliance on a broader perspective, on using the technology, on ze delivery, on bees here and there.
sometimes you have distribution. sometimes you don't have the distribution, just get the take rate. so this concept, so we are going to be much more open to different types of alliances for us to do than we were before. chile was -- is one type that made us really confident that alliances are good and possible.
alan alanis -- banco santander -- analyst
yes. that makes a lot of sense. and, yes, they're very happy. so, again, congratulations, and thanks for taking my questions.
thanks.
operator
our next question comes from rob ottenstein with evercore. please, rob, go ahead.
rob ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thank you very much. a few questions that may be related. first, can you talk a little bit about how your high-end business in brazil beer is developing? obviously, a tremendous portfolio.
but what percentage of your business now? is it the high end? is that part of the business gaining share? and are you seeing any changes in the consumer base between kind of the craft beers that you have, the imports? any nuances around corona, beck's? so that would be the first question. and then the second question is, can you talk about innovation this year, kind of revisit what are the most important innovations in 2021? and anything that you're doing that's notable on the -- beyond beer or returnable -- not returnable bottle, returnable drink side -- ready-to-drink side, i'm sorry, ready-to-drink side in your region? so high end, '21 innovation, and ready-to-drink beyond beer projects in '21. thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so thank you for the question, robert. let me get the premium first. so this was a quarter that we grew with our portfolio of something around 35%.
so it was a good growth. so what we saw during the pandemic is that -- so we saw, in terms of portfolio, this thing about the resilience of the core. the high-end growth in this segment is something more structural, that it's like a more long term. and we see it coming back again.
and this is a structural. it's something that is our priority. and we put, as a kpi for us, brand equity, so investment in branding ahead of any type of market share gains. ok? so that was our decision.
we put the portfolio in place. we position the brands, find the consumers. and then we are really investing marketing dollars, over-indexing big time on the high end. and we really want to drive brand equity ahead of any type of penetration in consumption to really have a sustainable long-term business.
and we are very excited about it because we are growing equity very fast in a very consistent and sustainable way with our portfolio. and then our portfolio has to grow volumes accordingly. so it was a good quarter, but i'm more excited with even though -- with the brand equity on how corona is really performing in brazil, on how beck's, it really came with this vision of a product that follows the [inaudible] and has the edge in flavor as [inaudible]. so i'm really excited about brand equity moving very fast, sustainable for our portfolio, and then volume will follow.
ok? so this is one thing. second thing, it is that when we talk about innovation and adjacencies, so talking about beverage here, so the pipeline of innovation, the most relevant things that we have in place are -- so a bet on health and wellness. ok? so this is the avenue that we're going to populate, and we're going to have more products on that. so we are in the olympics now launching michelob ultra in brazil with the olympics -- in the olympics moment.
usain bolt is our -- is in our advertising. so it was a good moment for us to launch ultra. we just rolled it out after the pilot stella without gluten that we are very excited about. so we're bringing new consumers to the beer industry.
so these are -- this is an avenue, ultra, and gluten. we launched it in terms of renovation of the core, a brand called spaten. there is one brand that from our portfolio, german first dated from 1397 that we are rolling out in brazil, that it will have entry, premium, core-plus prices that is important bet that we have. we just started to roll it out.
and in terms of adjacencies. so the beats brand is doing very well. we are rolling out mike's hard lemonade with the flavors and with the lemon, tangerine, and pitaya flavors. and we are piloting hard seltzer.
so that's where we are. and these are the three most important avenues of pipeline, of innovation that we have for the h2.
rob ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. and if i could just follow up. and i was very interested in your comments on growing brand equity ahead of volumes essentially and making a kpi brand equity. is that approach somewhat different than what you've had over the past history? i mean, not maybe the last couple of years, but historically, over the last 10 years, would that be a very different approach?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so this -- specifically, this kpi that we are following, brand power -- or brand equity and power are going faster than the market share. it was something that, for now, we are 18 months consistent with this specific strategy, and we begin to see it paying off.
rob ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst
terrific. thank you very much.

ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. now i would like to turn the conference over to mr. jean jereissati, ceo for ambev, for his final remarks.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so i would like to thank again my team, ambev, for their dedication during these tough times. i also want to thank analysts and everyone who joined this call for time and attention. and to wrap up, i'm really confident about the future. i have this feeling that we -- our company is really structurally better in a tough cycle of commodities and currencies.
but when you look at the underlying trends, we are really structurally better. commercial strategy, innovations, tech platforms, and operational excellence is really delivering results. we seized the opportunities brought by the crisis. we placed big bets of accelerating toward the future in a sustainable recovery.
transformation is here in our business. so we have this vision of platform, customers, and consumers, two big digital products that we have, bees, and ze. and our portfolio is really stronger than before. brand equity, brand power is really showing that.
we have 3 million consumers in brazil that claimed -- that mentioned to us that one of -- in the past, one of our brands were not their preferred one. and now one of our brands are their preferred one. so i'm very excited about my portfolio. and cash generation is strong, remains strong.
so thank you very much for all your time and attention, and have a great day.

this quarter, we completed one year since the negative impact of the first wave of covid-19 pandemic. and i'm happy to see that the choices we made in the past 12 months continue to deliver results. we achieved the highest consolidated volumes in a second quarter on record, which led to an all-time high rolling 12 months volumes, 5 million hectoliters above the peak back in 2015. we have previously mentioned that we were better prepared to navigate challenges brought by the pandemic.
but at the same time, we also got ready for the economic reopening as vaccination rates increased. our commercial strategy, innovations, tech platforms, and operational excellence supported once again our performance as mobility restrictions were partially lifted in many of our markets. nine of our top 10 markets delivered volume growth versus last year, and seven of them grew volumes ahead of 2019. net revenue per hectoliter continued with solid growth driven by flexible and agile approach on pricing and premiumization efforts.
our above-core brands continue to gain relevance within our portfolio. our international operations continued the recovery path in the quarter, growing top-line ahead of 2019 and helping to offset transactional fx impacts on a consolidated level. in cac, top-line growth was led by dominican republic, followed closely by guatemala, which continues to show good momentum. panama is bouncing back from tighter restrictions.
in las, we grew volume ahead of 2019 levels. in argentina and chile, our global brands showed again a great volume performance, driving premium mix, which supported margin recovery versus last year in both countries. bolivia, on the other hand, remains impacted by the pandemic, where we continue focusing on preparing the company for the recovery. canada still suffered from mobility restrictions.
however, delivering growth in top line and ebitda. in july, we saw restrictions being partially lifted as vaccination rate reached more than 50% of the population. brazil beer continued to show great commercial momentum with double-digit volume growth versus 2019. this was also the fourth quarter in a row that we gained market share according to our estimates and that innovation continued to represent more than 20% of our revenues.
we grew volume in all segments with highlights to our premium portfolio that grew volumes by approximately 35%. bees comes with more than 70% of our active customer base, helping ambev to reach all-time high customers for both beer and nab as well as all-time high customer satisfaction measured by nps rating in june, while reaching brl 9 billion of gmv this quarter. ze delivery fulfilled more than 15 million orders, continuing to grow significantly versus last year. talking about brands.
we continued to invest in our portfolio, and i'm glad to see the growth of our brand power metrics. in the recognition of our marketing team at cannes lion awards in france, ambev received seven prizes: two gold, three silver, and two bronzes from campaigns in brazil and argentina. in the first half of the year, on a consolidated basis, ebitda grew 25% versus 2020 but was still 7% behind 2019, impacted by fx, commodities headwinds, and sg&a expenses. for the second half, our outlook remains unchanged.
we are on track with our v-shaped top-line recovery despite all challenges. we will continue to pursue volume performance at this new rolling 12-month levels reached in last quarters. cost pressures will continue, especially in brazil. and as for bottom line, normalized consolidated ebitda performance for the full year should improve as we work to get back to 2019 levels.
on a longer-term perspective, we are building an ambidextrous organization focusing on delivering the short term, while at the same time, transforming our business for the future. as we continue this journey, our business vision is to transform ambev into a platform with inspiring brands that connect people in the ecosystem, creating shared value. as part of our transformation, today, i would like to talk about our fintech, donus. we believe that our customers can increase their chances of success if they become more digitalized and have access to more insights, to more adequate financial resources, lower bank and financial transaction fees and even more convenience.
today, more than 80,000 customers registered on donus can enjoy solutions such as pos terminals, digital wallet, and credit lines. on the credit lines, we believe our long history with customers makes our credit scoring assessment very reliable. so far, default rates are within expectations, and we are now fundraising to expand this operation. in 2021, our focus is to roll out donus in all distribution centers in brazil as we did for bees starting last year.
to close, our top-line momentum is real and will be put to test in h2 given the excellent results we had last year. and i'm confident in our ability to keep taking our business to new levels. and i would like once again to thank the ambev team for their dedication during these tough times. thank you very much for your time and attention, and i will hand this over to you, lucas. 
lucas lira -- chief financial and investor relations officer
thank you, jean, and hi, everyone. as you will remember, q2 2020 was very tough because of the impact of covid-19. volumes collapsed in many markets and the mix shift was severe. however, despite these short-term headwinds, we didn't panic.
we did what we had to do to adapt quickly, getting even closer to our ecosystem. and most importantly, we did not lose sight of the long term and decided to seize the opportunities brought by the crisis and placed some big bets to set us up for a sustainable recovery. fast forward 12 months, our q2 2021 financial performance brings more evidence of the continuous and consistent improvement that i've been talking about so much. and the good news is that our team's disciplined execution behind these bets is continuing to pay off big time.
and here's why. net revenue grew a little over 36%. ebitda grew 24%. normalized profit grew nearly 116%, while operational cash flow remains unabated and grew about 2%.
in addition, our financial performance in the quarter was boosted by brl 1.6 billion in tax credits, of which brl 1.2 billion in other operating income and brl 0.4 billion in our financial results. just to recap, these tax credits resulted from a favorable brazilian supreme court decision last may that confirmed its 2017 ruling that the inclusion of the icms state tax in the taxable basis of the pis and the cofins federal taxes was unconstitutional. given the nature of this dispute, these tax credits are technically part of our normalized results from an accounting standpoint. but as was the case in our q4 2020 financials, we disregarded these tax credits for purposes of calculating our organic performance, treating them as a scope change.
we still have some pending litigation in this matter going forward, and we will keep the market updated as things progress. however, as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, the amounts that remain under dispute are not as material. while i'm on the subject of taxes, i also wanted to briefly comment on the proposed income tax reform in brazil, which has generated a lot of questions from investors lately. the draft legislation is currently being discussed in congress, and we are monitoring the proposed changes under public debate very closely.
it is too early to speculate what will unfold. so we cannot comment on what impact, if any, this part of the broader tax reform will have on us and/or our shareholders. should there be any material developments, we will, of course, keep everyone informed. now back to q2.
as expected, the quarter presented meaningful headwinds in terms of costs and expenses. cogs per hectoliter grew nearly 16% on a consolidated basis. these headwinds were mostly felt in brazil, where our cost of goods sold was negatively impacted by adverse fx and commodity costs. on the other hand, better-than-expected mix, thanks to our commercial initiatives and on-trade reopening witnessed toward the end of the quarter, drove our returnable glass bottle volumes up, which reached nearly 40% of our total volumes, which is up from 30% in q2 2020.
also, cash sg&a was higher, growing about 42% on a consolidated basis, where sales and marketing grew 35%, pretty much in line with our net revenue growth of 36% as we implemented our commercial plans for the quarter. distribution expenses grew 28%, also below our net revenue growth, mainly because of higher volumes, growing innovation, returnable glass bottle mix, and expansion of dtc platforms in countries like brazil. and administrative expenses doubled with most of the increase coming from provisions for variable compensation since our performance for the year continues to be better than expected. and remember, 2020 was a no bonus year.
should our performance remain on track during the second half of the year, variable compensation should continue to impact our year-over-year sg&a performance. having said all that, the most important message is that despite all these headwinds, we remain on track toward our main ambitions for the year. strong and balanced top line-led recovery across our markets with better net revenue per hectoliter performance versus 2020. we continue to expect brazil beer cash cogs per hectoliter to grow in the low 20s for the full year, with better-than-expected mix pretty much offsetting increasing nonhedged commodities exposure.
and normalized consolidated ebitda performance for the full year should improve as we work to get back to 2019 levels. let me now turn to our financial priorities of protecting liquidity and improving our return on invested capital. liquidity remains under control. thanks to the strong cash generation during our recovery, we decided to pay down in q2 the remainder of the debt we raised at the height of the covid-19 crisis to create an additional liquidity cushion.
having said that, going forward, we still believe it is warranted to maintain a prudent approach toward liquidity given the uncertainty and volatility that persists across our markets. as for the journey of improving our return on invested capital, we remain laser-focused on operating as efficiently as possible, but we are also more and more focused on improving our resource allocation across the company. think of it this way. we have great people, we have great assets, and we have very strong cash generation.
so the better we get at resource allocation, the greater the chance of consistently creating value. this value creation mindset is becoming a big focus of ours. and a good example of this approach is how we are looking at our technology platforms. platform business models like bees, ze, and donus in brazil not only make total business sense from a customer and consumer standpoint, but they also make sense from a return on investment perspective.
of course, we are still scaling them up, but we believe that once at scale, these platforms can drive important value creation for the company. and the reason why i say this is twofold. first, connecting these tech platforms to ambev's base of customers, consumers and brands will broaden our total addressable market with potential for further growing both top line and bottom line in absolute terms. and second, over the last decades, we developed this amazing asset base in terms of distribution, capabilities, and reach as well as trusted relationships with millions of points of sale across latin america that provide our technological platforms with a very solid foundation to build on and scale in terms of speed, autonomy, and leverage.
the more we are able to use the core business as a springboard, the less capital we will require to grow these businesses. in terms of use of cash, after taking into consideration the appropriate liquidity levels for a more unpredictable and changing environment, after allocating resources efficiently toward organic growth, and after keeping some m&a dry powder, we intend to continue returning excess cash to shareholders over time. to wrap up, a quick word on esg. on june 28, we held our esg day when we shared our thinking in terms of how we are approaching sustainability, which, after all, is our business.
thanks to everyone who joined. and for those of you who are unable to make it, the materials can be found on our ir website. and we look forward to continuing this dialogue with the investment community because there's still a lot much more to share, to learn, and to do. thank you.
and with that, let's move to q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from robert ottenstein, evercore.
robert ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thank you very much. there's -- from what i can tell, there's really been kind of an -- there's a lot of background noise there, an unprecedented kind of change in some of the competitive dynamics in brazil, particularly in terms of categories, with your leading competitor apparently abandoning a lot of their core value brands and just kind of totally restructuring their overall portfolio. can you talk about what is going on in the brazilian beer business in terms of pricing architecture, what the opportunities are as you look at that? you're, obviously, bringing in spaten as kind of a core plus proposition, but what does it mean when you have such a dramatic change in the competitive landscape; and you have a whole portion of the business, economy or value beers, being walked away from by a major competitor? thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
thank you very much for the question, robert. the brazilian market has always been very competitive in general, and it will continue to be for a while, but i mentioned at some point in time that -- just when i arrived, that i would foresee the competitive landscape more with the trends on our side. since that, we have been working a lot on our plan, learning consumer trends, understanding the competitive landscape. and we are very excited about what we have been accomplishing.
the numbers of volumes that we had this quarter, they show that. if you look at the numbers, it is not just about competition. we are really expanding our reach, expanding the number of consumers [inaudible] transaction in our brands, so we are really very excited about our plan. innovation already represents more than 20% of our net revenue, so we are taking the right products in the right places.
so we have been talking a lot about the brahma duplo malte that really came to be the leader of the core plus segment that was a segment that was very underdeveloped in brazil and has a big potential. so we have been growing new brands consistently [inaudible] year to date, our high end is growing 20%. consumers are more and more electing one of our brands as the no. 1 brand they love.
so we have 3 million more consumers that we had in 2019's; all this transformation, technology, the reach, the convenience that bees and ze delivery are bringing for consumers and customers. so really, about -- the performance is really about our plan. 100% of the volumes expanded in the industry came from our brands. and on top of that, we are seeing competitors really moving in some direction that it's hard to really figure out exactly what's going on.
so when we look at production numbers of [inaudible] of the industry and of competitors, in the end, competitors, they are producing less than 2019 levels, so this is something that we are much ahead of that. and i'm not sure if that's really -- a decision is really something that we are selling, and we are getting it right. we are getting the consumers. and it looks like somehow consumers are more -- and customers more toward our brand.
so we are going to keep looking an eye on competitors. i think, it's a big opportunity for us, anything that happen on the competitive side, but we are really excited about how we are bonding with our consumers, how we are all-time-high relation with our customers in net promoter score and how we have been able really to drive industry expansion.

our next question comes from marcella recchia, credit suisse.
marcella recchia -- credit suisse -- analyst
jean, lucas, congrats on the results, and thank you for taking the questions. i have two questions on brazil beer. first is about loading. i would like to understand better if, after announcing the second price increase in mid-september, you saw any signs of mismatch between sell-in and sell-out late in the quarter that could have given an extra boost to the 3q volume performance.
that would be my first question. and secondly, it's about packaging supply. we have seen constraints for both glass bottles and aluminum cans globally. and ahead of the fourth quarter, which is a seasonal peaking period for the industry, yes, i would like to see if you are seeing already any signs of constraints at the packaging industry in brazil or even if it could become a risk going forward.
thank you very much.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
thank you for the question, marcella. so we brought that graphic that were -- of the rolling 12-month performance of our volumes in brazil and ambev because i think that graphic is really -- on a yearly rolling 12-month basis, it really mitigates any type of inventory change in levels, so i think that it was a good graphic for us to talk about. i am very excited about the q3 volumes because they happened amid a sequential improvement on our net revenue per hectoliter. so when we compare net revenue per hectoliter of q3 compared with q2: there were a lot of efforts in the q3 to really keep that up with an inflationary scenario that we are living in brazil that picked very fast, faster than we expected.
and then, we -- it was announced, the price increase, in october. i really don't -- i really feel that, the sell-in and sell-out, they are pretty much in-line in the inventories in the market. they are really -- we didn't see any movement on that. we have been controlling that in a very sharp way because we know that summer is coming.
and heading to your second question, what we are seeing in the supply chain is that supply chain have been under pressure since the pandemic. we were able to keep it up with gains in resolving the availability of canes -- of cans, where we see a more normalized supply chain. when we come to glass, industry is more pressured. we expected to see some normalization more in 2022 on the glass side, but somehow this type of disruptions are in a much lesser extent that we had in 2020.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations
and then just to add there, jean. this is lucas, marcella. i think, when it comes to glass bottles, one thing to keep in mind is that we have vertical, right, bottle production capacity in countries like brazil. so that also gives us, right, a very reliable source and -- of supply for bottles and more flexibility to adapt to pressure in the supply chain overall, in addition to our long-term relationships with suppliers.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
and we are leveraging our global footprint, too, on that.
marcella recchia -- credit suisse -- analyst

our next question comes from ricardo alves, morgan stanley.
ricardo alves -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for the call, jean. thanks, lucas. impressive numbers indeed.
i had a couple of questions, one follow-up on the competition side. you alluded to this, jean, but on the main competitor. i think that the first question was one of the main competitor, but when you look at your numbers and we look at the industry numbers that we can track, i mean, your performance is significantly above even -- you're significantly outperforming other smaller players as well. could you just shed a light on how you're performing relative to them? are there any perhaps specific categories where you're outperforming or specific regions where you think you're performing better than your smaller competitors? we've seen from the coke system, for example, different regions performing very differently, so i don't know if that could be part of the story.
that's my first question.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so let me try to elaborate more on that. so if you put our numbers together, you're going to see that we are gaining a lot of market share. it's not just a little.
it's a lot of market share, and this is based on our plan. i think, the core plus segment, it was a bet that we did two years ago that is really paying off. the innovation -- there is a lot of innovation there. brahma duplo malte has come -- spaten has come in very well, too.
so we had this strategy of helping the on trade to transform itself during the pandemic; and have takeaway initiatives with the small format, very affordable, of 300 ml bottles. this is performing very well, too. these brought to us -- from pre-pandemic levels, we had 750,000 customers. now we are reaching 1 billion -- 1 million customers in q4.
so our plan is really structural. i think, it's really working. and when we look at competitors, both of them, the two, producing less than they have produced already below 2019 levels, it doesn't seem to me that it's a supply restriction. it really is not because you have a plant that you can sell.
so consumers has to buy. the customers should be in your hands. so i really feel that our commercial strategy is really acquiring more customers and like seducing more consumers. we have 3 million more consumers, so i feel that our strategy is going -- is doing ok.
so we did the right investments on capacity in the last two years to be prepared for this type of volumes. and i just feel that, competitors, they have not been able to really get the transaction right and really to sell. and even this announcement that we are -- listen all the time about competitors increasing capacity, i question myself if it's -- if this is more of an upgrade on capabilities that's really a potential to put more volume in the market. so i think, this is a big question for us.
so having said that: we are selling very well on north, northeast, middle east, middle west. most of the areas are doing very well. it's amazing how we have been growing all the segments. so we are growing core that -- it was a handicap that we had in the past.
the core was really going down. we are seeing our three brands brahma, skol and antarctica growing. we kind of created the core plus segment where we are really having bohemia, brahma duplo malte, now spaten. and our high-end portfolio is really year to date, growing on the 20s, so i'm seeing a very balanced growth when -- in segments.
i'm seeing a very balanced growth in regions that shows that looks like our commercial strategy is really paying off. besides the challenge that we have on the macro side; besides the competitor, the competitive landscape, i really -- i'm really happy with our commercial strategy.
ricardo alves -- morgan stanley -- analyst
super helpful, jean, thanks for that. one final question, a very quick one on the revenue per hectoliter, also in brazil beer: when you're thinking about the fourth quarter, just wondering what your latest thoughts are because of the price increase. i don't know if there are any major mix of category or mix of channels that we should have in mind when we're thinking about the unit revenue. but even more interested on the price increases, how they've been accepted, so far, so if you're able to share any color on how october is performing on that front, that would be helpful.
thanks again.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so in the end, we don't disclosure that much and do forecasts on the peak. it was public that we did it in the beginning of october. so what we are seeing is that -- so it's in the market.
so the numbers are in the market, and it's pretty much around the same shape that we have been doing for a while. what i can tell you that is really -- is exciting me, it is that the on-premise recovery has been stronger than we anticipated. we are seeing -- because, at some point in time, we help the bars to transform. and then they became platforms to takeaway and deliveries.
ze delivery helped them a lot, but now we are seeing the social out-of-home occasion getting traction again. so there is pretty much when you get with your friends and go to the bars and really drink in the bar. so we are seeing this occasion really picking up faster than we expected. and looks like this will help us on this occasion.
this is occasion that is very profitable for us, that we have been always designed for it. and it's really coming back strongly. and we foresee it. for example, the rgb bottles and the rgb mix, really they are growing sequentially more than we expect.
and we foresee in 2022 they're above 2019 levels.
ricardo alves -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, jean.

our next question comes from thiago duarte, btg pactual.
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, everybody. i have two questions. i will stick with the brazil beer discussion here.
the first one is a question on how should we think of ambev's brands' fair market share in brazil beer right now, particularly in terms of the price point relative to the actual market share that you have achieved. it looks like you're capturing a lot of market share, as jean said just now. pricing is evolving, but it continues to lag the overall beer inflation and despite the premiumization of the mix and margins and not even relative to basis points. but even in unitary terms, margins are not much higher in nominal terms than they were several years ago.
so jean, you mentioned in the opening remarks the -- a healthier portfolio, better service level. you mentioned you're reaching 3 million more people, consumers, relative to 2019, so i wonder what -- how that should translate into your -- into the discussion between your actual market share, your fair market share and the price point that you see for your most relevant brands today. i mean, if we look historically, this is a point in time where you guys would probably be capturing a lot more pricing power than we have seen, so far. so that's the broad discussion i was looking to have.
and the second question is on the industry. i mean, even putting the market share discussion aside, i think, abi, in their conference call they mentioned being gaining share of throat in many markets, including brazil, but it still for us is striking to see the -- how the aggregate beer industry volumes are growing and in spite of the very tough comps from last year. so if you could comment on how the category growth is sustainable, in your view, relative to other alcoholic beverages. and of course, in terms of per capita consumption relative to where we were before and into the future would be nice to hear as well.
thank you so much.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok, let me see if i can get this right, duarte. so yes -- so duarte, it's true. we are with a market share gaining -- when we put all the numbers together, better than we expected, better than we anticipated. so this q3, when we compare with what competitors are doing, there is a lot of market share gains over there based on our strategy.
we have been building the high end in the core plus segment. if you remember, at the beginning of the year, we gave a guidance of our vic in beer brazil growing in the low 20s. so we knew that this was coming. it -- so a big part of it, it was because that -- our hedging policies and the impact of the currencies that we had in the hedges this year.
and we are -- really put in our pricing strategy based on the consumer side what consumers can really pay and, yes, to -- maintained our volumes health; and then based on that, on top of that, really work on the mix of innovation, the mix on channels, and overdelivered based on that mix. i think, we have been able to -- we kept our guidance in our vic numbers. so we are really working on that even though lots of things happening on the commodity side, but this year, we are really maintaining our guidance. and then we have the consumer ability to pay that -- what happened in brazil with -- was that the inflation picked up very fast.
and that is the reference to -- on our pricing decisions, to really guarantee that the beer in the basket is competitive for us to continue to develop share of throat and continue to develop per capita. and with that type of volumes that we are having and with the inflation picking up, this equation, we are going to follow to really guarantee that our revenue per hectoliter is above and -- what we need. and we believe that, next year, this equation will be more on our side, ok? so somehow, we follow the inflation with rates. on top of that, we have the innovation and premiumization strategy.
on top of that, we have the revenue management. and we believe that we are really getting these muscles right and pricing will get better, yes. one thing that i would like to mention on the transformation side is that we are learning a lot on the revenue management side with our fintech and with bees. and we are beginning to pilot the trade-off of discounts and cashbacks.
how our customers and how consumers really react to that is a whole new world of possibilities for us. and this is something that i'm very excited is a project that -- it will help us a lot on this revenue management of the future, ok? so having said that, talking about the industry, so yes, we have been very excited about the way we have been developing the industry in brazil. all the industry expansion is really coming from our initiatives. when we looked brazil on a granular base, we still have a lot of opportunities from per capita when we compare regions.
sao paulo and middle west, they still have a very different level of per capita consumption. when we looked at frequency, that it was something that peaked during the pandemic, and we looked at u.s. and mature markets, we still have a lot of opportunity, yes, on the consumer side to increase frequency, so we believe that a big part of it will stay. so we are still very excited about the per capita consumption in the -- and the industry expansion moving in the future.
and on top of that, we just put in place, and this is more of a share-of-throat view, our business unit of beyond beer and future beverage that i think is a huge opportunity for us here in brazil to learn what's going on in canada. in u.s., we are really working on the mike's brand. we are bringing rtds. we are bringing wine in cans.
and i'm really excited about this another avenue of growth that we really -- that is accretive. its net revenue per hectoliter is higher. and there is a lot of opportunity on share of throat to continue to grow on that side.

our next question comes from isabella simonato, bank of america.
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, everyone, jean, lucas. i have two questions. first of all, thinking about 2022, right, i understand that you guys will release the guidance on costs in the beginning of the year, but if you could give us a color on where you're seeing cost pressures and especially your fx hedges given the recent depreciation of the brl, that would be helpful to understand how to think about next year.
and second of all, lucas, you mentioned in the presentation, right, about protecting liquidity and the balance sheet. and in the same time, we have a potential tax reform in brazil. how are you guys thinking about returning cash to shareholders, not only in terms of timing but if we could expect an increase in this year versus 2020? thank you.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations
isabella, thank you for the question. starting with 2022 cost outlook, i think the first important message here is that the scenario, right, for input costs remains, all right, fairly volatile, as i'm sure you've all been following, particularly in brazil and argentina. and there's still some hedging to do before the end of the year, right? we continue to work under our hedging policy to give us the predictability, right, going forward. and it will give us time to prepare, adapt as need be from time to time, but what we can say at this point is that, although, 2021, the main headwind was fx, followed by commodities, in 2022 what we're seeing as of today is that fx should be less of an issue, ok, because of the hedge and happening kind of on a rolling basis and how the brl especially kind of evolved throughout the year as hedging was underway.
so we see less pressure, going into 2022, from fx and more pressure coming from commodities. and again as i said, there's still some hedging to be done, ok? and last but not least, one of the things that has helped us in 2021 and we hope that could also play a role favorably going into 2022 is the mix, all right? as i mentioned in my opening remarks, one of the things that has contributed to our better-than-expected performance is the mix starting to work in our favor. and in case of the cogs impact of the mix evolving better than expected, it -- the mix has helped us offset our unhedged commodity exposure. that picked up, right, in q2; picked up again in q3, so i think the mix -- to the extent that the team continues to do a good job on the commercial side as the on-premise recovers, as returnable glass bottles, all right, continue to come back in a healthy way, hopefully, mix will also once again play in our favor.
and then as you said, we hope to be in a position to provide more visibility with respect to what to expect in 2022 at the end of february when we announce the full year results. as for the second question, in terms of returning excess cash to shareholders over time. this is a year-end decision. so we continue to work, as i mentioned in my remarks, under the same paradigm in terms of how we think about capital allocation in the company.
so priority no. 1, all right, remains to reinvest in growth, be it organically, be it nonorganically. so that hasn't changed. and then in addition, we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders over time, but that's a -- that's more of a year-end conversation that we will have with the ambev board.
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's clear. thank you.

our next question comes from thiago bortoluci, goldman sachs.
thiago bortoluci -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone, and congrats for the results. just trying to add up your revenue per hectoliter growth in brazil in a bit more details. you guys mentioned earlier in the call the positive impacts of the on-trade mix into your average prices, right. however, when i see net revenue per hectoliter in brazil beer, it is still up but sequentially decelerating.
can you please break up in more details what were the drivers for the sequential deceleration there? and in terms of overall trends, i know we don't have a guidance for the quarter, but what should we expect for the fourth quarter, bearing in mind that cash cogs per hectoliter should sequentially accelerate? thank you very much.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
yeah, so in the end -- when we started the year, we have always been mentioning that our revenue management strategy will be very agile, nimble for us really to get the best opportunities in the market, to learn with regions. and we have everything. and to be very honest, this june -- yes. so this decision -- or so the inflation picked up very fast, and we were trying to catch up as we move.
so that was something that -- it was not planned in the beginning of the year. and somehow, we were very happy to -- in this context to see the q3 net revenue per hectoliter really like peaking. so it was better than q2. and when we look that -- if it's accelerating or not, you have the last-year basis where we have to compare.
what i can tell you, it is that, this elasticity that we saw in q3, when we compared with h1 and q2, of the price moving with this type of volumes, it really surprised us. and this equation was an equation that come above our expectations, which suggests that our brands are stronger. we had more volumes to the net revenue per hectoliter increase, so we are very happy with this type -- or with that algorithm and with that type of equation. so having said that -- so what was really planned in the beginning of the year for us is to do right, to do accordingly.
it was really the october move that we announced. it was public, yes. we made it happen. it's in the market.
and i think, this is -- it's more substantial.
thiago bortoluci -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's clear. if i may, just a follow-up on the delivery. you reported volumes essentially flattish quarter on quarter, right? any early signs of some change in mix or cannibalization with the reopening thus far?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so let me get your question to talk about the technology platforms. i will talk about zé and then i will jump into bees and donus. so ze delivery is on the right path.
it's really -- yes, we are very excited about it. so we have -- so we stopped a little bit the city expansion for us really to get all the -- all our strategy right. so we spanned less cities than we expected. we did not see that much change on the project, on the plan that we have with ze delivery, but ze delivery is really thinking more and more to be more omnichannel to really think about not just the convenience piece but all the journey of our consumers.
we are starting back the expansion on the cities. and we are working a lot on the last-mile efficiencies. so these are the three things, major things, that we are doing on ze delivery. and ze delivery, it will -- it's really a success and it will continue to grow a lot, but we have these three fronts that we are working, omnichannel, expansion city by city and then last-mile efficiency.
that is something that -- to have the business sustainable in the long term. and one information that -- just for you to know: so we were able to get ze delivery already that is pretty much focusing, focused on the in-home occasion with the same rgb mix that we have in the average of the company. and that's really something that it happened ahead of time. so 40% of the mix of ze delivery is already coming from returnable bottles -- because, the motorbike, it takes the bottles and get it back.
so this machine is really working, so we are really excited about that. so ze delivery is in place, will grow. it's really going to the next level in terms of having more occasions; be more omnichannel; restart the expansion; and really get it, with the last-mile efficience, right. so one thing that i would like to mention is that really we talked a lot in many times about bees.
i mentioned that 85% of our active buyers are already in the platform, that we achieved a 1.1 billion annualized marketplace gmv in ambev of bees. so just mentioning the products that are not from ambev's portfolio. so this is something that is doing very well. and yesterday, we announced the partnership with brf, and i would just like to mention because this partnership is different from what we are doing.
we have been doing this pretty much the one pl. so we buy. we sell. it goes through our warehouses, but this deal with brf was the first one that it was really a contract of a software-as-a-service, ok? so bees in the end is really providing a software service to brf.
and then brf will have bees on their sales reps, on their palmtops. and their customers will use the platform of order taking. and brf has around 250,000 customers that they go direct, and they will have access to a 1 million base of customers and with bees really providing a service-as-a-software, ok? so this is really something that is different from what we are doing. and i'm very excited about it, to have brf with us.
and the third one is really donus, the fintech, that is really growing very fast, is -- so we are now with brl 1 billion of tpv year to date. so just in q3, we have brl 650 million in tpv. it's really tripling sequentially. we have 145,000 customers that downloaded the wallets.
and we are really working on the machines, the take rates. we are really doing credits for our customers and really moving into the revenue management and the trade-offs of discounts and cashbacks. so these three initiatives, i'm very excited. they are really getting sizable.
they are really beginning to bring a lot of value for our company.
thiago bortoluci -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's amazing, jean. thank you very much.

this concludes today's q&a session. i would like to turn the floor over to mr. jereissati for his closing remarks.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so i would like to thank my team again, once again for this quarter. i would -- also want to thank all the analysts and everyone who joined the call, for time and attention. and to wrap up, in the full year, despite the anticipated tough comps in q4, we'll continue to work to maintain our commercial momentum, delivering a healthy top-line recovery. also we will not lose sight of the long term and return on the investments that we are doing now.
and we will continue to invest in our portfolio and the transformation through the tech ventures, which continue to grow and become more sizable. cash generation remains solid even in a year that we invested on the ventures. we invested on capacity. we invested on tech as part of our transformation journey.
and i'm very excited about the relationship and the bonding that we are having with our consumers. not just here in brazil that we talked a lot, but i'm seeing brand equity and i'm seeing consumers really toward our portfolio in all the countries that we operate. so thank you very much. see you next year.
and have a great day.

good morning, and thank you for waiting. we would like to welcome everyone to ambev's third quarter 2021 results conference call. today with us, we have mr. jean jereissati, ceo for ambev; and mr.
lucas lira, cfo and investor relations officer. as a reminder, a slide presentation is available for downloading on our website, ri.ambev.com.br, as well as through the webcast link of this call. we would like to inform you that this event is being recorded. [operator instructions] before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the safe harbor of the securities litigation reform act of 1996.
forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of ambev's management and on information currently available to the company. they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions because they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstance that may or may not occur in the future. investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of ambev and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. i would also like to remind everyone that, as usual, the percentage changes that we'll be discussing during today's call are both organic and normalized in nature; and unless otherwise stated, percentage changes refer to comparatives with third quarter 2021 results.
normalized figures refers to performance measures before exceptional items which are either income or expenses that do not occur regularly as part of ambev's normal activities. as normalized figures are non-gaap measures, the company disclosed the consolidated profits, eps, ebit and ebitda on a fully reported basis in the earnings release. now i will turn the conference over to mr. jean jereissati, ceo for ambev.
mr. jereissati, you may begin your conference.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
hello, everyone. thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. this is our last call of the year, so i would like to do things a little bit differently today. i will cover the highlights of the quarter in a moment, but i would like to begin talking about people.
i have been very vocal about how ambev is on a transformation journey. transforming a company like ours, it's hard. it takes time. it's painful.
there is a lot of skepticism and setbacks. in many respects, we are learning as we go, but we are doing this together as a team. a couple of weeks ago, something happened that personally meant a lot to me. ambev was recognized by great place to work as the fifth best large company in brazil to work for.
just to give you an idea of how transformational this is: in 2020, we ranked 27. a lot of great people built this company, and we are a company of owners. our people has been and will always be the heart and the soul of ambev, so i'm very proud to see that my team has been humble enough to face the brutal facts of the last few years and learned from our mistakes; has shown enormous resilience in the face of covid; made bold bets and delivered results consistently as we recover from the pandemic and, at the same time, has helped the society; has stayed committed to building a better, more collaborative, diverse, innovative and more sustainable company for the long term, and is happier and more engaged along the way. and this is true not only in brazil but also across the other markets where we operate, so a big thank you to everyone that have been making this transformation happen on a daily basis.
the third quarter was another step on this transformation journey, and frankly, it was another solid step in the right direction. i ended the last call saying that our top-line momentum would be put to test in the second semester. and in q3, we delivered 20% net revenue growth, with volumes up nearly 8% year over year. nine of our 10 markets delivered volume growth versus last year, and eight of them grew volumes ahead of '19.
and as a result, we delivered 180 million hectoliters on a rolling 12-month basis, 8 million hectoliters above our peak back in 2015. in this quarter, we delivered another solid net revenue per hectoliter performance, which grew 12% versus q3 2020. comparing with '19, net revenue was up 43% on a consolidated level in the quarter and year to date up 31%, versus '19. if we break down this performance by region: our international operations generally continued to bounce back nicely.
in cac, volumes grew nearly 9% year over year and are just slightly below 2019 levels. as mobility restrictions continue to ease, thanks to vaccination, our volumes continue to recover, led by the dominican republic and panama, with the core plus and high-end portfolios continuing to gain weight in our mix. in las, volumes grew double digits versus 2020 and '19. argentina, chile and paraguay drove this growth, also thanks to our core plus and high-end portfolios.
bolivia posted strong recovery from 2020 but remains below 2019 levels, and there we still have a lot of work to do. canada, however, had a tougher quarter in terms of top line. although it's still above pre-pandemic levels, net revenue in the quarter declined roughly 2.5% versus q3 2020, with volumes down almost 7%, while net revenue per hectoliter grew 4.5%. the industry was still impacted by mobility restrictions; and we faced some supply chain disruptions, mostly in quebec.
turning to brazil, starting with nab. net revenue increased 22% in the quarter versus 2020 and nearly 26% against '19. volumes were up nearly 10%, compared to q3 2020 and almost 15% versus '19. this performance was mainly driven by gatorade, h2oh! and guaraná antarctica, all of which grew above 2019.
and last but not least, brazil beer top line grew 16% in the quarter versus 2020 and 51% versus 2019. our step change in volumes continued in the quarter with 7.5% growth versus 2020 and almost 35% growth versus 2019, outperforming the industry and gaining market share. this is a result of a commercial strategy that has consistently continued to work despite covid, despite macro headwinds and despite competition. it is not just one thing that's working.
it's a combination of a healthier portfolio, at first, with stronger legacy brands plus a strong innovation pipeline which once again represented over 20% of our net revenues. in addition, we increased the number of fans of our brands by 3 million people since 2019. second, a better service level, reaching 53% net promoter score in the quarter; third, our technology big bets, which have continued to structurally improve how we connect with consumers and solve our customers' pain points. for instance, bees is now used by 85% of our active customers in brazil, currently offering over 350 products from 40 third parties of different industries.
in addition to that, yesterday, it was announced that brf products will be made available through bees, which is consistent with our desire to offer better service and solutions to our customers. and finally, great execution of our pack and channel strategy, with the 300 ml returnable glass bottles leading the way as the on premise continues to reopen. all in all, year-to-date top line is up 28%, with volumes growing 12% and net revenue per hectoliter increasing 14% versus 2020. when comparing with '19, we are up 31% in top line, 11% in volumes and 17% in net revenue per hectoliter.
during our last three calls, i took the opportunity to focus on how each of our technological platforms in brazil are enabling our transformation as a company: ze delivery in q4 of last year; bees in q1 2021; and donus, our fintech, last quarter. today, i would like to spend some time on what i like to call the logistics revolution that is underway to allow these platforms to fulfill their potential. as ambev transforms itself into a platform with inspiring brands that connects people and the ecosystem, creating shared value, a best-in-class logistics operation is a must. in the '90s, we created our second-tier logistics operations, betting big on direct distribution, with currently more than 100 distribution centers spread across brazil and making 80,000 deliveries per day.
in the last two years, we have started to set up a third-tier logistics operation. approximately $100 million have been invested to-date on several footprint and technology-related initiatives to better prepare us for these new operating models. for instance, in terms of creating a delivery footprint designed for growth, we are investing behind small urban distribution centers near high-density regions, making our delivery capabilities more flexible and agile. these urban distribution centers or udcs, how we call, operate only with small models like bikes, lightweight motorcycles and small vans, which are faster and cheaper for small drop-size orders.
the idea is to provide a better service level for small box using the right model with more efficient occupancy rates and lower carbon emissions, leaving bigger deliveries for bigger trucks. the udcs integrate b2b, dtc and the marketplace platforms. and we are also piloting offering services to partners, gaining even more efficiency. we currently have five udcs in operations, three of them in sao paulo.
we will end up the year with 14, and we are just starting. to wrap things up, some quick words regarding our journey, the remainder of the year and 2022. 2020 was a very tough year, but we stood our ground. 2021 has also been challenging, but we have continued to improve our performance in a consistent way, led by our v-shaped top-line recovery, so i'm looking forward to what 2022 will bring with its risks and opportunities.
lucas will go into more detail, but although q4 will be another tough comp, we will continue to work to bring our nominal consolidated normalized ebitda for the full year back to 2019 levels. and based on our year-to-date performance, we believe there is room for improving this number, close a better 2021 and be better positioned for the next year. with that said, let me hand it over to lucas, who will cover our financial performance. thank you, everybody. 
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations
thanks, jean. good morning and good afternoon, everyone. i would also like to start by talking about transformation, so i will kick off with climate action, where we also took a transformational step in the right direction during the third quarter. q3 was marked by the announcement of our first carbon-neutral brewery and malt plants in brazil.
our ponta grossa brewery in the state of paraná and our malt plant in passo fundo in the state of rio grande do sul delivered 90% reduction of co2 emissions versus 2017 and had the remaining 10% emissions neutralized via carbon credits. this process began in 2012 when we built these plants designed to be low-carbon operations, and we're proud to see it come to life. to get here, we focused on four things: heat produced on site from biomass boilers; green energy produced on site from biogas of the effluent treatment system; energy consumption efficiency leading to more than 15% total purchased energy reduction; and 100% electricity purchased from renewable resources, in this case hydro. as next steps, we will implement electrical forklifts, starting in q4 2021; and build on-site solar farms, starting next year.
and these investments make total financial sense as well. our decisions to move toward carbon neutrality has not only led to efficiency savings in terms of energy consumption but also allowed us to secure renewable energy sources at more attractive rates than before. also this milestone is not an isolated event. we're developing a road map to have 100% of our production facilities become at least carbon neutral in the future, which we expect to be able to share in the coming months.
turning to our financial performance in the quarter. overall, we saw a similar dynamic to the first half. ebitda growth, driven by top-line recovery, partially offset by cost and expense headwinds. the difference this time is that, in q3, we faced much tougher top-line comps than during the first half of the year, but the team's disciplined execution came through once again.
in the quarter, net revenue grew nearly 21% organically, lapping 15% organic growth in q3 2020. ebitda grew approximately 9% organically against 1.4% organic growth in q3 2020. normalized profit grew about 50%, following 2.2% growth in q3 2020, while operational cash flow declined almost 10%, lapping 99% growth in q3 2020. versus q3 2019, net revenue grew 43%.
ebitda was up almost 16% in organic terms, while normalized profit increased 54% and operational cash flow improved 80%. margin pressure, unfortunately, remains a reality, with gross margin contracting to 50% and ebitda margin contracting to slightly below 30% in the quarter. however, we did see sequential ebitda margin improvement versus q2 2021, which stood at 26% at the consolidated level if you disregard the one-off tax credits in brazil. we still have a long way to go, but we see this as a relevant improvement nonetheless.
now let me go through the main cost and expense drivers. cogs per hectoliter increased 18.5% on a consolidated basis in the quarter. we once again saw adverse fx and commodity costs as the main factors, particularly in brazil, while better mix offset higher unhedged commodity costs. brazil beer cash cogs per hectoliter in q3 totaled almost 16%, which should be the lowest growth for the year.
fx and commodity pressures should still be an issue in q4, but we continue to expect brazil beer cash cogs per hectoliter to grow in the low 20s for the full year. as for cash sg&a, year-over-year growth totaled 23.6% on a consolidated basis. sales and marketing and distribution expenses grew mid-teens, so below net revenue growth. the main drivers here were the same ones from q2, albeit at lower levels of growth year over year.
and administrative expenses were nearly 81% higher year over year, which was primarily a result of provisions for variable comp since our performance for the year was once again better than expected. and should our performance remain on track during q4, variable comp accruals should continue to impact our year-over-year performance. in addition, it's worth sharing that, when we break down our administrative expenses ex variable comp accruals in regions like brazil, for instance, what we saw in the quarter, and this is also true since 2019, is that overhead packages are growing below inflation, with the exception of two packages: first, our investments behind b2b, d2c and fintech platforms; and second, technology spends to enable our transformation. despite the near-term impact, we have no doubt whatsoever that these investments make sense given our overall strategy.
and we've managed to find nonworking dollar savings in other lines to fund this transformation to a great extent. and as these platforms scale up and we find smart ways to leverage ambev's scale and reach, we do see opportunity for more attractive returns in the future. looking ahead, given year-to-date performance and should the recovery continue in the final months of the year, we feel more confident in our ability to deliver on our two main ambitions for 2021 despite a tough comp in q4: first, a healthy balance between improved volume and improved net revenue per hectoliter growth as part of our top line-led recovery across markets. year-to-date volumes are up 12.3% and net revenue per hectoliter is growing 14.1%.
and second, normalized consolidated ebitda performance for the full year above 2019 levels in nominal terms, which we more and more see as feasible. year-to-date normalized consolidated ebitda stands at approximately brl 16 billion, which is 4.5% above 2019 in nominal terms excluding the one-off tax credits in brazil. finally, some quick comments on our financial priorities of protecting liquidity and improving our return on invested capital. liquidity remains solid given strong cash generation despite the several headwinds we've faced since last year, but the environment does remain uncertain and volatile, so we continue to believe a prudent approach remains warranted.
our use-of-cash priorities also remain unchanged, reinvest for growth organically and nonorganically and return excess cash to shareholders over time. and in terms of improving return on invested capital, the name of the game continues to be operating efficiency coupled with better resource allocation across the company. given the evolution of our business such as our bets behind b2b, d2c and fintech platforms, we believe that, when thinking about profitability, we need to look beyond margin ratios and also focus on return ratios. don't get me wrong: we will always focus on improving the drivers of margin ratios for each of our segments and ventures, but given their different financial profiles, we've been focusing more and more on return ratios to manage our business.
2020 was tough in terms of profitability in both dimensions, but the good news is that 2021 has the potential to deliver better returns than 2020, which is important progress despite sustained margin pressure. our journey of continuous and consistent improvement is well underway since 2020, step by step. this goes way beyond quarterly performance, and we will stay the course toward creating value over the long term. thank you, and we can now go to q&a.

thank you. we will now start the q&a session for analysts and investors. [operator instructions] our first question comes from marcella recchia, credit suisse.
marcella recchia
hi, jean. hi, lucas. thank you for taking my question. i have two questions here.
first one is if you could give us a little bit more of color on the main components behind the guidance for the ebitda growth acceleration to above around 11% levels in 2021. and the second question is if you have any assessment of elasticity impact on price increase on volumes. so far and going forward, right, we have seen that the industry is highly focused on pricing to manage cost headwinds, and i think that is also the case for you guys. so how you are seeing that impact in terms of elasticity? thank you very much. 
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
hi, marcella. thank you very much for the question. let me get the ebitda drivers growth first. overall, talking about, first, about net revenue per hectoliter.
i think most of the price is already done. so we entered in 2022 with a good carryover, and we are very confident on improving mix during the year, because i think that some trends are in our favor as the old trade reopening, as the 600 ml bottles are gaining traction. this would help us. innovation on the core plus and the premium is really working.
so that part, we are confident. we mentioned that our -- in brazil, our cash cogs would be in between 16 and 19. that is better than last year that it was in the low 20s. and sales and marketing should be below inflation with administrative really going a knock.
so i think there is -- so with this balance, we believe that we can accelerate ebitda. of course, the volumes in the industry are, i think, the most tricky part. we are starting with a very good market share in key countries. so this helps on one hand.
we had omicron impact in january, but somehow, on the other hand, looks like we're going to have two half carnivals, one now, one in april. we're going to have a world cup in the summer that we never had. there's always impacts. it's a big occasion for the brazilian market.
so that's where lends a little bit more of the doubt. but we are very confident that we are with a better portfolio, structurally better, brand active going up and great innovation working in the market. so this is the first one. the second, about elasticity.
so what we are seeing is really that when we think about segments, that the value segment is the one that suffered the most, ok? what we saw during the past -- the last year, it was. so our core plus is something that is a structural change that help and brings new news, new recipes for consumers. so this is -- so it's an important piece of the market that it's going beyond any historical of elasticity. premium is solid.
and our core with the returnability strategy rebounded to grow. so it's really been resilient. so i think talking about segments, what's really been more impacted overall is the value segment and the brands that does not have equity. so from our side, we have momentum on mainstream, on core plus and in high end.
so we are excited about our portfolio in general.
marcella recchia
perfect. thank you very much.

our next question comes from sergio matsumoto, citigroup.
sergio matsumoto -- citi -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning, jean, lucas. thank you for taking my question.
i want to ask about the revolution in logistics to urban distribution centers. you commented on this in the last couple of quarters. and we understand that you're building it out in sao paulo and other parts of brazil and also transitioning clients into bees for the ordering, and 85% already there. so two questions on this.
the first is, jean, where do you think you are in this whole process? because it's -- revolution is a big word, and i'm sure it's a long, involved process. so what do you think? do you think you just started it? or do you think you're halfway through? or like if you can give us some color there? and the second is, if you could frame the benefits in terms of top line growth benefits and any cost savings that you might expect by transitioning to this new process. and if that -- if those cost savings, if any, if we're going to see them? or would you be investing them back into the market? thanks. 
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you for the question, sergio. yes. so last call, we talked a lot about it.
it's an important piece of -- in our transformation journey. just for you to have in mind. so what we are talking that the major piece, it is that ambidextrous warehouses that they work for direct-to-consumer initiatives, and they work for b2b initiatives together. ok? so i think this is something that there is a game changer in terms of getting it right and really being efficient.
so we have the urban centers. and around -- we have already something around 40 new urban warehouses that can manage consumer and customer in the same platform. what is great about it is that our dtc initiatives, you have 80% of the volumes that goes -- that comes -- that orders comes on friday night, saturdays and sundays. and the b2b is something that is more planned and it's more weekdays.
so it's highly complementary, the initiative. that will help us a lot to build this capability, to reach consumers and build this capability to aggregate much more products that we have today that goes beyond our portfolio. that helps our innovation, but really accommodates some partnership that we are doing with other industries. ok? so this is really about capabilities at this moment.
so -- and it is something that we are just starting. so the part of the question where we are is just the beginning. and for now, so the dtc is really getting more positive. so everybody comments and asks about the dtc last mile, and this is really a piece that will make the last mile of dtc accretive to us at some point in time.
for now, we are really ramping up, and we are just starting.
sergio matsumoto -- citi -- analyst
and for the benefits, jean?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so the phase that we are today is really about expansion, ok? so this is really to get the dtc more efficient. we know that the delivery is not in the same level of margins that we have in the company. so it's like to mitigate this growth and to get the dtc at some point in time with the same margins that we have in the company. so it mitigates the growth of dtc for now.
it gets dtc accretive at some point in time.
sergio matsumoto -- citi -- analyst
yes. i guess what i meant to ask you on the b2b part. there is a change in the way the customers orders, and there's probably a sales uplift and some sort of cost savings, perhaps fewer salespeople needed, less frequency in visiting the clients, if you can frame those, that would be great.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so it's a little bit disconnected. so delivery and order taking, ok? so that's why i'm talking pretty much about the warehouses and the supply chain, talking about on a broader perspective. so what we are seeing is that clients, customers can be much more organized with this.
they can elect, they can plan themselves where to receive. so they are paying additional money to have more days in terms of frequency. we are much more efficient on discount optimization and management because of our data. so this piece is really -- this is really accretive on this discount management and organizing the logistics.
and it will be added. it's marginal to really -- with all this platform to really have the partners in the same truck light we are delivering here. ok? so somehow it's very good for the base business. the base business gets efficient.
but then when we aggregate the other products, when we aggregate the marketplace products, it's really something that we are talking more about growth of this piece of the equation that we are there. so we mentioned that assortment that has no known bet in bees reached 1.4 billion in gmv. so this piece is already -- is below the average ebitda margin of the company is growing. and this piece, it's profitable -- it's getting profitable with this logistic approach.
the base business, this business is really getting more efficient with all the street comments.
sergio matsumoto -- citi -- analyst
thank you. 
operator
our next question comes from alan alanis, santander.
alan alanis -- banco santander -- analyst
thank you and congratulations on the results. hi, look, i have a couple of questions, one around the balance sheet. and you're sitting on $3 billion of net cash. what's your -- what's the outlook in terms of dividend payout and potential share buybacks? that will be the first question.
the second question is more around the market and the super premium category. you mentioned corona moving up 44%, very, very strong. congratulations for that. heineken mentioned that they were reporting 10% increase in volumes.
could you explain a bit what's going on regarding the super premium category? why is it so strong again in brazil? and for the same token, why -- or what's the contribution in terms of margin expansion or margin contraction of this super premium category in brazil, please? thank you. 
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
i'll get the first one, i'll end in the second. i'll get the second one, first, and then i'll get to lucas. ok? yes. yes.
so the -- so we mentioned at some point in time that our long-term view for the high-end portfolio that we have in brazil, it was mainly to have brand equity ahead of volumes, ok? so ahead of market share, build brands, build the desire, connect with consumers. and we have been doing this for a while, and it was a very successful strategy that we have, best year, somehow four major brands of our high-end portfolio, really got power brand equity up. ok? so corona is doing very well. stella is doing very.
beck on the brand equity side is doing very well. and we are beginning to see demand to those brands. so we are seeing corona, it was a 44% up. we see beck's with 59% up, too.
stella is doing ok. original. our domestic brand was 35% up. and this is a major use of our strategy to improve margins moving forward.
these products, they are 1 50 on average price of the market, and they are accretive in terms of margins. but our main strategy is still to see to have brand equity ahead of market share. for example, corona has three times the brand power that it has in terms of market share. so there is a lot of spaces to that on consumer pull on that is an important piece of our equation.
we add to that the innovation, the core, plus there is another part that will bring the creativeness for us in our portfolio.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
ok. alan, thank you for the question. a few points here. in terms of use of cash, the framework, the mindset continues to be the same as the one we've had over the years.
meaning, number one, we want to reinvest in growth opportunities. and over the last few years, i think we've found very attractive organic growth opportunities, either in our base business or in these new business ventures that we've been investing behind leveraging technology. so plenty of opportunity to reinvest the strong cash flow generation to generate more growth, number one. number two, non-organic growth opportunities.
we're always looking at interesting opportunities, again, in the base business, in markets where there are still white spaces or in these new business models, new ventures opportunities to enhance our capabilities to drive the expansion of these ventures going forward, ok? that's priority number one, reinvest in future growth. and then we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders over time as we have been over the course of the last few years, right? just to give a bit more color on this. if you take 2019, 2020, and 2021, right, what we ended up doing was we had -- if you look at the fiscal year, right, total payout, we had roughly 7.7 billion of payout between dividends and ioc in 2019 and 2020, right? reminding that 2020, there was a very tough year, but we managed to keep the payout at the same level. and as the business performance and the financial performance bounced back in 2021, we managed to increase the payout, and we ended up making the largest payout, i believe, since 2016, it was the third largest total payout in history, growing 23% versus 2019, while profit grew roughly 8%.
so the way we continue to think about this is as the business improves and after we've reinvested for growth, we will continue to look to return excess cash to shareholders and improve the payout over time. the way to return excess cash to shareholders will remain very much focused around maximizing the ioc as we have in the past, supplemented by dividends. and from time to time, we will look at buyback programs, but that's a discussion that we have with the board from time to time. for now, the decision remains to prioritize ioc and dividends.
and this is a conversation more toward the end of the year for us.
alan alanis -- banco santander -- analyst

our next question comes from lucas ferreira, j. p. morgan.
lucas ferreira -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. before taking any question, some additional clarification on the guidance, if possible. just wanted to understand how much you think you could outperform the market this year. so in other words, how much you see the brazilian beer market growing in 2022? and i just to have a view about this growth, if you think it's going to be a bit more backloaded into the year.
since your volumes declined in the fourth quarter, if you can give us a sense of how the year is starting? so how should we think about reconciled at the beginning of the year with your full year guidance? and the second question around the same thing here, if you can give us a sense of how relevant both bees and for you guys to these results in '22. so you -- if not mistaken, i believe, this marketplace is already growing like probably 40% from the last number you gave us in the third quarter. so just wondering if you can explain to us a little bit how these -- and i believe it will contribute to this outperformance in 2022. thank you. 
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. let me get this one. lucas, thank you for the question. so thinking about -- i think that we talked about the lines.
i think that the trickiest one is really the volume, right, so that we mentioned. we are confident because we are starting with a good to carry over in net revenue per told we're starting with a good, a very good position in terms of market share, a solid with returnable performance really going up. so we are confident that we are structurally better to address the year and starting the year with a market share much above that we started the previous year, ok? so that's how we think that we are structurally better and starting the year. so having said that, we had the omicron impact after the -- in the beginning of the year.
last year, the carnival was already some weak in what we are seeing. so we have seen a recovery in february, but somehow looks like we want to have like half carnival is just a holiday and then we're going to have another one in april because rio de janeiro and sao paulo already mentioned that they will have some activities on. and then we have all the reopening, and then we have elections and world cup. so somehow, i think that's the most tricky part.
so it's really something that we have to be attentive, disciplined, agile and flexible to address the industry overall. i think that's the most i can mention to you. let's see, no crystal ball on that. there is plus and minus that we have to address.
we are starting in a good position. having said that, this is really about growth. so this really helps the base business overall. ok? so -- but when we talk about the other assortment, it's really about growth.
so we are building growth. the delivery, we are more sizable already now, and we begin to see efficiencies coming as we get the last mile more efficient overall. so we are more and more doing two deliveries in the same motorcycle. so we are more and more getting efficient on revenue management on that piece.
so we see that more sizable in really getting more efficient. and this is really the other piece is really about growth. ok? so i think that's the most i can mention. so that's pretty much it.
alan alanis -- banco santander -- analyst
yep, that's pretty much it. thank you.

our next question comes from angie breslin, btg.
unknown speaker
hello. hello, lucas. my question is on the cost outlook for 2022. the cost per hectoliter in brazil should grow the 16% to 19% you mentioned in brazil beer.
and that is now mostly coming from commodity pressures rather than the fx as it was in the past. so if you could just provide some additional color on how that could also apply to your other business units and also how the outlook for revenues growing by higher revenue per hectoliter rather than volumes may relate to that in terms of potential price hikes that you see during the year.thank you.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
yes. thank you for the question. our outlook for cash cogs per hectoliter, right, is -- in terms of the guidance is really, i mean, focused on brazil beer. we're not providing any guidance with respect to the other business units.
however, when we look at the commodity inflation, no business unit of ours is immune to it, ok? and as we have the hedging policy in place rolling 12 months forward, you can get a sense of the impact that commodity inflation can have across our other business units. ok? but just given the importance of the brazil beer business to the overall performance of the company, we wanted to provide this additional level of detail so the market can have a better sense of what to expect in the year, ok? and could you repeat the second part of your question on the net revenue per hectoliter, please?
unknown speaker
yes. sure. it was just if the goal of -- or at least the outlook of growing revenues mainly by higher realized prices, if that implies that you see, in the end, a better environment for price pass-throughs and now mainly overseas. you mentioned before that the -- some of the price hikes should come from better mix, and you have already a positive carryover.
but just thinking if we would also expect higher price hikes than if you see a positive environment for that overseas.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
ok. so outside brazil, i think one of the key drivers of our net revenue per hectoliter performance has been premiumization, ok, number one. so -- and that is true not only for core plus volumes in markets like argentina, in markets like -- many markets in the caribbean, the dominican republic, panama, and also canada, ok? and this is also true for our premium brands across these markets.,so i think both in 2020 and 2021, we really saw this momentum building around above core, core plus and premium volumes, increasing the mix, and that has helped us on the net revenue per hectoliter performance side. i think that's one of the major contributors over and above the core pricing.
and as jean mentioned earlier today on the call, we've pretty much started the year where we wanted to be in terms of pricing. and so we count on this carryover to give us also a good tailwind going into 2022.
unknown speaker
that's very clear. lucas, thanks very much.

our next question comes from isabella simonato, bank of america.
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, jean, lucas, thank you for the call. my first question is on the volume performance, but more from a channel perspective, right, both in q4 and how you're seeing the beginning of the year. if you could give us a little bit more color on the performance between the on-premise and the off-premise in brazil.
the weakness that we saw in the industry, where was that more concentrated? and how are you seeing the pace, of the on-trade recovering throughout the next couple of quarters? that would be my first question. and the second question is, it's interesting, you guys mentioned the sg&a relief for 2022. any sense of magnitude or how should we think that versus inflation for the year? i think that could be helpful. thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
you can go.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
you can take the first one.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
i will take the first one on volumes and then i'll answer the sg&a one. so isabella, thank you very much for the question. so what we saw in q4, it was a lot related with weather, that it was a very bad weather overall. so we saw this industry deceleration on that part.
so impacting all the channels equally, and then we had omicron that impacted more the on trade again. so we have been seeing structurally better come back of the on-trade, but then omicron stopped that, and then we saw the impact on the on-trade again. but q4, it was mainly pretty much about the weather overall. we believe that this on-trade coming back is more structural.
when omicron goes, it's really getting better. we've seen the on-trade overall reorganizing, transforming itself to do deliveries, to do takeaways. of course, the occasion of gathering outside of home with friends, it is volatile. so it was getting better.
it stopped. i think it will get back again. so i think throughout the year, this should be a positive as we've seen all over the previous year. overall, ok? so in terms of channel, we believe that the on-trade in transition train will continue to rebound during the year, and that's what pretty much it.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
and with respect to your question on sg&a, isabella, a few things here that i think are worth highlighting. i think number one, 2021 was a year where sg&a growth was heavily impacted by admin expenses going up. and within admin expenses, there were a few dynamics that we highlighted during our q3 call. number one, if you think of the growth of overhead, excluding our investments behind technology, the overhead growth was actually much milder and below inflation, ok? but since 2020, we've taken the deliberate decision to over invest in technology to build the future.
ok? and that had an impact on top of the variable comp. and as it relates to variable comp, i think it's fair to say that the variable comp accruals in 2021 were on the higher end of historical accruals, given that the rebound in performance was much stronger than we expected going into the year in 2021. so when we look at 2022, i think a good way to think about sg&a is less growth on the sg&a side coming from admin because of lower variable comp accruals versus the level at which we accrued in 2021. we will continue to stay very, very disciplined around overhead growth as we have historically been.
and -- but we won't be shy about continuing to invest behind technology. ok? but all in all, a much better level of growth on the admin side as opposed to 2021. ok? then when you go to sales and marketing, sales and marketing in 2021 was heavily impacted by the comparable base, because in 2020, sales and marketing was at a much lower level as we adapted to covid and we tightened the belt. so there was a tough base of comparison and that, to a great extent, explains kind of the year-over-year growth, albeit below net revenue growth, ok, for the full year.
so sales and marketing, i think perhaps the best way, just to have a reference, is to look at historical sales and marketing performance and use that as a reference, though we're not giving any specific guidance on sales and marketing for 2022. so i would look at historic levels, ok, as a reference. and then on the logistics side, i think the -- one of the main impacts was the increase in initiatives like dtc, as jean mentioned, that they bring the last mile distribution cost. we will still invest behind that expansion.
so there's still some increase on the distribution cost side but nothing to flag here out of the kind of ordinary expansion of the business. ok? so all in all, sg&a growing less than it grew in 2021, given these different levers that i mentioned.
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's very clear. thank you.

our next question comes from robert ottenstein, evercore.
robert ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thank you. thank you very much. first, just a short detail question.
any update in terms of state or national taxes that impact beer in brazil? and then my main question really is on how you're addressing total beverage alcohol opportunities in your key markets and particularly, spirits. how beer is doing versus spirits? plans that you have to perhaps get into spirits or address spirits occasions with more ready-to-drink products. you've done some of that in the past, but i'd like to get an update on where those initiatives are. thank you. 
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
ok. i can take the first question on taxes, and then jean can answer the second one on total beverage alcohol. on the tax front, robert, there's no real update. i think just taking a step back, our view is that given how hard covid hit our markets, we think that everybody needs to support recovery.
and so in our view, the way forward is to invest behind the recovery of the on-trade for instance. and so to the extent there is further taxation, that's going to increase the burden on the industry, increase the burden on the trade. we think that's not going to be constructive for the recovery of the industry as a whole, ok? but there's no real update since q4 on the tax front.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
robert, and let me get the second one. so thanks for the question on total average. let me start with something that we don't talk that much. we have been building nabs across the board in brazil, argentina, uruguay.
and we are really excited about what we -- the foundations that we built this year. so we have resilience on that side. we are gaining market share. pepsi black is really something that we are very excited about.
the taste is really something that consumers are cheering with us. [inaudible] is doing very well. so -- and business is really helping for us to give more space for nab. so this is the first thing.
i think it will be a strong year for nab across the board in our company, because we built -- that was a year 2021 was a year that we built a lot of things to help nabs. having said that, so we stepped changed the share of trout of beer in the previous -- in 2020 and 2021, it was a step change. you've seen my volumes. somehow we get it right, the innovation strategy and the affordability strategy on the mainstream on the core.
so we stepped change share there, so our category is very resilient in brazil, in argentina, in chile. in our major footprints, beer is really, as a category, really doing well. we are taking the lead on innovating on deciding the relative price on the basket. so we are very excited with that.
having said that, we just put in place a business unit to go to think about beyond beer. that is thinking about all the options that we have. so rtg is really something that we are starting. so with beats in brazil and mike's, there is soda that we piloted is doing very well.
it's really something that we believe that will have traction in our major markets. and then this is pretty much the spirits occasion. and then we are studying everything and open on all the alcoholic beverage, but it's easy to say how we're going to move. so we put in place the capabilities.
we hired ahead. we are studying deeply. rtg will move first, and we are studying the rest.
robert ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst

our last question comes from gustavo troyano, itau.
gustavo troyano -- itau bba -- analyst
i was wondering if you could explore a little bit more on the ebitda guidance for 2022, especially trying to analyze the magnitude of the forecasted growth within different geographies. so it would be very helpful if you could help us navigate through a build-out maybe of the consolidated ebitda growth across the business units. so which regions could increase ebitda ahead of the consolidated growth? which ones could access headwinds for the consolidated growth to meet your ebitda guidance? so when you call to give us mainly focusing on your international operations and how we compare your ebitda outlook for 2022 would be very helpful.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
ok. thank you for the question, gustavo. we're not going into that level of detail, but let me try to give you a good way to think about it. and one of the reasons why, when we project 2022 based on our plan kind of what are the reasons to believe that we're going to work toward delivering more than the 10.9% organic ebitda growth for ambev at the consolidated level.
i think a good way to think about it is in 2021, we delivered the 10.9% organic growth year-over-year, with ebitda decline, not only in brazil beer and ebitda decline in brazil nab, whereas our international operations in last cochin canada really made a difference in terms of allowing us to deliver this organic ebitda growth despite all the fx and commodity headwinds that we faced across markets, we still managed to deliver good recovery and double-digit ebitda growth. so when we look at 2022, we see, given the momentum and given that we're starting the year better prepared, we see a 2022 with brazil bouncing back in terms of ebitda growth. so just by having brazil bouncing back and growing ebitda after three years of decline, and given the size and importance of brazil, not only beer, but also nab, to the overall company, that gives us confidence that we can deliver this improved performance and growth level for 2022. i think that's the main difference.
it's brazil bouncing back and growing ebitda in organic terms.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
and to add on that, gustavo, central america and caribbean has been a clock, has been some steady. canada, too, it has been easy to predict. last, we are doing very well, so the core plus strategy is really working. chile is really something that we are accelerating.
paraguay is doing very well. argentina, too. so in the end, nabs is what i mentioned, somehow we don't talk that much, but i think it will have a strong year. and then we have brazil turning.
gustavo troyano -- itau bba -- analyst

so thank you very much. thanks, all analysts, everyone who joined the call for your time and attention. 2021 was a great year in our journey. we are transforming our business.
the milestones that we accomplished, it was something that we are very proud of. q4, we consolidated a whole new level of volumes. we are structurally better prepared to 2022. we know that 2022 will have its challenges, but we are confident on delivering consolidated organic ebitda growth in 2022 ahead of our 2021 performance.

[operator instructions] before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the safe harbor of the securities litigation reform act of 1996.
forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of ambev's management and on information currently variable to the company. they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions because they relate to future events, and therefore, depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other operating factors could also affect the future results of ambev and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. i would also like to remind everyone that, as usual, the percentage changes that will be discussed during today's call are both organic and normalized in nature.
in nature. and unless otherwise stated, percentage changes refer to comparison with fourth quarter results. normalized figures refer to performance measures before exceptional items, which are either income or expenses that do not occur regularly as part of ambev's normal activities. as normalized figures are non-gaap measures, the company discloses the consolidated profit, eps, ebit and ebitda on a fully reported basis in the earnings release.
now i'll turn the conference over to mr. jean jereissati, ceo for ambev. mr. jereissati, you may begin your conference.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
good morning. good afternoon, everyone. thanks for joining our q4 and full year 2021 earnings call. 2021 is now history, but it definitely lasted smart.
we had an all-time high engagement of our team, which once again rose to the occasion and remain steadfast in transforming this company to a new chapter. we kept a very high reputation as we continue to focus on having a positive impact in society and growing together with our ecosystem. we have reached our record top 15 million hectoliters of new volume on top of 2020 and pretty much all the industry growth in the period. our normalized ebitda went back to double-digit growth and above pre-pandemic levels, despite unprecedented cost headwinds.
and we had free cash flow growing ahead of normalized ebitda, improving our roic while investing heavily in the future. i want to deeply thank my entire team for this amazing year. now let's talk about q4. our main objectives in the quarter were to consolidate our new volume levels.
and here, we grew volumes in the quarter, improving our rolling 12 months performance and to position ourselves to start 2022 structurally better than we begun 2021. we accelerated our net revenue per hectoliter growth, reaching 15.2%, which leave us in a good place to start the year. breaking it down by region. in brazil beer, our volumes in the quarter declined 3%, amid a high single-digit industry decline according to our estimates.
therefore, we sustained market share gains, and we led in 2021, both volume share and value share growth. in fact, this was the second year in a row in which we outperformed a growing industry, adding 4.5 million hectoliters in 2020 and six million hectoliters in 2021. in the quarter, net revenue per hectoliter grew 9%, and we expect to improve this performance in 2022. in brazil, nab volumes grew by almost 2%, and net revenue per hectoliter grew nearly 12, thanks to better packaging and premium mix.
we estimate we gained market share in the quarter, benefiting from a better visibility and improved distribution with bees, closing the year with all-time high buyers in history. our international operations continued to rebound consistently. latin america south was our major growth engine with volumes growing almost 9% and net revenue per hectoliter about 31%. we had a solid performance in central america in the caribbean.
volumes grew by 2.5 and net revenue per hectoliter grew by 16, thanks to our premium and core plus brands that are gaining mixed weight. canada, we grew approximately 4% in both volumes and net revenue per hectoliter, an easy comp given q4 2020, combined with market share gains, led by corona and michelob ultra. on top of that, we are structurally better positioned to start 2022. our portfolio is stronger and healthier.
for example, in brazil, brahma duplo malte and brahma were first and second in brand equity improvement among all brands in the market. and we are starting this year with 1.6 million more consumers that states that love one of our brands. also, i would like to highlight the performance of corona, that is the leading premium brand in central america and the caribbean in canada, in chile, in argentina  and grew 44% in volumes in brazil. innovation is working.
we tested more than 65 new products throughout the year, including beer and non-beer products. there is an avenue of growth in health and wellness with stella gluten-free and michelob ultra. our core plus segment already represents 10% of our brazil volumes. after the successful launch of brahma duplo malte, spaten has had a very good traction in brazil.
this segment represents an enormous opportunity in all countries, with andes origen leading in argentina, cusqueña doing very well in chile and skol surprising us in paraguay. we are going beyond beer. beyond beer is already an important profitable growth driver in more mature markets like canada, where we have the mike's in neutral franchises leading the way. and in 2021, to be ahead of the curve in our other markets, we strength our beyond-beer capabilities.
we created a new business unit to bring focus and consistencies to our strategy toward exciting new alcoholic beverages categories, such as ready-to-drink, can, cocktails and seltzers. in brazil, we have the beats franchise broadening its portfolio, and we will continue to expand mike's after a successful pilot in 2021. dtc initiatives have steps changed. this is especially true for the delivery in brazil, not only in terms of geographic reach, but also scale and assortment.
in 2021, they reached 300 cities, delivered 61 million orders. and we begin 2022 with four million monthly active users. and this is revolutionizing how we connect with clients in dominican republic and in brazil, where more than 85% of our customers are already ordering online and of which more than 80% make majority of their purchases to the bees app. also, our offering of non-ambev products on the platform reached a 1.4 billion annualized gmv in 2021 in total ambev, in this is just the beginning.
in 2021, we kicked off the expansion of bees software-as-a-service capability with the agreement with brf in brazil, and we are speeding up this implementation in argentina, paraguay and panama. at this time of the year, last year, everyone was worried about the impacts from the pandemic, the reduction in government stimulus, the cost pressures given fx devaluation and commodity increases. after 12 months, the results were: our volumes were up 9%, net revenues up 24% and ebitda growing 11. we believe we adapted quickly in 2021, and we invested ahead to continue to lead in 2022.
a lot has changed in the past year. in 2022, we will remain alert, attentive and not let down our guard. because covid is still among us, we're going to see a lot of industry volatility, given consumer inflation, pressuring disposable income on the one side, but we're going to also see awards come during the summer on the other side, cost pressures given unprecedented commodity inflation. in brazil beer, cash cogs per hectoliter is expected to increase between 16% and 19%.
and despite all that, we would deliver consolidated organic ebitda growth in 2022, ahead of our 2021 performance with brazil back to growth. we are structurally better prepared. we have a plan, and our team is already working on it. to finish, i would like once again to thank all of our people for the great 2021 and for this amazing transformation journey we have been going through.
thank you all. see you in may. and now it's over to you, lucas. 
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
thank you, jean, and hello, everyone. let's start with the numbers. net revenue grew 16% in q4 and nearly 24% for the full year. ebitda declined about 2% in the quarter but grew almost 11% in 2021, which is well above 2019 levels, even if you exclude the impact of one-off tax credits in brazil.
normalized profit declined about 45% in q4 due to tax credits one-offs in brazil, but increased over 11% in the full year. and operational cash flow increased over 40% in the quarter, finishing the year more than 21% above 2020. what's more, our consistent improvement on the operational side also translated into better performance when it comes to our value-creation agenda, with return on invested capital, economic profit, and free cash flow all back to growth, and all this while, first, continuing to invest behind our business transformation and future growth, with capex for the year totaling brl 7.7 billion, which is nearly 64% above 2020 levels, and sales and marketing growing 15% to support our portfolio strategy and innovation pipeline. and second, returning excess cash to shareholders with a total payout of brl 9.5 billion in the form of dividends and ioc in the year, which was about 23% above 2020.
and in terms of sustainability, 2021 was another year of consistent and continuous improvement, and we remain on track to deliver our goals by 2025. for instance, we announced the first carbon-neutral large brewery and multiplant in brazil, and we also reached 100% renewable energy for our breweries in panama, the dominican republic, and guatemala. we advanced several initiatives to decarbonize our value chain operations related to scope 3, and we continued to dream big. we announced our ambition to achieve net zero for operations by 2030 and for our value chain by 2040.
all in all, we delivered the consistent improvement in performance we have been so vocal about since 2020. and now that we are pretty much back to pre-pandemic levels on the bottom line, and with 2021 behind us, we must look ahead. so let's focus on 2022. first, what doesn't change? one, top line growth will remain a key priority and a key performance driver.
two, input cost pressure, unfortunately, remains a headwind. and three, our focus on value-creation drivers such as return on invested capital, economic profit, and free cash flow generation remain. now what should be different in 2022? one, our net revenue performance should be more driven by net revenue per hectoliter than volumes as we adapt to a higher inflationary environment. two, cost headwinds will come mostly from commodity inflation rather than fx, but at a lower growth rate than in 2021.
three, sg&a growth should improve, which was heavily impacted by variable compensation accruals. and four, the tax credit one-offs in brazil that positively impacted our ebitda, financial results, and effective tax rate over the last two years should no longer impact our performance in a material way. let me give a bit more color on our cogs outlook in brazil beer, which we are giving specific guidance. we expect brazil beer cash cogs per hectoliter to grow between 16% to 19% for the full year.
this number assumes commodity prices remain at their current levels and does not include the per hectoliter impact on the sale of non-ambev products on our bees marketplace, such as milk, vegetable oil, rice, condensed milk, and chewing gum. given bees marketplace growth trend in 2021 and our plan going forward in countries like brazil and the dominican republic, starting in q1 2022 earnings results, we will report our net revenue per hectoliter, our cogs per hectoliter and our cash box per hectoliter performance, excluding the impact of these non-ambev products sold under bees marketplace. this is intended to provide more transparency to the market on this important growth driver as well avoid distorting the performance of the underlying beer results. when we bring it all together, what this means is that we will work to deliver better ebitda growth in 2022 than the 11% growth we delivered in 2021, despite a tougher q1, despite volatility by quarter and despite the cost headwinds i mentioned.
turning to our financial priorities. we will focus on optimizing our business through three things: first, improving our financial discipline with a focus on liquidity as well as our typical cost and expense management initiatives while reinvesting for growth organically and nonorganically; second, further our value creation agenda with a focus on improving our return-on-invested capital, economic profit growth and free cash flow growth; and third, return excess cash to shareholders over time. regarding value creation, we will continue to look beyond margin ratios and also focus on return ratios. margins remain extremely important, but when it comes to creating value in a sustainable way in the long term, asset turnover is another important lever, and we see room for improvement here.
as for instance, our tech platforms continue to expand. and yes, 2021 was still a tough year on the margin side. but on the return side, we managed to break the downward cycle we were on for a while. following in 2022, the challenge is to build momentum on top of what we accomplished last year.
so to wrap up. following good recovery last year, 2022 brings well-known challenges but also several opportunities we've been investing behind since 2020. we believe we are better prepared, and we will have to deliver once again the continuous and consistent improvement as we transform this company. thank you, and now let's move to q&a.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from mrs. isabella simonato with bank of america.
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, everyone. good morning, jean and lucas. thank you for the call and the question. i would like to ask about beer brazil.
you mentioned that the penetration of rgb, right, has been improving. can you extrapolate how much is the recovery of the on-trade itself? and how much is the strategy of the repositioning of the rgb that you mentioned in the investor day, right, with more adequate prices? and what we can expect from that going forward if you're already in the optimized mix of rgbs or there is more to come? that would be my first question. and the second question is still on the consumption environment, right? i think it is not exclusive of you that january was very weak and that we saw improvements across different sectors in february and march. but can you give us a sense how you guys seeing the beginning of q2 in terms of a consumption environment, and essentially mix performance? how are you feeling overall, the overall market now in q2? thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
hi, isabella. thank you very much for the question. so i'll take first one, beer brazil on-trade recovery, right, and rgb bottles. what i can mention is that we still don't see in q1 the full recovery of the social out-of-home occasion, as we compare to the pre-pandemic level in terms of mix, ok? so we are still seeing mid-single digits down in terms of mix and -- but it's really accelerating.
so we saw that this trend, this recovery was happening quarter after quarter. then we had sequential improvement in q1 compared with q4 of last year. but we are quite not there yet but moving, ok? so still opportunity on that front, but happy to see sequentially moving. so this is the first question.
the second one, as i mentioned in the last call, the previous call. the big question of this year really would be about the volumes, right? so i think the other things were well set, so we had a good starting point in terms of market share. the price sequentially looks solid. the cogs, it is really something that we confirm the guidance.
so the question was really about the volumes. we were going through a very tough january due to omicron at that point, at that moment. and we had the questions about disposable income and inflation impact in the industry, but we knew that this year, we would have to have carnival, a lot of occasions related with beer, a world cup in december. so the big question was really about the volumes.
and then we figure out during the quarter that january looked like really a one-off because of omicron. and then february got better, march was a very strong month, and we have momentum. we have seen this continuing.

the next question comes from mr. thiago duarte with banco btg pactual.
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
hello. good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for the opportunity. two questions on my side. the first one, first of all, we appreciate very much the breakdown you're giving in terms of the non-ambev marketplace sales and the impact on the results.
i mean this is very helpful. and particularly on that, i was looking for some more color, when we think of the revenue per hectoliter performance in the brazil beer division. can you break down, to any extent, how packaging and brand mix impacted the year-over-year performance? or even the sequential performance? i mean, jean just discussed the -- how the rgb is gaining traction there, but not there yet fully. so can you talk a little bit how, again, packaging and brand mix impacted the revenue per hectoliter? that would be great.
and the second question is regarding the performance of the core plus segment, right? it's clear from the statements that premium did really well. core was once again resilient, but there is a sense that core plus lost a little bit of ground. so i just wanted to see and hear your thoughts on about how that specific segment performed during the quarter. thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you. duarte. so let's see if i can break it down.
i'm not sure if i can break it completely down. but overall, brand mix was overindexing, right? this -- the net revenue per hectoliter. and the pack mix went a little bit down, as we mentioned in our investors day, that during this previous year, we were rebalancing our pack price strategy one-ways and rgbs. so in the end, net-net, it was positive.
we are somehow -- we are confident on the net revenue per hectoliter. i think one way for you to look at it, it is that sequentially, it is going up compared with q4. and if you look at my previous year, the specific q1 of the previous year was really something that was strong. but then moving forward, so the mix effects diluted a little bit in the previous year.
and we are confident that now it's really sequentially going up and very solid. it's a good level when you look at the full year and the level where we are now, ok? so in terms of revenue per hectoliter. talking about brands, brands and packs, i think we are very pleased with the volumes, right? so if you look at our volumes and compared with the pre-pandemic levels with 2019, if you look at production numbers, we are 6% above -- 5% above 2019, and we are seeing overall competitors in a level, there is much below that. and in the short term, year over year, we are happy with the 2%.
so the bright spots, it was really the high end, so that we grew high teens, right? so for me -- not to say it's wrong, high teens. so the mainstream was very solid to mid-single digit, the combining brands. in the core plus, we put a basket there that's brahma duplo malte, spaten, bohemia. and it's already represents more than 10% of our volumes with the highlights for brahma duplo malte and spaten, and bohemia, we took some discounts out regionally.
but so core plus, we feel that the strategy is right and represents more than 10% of our volumes so far. one big thing, too, is that i mentioned is that in terms of strategy of portfolio and brands, the rgb basket, it really went up double digits, and it's not there, ok? so it's, as i mentioned to isabella, so the mix of 600 ml is not still in the pre-pandemic level. but when we look at the full basket of rgb, they are really growing double digits. they are more on the 20s, ok?
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst

the next question comes from mr. sergio matsumoto with citigroup.
sergio matsumoto -- citi -- analyst
yes. good morning. i wanted to ask deeper on one of the topics that came out in the investor day about those four brand, the 3bs plus spaten. and kind of ask you about how do you balance between those priority brands versus the complementary brands? do you see spaten, budweiser and beck's, like those that are not as big as brahma to kind of get just as big over the medium to long term and perhaps overtake the size of antarctica and skol? how do you see this balance between these priority brands?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you for the question. i think when we put our vision on innovation and white spaces to launch new brands and build the portfolio of the future, i think what was very clear for us, it was that we have a space in brazil on the core plus segment that is highly developed across the board in china, in u.s., in high maturity markets in canada and u.k. and somehow, the -- so the space that would be created over there on the core plus, the potential should be something around 25% of the industry, right? so somehow in the long term, i think -- so premium at some point in time could be like 20%, core plus 25%.
and then we have core and value, core a little bit more than 34%, and the rest of the value. so this opportunity that we are focusing on the core plus in the entry premium. so they are -- we are aiming on build something that we over-index in market share in 25% of the market. and so far, our two bets are brahma duplo malte and spaten.
so spaten has to be sizable and it has to be a play that can, together with brahma duplo malte lead this segment, ok? and then you can do the math for that. we are very excited. it is just starting. but we are very excited about the performance, about the feedback that we are having.
so we believe that it really can be a sizable brand, spaten, in the core plus. talking about the premium segment, we are really -- thinks that budweiser it will benefit from the reopening overall, the entertainment agenda, the world cup, that it was very depressed in the previous years. and we believe that beck's and corona, they can play really important role coming from above and building the super premium segment, ok? so i'm not quite sure if i really answer exactly, but this is a little bit division. i think the core plus can be 25%.
the premium can be 20%. we have a dream really to over-index overall. and these brands should get sizable to make this mission for us.
sergio matsumoto -- citi -- analyst
yeah. yeah. understood. it does make sense.
it sounds like spaten, there's a lot of opportunity that you see going forward and this is something that we should keep an eye on. thanks very much.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
yeah. for sure.

the next question comes from mr. lucas ferreira with banco j.p. morgan.
lucas ferreira -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everybody. thanks for your time. my first question is regarding the cost, the cost guidance that you have for the year.
specifically, if the volumes coming strong or performing well, put it this way. if you start feeling a bit more comfortable with the costs kind of coming more toward the low end of the range or eventually coming even below that range like it was the case in the first quarter adjusted for the marketplace. is this something that we can say or not yet? and the second question, maybe to lucas, regarding the working capital specifically this quarter, which was a bit heavier, put it this way, especially on the accounts payable line. so if there's anything particular about this quarter that you can highlight and how to think about that going forward? thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so i will get the first one, and then lucas get the second one. so i think -- so when we gave this guidance in the previous quarter, we saw it was in the day that the war started, right? so at some point in time, we were a little bit anxious about it because we didn't know how everything would evolve with the war, but we were confident. so we did a lot of math to get to this range.
and we are very confident that we will be in that range. we are working very hard for that more and it's hard to say. it's too early to mention that we can go under, but we are very confident to say that we're going to be inside that range.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
ok. lucas, this is lucas here. so on working capital, i think the two -- you're spot on. i think the big difference in the quarter is really when it comes to payables.
and within payables, there were two main factors, ok? factor number one was the payment of the variable compensation, ok, in q1. remember, 2020 was a no bonus year. so 2021, there was no cash outlay for variable compensation, which was not the case in 2021 where there was a bonus paid out and it hit us in the first quarter of 2022, ok? so that was the first big impact that we saw in the payables line. and second, related to capex.
as you may remember, we have payment terms that vary depending on the category of suppliers. and many of our suppliers, particularly capex, we have longer payment terms. and so depending on the calendarization of our capex spend, there are instances where we commit, we book the expense in one fiscal year, but the actual payment, the cash outlay falls in the next fiscal year. and so what happened this quarter was exactly that.
so there were capex commitments that were booked in q3 and q4 and the cash outlay is going to -- has fallen in q1 of this year. ok? so those are the two main drivers of this variation on the payables line. i think for the year, we continue to work very hard on improving working capital performance overall. so i would see q1 performance as these two factors and nothing more than that, and then we'll continue to work on it, ok?
lucas ferreira -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
excellent. thank you very much.

the next question comes from mr. gustavo troyano with itau bba.
gustavo troyano -- itau bba -- analyst
hi, jean and lucas. hi, everyone. thanks for taking my question. i was wondering if we could explore a little bit the ebitda organic growth forecast for 2022 of 11% that you have mentioned in the fourth quarter, especially trying to analyze how this first quarter compares with your initial expectations.
so it would be really helpful to hear from you if this quarter came in line with your forecast especially focusing on a business unit breakdown. so is there a business unit that has surprised you to the upside or to the downside? and looking forward, as we walk through the second quarter, do you believe these positive or negative highlights are on track to reach your original forecast? so any color that you could give us on this side would be really helpful. thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so thank you for the question, gustavo. so let me try to elaborate on this ebitda ambition that we had. so we mentioned that we should grow faster than in the consolidated level with ambev than we grew last year. the number is 10.9%.
so we feel that somehow what happened in the -- if you look at the growth on the previous year, it was really brazil on the negative territory, international operations doing well. somehow, we believe that our acceleration for the year it will be the continued performance of international operations and the rebound of brazil. and net-net, when we look at this quarter, everything that i look on it makes me confident that we are in line to make this guidance. i think canada, it was a place -- canada and dominican republic, it was a place that they were a little bit off.
but somehow, we saw the other areas really compensating. so i really feel that this quarter confirms our journey to deliver the ambition of accelerating ebitda growth that we mentioned before. and the main change is really in brazil beer and nab really bouncing back strongly.
gustavo troyano -- itau bba -- analyst

the next question comes from mr. robert ottenstein with evercore.
robert ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thank you very much. first, a more detailed question on the operating environment and then a bigger picture question. so can you talk and give us a little bit more detail in terms of what kind of pricing is going on in the brazil beer market today that you've done, that the competition has done and maybe break it out a little bit more by tiers.
from what we can tell, it seems much more geared to the high end and an increasing gap between core, core plus and the high end, maybe we're wrong, but that's kind of what our trade visits suggested. so that's the first topic on pricing. and then the second topic, kind of just bigger picture, some important management changes at the abi level, a growth officer, ricardo tadeu with a lot of businesses coming into him. can you talk about how that impacts how you run your business? and if anything changes there and whether it's beneficial? thank you very much.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you for the question, robert. so robert, q1 net revenue per hectoliter was 8.4% versus last year, excluding -- in beer, just talking mainly in beer, right, beer, excluding the marketplace. it was driven mostly by the price increases carryover that we had during q4 and revenue management initiatives.
our last price increase was in october '21. and so q1 is really a tough comp that when we look at what happened in the previous year. but sequentially, we've seen q1 going ahead of q4 and solid, which put us in a good position to the rest of the year. sequentially, we improved 0.7% compared with q4 2021.
and historically, the q1 and q2, they go -- because of seasonality in regions, it really usually goes down. and we were able to put it up, and we are seeing it solid moving forward. we're going to remain flexible watching inflation. inflation is not controlled in brazil, watching disposable income and elasticity, demand among the factors to continue to be flexible and get all the opportunities that we need.
talking about competition and segments. i think from our perspective, the segment that really have a rate of price increase the most, it was really the value segment. the value segment was the one that increased the most prices overall in the industry. and what we saw in this q1, q2 it was the price to consumer relatively was open.
we moved ahead. competition took a little bit time to follow and follow more by the mid of the q1. and so when you look at this q1 that we had, it was with an open relativity to competitors when we see the historical. so i think this is a little bit what i can mention.
so we are confident that the things are solid that we have at the moment. talking about ricardo tadeu's strategy, we have been working together for a while. there is a lot of collaboration with that. ricardo worked with us many times -- long time with us.
knows a lot our operations here in brazil. we expect to continue the collaboration on business, banking and dtc that these are a big bet for us. and i feel that this structure that abi proposed with ricardo, it's really something that's the right thing to do, and we will help us to think all this transformation holistically as a platform, not siloed and really we'll make all these things connect and be leveraged. so i'm very excited about ricardo's structure.
robert ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst
and just on the price increases, value up the most, yes, but that's not a segment that is very big for you. how would you compare the difference in your price increases between core, core plus and premium?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so i think in the end, robert, this is a little bit of a sensitive information. we do not comment that much on that. but there is no big difference on that. it's a little bit aligned what we are doing across the segments.
it's pretty much the same. of course, inside, we have a different strategy on branding. as i mentioned in the call before, we took some discounts of bohemia, for example, that was a brand that it was a regional play in the core plus segment to really focus on brahma duplo malte and spaten. so inside, there is some strategy brand-wise, but segments overall, they are pretty much going up almost the same rates.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
yeah. just to complement here, robert. lucas speaking. i think in 2020 and 2021, i think there was a more deliberate decision on our part focused pricing more on one-way packaging, right, as opposed to rgb, right, as we kind of revisited the entire price tree.
and also, we didn't want to overburden the on-premise, which was suffering a lot during the covid pandemic. so we felt that if we were to take pricing during that period of time where the consumption occasions out-of-home were depressed, right? we would be kind of overburdening and slowing down the recovery of the channel. but this was more a reality of 2020 and 2021. and so now i think it's more of a more of an overall kind of pricing strategy, obviously, looking at segment-by-segment, brand-by-brand, region-by-region, channel-by-channel to see where there are fine-tuning needed.
but i think this was more in the past, ok?
robert ottenstein -- evercore isi -- analyst

the next question comes from mrs. fernanda sayao with credit suisse.
fernanda sayao -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, jean. hi, lucas. fernanda sayao from credit suisse. thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.
i have two on my side. so first, i was wondering if you could comment on market share dynamics across markets specifically across segments and brands? and then also, if you could give us some more detail on what happened specifically in canada, and how you see the business going forward? thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. thanks for the question, fernanda. talk about region first, and then we jump into segments. overall, we are with a solid market share at ambev, right? so if you look at -- i'm really putting the rolling 12 volumes months that is really something that we are looking it.
we know that we are the leaders of the industry, so we have to think not just about gaining market share, but we really have to think about occasions and industry expansion, and we are very excited about our volumes. when we were discussing in the previous quarter, if we have cycled all the growth, and then it will be -- the story of volume growing would be behind or if we're going to continue to be able to grow volumes and then we delivered at ambev levels at the rolling 24 -- rolling 12 months, again, that it was very strong to let us to 182,000 hectoliters at ambev level. so this is the first thing. so going in thinking just in terms of market share, the breakdown of market share on the regions, so it is solid, too.
so we are gaining market share in brazil. we are gaining market share in chile. canada, we gained market share. we have a very solid position in terms of market share in dominican republic.
argentina, somehow, we are in line with the market share that we had -- that we always had over there. and so region-wise, we are pretty much with a good performance of market share. and looking at segments in brazil somehow, so let me just mention that that we don't mention usually. and then nabs, we are selling a lot and gaining a lot of market share with the strategy that we had on the portfolio rebalance, with the digital platform really helping us to gain market share overall in nabs that we don't talk that much.
and it will be -- we really see as a model of growth moving forward, ok? so talking about specifically about brazil and the segments. so we are seeing -- we were very excited about the high-end performance that we had in q1 in terms of volume. it was a high teens performance. the core plus, it is solid with brahma duplo malte and spaten.
the core is really outperforming the industry overall, and we make some decisions on the value side, mainly in cans on the value to really put prices up. and then -- so there is less volumes and less market share over there. but somehow market share feels solid. and we are focusing on a basket of brands that you mentioned in the investors day, we are focusing across the board on the core plus segment.
so we have -- we launched two years ago skol in paraguay in the core plus segment. we have andes in argentina in the core plus segment. so we are across the board focusing a lot on the core plus segment. and somehow the focus brands that we mentioned to brazil on the investors day that are the bees, the strategy that we have over there.
in canada specifically, canada was a tough industry somehow the hit of omicron and the tough comp that we had previous year, it was really something. the good part is that this quarter is not a big quarter in terms of seasonality for canada, and we are seeing industry recovering, and we are seeing that the market share -- that we are gaining market share in canada. so somehow it was pretty much a combination of a tough comp and a bad industry that we have in canada, but the business is solid, innovation is working. the brand is working.
the beyond beer that we are launching, they are solid in canada. so somehow, we are confident when it comes to market share in canada.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
yeah. just to add here on canada, specifically. i think just to give you a little bit more detail around the market share performance. first, i think we saw good performance market share-wise in premium.
this was led by stella and corona. when you go to core plus, michelob ultra continue to also perform well. so these three brands have delivered for us over the last few quarters in canada. so it was great to see that despite a very negative industry, particularly in january, these brands continue to outperform the market and gain share, ok? and then in addition to going beyond volume because net revenue per hectoliter was actually positive, growing 4%.
but on the cost side, the operation obviously suffered from the commodity headwinds that have been impacting many, many markets, right, across the board. and in terms of sg&a, i think the main impact was on the distribution side, given rising freight costs. and so that was also a factor in q1. but again, going forward, we have a plan in place to improve performance and -- but we have to deliver.
so that's the challenge going forward.

thiago bortoluci -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. hi, jean, lucas. good afternoon, everyone. i have two questions.
the first one, following up on the discussions on market share. could you please elaborate a little bit more in volumes growth in argentina, please? this is the first one. and the second one, regarding the additional information you shared on bees, especially the portfolio out from ambev. we are seeing, at this point, cash gross margins close to mid-single digits, right? but i understand that part of this is basically because you're leveraging your existing footprint and existing capacity within the truck.
so most of this should flow through ebitda. and please correct me if i'm wrong on this? but going forward, as you scale up the platform, how should we think about margins for this business unit on an underlying basis? should we expect additional sg&a to come over the next quarters? or should we take this current level as an underlying base for margins going forward? thanks.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
i'll get the first one and then lucas help me with the second one. so somehow, let me talk first about las, argentina. we had a good performance in top line in las. so it was 40% up.
so we have to remember that we have -- the countries that we have here is argentina, chile, bolivia and paraguay, and uruguay. so it was a good performance. it's an area that it's relevant for our growth. talking specifically about argentina, our volumes in argentina, they were negative on this quarter in beer.
so they were low single digits negative cycling a strong q1 that we have in the previous years, with nabs on the more positive territory over there. but with a market share that was pretty much in line with what we had in the previous year in argentina, ok? so talking about bees and margins, i will hand over to lucas.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
sure. thanks for the question, thiago. i think overall, given that the platform is still an expansion mode, again, we've come a long way in the last year, but there's still a lot of opportunity ahead. the honest answer is it's still too early to establish a steady-state type kind of margin level, ok, for the marketplace business.
but given how we are structured and how we're working, right, with bees, meaning leveraging our capillarity of our distribution network, our reach to clients. i think, i mean, conceptually, it makes sense to think about gross margin flowing more, right, to ebitda margin and less sg&a, right, expense than you would see if you look at other kind of similar type operations, ok? and conceptually, that makes sense. it's hard to give you a more precise indication of how much of it flows through at this time because we're still expanding.
thiago bortoluci -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and lucas, if i may follow up on this, thanks for the color, would you think it would make sense to comp this absolute level of margins with the cash and carry guys? or it wouldn't make sense?
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
well, you guys are the experts here, right? you guys are the experts on one of the best comps, ok? we obviously, right, look at other market participants. and -- but again, we're focused on the client in delivering the best possible service and assortments to our clients. i'll leave it to you guys, the experts, on what are the best comps.

the next question comes from mr. ricardo alves with morgan stanley.
ricardo alves -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hello, jean, lucas. thanks a lot for the call. most of my questions have been answered. just some more specific ones.
on administrative expenses in brazil beer, we did see the year-over-year decline as a percentage of sales, i think you're running at 8% or so, but still seems a little bit above historical. so did you guys expect this line to go lower from here? did you expect to see a lower number already in the first quarter, just for the sake of modeling the rest of the year in 2022? any color here would be helpful if there's anything within the admin line that surprised negatively in the first quarter and maybe that will change going forward.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
yeah. i think the big -- lucas here, ricardo. thanks for the question. i think regarding brazil beer specifically, i think the main thing i would call out was that last year, sales and marketing expense, right, was actually down year over year, ok? and so in a sense, we actually had a tough comp on the sales and marketing portion of brazil beer sg&a, ok? number one.
on the distribution side, we continue to face cost inflation, particularly from diesel, right? so we do operate a large direct distribution network. and so the logistics operations tends to suffer as diesel, fuel prices continue to increase. so i think looking ahead to your question, that should continue to pressure. and last but not least, i think the administrative cost side of things was a major factor in 2021 given the variable compensation accruals that were done quarter after quarter.
and for this year, we're not seeing -- we didn't see in q1, and we don't expect to see going forward that type of growth on the variable comp accrual side, ok? just because of the dynamics between 2020 and 2021 and the level of performance that was ahead of our expectations in 2021, ok? i hope this helps.

so thank you all. thank you all analysts and everyone who joined the call for your time and attention. to wrap up, we had an encouraging quarter, and we will remain focused on seizing the moment for the main consumption occasions during the remainder of the year. we still expect some volatility and cost pressures coming mainly from commodities.
but despite all the challenges, we remain on track in terms of our main ambitions for the year that i mentioned here to deliver consolidated organic ebitda growth in 2022 ahead of our 10.9% organic growth that we had in 2021, mainly because of brazil back to growth. so thank you very much. see you in july, and have a great day.

jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
good morning, good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining our earnings call for the first quarter of 2022. three weeks ago, during our investors day, we focused on our culture, our strategy and our business model has evolved, how we embrace technology in benefit of our customers and consumers, why we see several opportunities to create value going forward in our overall company's transformation. today, i will, of course, focus more on our q1 results.
but as i do this, i will also highlight how many of the things we showcased during the investors day are already positively impacting our short-term performance. so let's talk about the quarter. during our full year 2021 call, i explained why i believe we were starting 2022 better positioned, while acknowledging we expected a tough start to the year. q1 2021 had a very strong performance, with volumes up 12%, net revenue up 28% and ebitda of 24%, record growth rates for the first quarter of the year.
and this year, we were off to a slow start because we had a one-off january, a very tough month in many markets, given the omicron variant. however, i was happy to see that the team managed to deliver a better overall performance than we expected, particularly in brazil and las. for instance, brazil volumes bounced back in february and were very strong in march, which drove consolidated volume growth of 5.5% in the quarter. brazil, net revenue per hectoliter grew not only year over year but sequentially versus q4 '21, both in beer and in nab.
in beer, volumes grew 2.1% despite the tough january, thanks to premium portfolio growing high teens and core portfolio growing mid-single digits. according to our estimates, we once again gained market share versus last year. our three main core brands, brahma, antarctica and skol were ranked in the top of the 10 most valuable brands in brazil among 478 brands in 26 different categories according to brandz. in the core plus segment, spaten remains expanding its distribution in volume per outlet, and brahma duplo malte launched new returnable and one-way presentations, which will address more consumption occasions.
nab volume grew 16.9%, driving market share gains according to our estimates. the premium brands volume grew above the rest of the portfolio, led mainly by energy drinks, h20h!, pepsi and gatorade. in las, volumes grew 2.9% despite a strong comparable in argentina and the volume impact in bolivia due to another covid-19 wave in general. in chile, we gained market share according to our estimates and expanded distribution, despite lapping the start of the partnership with coke bottlers.
our core plus and above portfolio continued to grow in chile as well in paraguay and bolivia. of course, not everything worked. in cac, volumes declined 4.7% due to supply constraints in the dominican republic, our largest market in the region. we expect supply constraints to ease going forward.
however, above the core portfolio, continue to gain weight in our volumes, thanks to brands such as corona and modelo. in canada, volumes declined 8.4%, mainly driven by the worst industry of the last 30 years in january, which then recovered in february and march sequentially, coupled with tough comps from q1 '21. despite weak volume performance, we estimate having gained market share in beer and our net revenue per hectoliter grew 4% due to consistent implementation of revenue management initiatives. so let's go deep in what's behind this performance.
let's talk about our five pillars of our how to win framework. the first pillar, brands for each and everyone. in brazil, focused brands, brahma, beck's and budweiser added over 500,000 fans versus same period of last year according to our estimates. and in las, number of fans increased by 300,000.
after reaching a better balance price relativity between one-way and rgbs, our pack price strategy. our returnable packaging grew double digits in brazil, mainly in the 600 ml presentations in premium and the 300 ml presentations in core portfolios. second pillar, thirst to lead the future. our innovations continue to over-index market share according to our estimates, reaching 17.6% of brazil's beer net revenue, thanks to the continued success of brahma duplo malte, spaten and stella gluten-free.
innovations also reached over 17% of las net revenue. we launched new can sizes and secondary packaging to serve more occasions in the off-trade channel to brands such as budweiser, brahma duplo malte and original, too. third pillar, a toast to our customers' success. the digitalization of our customers continue to grow successful and supported our nab business to achieve a higher penetration per outlet and increase its number of customers.
and we continued the successful expansion of bees in paraguay and argentina. this marketplace in brazil grew gmv almost 10 times versus the first quarter of last year. in the last six months, serve more than 500,000 customers offering 400 skus, which include partners such as pernod ricard and bacardi. this brand continued its rollout in our operations, reaching more than 270,000 accounts and more than 1.4 billion tpv in the month of march.
and lastly, in april, we announced a deal between us and [inaudible], which is a relevant player in the logistic industries in brazil. together, we will further advance on the urban distribution centers developed. fourth pillar, experiences that come to you. ze delivery reached monthly active users of 4 million and grew the number of orders versus q1 '21 by 15% and dtc initiatives in las achieved 20,000 monthly active users.
fifth pillar together for a better world. we launched a collective effort to echo scope 3 emissions with more than 165 suppliers that represents over 65% of our total scope 3 emissions. and for the first time, more than 50% of our newly hired employees in the quarter were women. all in all, i come out of q1 encouraged and we will remain focused on seizing the moment for the main consumption occasions to come during the remainder of the year.
we continue to expect volatility in some of our markets and cost pressures coming from commodities for the remainder of the year, but we are not making any changes to our outlook for the year. therefore, the full year guidance related to brazil beer cash cogs per hectoliter growth between 16% and 19%, excluding the sale of non-ambev products on the marketplace remains unchanged. and despite the challenges ahead, we are on track in terms of our main ambitions for the year, get brazil back to bottom line growth, to have consolidated organic ebitda growth ahead of 10.9%, organic growth that we had in 2020 and improve our roic. to close, i would like to once again thank all our people that manage to deliver this quarter's performance, and i would like to thank you for your attention, and handle this over to you, lucas. 
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
thanks, jean. good morning, good afternoon and good evening. during our full year 2021 call, i laid out our approach toward 2022, and i mentioned what should be the same and what should change during the year as compared to 2021. so let me walk you through how q1 performance stacked up using this exact same logic, starting with what wouldn't change.
first, top line growth would remain a priority and a key performance driver. the result, 18.5% net revenue growth overall with brazil being the main highlight. second, input cost pressure would remain a headwind. the result cash cogs per hectoliter grew nearly 20% at the consolidated level.
and for brazil beer, it grew a little over 15%, excluding non-ambev marketplace products. and third, we would continue to focus on value creation drivers. here, during our recent investor day, we shared the financial logic behind our strategy and why we believe there is a path to sustainable long-term value creation for ambev, starting with a focus on improving our return on invested capital, building on our progress in 2021. and as jean pointed out, there are some good examples already of how our bets are translating into improvements in the short-term performance.
now in terms of what should be different in 2022. first, net revenue performance should be more driven by net revenue per hectoliter than volumes as we adapt to a higher inflationary environment. the result, net revenue per hectoliter grew around 14% and volumes grew nearly 4%. second, cost headwinds would come mostly from commodity inflation rather than fx.
the result, commodity inflation represented over two-thirds of the increase in brazil beer cash cogs per hectoliter driven mostly by aluminum and barley. third, sg&a growth should improve. the result, cash sg&a grew almost 16% with sales and marketing growing a little over 12%, distribution growing 24%, mainly due to rising diesel prices, and administrative expenses growing just about 3% given lower variable compensation accrual. and fourth, over the last two years, we had significant tax credit one-offs in brazil that positively impacted our ebitda, financial results and effective tax rate.
this was not a major factor in q1, but will be a factor in q2 given how much these tax credit one-offs positively impacted the second quarter of 2021. what this all means to us is that these results are a clear indication that we are on track to deliver a better ebitda organic growth in 2022 than the 10.9% organic growth that we delivered in 2021. i would now like to cover two more topics. first, our financial performance below ebitda and cash flow, and then esg.
cash flow from operating activities totaled about brl 520 million in the quarter, which represents a decline of about 82%. q1 2021 cash flow from operating activities had grown about 84%. and this quarter, there were two main factors that adversely impacted our operational cash generation. first, payment of variable compensation in march; and second, higher capex payments to start the year given the calendarization of our 2021 capex commitments.
normalized profit, however, grew nearly 29% in the quarter, given ebitda growth, a lower net finance expense versus q1 2021 of about brl 600 million and the lower effective tax rate. but as i mentioned, we faced a very tough comp in q2 given the tax credit one-offs that totaled about brl 1.6 billion, of which, approximately brl 1.2 billion impacted our ebitda, and almost brl 400 million impacted our net finance results last year. turning to sustainability. recently, we had some very important milestones.
i would like to highlight three related to our focus on environmental sustainability. first, we announced two more carbon-neutral breweries in brazil, agudos brewery in the state of sao paulo and cachoeiras de macacu brewery in the state of rio de janeiro. together, they represent an emission reduction of over 14,000 tons of greenhouse gases per year, and we intend to deliver another seven carbon-neutral operations by year-end. second, guarana antarctica is now packaged in bottles that are made with 100% recycled pet.
this was a groundbreaking initiative that our team embraced and managed to deliver a great outcome. we're very proud of guarana antarctica's heritage in brazil, what it represents to brazilian consumers and its leadership in the circular packaging agenda. third, another unprecedented initiative but regarding scope 3 emissions. as part of our ambition to reach net zero in the value chain by 2040, we engaged over 165 suppliers that represent over 65% of our total scope 3 emissions covering not only reporting, but also concrete actions to decarbonize.
and lastly, our 2021 esg report is out and can be found on our investor relations website. we plan to host another esg day in the second half of the year, so we can cover in greater detail, our ambition, our progress and learning so far, and what's to come. that's it, folks. better start to the year than we expected, which is encouraging, challenges and volatility remain a reality, so our guard remains high, and we have more work to do.
let's move to q&a.

ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question comes from marcella recchia of credit suisse.
marcella recchia -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, lucas. hi, jean. thank you for taking my questions and congrats on results. i have two questions.
first, on price. based on conversations with the industry participants, we heard that ambev implemented an off-cycle price increase in the second quarter. so just would like to confirm that and if so at which channel and pack and by how much? on top of that, based on third quarter hard cost, can we expect the usual price increase to come, or could we -- could you increase discounts or reduce price in order to push volumes? let me [inaudible] the answer of that before asking the second question.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok, marcella. thank you very much for your question. as you know, we are really focusing on finding the right elasticity in the sustainable benefit between volumes and net revenue per hectoliter, always with medium long-term pricing strategy unchanged, prioritizing to do not lag inflation, but really work on a favorable brand back in channel mix.so this is  strategy pretty much does not change. since 2019, we have been growing volumes, while improving pricing performance and we continue to monitor the environment moving forward but in a flexible way, watching inflation, disposable income, really working on elasticities to make the decisions on revenue management.so having said that, we did a more tactical price increase in may, it was a small one.
it was granular in some packs by jan, there were some regions that it was around 2.5%, both on off-trade and on the -- on say, right? so usually, we see in q2 net revenue per hectoliter going down sequentially, so this is more of an effect on mix in the northeast regions gain weight, and then we get the winter coming in the southeast.but this quarter was surprised us, it was really that the actions that we took, the channel mix, and the pet mix during the covid and the reopening of bars maybe seen rgb 600 ml bottles or regional [inaudible] really getting traction. so, this helped us to somehow -- to mitigate this usually net revenue per hectoliter decline that we have q2 to q1. page two, i can't really comment. i can't really comment on the competitors sensitive on pricing decisions moving forward.
marcella recchia -- credit suisse -- analyst
perfect. that's very helpful. and the second question very quickly is, about the core plus segment, which was the only segment you did not mention how much volumes grew in the quarter. so, it would be nice to hear from you how the segment performed in the second quarter? and also, if you can give us some color on how has been the rollout and acceptance of [inaudible]? thank you.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
ok. so that's a good question. let me give a step up to talk about dynamics that we saw in the q2 and then we talk about the segment. what we see marcella during this  doing a deep study in the previous two years is that, we developed a lot of actions really to fulfill the in-home opening, right? so since the pandemic arrived, we designed ourselves to get the in-home occasion right and we went deep on that, right? so you see that delivery was slowed.
brahma duplo malte, it was a brand on the core plus segment designed [inaudible]. we changed -- we expanded the 300 ml bottles focused on the traditional trade to get inside homes. so it was really a strategy that we are very happy with it. it's really step changed our volumes that was to combine all these things, that's really something that that really led our 10 million hectoliters change in the company.
but what we have seen in q2, it is that -- so there is a lot of residual of in-home actions, but consumers travel back to our strength that it was the bars. and then we see everything around this social out-of-home occasion really shining and a lot of residual on the home really shining the out-of-home occasion. so, because of that, we see high end very strong with original, brahma that they are -- they were waiting for to come back, right? so -- and they suffered a lot and they came back. we've seen somehow be core in 600 ml bottles and liter bottles coming back that they were really growing more on the 300 ml bottle.
in the corporate strategy, it continues -- so bohemia, we kind of unplugged with market initiatives. we are really focusing on spaten and brahma duplo malte that segment. and if you see the combination of these two brands, spaten, it was designed more on the 600 ml bottles, brahma duplo malte more on the in-home occasion. if we get the two combined we are growing double-digits in this quarter, but with bohemia with negative volumes.
marcella recchia -- credit suisse -- analyst
excellent. thank you so much and congrats again.

the next question comes from isabella simonato with bank of america.
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. good morning jean, lucas. good morning everyone. just a follow-up, two questions is, first of all, a follow-up on the volume discussion in brazil.
it's interesting when you mentioned, right, based on the remarks, pretty much all the main segments, right, grew double-digits this year, while when we look at the printed volume, right, they're going to have -- looks below the average of those segments. so, if you just give a little bit more color per segment or what exactly brings the average a little bit down? i think that would be helpful. and the second question is when we think about the performance right over the first half, and you guys mentioned it has been a positive surprise. however, you didn't change guidance, right, or you -- i don't know if you think there is more room for positive surprise or if you guys are seeing a more challenging second half.
and if that's the case, what would be those challenging, right? it is in the international market, given what's going on in argentina, or a tough comp in brazil? so, just to get a little bit more color how you guys see in the second half. thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
let me get the first one and then lucas get the second one. but isabella, so volume-wise, we are very excited about. so, 8% volume -- it's a great volume in the quarter. but in the end to look quarter by quarter, sometimes, it's misleading because consumer is moving.
so -- and from one occasion to another. it was really -- if you look back to 2019, we are 20% above our volumes in 2019, ok? so, we've seen a structural brands in the high end doing well consistently in this period, and then we landed in above 20s in the high-end brands with like original and skol, brahma as i mentioned, really leading more than that. somehow, i mentioned that [inaudible] plus sparking, they are double-digits. the midstream is around that two, ok? so with low teens to what really went down, it was the value brand that we really unplugged, brands like [inaudible] brands that some regional brands that we have like [inaudible].
so they were brands that really took the heat overall. and -- but we see somehow core and core plus taking brand now in the same pace and then high end ahead of  of the portfolio. our specialty brands, they are doing very well, ok? so the craft are going doing very well to specialty. so this is one thing.
talking about the guidance, i will hand over to lucas, but just to mention, just to guarantee that he put the right words here on the call. but somehow, we are excited. we mentioned that q1, we had that strange january that as a one-off hit on -- with omicron in many markets. then we had this q2.
then when we look at h1, it's more something like what we was expecting in q1, if it was not omicron and it's a place that we are better than we were in q. and what i mentioned in my initial statement is that we believe that h2 will be strong -- we are confident that we will be better in top line and bottom line when we -- h2 when we compare with h1. so somehow, if you put the numbers, we are confident. but i will get to lucas as you look at kind of rounded up.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
sure. thank you, jean. hi, isabella. thanks for the question.
starting with the guidance. the guidance that we gave for the year was related to cash cogs per hectoliter in brazil beer, excluding non-marketplace products, right, ambev products, non- ambev marketplace products. and that was the guidance that we gave, right, in q4 when we announced the full year results and announced our expectations for the year. and that guidance stands year-to-date, the cash cost per hectoliter in brazil beer, excluding non- ambev marketplace products, is trending at 14.5%.
so below the range, which is good. but again, given that not 100% of our costs, right, are hedgeable, right? we still see merit in keeping the 16% to 19% outlook for the year, ok, as our official guidance. on top of that, when you think of our ambitions for the year, just to add on to what jean mentioned, when we look at our h1 performance, our view is that we come out of h1 more confident on our ability to deliver our ambition of growing ahead of 10.9% organically at a consolidated level, which is what we delivered in 2021. when we shared this ambition on one of our prior calls, i remember i got the question on why we believed, right, growing ahead of 10.9% was feasible.
and the answer then was that if we managed to deliver a brazil bottom-line coming back to growth that in and of itself, right, would be a significant tailwind in our ability to deliver this ambition. and if you look at our results in h1, right, there was a step-up in q2 in terms of our overall performance, and that made an enormous difference on our total ebitda growth for ambev in the first half, which is around 15%, i believe, 14%, 15%. so, within h1 at 15% and brazil, stronger than we expected, right, we think that if we manage to do a better job in cochin, canada and last continues to deliver good performance and mindful of the challenges in argentina. but outside of argentina, last in q2, the other countries bolivia, paraguay, chile, and uruguay, they grew double digits in q2, ok? just for instance, just another data point for you to have.
so, if we manage to have brazil continuing momentum in h2, last continuing to deliver that can be helpful in offsetting potential headwinds in a in cochin, canada. but again, we still have work to do there and we're still going to pursue better results in canada and in cac in h2, ok?
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
no, that is super clear. jean just one minor confirmation. when jean said second half could be better on topline and bottom-line than half one, is it nominal terms or growth, just to double check that?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
inorganic growth.
isabella simonato -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
inorganic growth. ok. perfect. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from lucas ferreira with j.p. morgan.
lucas ferreira -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, everybody. thanks for questions. the first one is regarding sg&a. if you can discussing the second half of how to think about sg&a, you have some important events ahead, such as the world cup, potentially provisioning for bottles, again, it's going to be a strong year.
so, how to think about that? there was already kind of heavy sg&a of this first half. so, should we see similar trends into the second half or that should see somewhat alleviated to help you deliver this growing expectations you're talking about? and the second question, lucas, last year, you guys had some issues with sort of an unhedged position because, i guess, the company ended up with selling much more beer than you expected, right? so, how to think about that this year? are you also probably performing a bit better than expected? are you guys having sort of unhedged positions to do as well? and would those come maybe now at a lower cost given the foreign commodity prices or you cannot say that yet? thank you.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
sure. lucas, thanks for the question. let me start with the second one on the hedges, ok? so, everything that's hedgeable for 2022 has been done, right and has been done for quite some time now. so, the issue is not around hedging per se, ok, looking into h2.
the issue is more on the unhedgeable side of our cost base. and you're right, that was an issue last year. there was an increase in the second half of the year on the unhedged portion of our costs. this year, there has been some impact not enough right to compromise, right, the guidance that we gave in brazil beer.
but that remains a risk for h2, and that's one of the reasons why, right, we're not updating  we're not making any changes to our guidance of 16% to 19% in brazil beer, as i mentioned, and in my prior answer, ok? so again, the issue is not the hedging side that's done for 2022. the issue is more on the unhedgeable portion of our cost. and again, we are living in higher inflationary environments overall that applies to cost that apply to expenses. and that's a good segue to try and answer your first question around the sg&a.
what we anticipated directionally for sg&a in 2022, was a lower growth of sg&a year-over-year as compared to, right, 2021 to 2022 and because of the lower accrual for variable compensation, right? as you will recall, lucas, last year, one of the main factors that led to a higher sg&a growth year-over-year versus 2020 was precisely the fact that the recovery was much stronger than we expected. and 2020 was no bonus year, right? so that created a double whammy effect, if you will, on the admin side through higher bonus accruals. that's not the case this year so far. obviously, h2 will depend on how we do versus our budget, and then we will accrue according, right? so with admin expenses growing at a lower rate because of lower year-over-year bonus accruals, that should help us, right, for the year, deliver a better sg&a growth.
and then on the sales and marketing side, i think the point to call out is really q4 and q3 as we prepare for the world cup, right? so there is sales and marketing investment for an event of that proportion, right? it's a great opportunity that we have coming up in q4 to really leverage not only our brand portfolio but also our technology platforms, right, to really meet the moment, serve clients better, serve consumers better during such an important event for markets like ours. so yes, there is a calendarization that's different than this year, because of the events that we have coming forward. and in terms of distribution, i think the watch out is really what happens to diesel, right? i mean diesel has been a factor on our distribution expenses, not only in q1 but also in q2, it was a factor. i think the glass half-full side of the equation in terms of sales and marketing and in terms of distribution is that year-to-date it's growing below net revenue growth, right? and i think that's good news.
that's something that we always do that sense check, and in addition to that, right, we're applying our typical financial discipline, making sure that we are as focused as possible on being strict on the non-working money side of our business, which is everything that consumers don't touch, feel, see to release funds to be able to invest more in things like sales and marketing that are going to continue to develop the health of our brands going forward. ok?
lucas ferreira -- j.p. morgan -- analyst

the next question comes from thiago bortoluci with goldman sachs.
thiago bortoluci -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. hi, jean and lucas, good morning everyone. thanks for taking the questions. i have two.
the first one, a follow-up on the cash from guidance. obviously, there are a lot of different moving parts here, and we understand that you have an average policy of hedging in part of our commodity needs on a pro forma, but you might also be kind of [inaudible] price as well. so i'm just curious to hear from you if we should see the impact from lower commodity prices just 12 months from now, or you could have decided to go for more to meet the dealer and you could see some part of business selection early on over the next quarter? this is the first question. and the second one is regarding the world cup and the outlook for the first quarter, right? obviously, that there are also a lot of different moving parts just in brazil, the election typically, we know that this event is very positive for volume, right? so just try to explain and hear a little bit from you, how much of an opportunity do you see for the first quarter and beyond that if you believe this volume should be really incremental as you head into 2023, or this might create an opportunity? thank you.
those are the questions. thanks guys.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
ok. thanks, thiago. this is lucas. let me take the first one, and i'll hand it over to jean to talk about the preparations for the world cup on the commercial side, ok? so in terms of the exposure to aluminum specifically, right? i think this is more of a 2023 issue than the 2022 issue.
and the good news is that, of course, it's still early to give any specific outlook for 2023. we still have a good portion of hedging to do right through the end of the year. but the good news is that so far aluminum is no longer a tailwind. it's no longer a headwind as it has been over the last two, three years.
on the currency side, the brl hedge versus the us dollar is also a tailwind for a change. it has been a headwind for the last two and three years as well. and so that's the good news so far, again, still a lot of hedging to do through the end of the year. and on the glass half empty side of the hedge for 2023, so far our hedges with respect to barley are continuing to be a headwind, but to a lower extent than the levels that we saw in 2022 and the argentinean peso fx hedges should continue to be a headwind, at least that's what we've seen so far this year.
so aluminum, more of a 2023 issue, and kind of that's where we are so far this year, let's see how things unfold on the hedging for commodities and fx through the remainder of the year. over to you, jean.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. so let me talk about the world cup here, right? so the question that we are for you to get the information yesterday, we had a world cup team, ok? so we put like 50 people in the room from inside the company, outside to have the best insights of what could do  could we do in this world cup, and we learned a lot yesterday. and the question that we did for ourselves, the statement so the briefing of the day is what can we do in this world cup that will make us better in 2023, ok? so that was the statement that we did to 50 people to outside to people from agencies, consultants and it was a day that we learned a lot and we went out with great plans on that opportunity to resolve problems to make this world cup more inclusive to make in the end the young people more interested, to make soccer something that can be enjoyed by women. so we are really thinking about how can we solve problems with our brands, with this world cup strengthening the brand.
we are connecting that delivery, how can we acquire users during the world cup that they will stay, how can we touch the hearts of the brazilian. the sentiment that we find with the survey's that everybody is waiting for this world cup as a breath. everybody knows that the next three, four months, it will be about quality organization looks like the world cup is a moment that brazil can come together again. so it will be a very important moment.
we are very intuit. we are prepared on the logistics side. we are prepared on the marketing side. we believe that we will -- it's the first time that we have world cup in the summer in this context after one year of pandemic.
and for sure, we will help us this year. the big question is what are the structural things with brands and digital products that we can do to get together with the brazilian and to make it residual for 2023. we are very excited about the world cup.
thiago bortoluci -- goldman sachs -- analyst

the next question comes from thiago duarte, btg pactual.
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
hello. thank you. hello, lucas and everybody. i have  three questions on from my side.
the first one it is clear at this point that you're positively surprised by the performance in brazil relative to when you provided the guidance or when you even said that the momentum was strong in the end of the first quarter. but it's not clear to me what exactly is the biggest source of surprise. is it -- so if i think, jean could comment a bit on that. so it is just demand -- the consumer demand or how strong consumers are going back to on-premise? is it the solution of high e-commerce, is it the cost side, which is on the favorable side in terms in terms of your guidance.
so you if can -- if you could elaborate a little bit more on what you are saying are the biggest sources of a positive surprise for the performance that the company had in the second quarter and in the first half of the year, that would be great. the second question is going back over the pricing in brazil business. jean, you mentioned a small price increase in the second quarter. if you could elaborate a little bit more when we look at the 11.2% revenue per hectoliter growth with beer excluding marketplace, how mix, in particularly, packaging with the incremental rgb is driving that now, that would be very helpful as well.
and a third question would be on working capital. it's not only on q2, but also in the entire first half, there was some -- second working capital consumption, which is not very common, considering that you guys are growing volumes and are easily gaining share. and i presume this is positive for the working capital of the company, as you guided before. so if you could elaborate a little bit on what's driving that working capital consumption ahead of the second half; that would be nice as well? thank you
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
i'll get the first and the second question. and then lucas jump in to the third one, ok. so what surprised us in brazil in q2, it was so -- the moving pieces we knew, ok, but surprises us that we continue to gain market share. ok? so sequentially, we gained the market share and the strength of the bars reopening, it was something that came on the top of our range of expectations, ok? so somehow, there was this discussion about when the consumer -- when the bars really fully reopen -- and it's not just the bars and the social out-of-home occasion gets a full potential.
so what's the size of it? and what's the residual volumes of the in-home initiatives and the occasion that it was created during the pandemic. and this mathematics surprised us. or at some point in time, we believe that in-home could go down more for their on-trade to go to be reopen or the on-trade was not that strong. so it was the combination of this equation, the residual of in-home with the strength of the out-of-home that surprised us.
and then 8.5% in terms of volumes, it was above this math. and talking about revenue management, you know that we are very granular now on the revenue management. you know that we have a strategy that we are -- have been very inclusive and really maintaining beer competitive in the basket of the brazilian consumers. and what we liked about this quarter is that it was really -- we really challenged the elasticity in general.
ok, it was like good net revenue per hectoliter actually with good volumes. and it was about the carryover of the previous year, the tactical things we did, as i mentioned, here in may. but a big part of it, it was the 600 ml bottles and the high end, the brand mix helping us in the value brands going down to. so the combination of brand mix and 600 ml bottles coming back that made this number that you see in our q2.
so working capital, lucas?
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
sure. hi charlie. thanks for the question. i think in terms of working capital, i would say that the bigger issue was actually q1 on the payable side, ok? i mean like if you recall our conversation last quarter, right, our payables in q1 have had an issue around the payment of the variable compensation, right? and also, there was a higher level of payments to suppliers, given the calendarization of our capex.
so capex that was booked, right, in h2 of 2020 ended up being paid in q1, right? so that double effect created a bigger gap in terms of working capital in q1. in terms of q2, and that's by far kind of the biggest factor year-to-date. i think q2, what the outlier here is more on the receivables side, and it relates to the tax credits that we recognize, unlike last year when we recognized the tax credits, but did not immediately monetize. this year, the monetization was faster than last year and that has an impact on our receivables.
in terms of inventories, no major change in terms of inventory building, there was some more inventory building in q2 this year than last year, but again, it's more of a calendarization effect. and then on the payables side, in q2 also no big major change other than just a different calendarization of our capex spend and when the payments are falling. so i think it's better to look at working capital more on a yearly view because on a quarterly view, you will have, from time to time, these swings related to specific events like the bonus, like calendarization of capex, like the tax credit.
thiago duarte -- btg pactual -- analyst
that's clear. thank you so much.

the next question comes from alan alanis with santander.
alan alanis -- banco santander -- analyst
hi everyone. thanks very much for taking my question. congrats on the results you have in [inaudible] has to do with the competitive dynamics and the connection between soft drink and beer. i mean, i understand we've been gaining market share on beer.
i think that there are reasons also among your competitors, the separation with institutions of heineken from the coca-cola system. and i think that  congratulations, you are doing a lot of things right in taking advantage of that in gaining market and value share. what's a bit of a surprise for me to see that you're also gaining a lot of market and value share in sales after the coca-cola company and [inaudible] what are you seeing and what are you doing differently in soft drink in order to be gaining market share and how sustainable is this going forward?
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
thank you, alan, for the question. in reality, soft drink was really big start of this quarter, right. it's -- we are very proud of the performance of soft drinks and somehow, i've been mentioning for a while now that we've been transforming ourselves into more of a platform in the past we were like a beverage company. now we are a platform.
so, this is something that people do not understand somehow, but we did a huge structural change inside the company in terms of breaking the silos in terms of having the marketing areas as a marketing-as-a-service; have my frontline team working for the whole portfolio in the past i have siloed teams. so, we did a big change to prepare the company to really unlock its potential of topline growth. on top of that, we focused our efforts on soft drinks, on brands of the future. so, somehow, the pepsico partnership is stronger than ever.
the launch of pepsi black, it was just a surprise for us how the product is getting into the face of the cities and the places that we are launching. and somehow -- so with this strategic view with a good partnership of pepsi and this arising where we had in the past a sales rep that somehow was a fun in terms of number of skus that they could offer. so, the combination of these three things maybe put nab on fire we estimate that we are gaining market share. so, pepsi brand, there is a whole ocean of colas that we never tackle reality as really accelerating and gaining market share.
and this is really allowing us to do much more things that we would do in the past. so it's important avenue of growth for us that we are really interested. so i think this is structural.
alan alanis -- banco santander -- analyst
got it. no, that is -- so you're pushing more toward the total beverage and you are deleveraging your real power, your scale here to move more soft drinks. thank you so much and again, congrats on your results.

the next question comes from carlos laboy with hsbc.
carlos laboy -- hsbc -- analyst
good afternoon everyone. jean, it's nice that the creative team is winning awards and i was thinking it's a landmark really, that you can celebrate your markers and they're growing importance. but can you speak to the proof point to evidence a lasting brand rehabilitation and renovation is happening. maybe you can expand on the brahma case or on any other incremental proof points that you have that your core brand build strategy and renovation strategy are working here.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you for the question, laboy. yes, so i could mention i think brahma is really one brand that is really on fire as a family with chopp brahma appearing a long time that we don't talk about it as the reference of beer in brazil when the reopening of bars like. so, on fire chopp brahma with the using brahma brand doing very well and brahma duplo malte coming in the middle of all this family making a stature of brand and family that it's really getting consumers.
if you add up, it's really the brand most valuable of brazil is really drama that has more lowers is really the overall brand brahma doing very well and it was not like that like two or three years ago, we rejuvenates brahma with brahma duplo malte, and we stepped up again, the quality use of the brand with chopp brahma coming back as it come in this stage in the q2. i think somehow, it's a combination of mind, mouth and hearts that we were able to tackle in the right way these three themes with the brahma brand, for example. another brand that is doing very well, so we are somehow biased this quarter that original just explode it to. it's a brand that is about the traditional routes of the brazilian about the bar.
so the bars were closed at the occasion. so everybody is coming to our original brand and pasco regional. so this is one thing another way that we can mention. and i'm very excited about bex, there is a brand that we are cooking in a very low temperature, like, i don't know how we say this in english, but we are cooking it slowly.
it's read about getting the pallets right in the edginess of the ruble centers. and it's on fire to us is the brand that everybody is talking about the edge of the palate, european, trendy, moving the boundaries. so we showed you that architecture of brands that we have in their archetypes. and somehow, i think that our focus brands are doing just amazing.
you've seen the numbers. our price, it was very resilient this quarter. this means that the channels are right, this mean that consumers are paying. and this is what a combination of renovation and innovation.
so i don't know, if i really answered your question, but the last thing that i could mention is that pre-pandemic levels in today levels, we have 1.5 million people that saying to us that that they love one of our brands. so pre-pandemic level to now 1.52 million consumers that elect one of our brands and their loved brand. so i think that's it.
carlos laboy -- hsbc -- analyst
thank you, jj. and cash cogs for hedge funds, but this brand renovation is the real lasting stuff on the turnaround. congratulations.

the next question comes from sergio matsumoto with citigroup.
sergio matsumoto -- citi -- analyst
yes, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. i wanted to circle back on the voice improvement of the new metric as discussed in the that  with the recent improvement in the top line, and the recent decreases in the spot prices of the commodities, i'm wondering if perhaps we can see some changes in how the composition of the return on investment capital might improve over the coming years with -- you had mentioned investment capital turnover as the first phase and then transitioning into more of a no path to margin improvement, would you say that the -- that transition might occur faster than expected when you than a few months ago?
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
yes. hi, sergio, thanks for the question. this is lucas speaking. sergio, in all honesty, i think it's very hard to right  it's very hard to speculate at this point to what extent, right, our longer-term perspective on the two drivers for improving our return on invested capital, right, could change in view of the latest, right, the latest movements in q2, right? and the reason i say that is, in q1, the picture was right strikingly different because commodities were on the rise in q1.
so to me, i would be speculating here if i gave you any indication of  of what change this can imply longer term. i think we have to really wait and see how commodities behave going forward, how currencies move going forward. i think what's important for us on the commodity side and on the currency side is the discipline that we have in following our hedging policy, right? that's key to give us predictability that's key to give us time to react as headwinds may arise. so that discipline remains intact, and we will continue to focus on that.
having said that, if we continue to deliver top line growth, right, as we have in the last two years, that's obviously helpful for the margin recovery. and so let's see how things progress on the top line side. but as we've mentioned time and time again, top line growth remains a priority for us. some quarters, some years, it may be more volume than price.
it may be the other way around, like we're seeing in 2022. but we remain kind of steadfast in continuing the momentum that we've built on the top line growth side. and on top of that, we have the better asset turnover potential given the platforms such as these with marketplace and d2c and fintech and as these scale up, we see opportunity to have a better asset turnover profile than in the past, but we have to deliver. let's see.
sergio matsumoto -- citi -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.

the next question comes from leandro fontanesi with bradesco bbi
leandro fontanesi -- bradesco bbi -- analyst
hi, everyone. one question or one discussion that we have with investors is regarding argentina, right? so recently, the depreciation of the argentinean peso at the blood market was much stronger relative to the official rate, right, than it was in previous quarters. and so there's a concern that the net income that you're generating in argentina you may have issues to take that money out of argentina and especially relative to what you report on your accounting numbers, right, they use the official rate. so to help us address or to help us understand the risk, if you could like provide us with some information such as what percentage of your total ebitda comes from argentina, also how you are addressing that risk going forward? and actually, i understand that you report how much you're having cash in argentina and cuba, which i think is like brl600 million, does not look relevant.
but it has been reducing in previous quarters that means you are burning cash in argentina, and then generating the majority of your cash outside of this operation. so to understand if you could potentially allocate some of their costs from other operations in that country in that way, you don't need to depend that much on taking the money out of the country? thanks.
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
yeah. hi, leandro, thanks for the question. this is luca speaking. regarding argentina, i think, first, there is a lot of short-term volatility in the country.
the good news is that on the operational side, the business continues to perform relatively well when you think of top line, when you think of the portfolio and the health of the portfolio and how that's translating into our performance, not only in core but in above core segments such as core plus and premium brands with good brand health indicators, market share in line with what we expect, so on and so forth. however, on the macro side, we are once again seeing more volatility coming out of argentina. that's a fact. the last time we faced something similar was 2019.
and there have been other instances in the past 10, 15 years where there have been years of more volatility and currency devaluation and so on and so forth. so i think for us here, the way we approach it is stay focused on the micro and the commercial performance because it's a sizable market. it's a growing market. it's a profitable market for us.
so that remains a priority number one. number two, protect what we can protect, what we control on the cost side. so that's where the hedging policy comes in. so we continue to adhere to our on average 12 months hedging for the argentinean peso and for the commodities, right, as they apply to the argentinian business, ok? and that helps us protect our costs in argentina, ok, and the ebitda performance in argentina.
we also look into -- we're constantly looking into right cash management, how we manage counterparty risk in argentina between local banks, international banks. and so there's a lot of tracking and monitoring of the situation on the ground to make sure that we're very disciplined and diligent in terms of our cash management, so the operation can keep running, right? we can continue to work with our clients, work with our suppliers. we want to keep things running in as seamless way as possible, ok? and then, on the taking money out of the country side, i think, the point here is more as -- is more of, there are -- right, there are restrictions in place, right, for operating in foreign exchange markets. our focus is more accessing foreign exchange markets in argentina to keep the operation running.
the level of imports is fairly low, but we want to make sure that we still have access to keep the operation running. so that's the bigger priority. and in terms of cash generation, historically, the cash generation is more -- in argentina is more skewed toward the second half year of the year than in the first half of the year. hope this helps.
leandro fontanesi -- bradesco bbi -- analyst
yes. thank you, lucas. the q&a session is over. i would like to turn the floor over to mr.

jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
so, thank you all. i thank, all analysts, everyone who joined today, the call time -- for your time and attention. to wrap up, i think, it was -- i like to look at better h1 than q2. i think it was a great h1 for ambev, for brazil, and we are confident that we can deliver an even stronger h2, ok? we remain on track in terms of our main ambitions for the year, to get brazil back to bottom line growth, to have consolidated ambev organic ebitda growth ahead of the organic growth that we had 2021 and improve our roic.
and we will continue vigilant on the short-term volatility and cost trend. thank you very much. see you in october and have a great day.

lucas lira, cfo and investor relations officer. as a reminder, a slide presentation is available for downloading on our website, ri.ambev.com.br, as well as through the webcast link of this call. we would like to inform you that this event is being recorded and all participants will be in a listen-only mode during the company's presentation. after ambev's remarks are completed, there will be a question-and-answer session.
at that time, further instructions will be given. [operator instructions] before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the safe harbor of the securities litigation reform act of 1996. forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of ambev's management and on information currently available to the company. they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions because they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.
investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other operating factors could also affect the future results of ambev and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. i would also like to remind everyone that, as usual, the percentage changes that we will be discussed during today's call are both organic and normalized in nature; and unless otherwise stated, percentage changes refer to comparison with first quarter 2022 results. normalized figures refers to performance measures before exceptional items which are either income or expenses that do not occur regularly as part of ambev's normal activities. as normalized figures are non-gaap measures, the company discloses the consolidated profits, eps, ebit, and ebitda on a fully reported basis in the earnings release.
now, i will turn the conference over to mr. jean jereissati, ceo for ambev. mr. jereissati, you may begin your conference.
jean jereissati -- chief executive officer
good morning and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining our earnings call for the second quarter of 2022. during our last call, i mentioned that we started 2022 well-positioned and that i came out of q1, encouraged with what we delivered. as i review q2 results, i see even more evidence to be confident going forward.
and here is why. this quarter provided a glimpse of consumption patterns in a post-covid world. in several of our markets, reopening continues well underway with services and on-premises businesses coming back. and as this takes place, we have once again been able to meet the moment.
ambev grew 6% in volumes, reaching 42 million hectoliters, which is 15% higher than 2019 levels. it is the first time we reached more than 40 million hectoliters in the second quarter. this led to a net revenue growth of almost 20%. in addition, organic ebitda and cash flow grew over 17% compared to the same period of last year.
so, let's talk about brazil. in brazil, we witnessed more clearly the consumer comeback journey to the entrée and overall out-of-home occasions, leading to another quarter of solid topline performance. in beer, we estimate we gained market share versus last year, and sequentially versus q1 this year in both volumes and value. volumes grew by 8.5% in the quarter and by 5.2% in the first half.
to-date, we grew 2.2 million hectoliters, leading the industry expansion as we estimate that the industry grew almost 0.5 million hectoliters. in terms of segments, premium grew more than 20% led by original and chopp brahma, which are more relevant in their own tray channel. in fact, this quarter, chopp brahma achieved its highest volume in the second quarter with 40% more buyers than the pre-pandemic levels. while our corporate volume sustained its momentum, increasing volumes, low-teens, and we continue to invest behind developing our core plus brands, brahma duplo malte and spaten.
net revenue grew 23%, with net revenue per hectoliter growing about 13%. and finally, ebitda in brazil beer grew 27.5% organically, with margins expanding by 80 bps. talking about nabs in brazil, we delivered another great performance this quarter. volumes grew 16%, driven by healthy brands, especially in the out-of-home occasions supported by bees.
we estimate we gained market share again this quarter. in csd, pepsi brands grew more than 20%, driven by the great success of pepsi black, which almost doubled its weight within our pepsi brand. net revenue per hectoliter grew 22%, driven by revenue management initiatives, the premium mix and package mix as single-serve packaging grew 37% this quarter. ebitda grew organically 92%, expanding margins versus last year by 500 bps.
regarding our technology platforms, over 86% of our revenues are coming through bees. on the marketplace, in june, we announced a partnership with grupo pao de acucar, who will offer a vast range of products on our platform via a 3p model, just like brs, delivering an even better assortment and service level for our clients. ze delivery fulfilled 15 million orders, 2% below the previous year, mostly impacted by the rise of out-of-home occasions. gmv grew by 7% compared with last year, and we kept a four million month active users in the delivery.
we continue to invest behind adding more features to our app and delivering a better user experience to our consumers. and bees bank grew tpv quarter over quarter by almost 40% and now reaches about 300,000 customers. turning to our international operations. in las, overall volumes grew by 1.5%, led by bolivia, which benefited by the reopening.
in argentina, we remain cautious about the impact of rising inflation on consumption, despite flattish overall volumes in the quarter. in chile and paraguay, premium and core plus continued to gain weight among our brands. las, net revenue per hectoliter grew 38%. in cac, overall glass supply constraints remained, coupled with a tougher short-term competitive environment in panama, this all contributed to a 10% decline in volumes and a flattish net revenue in cac.
talking about canada, despite the reopening that took place, industry is still sluggish. we estimate that beyond beer industry declined by almost 9% in the quarter. talking about beer, we estimate to have gained market share led by core and value brands. now i would like to talk about brand building.
during our investor day, we explained our framework based on three pillars; mind, mouth and heart. and this is a quarter to be proud of, of how much we have evolved in the last few years in brand building. this evolution is no longer going unnoticed. last year, we were awarded seven prizes in cannes festival of creativity and this year, 12.
ambev was the most awarded brazilian company in the festival with lions for all of our beverages categories, brahma and budweiser were awarded in beer, guarana in ads and mind in beyond beer. talking about our framework, starting with mind, we strongly believe that being creative is the best way to not only capture consumers' attention but also engage with them in a meaningful way. brahma brought home its first-ever golden lion and seven lions in total, which is an absolute record. it was the most awarded brands in the world in the social media category with our foamy haircut campaign.
the results of all this creative effort helps brahma continued growth in brand health kpis. now moving to mouth. key recent innovations continue to grow as we keep launching products to delight all brazilian tastes. our most recent project is brahma duplo malte escura, or brahma duplo malte black, a special limited edition, which is brewed with two types of malte to create a darker and even creamier beer.
we continue to collect awards for our innovations. in june, we were listed one of the 20 most innovative companies in brazil by the mit technology review, a study that evaluated innovation capabilities in more than 1,000 companies in the country. finally, going to our third pillar, the heart. here it's all about being relevant in consumers' lives and connecting through their passion points.
after the two years gap due to covid-19, our brands continue to be a fantastic platform for cheering together. brahma helped to bring back some of the festivities in the northeast of brazil, one of the largest and most traditional celebrations in the country. budweiser presented the nba house 2022, a space where more than 40,000 people had the opportunity to watch the season playoffs and beck's created the urbeck's festival. on urban music and our circuit that helped to awaken different areas in the main urban centers of brazil.
we will keep consistently focusing on mind, mouth and heart to make sure we are relevant, innovative and loved by our consumers, which will make stronger brands in the long term and help our organic growth trajectory. to conclude, our performance in q2 accelerated in brazil even more than we expected more than offsetting some headwinds we had in our international operations. it was a great h1, and we will work to deliver an even stronger h2 in terms of both top and bottom line despite facing a tough comp in brazil beer volumes in the third quarter and the continued volatility and inflationary pressures. we are not making any changes to our guidance for the year relating to brazil beer cash cogs per hectoliter growth between 16% and 18% and excluding the sale of non-ambev marketplace products.
moreover, we remain on track in terms of our main ambitions for the year. that is to get brazil back to bottom line growth, to have a consolidated non-ambev organic ebitda growth ahead of the organic growth that we had in 2021 and to improve our return over invested capital. lastly, i would like once again to thank the entire team for the ownership mindset in delivering results and transforming the company and a special shout out to the marketing team. congratulations for the amazing performance at cannes.
thank you for your time. and now i will hand over back to lucas. 
lucas lira -- chief financial officer and investor relations officer
thank you, jean, and hello, everyone. our financial performance in q2 was fairly consistent with the first quarter in terms of what should be the same and what should change in 2022. what would not change, first, top line growth remains key. we delivered nearly 20% net revenue growth overall, with brazil once again being the main highlight.
second, input cost pressure remains a sticking point. cash cogs per hectoliter grew nearly 18% at the consolidated level, while for beer brazil, it grew almost 14%, excluding non-ambev marketplace products. and third, we would continue to focus on value creation drivers. the name of the game here continues to be improving our return on invested capital, building on our progress in 2021.
and in terms of what would change, first, net revenue performance more driven by net revenue per hectoliter than volumes as we adapt to a higher inflationary environment. net revenue per hectoliter grew almost 13% and volumes grew around 6% in the quarter. second, cost headwinds would come mostly from commodity inflation rather than fx. commodity inflation was more explained by the increase in brazil beer cash cogs per hectoliter driven mostly by aluminum and barley, which was partially offset by better rgb mix.
third, sg&a growth should improve. cash sg&a grew about 15% in the quarter with sales and marketing growing almost 22%, thanks to continued investment behind our brands and innovation, distribution growing 18%, mainly due to rising diesel prices and admin expenses growing just around 2%, given lower variable compensation accrual once again. and fourth, tax credit one-offs in brazil that positively impacted our ebitda, financial results and effective tax rate in q2 of last year would be a factor this quarter. and it was a factor, but for a different reason than we originally anticipated.
we recognized in the quarter about $1.2 billion in tax credits, of which a little over 900 million in other operating income and approximately 300 million in our financial results. this gain also relates to the inclusion of the icms state tax in the taxable basis of the pis and cofins federal taxes, which was declared unconstitutional. as i have mentioned in prior calls, there is still pending litigation in this matter. and during the quarter, we concluded together with counsel and external advisors, both the legal viability assessment as well as the quantification of this additional portion of tax credits for the pis and cofins that we overpaid over the years.
as a reminder, these tax credits are technically part of our normalized results from an accounting standpoint, but we disregard them for purposes of calculating our organic performance, treating them as a scope change. please refer to our financial statements for further details. now, given our performance in the quarter, we are well on track to deliver a better organic ebitda growth in 2022 than the 10.9% organic growth we delivered in 2021. brazil's recovery this year is turning out to be stronger than expected, which is more than offsetting the declines in cac and canada year-to-date.
as for last, year-to-date, argentina is delivering ebitda growth slightly ahead of local inflation, while the other last countries delivered ebitda growth in h1, driven mainly by bolivia, which is finally recovering from covid. and putting this quarter's performance into perspective, since q3 2020, we've managed to deliver net revenue growth above 13% and quarter after quarter, and this was true again in q2. so the growth is there, despite all the headwinds we faced. and the good news is that in q2, we finally managed to deliver growth and profitability in brazil, which had been lagging for a while.
brazil beer expanded ebitda margins by 80 bps on while brazil nab expanded ebitda margin by 500 basis points. no doubt, there is still work to do on the gross margin side and in terms of consistency, but it's a start. speaking of profitability, as i've mentioned in prior calls, we've also looked at profitability in terms of working to consistently improve returns on invested capital year-after-year. and here, we're also happy with the progress we've made so far this year.
as first, we continue to look at ways to optimize our business through financial discipline on the cost and expense side, as well as improved resource allocation across our businesses and markets; and second, improved return on invested capital as we look to digitize and monetize our assets. here, the scale-up of the technology platforms such as bees and ze delivery are helping us improve not only nopat growth, nopat margin, but also asset turnover. it's still relatively early days for these platforms, so we definitely see more upside going forward. now let's turn to our cash flow and our financial performance below ebitda, and i will close with some words on esg.
cash flow from operating activities totaled about $2.2 billion in the quarter, which represents an increase of about 17%. normalized profit grew a little over 4% in the quarter given ebitda growth and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher net finance expenses versus q2 2021 of around brl200 million. net finance expenses were mainly impacted by the continued increase in the carry costs associated with our fx and commodity hedges in brazil and argentina, which should continue to be an issue going forward. our interest expense grew mainly due to fair value adjustments of payables under ifrs 13, but it was fully offset by higher interest income resulting from the brazilian tax credits we recorded in the quarter.
before i wrap up, i want to briefly highlight our progress in terms of some important sustainability milestones. on the environmental side, we announced three more carbon neutral plants in brazil; arosuco aromas in the state of amazonas; juatuba in the state of minas gerais; and curitiba in the state of parana. together, they represent an emission reduction of over 5,000 tons of greenhouse gases per year and we intend to deliver an additional four carbon-neutral operations by year end. and on the social side, our people that volunteer within the voa social transformation program have recently joined gerando falcoes, a brazilian ngo of social development in an initiative to mentor social leaders of brazilian favelas that are graduating at the ngos falcons university.
we plan to hold our esg date during q3, and we hope you can engage with us in this dialogue. so to wrap up, a few final messages. first, we delivered a stronger h1 than we expected, which gives us more confidence going into h2, particularly in brazil. second, our guard remains high since challenges and short-term volatility remain a reality, particularly in countries like argentina, panama and chile.
and third, we remain focused on delivering continuous and consistent improvement in our results as we progress on ambev's transformation journey. now let me turn it back to the operator so we can go to q&a.
