[operator instructions] our first question comes from brian johnson with barclays. your line is open.
jason stuhldreher -- barclays -- analyst
hi team, this is jason stuhldreher on for brian. i appreciate the color today. i wanted to just first start on the q4 outlook and specifically on the production side of things. i think some other suppliers are taking a more conservative stance around q4. it looks like the production assumptions you lined out are more or less in line with third-party estimates. and so i was wondering if you could just comment on your level of confidence around those q4 numbers. are the schedules you're seeing in the first month here kind of validating those q4 forecasts that others are putting out?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll start out, and i'll let jeff provide additional comments. to answer your question directly, yes, the schedules that we have in front of us are pretty consistent with what we are anticipating in q4. as everyone understands inventory levels for our customers are down, they're trying to replenish the dealers right now. there is a strong desire for our customers to run at peak output, particularly in our key models. and certainly, we value the mix that we have. i would say the only note of caution that i would have is, as we mentioned in our formal remarks, there's still some volatility, if you will, in the volume in that from time to time, our customers are experiencing directly, indirectly covid-related disruptions in the supply chain, not caused by adient but caused by other suppliers. so that's a potential risk that's out there. certainly, demand is not the risk that we see.
jason stuhldreher -- barclays -- analyst
understood. okay. and then second question, maybe a little more medium-term focused. as we look at the operational improvements that you've been able to do year-to-date, if i recall, coming into the year, you're looking at maybe around $200 million or so of performance improvements in 2020, and then you were actually ahead of that in q1 before the shutdown started happening in china. and i guess, as we look at what you've done year-to-date, it looks to be more in like the $300 million range of performance at the plat and program level. and so just kind of curious here, as we look over the next several quarters or even a year or so, at what point do the comps start to become more difficult to extract performance? and i guess i'm wondering, has the covid issue, has that allowed you to bring forward some of these performance initiatives? and i guess, just how much more runway is there as we look over the next four to five quarters?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
i'd kind of break the question into two pieces. certainly, a lot of the performance improvements we expected were in the, i'll say, commercial and operational improvement of the existing business. there was another element, as we improve launch performance, which we have, that would continue to improve our overall performance. the other element that we touched on is ultimately exiting business that was not performing up to our level of, i'll say, tolerance and then bringing on new business that would bring that next wave of operational improvement. so i think there's ample opportunity for us to continue to go down that path. i think covid kind of suspending that for a period of time as we focused on liquidity. we've taken new actions that we have to put into the equation with anticipated a down market that probably wasn't originally envisioned when we started to articulate a turnaround plan. with regard to, is the environment right, i would say the environment is certainly right for our customers to look at cost reductions. if you just look at it from their perspective, they still are making huge investments, particularly in electrification.
that was a daunting task. they still have the risk of fines in europe if they don't meet environmental standards. that was a daunting task before covid. so covid in a down market hasn't improved that environment. i know, in fact, in talking with them, it's only increased their appetite to find ways to reduce costs. and when they want to find ways to reduce costs, that creates an opportunity for us. so i'm cautiously optimistic we can continue on our path and maybe even find, as we've mentioned in previous calls, incremental opportunity as customers maybe look to hold on the platform longer, delay launches or engineering and capital investment in program replenishment.
jason stuhldreher -- barclays -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from john murphy with bank of america. your line is open.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, guys. doug, maybe if i could just follow up on that last question and sort of your discussion there. i mean as you look at this, obviously, as you're going through a rationalization of the business, this kind of disruption is can delay things. i'm just curious, in the context of what you're doing right now, are there any net new cost saves or business processes that going forward as the world normalizes might benefit you above and beyond what you were trying to execute before?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
so first of all, john, i would say, kind of to the point i was trying to make before, maybe i can reemphasize it. prior to covid, i think business was somewhat as normal. and our customers were focused on new launch. they, i think, weren't particularly interested in cost reduction initiatives. some were, some historically always have been, others were, i'll say, perhaps distracted. i think what covid did was create an inflection point for them to recalibrate. and when they recalibrated against a down market for the foreseeable coming years, i think they recognized that they really needed to intensify their efforts there.
fortunately for us, and we've spent probably the last nine to 12 months anticipating that, certainly not envisioning what covid might. but to my earlier point that there was going to be a real need for them due to their investments in, whether it was electrification or autonomous vehicles or meeting environmental standards, that maybe they didn't completely appreciate. and i think covid's been a catalyst for them to say, ""look, we really need to reach out."" and this isn't just speculation on my part, this is direct conversations with our customers. i wouldn't say every single customer has come to that conclusion.
but i think what we found is we've exposed them to the work that we're doing in that area, and it's some pretty impressive work. i mean to say it's va/ve is just a complete understatement. it's what we call it only because we haven't come up with a better name. but it's really focused on this concept of return on capital investment, how to get scale with a customer without putting in brand-new investment, how to do that quickly. there's a tremendous amount of technology on the shelf right now in the area seating that does not need to be reinvented that can be applied to more than meet or exceed consumer expectations. and it's really directing the customer to say, ""look, you should come and take a look at this on your next-generation program."" we've talked a little bit about one program we did that with one customer that just launched an electric vehicle, was going to introduce a next generation of an existing platform that's historically been internal combustion.
and we said, ""why don't you just take this new architecture and seating systems that you're just launching on electric vehicle and apply it to this next-generation product."" and in theory, theoretically, that requires 0 engineering work on your part, 0 capital investment on our part or minimal of us as we just leverage incremental volume off that and arguably minimal capital investment. that's becoming a much more appealing story to our customers, and i would expect that's going to continue.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then just a second question on the mix benefit in the quarter. and jeff, on slide 14, you went through the walk, and volume and mix was a headwind of $438 million on ebitda. i'm just curious, if you were to split that between volume and mix, i mean, how much of a benefit was mix in the quarter? and how sustainable do you at least see that in the near-term schedules are expected to be over time?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. good question, john. the i would say the most of what you're seeing there is just pure volume impact. mix wasn't a huge portion of that $438 million. as it relates to the mix for our fourth quarter, it's probably a little bit down just given the or unfavorable for us just given the launch of the f-150 and how production will go on that. but i'd say for the quarter, i'd take that $438 million as base. for the vast majority for your modeling purposes, i'd call it volume.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then if you could just, i don't know, illustrate or elucidate where you think 2021 will land in the context of you talking about trying to get to breakeven free cash flow in fy 2021? what is sort of the thought process or the business environment that you're fighting to get to that level in?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i'd say that there's a lot of components to that and some of them are still being worked as we complete our 2021 plan, john. but as we look through a couple of dynamics here, we've taken a big chunk out of our cost structure with the activities as we've decentralized the company. and those benefits, some have hit this year, but we'll have a full year run rate in 2021. that's going to be a big piece. i think there's going to be opportunities on capex where we won't be spending at the historical levels. the ss&m business, that's becoming a the improvement level in that business is significant. with a business that had cost us on a simplified free cash flow to, call it, $450 million in 2018-2019 time frame, it's probably half of that, a little bit, give or take, this year. and we'll end next year close to breakeven or we expect it to be really breakeven by the end. those are going to be big components of the free cash flow story for us next year. but there's some more work to do for us. it's also the continuation of the improvements that you've seen, doug talked about.
we're seeing, i'd say, from a program perspective, as i sit through, especially big program reviews, the team, not only they commanded of the data better, the all of it's coming through with better return profiles than what we're seeing in a lot of these key programs. so those are all key components, but i'd say we're pretty optimistic about it. the big challenge for us next year, quite frankly, is going to be europe in general. there is depending on where the market turns up for next year. we talked about it. doug talked about it a little bit earlier. but the european market is expected to be down. to restructure to take out cost in europe is expensive. and so i would expect that in dealing with next year, we are going to have some elevated restructuring costs in europe.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
great. and just one last housekeeping. what's minimum liquidity and cash that you're looking for, jeff?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i'd say we like to see cash, give or take, around the $500 million to $600 million mark. and we're going to have, in a healthy time period, around $1 billion on the abl, and we would expect that to be undrawn. so give or take, $1.5 million or so on a normalized basis. and we expect quite a bit over that as we end the year with the transactions, the working capital swing back and just the abl kind of rebuilding the asset base, primarily from accounts receivable.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, john.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from rod lache with wolfe research. your line is open.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning, everybody. i wanted to ask just two questions. one is trying to think about what your q4 guidance implies for prospective ebitda run rate. so ex equity income, if you use the midpoint, your guidance is about $135 million or $540 million annualized. can you just remind us, what is the seasonality of that? are there settlements that typically come in, in your september quarter? maybe some rough estimate of what the f-150 impact is. and as we extrapolate and think about next year, the $75 million to $100 million of savings, is that a net number? or should we think about nonrecurrence of some of the austerity measures this year maybe subtracting from that?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i guess i'll work backwards a bit, rod. but the $75 million to $100 million is a net number. you can we expected that's not necessarily from our q4 cost base, although there'll be incrementals to that, too. but from pre-covid level cost base, we see that as that's what we've been targeting to take out of the business. some of those costs are going to take the time period for europe, which is going to be a significant portion of those cost reductions, just with the environment on doing restructuring in europe, takes some time to enact. so i would expect a lot of those savings won't start to run rate until second or third fiscal quarter for us next year. some have already started to occur, though, today, so it's a bit of a mix. as it relates to the fourth quarter, it is a this is a pretty uncertain time, i'll be honest, and we opted to put guidance in here.
and as we look to 2021, i would say you can't necessarily use our q4 as a guide post for it. the f-150 is a big impact for us in the quarter. we do expect production essentially to switch over in september, and that's going to bring down the old line. and as we start the new with launch cost and have essentially dwindling production on the old, all that will have a big impact on sales and profitability in our q4. so i'd say more to come, rod. we'll give you more color on our on our fiscal 2021 plan on our next earnings call. but i would just say the fourth quarter is probably going to be an under guide for you on doing the math.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. is there a seasonality to settlements or something like that, that we need to keep in mind or no?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'd say most of them sort of happen through the year. but if there's a seasonal point to it, it tends to be in our first quarter, the calendar year-end quarter.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. and then lastly, the $50 million to $60 million equity income in q4, you said that, that excludes yfai. just given that china has recovered quite a bit more, is that a reasonable run rate or something we can extrapolate from? how should we be thinking about the drivers for next year? and is your payout math changing? it looks like this year, you're getting more than the typical 70% or 80% from that market.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. there's a lot of pieces to that question, i suppose. but the payout math was higher this year. if you recall, we were also doing the transaction with yfai and the change in aym and the sales on the ip. we were able to extract a higher dividend, in particular, out of that metals venture, the aym venture. so our payout ratio is significantly higher in 2020 than i would expect necessarily going forward that we've experienced going forward or in the past. so that was a positive for us this year that we were able to pull ahead. as it relates to the i guess, china market, we continue to do well. i'd say the this past quarter turned out to be better than expected as covid rebound was strong.
we anticipate that this quarter will be positive as well. let's see where the run rate actually comes out for q4. but i would say we do have some seasonality in that business from earnings. they tend to have a pretty strong fiscal q1 in general. our first calendar or our first quarter of our fiscal year, the last quarter of the calendar year tends to be a little strong. so you can't necessarily annualize one quarter there.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, rob.

thank you. our next question comes from james picariello with keybanc capital markets. your line is open.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, james.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
so on the timing of the $700 million wind down in unprofitable sales, is that over the next 12 to 24 months? and is there any material air pocket we should be considering with respect to the replacement of that unprofitable mix with new programs and conquest ones that you called out?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i mean, i guess the one thing i would point out, james, is the $700 million that we're going essentially doug talked about, that we're giving up is business where we have a negative on in total, a slightly negative ros on. so from an air pocket standpoint, when it goes out, there's not really a it's not like it's just lower profitability, it's actually slightly negative. so getting that business out will be an improvement to our overall ebitda, not just our margin. as it relates to the new business coming on, it does launch over it's not at one point. there are several programs that are involved. but i would imagine you should model out this all takes place over the next two to three years.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yes. with no my interpretation of air pocket is no major void in that time frame, unless something rolls out. it's pretty blended over that time frame.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then maybe just a flavor on an ss&m update. tying back to the $700 million that you're winding down or exiting, is there what portion of that attributes to ss&m? is that business still on track to exit that targeted, whatever, $400 million in tier two business over the next 2.5 years? or are you seeing more profitable replacement activity still within ss&m? is that trending maybe better than expected in terms of the renegotiations and new contract wins?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yes. again, maybe i'll try this backwards, and obviously, jeff can chime in. so as jeff mentioned, the business is improving. that is a combination of commercial settlements that essentially are now behind us, other than normal course issues that arise across that business versus this backlog of unresolved pricing that we had. i think where we've seen improvement is in faster-than-expected operational improvement, particularly in europe, but also in north america. so that business is aligned with our original formal statements about that getting to cash flow neutral in the on a run rate, at least, in the '22 time frame. when it comes to loss and replacement, there are metal and mechanism business that are part of the loss, but there's also new business coming on in that area in metals and mechs as well.
that one has always been for us a customer-related issue. and what we've been moving away from is trying to win metal and mechanism business under these mega programs that are going to go across a number of platforms, a number of regions with a single customer, some of which would be sold to our competitors versus programs where we have an element of vertical integration. and some of our customers still source complete seats and allows us the opportunity to make or buy on the metal and mech. so it's that is easy to talk about it in terms of just product segments. but i would say there's nothing significant in what we're talking about right now that is deviating from our original plan.
we still plan to scale that business down over time. revenues may come down a little bit quicker on it as a result of post-covid volume assumptions versus what we originally had planned. that talks to some of the restructuring activity that we're going to take in that segment. so i think that's covering most of the question. i don't know if there might be a piece i might have left out. certainly, left...
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's very helpful. thanks guys.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. the amanda.

our last question comes from joe spak with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
joe spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks for squeezing me in here. and jeff, maybe if we back out sort of what you identified as the covid cost from this quarter and last quarter, right, you have the adjusted ebitda down slightly and then the guidance is down slightly again, and i understand there's some maybe unique stuff in the fourth quarter. but can you just help us understand that in the context of sort of the underlying turnaround program? because at least between the march and june quarter, it seems like you are, with that covid adjustment, adjusting for the volume differential.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
not sure i totally follow your question. but yes, i would say we are adjusting for the volume differential. and most of the covid impact we're really talking about here of 400 approximately $400 million in the quarter, $500 million year-to-date is due to significantly lower volume and the pull-through expected that would have been expected from that volume. but help me if i think i missed the nuance.
joe spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes. i guess, like if we just back out the $100 million for the march quarter and the $400 from the june quarter, then ebitda is still down sequentially, i guess. so what's and i thought there was there's some more underlying traction. so maybe it's some difficulty in sort of separating what you guys are sort of doing underlying from the volume. but i'm curious as to the explanation for why the sort of sequential drop off.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so ok. the i think it's primarily going to be sales, joe. so at the end of the day, if you're pulling some more high teens on the revenue, i believe you get you had the $400 million. but there this is also sort of a weird quarter in the sense that it wasn't all just volume, and it's hard to totally articulate what the cost of covid impact is. we had the plant, especially at the beginning that would run for a little bit. there'd be maybe a covid case, we'd shut down the plant, we'd clean it, we'd go through the process. we ran things inefficiently in this particular quarter. but i think when you cut through all of that, we are seeing we continue to see positive improvement from the operations. there's a lot of noise that's around covid. and as you have, i'd say, the abrupt stop and kind of a really spotty restart, especially at the beginning, i think it created a lot of inefficiencies that ran through the numbers that are difficult to quantify and talk about. but maybe it's what it's impacting the analysis you're doing here.
joe spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just real quick, the actions on slide 10. can you just can you give us some insight into some of the industry planning that went into that? because you talked about sort of your customers are planning for lower volumes. and are these actions that are aligned to that or actions that, to be frank, probably could have been done anyway?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
maybe i'll start on the top on the above plant part, and doug can jump in on some of the stuff we've been doing more in the operations. but i'd say the above plant stuff, we took a very a significant chunk out of corporate. and i'd say this has been the path we were on. we just used covid as an opportunity to accelerate a lot of the actions. but we've been on a process here the last couple of years since doug is going to decentralize the company and put more power in the region, which has served us well. i've also served us well in managing covid, as a side point. but in taking those moves, we did amp up the speed of them. and then i don't know if doug you want to cut through the plant...
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i would i mean, to answer your question, i would say it is if you carve out the actions that we're taking in europe and set that aside, that is primarily volume-related. and then you look at everything else discussed on the page, you can argue some of it is independent of covid. this is just us being much more operationally focused, looking for opportunities to consolidate facilities, a lot of what we're trying to communicate there, and it's just a partial list is this whole concept of asset utilization and simple things that we point to about flexing our manufacturing cells in the case of weld cells.
so that as we bring new programs and we're not reinvesting, we're looking at ways to flex lines. that is something that we greatly improved upon over the last few years. and i think there's still more opportunity there, i would say, that's independent of covid. that's just the right thing for us to be doing to be more efficient manufacturer. this covid act as a catalyst for us to dig deeper. absolutely. so there is an indirect relationship there. so hopefully, that provides a little bit more color to your question.
mark oswald -- vice president-investor relations and corporate communications
thanks, joe. amanda, it looks like we're at the bottom of the hour. so this will conclude the call for today. i know there was a couple of questions that we did not get to. please feel free to reach out to myself. i'm available for follow-up questions. and again, thank you very much for participating in the call this morning.

welcome to adient's third quarter financial results call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to mark oswald. thank you. you may begin.
mark oswald -- vice president-investor relations and corporate communications
thank you, amanda. good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review adient's results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. the press release and presentation slides for our call today have been posted to the investors section of our website at adient.com. this morning, i'm joined by doug del grosso, adient's president and chief executive officer; and jeff stafeil, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. on today's call, doug will provide an update on the business, followed by jeff, who will review our q3 results and outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. after our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. before i turn the call over to doug and jeff, there are a few items i'd like to cover. first, today's conference call will include forward-looking statements.
these statements are based on the environment as we see it today and therefore, involve risks and uncertainties. i would caution you that our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. please refer to slide two of our presentation for our complete safe harbor statement. in addition to the financial results presented on a gaap basis, we will be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures to the closest gaap equivalent can be found in the appendix of our full earnings release. this concludes my comments.
i'll now turn the call over to doug. doug?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mark. good morning. thanks to our investors, prospective investors and analysts joining the call this morning, spending time with us as we review our third quarter results. i hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy in these difficult times. turning to slide four. let me begin with a few comments related to our turnaround plan. first off, the team remains laser-focused on the plant while navigating through the global pandemic. we continue to implement actions to ensure the plan progresses in a positive direction. when looking at our results, you'll see operational improvements are driving down waste inefficiencies. the financial slides within jeff's section illustrates how our improved business performance partially offset the significant covid bid headwinds. the team is exercising commercial discipline, resulting in new business wins with a higher return on capital versus outgoing programs. i'll expand on this point in a few minutes.
our launch performance continues to make significant strides with and extremely important as we head into critical launch quarter. we're proactively executing measures to take out structural costs to ensure the cost base is aligned with our expected smaller industry. and finally, we're moving closer to closing the two previously announced strategic transactions. the approximate $500 million of our cash proceeds will strengthen our balance sheet and help drive our total liquidity position higher exiting fiscal 2020. essentially, we have our hands on the wheel and continue to drive initiatives that are within our control. that said, turning to slide five, our third quarter results were significantly impacted by covid, where you saw industry production essentially at 0 across europe and americas in april and slowly resumed operations in may and june. we've highlighted a few of adient's headline financials since adient's financial performance is highly dependent and correlated to vehicle production.
our results mirrored the overall industry, essentially 0 sales in april, with steadily improvement into may and june. sales at $1.6 billion were down about $2.6 billion or 60% on a year-over-year basis. i mentioned sales were essentially 0 in april. the exit rate for the quarter was about 75%, the pre-covid levels for both emea and the americas. adjusted ebitda was a loss of $122 million, driven by the significant reduction in sales. we estimated the impact of covid around $400 million for the quarter. the team did a very good job flexing costs, unfortunately, the capital intensity of our business makes it difficult to offset fixed costs in the environment we were managing through. as production ramped up throughout the quarter, our earnings and margins progressed in a positive direction. with regard to cash, we ended the quarter with just over $1 billion of cash on hand and $1.2 billion of total liquidity. important to note, cash was significantly impacted by approximately $500 million temporary level trade working capital headwinds resulting from the restart of our operations across europe and the americas.
we expect that a majority of these headwinds will reverse as we move through q4. as far as the $1.2 billion of liquidity, we expect that we will be at a quarterly low point. in fact, total liquidity is expected to exceed $2 billion by the end of september, before factoring any potential debt repayment as a combination of additional jv dividends, proceeds from our previously announced strategic transactions and the reversal of working capital headwinds mentioned earlier will help drive adient's total liquidity higher. one other point worth calling out. the value of adient's strategic joint venture network was highlighted in q3 as the company collected approximately $240 million in cash dividends in the quarter. year-to-date, the jv has contributed around $250 million with an additional $30 million expected in q4. turning to slide six. let me spend a few minutes discussing the current state of adient's operation and restart status, first in the apac region. in china, the market continues to provide encouraging data points. adient's china operations have returned to pre-covid levels, in fact, more than 50% of our plants are running two shifts. china auto sales year-over-year volume continues to grow and improve sequentially.
adient's performance has outpaced the market, driven by our favorable customer and platform exposure as premium oems and japanese oems have performed extremely well during 2020. outside of china, certain asian countries are showing early signs of market recovery. we expect that trend to continue in the coming months. in europe, the market is recovering, but at a slower pace compared to recoveries in china and the americas. potentially all of adient's operations have really started with the exception of the small jit facility in the u.k. operations revamp. production. adient sales improved month-over-month in q3, essentially 0 in april to about 75% of pre-covid levels in the quarter. based on current customer release schedules, we expect that rate to continue to improve as we move throughout the fourth quarter. important to note, given production has not fully returned to pre-covid levels, adient continues to flex cost structure utilizing furloughs and short-time work as appropriate. we recognize the benefits associated with these programs will lessen over time and have taken proactive measures to address our structural costs in the region.
more on that in a minute. in the america, all of the adient's and jv plants have restarted production, similar to europe. adient sales have improved sequentially as q3 progressed and exited the quarter at about 75% of pre-covid levels. customer releases for trucks and suvs are running extremely strong. in some instances, production for certain platforms have returned to pre-covid levels. while this is an encouraging sign, we remain cautious as rising covid levels in southern u.s. and mexico and restrictive rules in the chihuahua region in mexico at risk to the production environment. turning to slide seven and shifting gears. let me address a common question related to new and existing business awards that continue to bubble up when meeting with our investor base. specifically, are we losing business to our competitors? simple answer, our focus on capital allocation and return on capital is driving profitable business awards, both new and incumbent business. we've studied and reviewed adient's profitability by customer, by platform, by plant, basically slicing and dicing the data.
what's clear is that certain businesses and platforms have consistently failed to earn an appropriate return. the team is focused on ensuring an adequate return is realized over the platform life is a key driver in determining which platforms we keep and which platforms we're comfortable walking away from. over the past 12 months, we've successfully replaced approximately $700 million in consolidated revenue incumbent business with a negative return profile with new business awards, including conquest business with significantly better returns. you can see a few examples on the right-hand side of the slide. in addition, our solid execution and value-add initiatives are driving additional opportunities to quote and win profitable new business. we're excited about adient's book of business that we'll be launching in the coming years. it's an important component of enhancing our margin profile. speaking of launches, and turning to slide eight, we've highlighted several critical launches, including the ford f-150, adient's second largest platform by revenue. over the past several quarters, launch management has been a specific focus area, helping to drive adient's improved operational and financial results.
adhering to a robust process around change management, enhanced readiness and program reviews and early escalation of potential issues made a significant impact. over the past several quarters, we've called out several platforms, including the cadillac ct5, chevy onix, toyota corolla, nissan leaf, for achieving flawless launch scores, which we define as 0, 0, 100, 100, 90, which breaks down to 0 safety incidents, 0 customer rejects, 100% on-time delivery, 100% achievement of financial targets, within 90 days from the start of production. we're not here to declare victory today, rather, we mention these examples as evidence of the team's hard work and preparedness for the upcoming launches. turning to slides nine and 10. let me conclude my comments with an update and the actions that are being taken to execute and position adient for long-term success. as we discussed in our q2 earnings and in subsequent investor meetings, adient took quick and decisive actions to help mitigate the impact of steep production declines experienced across europe and the americas as a result of the pandemic.
many of these actions, such as furloughing our direct and indirect employees at the plant, enacting salary reductions and salary deferrals above plant, suspending 401k, just to name a few, were temporary in nature. as adient operations restarted and production increased in q3, the benefits associated with these measures were reversed. addressing the company's cost base with structural, more permanent measures is essential as we look to create stronger, more profitable business, especially given adient's expectation of a smaller industry next year versus fiscal year 2019 and the company's extreme focus on capital allocation and return on capital. the rightsizing actions identified and are being executed include the above measures above plant measures within our operations. the goal is simple, reduce adient's breakeven point, be free cash flow breakeven or better in fiscal year 2021, even though vehicle production is forecasted to be below pre-covid levels. we have a lot of work ahead of us to achieve that target, but we're well on our way.
and in fact, we've identified and are in the process of executing cost reductions between $75 million and $100 million versus 2019 in our central functions and regions. slide 10, we've provided a few examples of these actions that have been announced. i won't read through the actions. but as you can see, the measures are far reaching, impacting above plants and joint venture operations. certain of the actions identified can be executed rather quickly, such as force reductions that impacted our americas regions and central functions in late may or actions implemented in asia earlier this year. other measures have a much longer lead time, such as significant reduction in personnel planned in europe. as noted in the middle of the slide, in july, we began negotiations with the works council in germany to execute force reductions impacting approximately 500 engineering and above plant personnel. the reductions are estimated to result in annual labor savings of about $40 million. it's important to note, a portion of the saving relates to flexing of the cost baselines, in other words, the prevention in margin degradation.
given certain of the actions will be implemented in fiscal 2021, we only achieve a partial benefit next year. full run rate savings are expected for fiscal year '22. given the size and magnitude of the measures being implemented, we do expect to have an elevated level of restructuring costs running through our financials in the coming quarters. the team is currently finalizing our fiscal 2021 plan. once completed, we'll be able to provide you an estimate of the size and timing of the charges and the cash outlays associated with these measures. in the end, significantly lower cost base, combined with continued operational improvement and a strengthening platform portfolio is expected to result in a stronger, more profitable business, essentially further positioning adient for long-term success.
with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff, so he can take us through adient's financial performance for the quarter.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, doug. good morning, everyone. and doug, i echo your earlier comments and hope everyone is safe and well. starting on slide 12 and adhering to our typical format, the page is formatted with our reported results on the left and our adjusted results on the right side of the page. we will focus our commentary on the adjusted results, which excludes special items that we view as either onetime in nature or otherwise skew important trends in the underlying performance. for the quarter, the biggest drivers of the difference between our reported and our adjusted results relate to restructuring costs, asset impairments and purchase accounting amortization. details of these adjustments are in the appendix of the presentation. sales were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down about 60% year-over-year, which, as doug noted, was driven by production stoppages at our customers across europe and the americas. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was a loss of $122 million. by applying our projected margin on lost sales and netted netting out our various short-term austerity actions, we estimate that covid cost us approximately $400 million in the quarter.
however, and as we'll discuss more in a moment, adient's operations across europe and america continued to experience improved business performance. with regard to equity income, q3 fiscal 2019 included $15 million of income related to our interiors business that is no longer part of our consolidation today. therefore, on an apples-to-apples comparison, adient's seating equity income was up $8 million or 15% year-over-year, a very good performance as a result of our china operations continuing to capitalize in the improving china markets. finally, adjusted net income and eps were down significantly year-over-year, a loss of $261 million and $2.78 per share, respectively. i'll also point out that our tax expense of $14 million in the quarter contributed to our net loss. for those of you wondering why adient did not recognize the tax benefit in the current quarter associated with their losses, if you recall, during 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, adient recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of many entities located in significant jurisdictions in which it operates, including the united states, germany, mexico, the united kingdom, among others.
no tax benefits are recognized for losses by entities with valuation allowances, and therefore, tax benefits were not recognized during q3 by many entities that incurred losses. one last comment on taxes. similar to q2 of this year, adient's third quarter effective tax rate was based on an actual tax rate calculation versus an estimated annual effective tax rate calculation. the continued use of this methodology was necessary due to the uncertainty of the pandemic. now let's break down our third quarter results in more detail, starting with revenue on slide 13. we reported consolidated sales of $1.6 billion, a year a decrease of almost $2.6 billion compared to the same period a year ago. lower volume across north america, europe and asia was the primary driver of the year-over-year decrease, again, attributed to lost production volume associated with the pandemic.
in addition, negative impact of currency movements between the two periods impacted the quarter by roughly $100 million. the biggest driver included the brazilian real, the czech koruna and the euro. worth noting on the call out box on the right, consolidated sales in both europe and americas were down substantially at the beginning of the quarter, almost 100% for the americas in april. both markets improved month-on-month as the quarter progressed, exiting the quarter at between 75% to 80% of pre-covid levels. in china, adient sales were strong exiting the quarter, driven by our favorable customer and platform mix. for markets outside of china and asia, sales began to improve as production volumes returned, but were materially impacted by the pandemic, similar to what we saw in america and europe. for each of the markets, adient's sales were in line or better compared to production within the markets. with regard to adient's unconsolidated seating revenue, year-over-year results were relatively flat. however, as you peel back the onion, the results varied significantly between unconsolidated sales in china versus unconsolidated sales outside of china.
in china, driven primarily through our strategic jv network, sales were up 14% year-over-year, excluding fx. the sales performance versus the market is attributable to adient's strong mix of business, specifically our exposure to luxury and japanese oems. outside of china, adient has a variety of unconsolidated jvs. these operations were impacted by the same production stoppages that affected adient consolidated results. on average, the unconsolidated sales of these jvs were down approximately 60% plus in the most recent quarter. we are encouraged we were encouraged with the sales trend. it's that's positively progressing, again, similar to what we're seeing with our consolidated sales. moving to slide 14. we've provided a bridge of adjusted ebitda to show our performance of our segments between periods. the bucket labeled corporate represents central costs that are not allocated back to the operation, such as executive office, communications, corporate finance, legal and marketing. big picture, adjusted ebitda was a loss of $122 million in the quarter versus $205 million last year.
the impact of significantly lower volumes across americas, europe and asia was the primary driver of the steep year-over-year decline. in addition, and to a much lesser extent, the planned divestiture of yfai also had a negative impact on the year-over-year comparison as we stopped recording its income last december. since adient's financial performance is highly dependent on and correlated to vehicle production, adjusted ebitda showed steady improvement month-on-month as we moved through the third quarter. in fact, after a horrible april and start to may, our june adjusted ebitda results were about equal to june 2019 despite sales being down approximately 25% year-over-year. speaking of monthly results, just one more data point. excluding in april and may, adient's margins have improved year-over-year every month through september 2019. back on the quarter, and as doug alluded to earlier, partially offsetting the significant volume reduction was improved business performance and lower sg&a costs. labor and overhead performance, a reduction in sg&a costs, lower ops waste launch and tooling costs were the primary drivers.
the approximate $45 million reduction in sg&a costs were primarily concentrated between emea and americas and included increased efficiencies and positive benefits associated with the deconsolidation of adient aerospace and the divestiture of recaro. but it's also important to point out, a portion of the improvement, call it, about $20 million, related to temporary benefits associated with employee compensation that are not likely to repeat next year. this temporary benefit was included in the net covid impact of approximately $400 million. business improvement, combined with labor and overhead efficiencies and lower sg&a, helped to contain our decremental margins to the mid-teens, call it, 16%, even as certain of the temporary cost reductions began to reverse. for example, the benefit associated with furloughing our direct and indirect plant personnel. this outcome was in line with internal expectations. and if you recall, we mentioned on the q2 earnings call, the 13% decremental margin experienced in the second quarter would trend higher as adient's operations restarted but would be contained below the 18% decrementals we typically expect.
to ensure enough time is allocated to the q&a portion of the call, we've provided our detailed segment performance slides in the appendix of the presentation. improved business performance and lower sg&a costs, partially offset by the impact of lower volumes more than offset by the impact of lower volumes is the primary takeaway from the americas and emea region. in asia, a $15 million improvement in our seating equity income offset the yfai equity income from last year, but overall performance was driven by lower volumes and earnings outside of china. let me now shift to our cash, liquidity and capital structure on slides 15 and 16. for the quarter, adjusted free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capex, was an outflow of $528 million. there were several factors that had a significant impact in the quarter's cash compared to our q2 ending balance. excluding adient's abl, these factors included, at a high level, lost production. given sales were down roughly 60%, covid essentially cost us about two months of production in the quarter.
we stated heading into the quarter, every month of shutdown cost us approximately $175 million of cash. therefore, loss production resulted in a burn of roughly $350 million, again, at a very high level. also a temporary net trade working capital headwind of approximately $530 million heavily impacted q3. this working capital outcome was expected with the sudden shutdown and subsequent restart of our operations. q3 working capital headwind is expected to unwind in q4 and benefit the quarter by approximately $400 million as noted on the right-hand side of the page. for full transparency, i'd also remind everyone in our that in our second quarter, working capital provided an approximate $100 million benefit to cash flow when production immediately ceased, reinforcing adient's working capital movements tend to smooth out over a period of time. moving on. partially offsetting the approximate $880 million of headwinds just mentioned was just over $240 million of dividends received from our china jvs in the quarter. this, of course, was a very good outcome and highlights the value of our strategic joint venture network.
in fact, for the full year, the dividends expected from china will be $70 million to $80 million higher versus our earlier estimates. in addition to the china dividends, a handful of other positive benefits aided the quarter, such as deferring certain tax payments and vat-related items, call those benefits around $70 million. although executing these actions throughout the year enhanced our liquidity and helped us weather the storm, these $70 million of deferrals will need to be paid next year. at the very bottom of the page, you can see we ended the quarter at about $1.2 billion of total liquidity, which included our cash on hand of $1.32 billion, plus $155 million drawn of undrawn capacity under our revolving line of credit. looking forward, we believe q3 represented our quarterly low point of liquidity and would expect liquidity to exceed $2 billion by the end of september before factoring in any potential debt repayment. key drivers would include cash proceeds expected from previously announced transactions, call it, $500 million; additional china jv dividend of about $30 million; the reversal of temporary working capital headwinds; and increased capacity under our revolver.
on slide 16, in addition to showing our debt and net debt position, which totaled $4.5 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, at june 30, we've also provided a snapshot of adient's capital structure. just a few comments here. we believe this capital structure not only provides flexibility to weather the storm, it provides flexibility to pay down debt after we cycle past the crisis. subsequent to the quarter close, adient proactively repaid $179 million drawn previously drawn on the revolver. i'd also note that capacity under the revolver is based on a one-month lag such that q3 availability was based on may ar and inventory balances. updating the ar and inventory balances to the end of june increased our revolver availability to approximately $650 million in july or a bit more than $300 million that reported at the end of q3. improving adient's cash generation remains a top priority. as doug pointed out, the actions adient has taken and plans to take are designed to improve our earnings and cash flow to be profitable in a smaller sales environment. once the crisis is in the rearview mirror, we'd look to pay down various excess debt obligations.
over time, post crisis, we'd expect to have 0 outstanding balance in the revolver and run with a cash balance somewhere in the $500 million to $600 million range. finally, a few closing remarks on slide 17. first, we expect the global economic impact of covid-19 will continue to influence the auto industry and adient for quite some time. that said, we're encouraged by the green shoots that emerged as we progressed through q3. building on the positive trend in vehicle production established in our third quarter, adient expects vehicle production across europe and america to continue to improve sequentially in the coming months. since adient's financial results are highly dependent on and correlated to vehicle production and based on the environment today, we expect adient's sales, earnings and margin performance will also trend higher in the coming months. specifically, we expect q4 sales to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion. although this implies a 13% decline versus q4 last year, at the midpoint, it's important to remember our sales in north america will be impacted by the launch of the f-150.
adjusted ebitda for q4 is expected to range between $180 million and $200 million. at the midpoint, this would be down versus last year's q4, but significantly less down than would otherwise be implied by the expected decline in volume. just to comment on our full year adjusted ebitda, which is not shown, but i'm assuming you'll do the math, it would settle in around $580 million range at the midpoint of q4's guide. and as you know, it includes an approximate $500 million impact from covid. i know many of you will be tempted to take the $1.08 billion and use that as your starting point for fiscal 2021, unfortunately, it's not that simple. the biggest factor being production volumes, which, heading into our fiscal 2021, are very uncertain. more likely than not, we expect volumes to be lower than our covid-adjusted numbers for 2019. in addition, our portfolio moves, such as the sale of recaro and the expected sale of fabrics and yfai, will impact the year-over-year walk into 2021.
the team is presently finalizing our fiscal 2021 plan, which we plan to share with you later this calendar year. moving on and back to q4. within adjusted ebitda, equity income will settle in the $50 million to $60 million range, in line with last year after backing out yfai equity income of $14 million. based on our customer launch plans, we expect capex to be about $100 million. and finally, for free cash flow, we'd expect q4 to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million.
with that, let's move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. operator, we'll have our first question.
",2020-Q3,ADNT
0.9992,,,,":
operator
all right. our first question comes from john murphy. your line is open.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, guys and thanks for taking the question. a number of questions real quick. on evs, obviously, it sounds like tesla is insourcing their seating. just curious is there anything else that you think could shift as the market heads toward ev's or is this a net neutral ultimately to you? i mean, how do you think about that?
doug del grosso -- president & chief executive officer
i think tesla insourcing in the u.s. is unique to them. it's a decision they made. it was a make-buy decision. we still maintain a fair amount of content and in fact that's been problematic for them. we've continued that production for an extended period of time as they've looked to make their move. in contrast, in china, it's not the approach they've taken. they recently awarded us the model y, it's been an extremely successful launch.
and in europe it's too early to comment on what their strategy is there. we are picking up a significant amount of content on the product in europe. don't really see that being a trend anywhere else. i think one comment i would make on the transition to alternative propulsion system is many of our customers, as you know, john, are really relooking at their product plans and the cadence of launches and it's going to be interesting to see how fast they accelerate that conversion. i think it is happening quicker than what we anticipated.
but from a seating perspective, we've always said, we're somewhat agnostic. a seat that goes into an ev or hybrid vehicle is essentially the same, there is some minor technical differences, but essentially the same. so long-term, we don't really see it as being an impact on us though we're -- we pay a little bit closer attention as that conversion happens to make sure we're on the right platforms.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and interestingly, the second question, jeff, you kind of alluded to sort of risk of supply shortages or disruptions as a result of covid, obviously, this is an impossible situation for any of us to call exactly. but is there anything that you're seeing at the moment, maybe in mexico or eastern europe or china where you're actually seeing sort of flashing yellow or red signs in the supply chain?
doug del grosso -- president & chief executive officer
yeah john. this is doug, i'll take the question to start out with and then jeff can comment. so, relative to the supply chain, when covid first hit, we put in, like many others, a dedicated group that tracks all of our supplier activity on a daily basis. and we look at a number of indicators where problems can arise. we try to be a little bit proactive, we don't wait for something to happen then put a contingency plan in place.
and the factors include we look at what the financial stability was of any high-risk supplier that we had, where they're operating, is there a regional risk from covid, we track covid infection rates and government lockdown activities to see what we could expect. but as you would imagine, there is a number of yellow and red areas. mexico has been an area of concern as covid impacted that region particularly along the border and more us. i think the other element that we have is we're working extremely close with our customers to mitigate those risks. and so far we've been extremely successful.
and in europe as governments have taken lockdown actions and infection rates have come down, we feel a bit more confident that the supply chains are protected. but, quite frankly, it's a daily battle. and what i think is good about what we're doing is we've committed dedicated resources. it's not a purchasing activity with us. it's a business activity, so that activity includes our operations and then working very closely together.
we take steps, in the case of mexico, to mitigate the risk by moving production to less infected regions and co-ordinate that with our customer to protect the supply line. so that's just something that's now become normal course of business, i expect that it will be around for a while, so we continue to double down on our efforts there.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got you. and then, just lastly, with the cash flow being flat to $100 million in the fiscal year '21. i mean when you look at slide 19, i'm just curious what opportunities you are -- you think there are to rework the balance sheet maybe even a little bit more and what you'll be going after, i mean obviously the four and the 2026s [phonetic] are something you were looking at. but just curious is that what you just keep going after and hammering or are there other opportunities to potentially refi and swap out that. i'm just curious what you think about there, jeff?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, john, it's a great question, it's one we're managing pretty closely, obviously. we talk about somewhere between $500 million and $600 million of cash would be a more normalized number for us. so we -- even though we don't have a ton of free cash flow generation estimated in our 2021 outlook, we have a lot of cash in our books today. so opportunity to go after some of this is there -- primary focus is to delever, waiting to have a little bit more sunlight from where covid is heading and where the environment is heading before we probably move too aggressively in that regard.
but i know the term loan is an opportunity for us, those secured notes do have a call feature in year-and-a-half from now, but they're expensive relative to some of the other paper we have. you mentioned the sub debt. so kind of a mix of it. we continue to look and we continue to look at the trading of it. but, again, kind of waiting to have a little bit more clarity from a covid standpoint before we start to address it in a meaningful way, but we definitely have capacity to do a fairly big step of it we believe in 2021.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so that $500 million of cash target, i mean, it gives you a little over $1 billion. i mean the timeline on that is just basically post-covid when things settle down, it's not an actual calendar target, it's an event or situational target, is that it...
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
we would have done it now, yeah, no, sorry to interrupt, we would have done it now had it not been for covid and the clarity on it. so we'll continue to monitor that, but do expect us to make some moves there in 2021. we certainly would expect to make moves that in that $1 billion type of -- up to $1 billion or so in the not too distant future, once we have some clarity on covid.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, thanks, john.
doug del grosso -- president & chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from rod lache with wolfe research. your line is open.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning, everybody. had a couple of housekeeping questions. first, number one, did the seat structures & mechanisms business reach ebitda breakeven in the fourth quarter? number two, can you kind of fill us in on the expectation for prospective restructuring savings from what you're spending here. and then third, if you could size up the -- presumably there is some headwind in your fiscal fourth quarter, first -- fiscal first quarter from the f-series and ram launches?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, let me start on the ss&m question, rod. we were ebitda breakeven or better than ebitda breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2020. we were actually pretty close to free cash flow breakeven in the business, i would say close to it, as we look into 2021, as we mentioned, we do -- it is fairly seasonal, but we do see ourselves getting to free cash flow breakeven in that business, but we had a good q4 in it.
i'm sorry, your second question was...
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
restructuring savings that you're expecting.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
oh, restructuring. yeah, it's a bit of a mixed bag, rod, some of it is -- has really attractive payback where we've, we'll say like a year and a half or so to two years on a lot of it. some of it doesn't have as much payback to some of the business we see as permanently, well at least for the next several years being down. but i'd say on -- about half to two-thirds of it has a strong payback against it in that probably 1.5 to two-year type of payback, the rest is just covering for short on sales.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
and then the f-series and ram headwinds that you're anticipating?
doug del grosso -- president & chief executive officer
we're not, i think we were a little bit specific on the ram truck that it was down significantly as they start building the classic that's restarted. f-series launch has gone as planned, so it's very much consistent with ihs forecast. and so as we exit the first quarter, we think we'll be close to running at full rate on f-series, but nothing significant outside of what either ford or ihs have spoke to on f-series.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then, as we look out to 2021, your decremental margins have actually been -- on volume, have been quite good and that isn't relatively low? can you give us some color on incremental margins? and i noticed that the $800 million of consolidated ebitda guide for 2021 is pretty consistent with where you're annualizing in the fiscal fourth quarter.
you did say that there is $5 million to $10 million of temporary benefit, so that obviously wouldn't recur and you mentioned some extraordinarily good mix. are those the primary reasons why you wouldn't expect improvement from that run rate, because presumably you're getting some further upside from ss&m and the restructuring savings into next year, your revenue is pretty similar, maybe a little bit up as you look out to 2021 versus the run rate in the fourth quarter?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, there is a lot of moving pieces around it. we've seen commodity cost jump up a bit on us, rod, which we've seen, i mentioned it for both steel and foam chemicals. they both jumped quite a bit. we do have recovery mechanisms with our customers on those, but there is a lag and in some cases, it's not full. but that's one of the pieces that sort of impacts us a bit.
doug mentioned some of the supply chain challenges and just operational challenges we have in this environment as well. we have to do a few more extraordinary events from sometimes moving production around, sometimes operating in less than an optimal way and with sometimes more absenteeism than we would certainly experience in a normal timeframe. all of it makes it a little bit more choppy from an operational perspective.
but you're right, we've generally performed better on the decremental side, we've generally outperformed there and the incrementals we try to build into the guidance here, but we build those incrementals with a little bit of caution around a couple of things i mentioned, namely, commodity cost in just some of the production side of things. and we do have a few more launches in 2021 than we had in '20 as well.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. but your incrementals -- you're expecting in the 15% to 20% range similar to what you're seeing on the decremental side?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, i think that's probably a good blending average. should be a little bit higher than what we lost on the decremental side.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
great, thank you.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, rod.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from james picariello with keybanc. your line is open.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. firstly, it's a great color in the guidance framework, just as we -- as we think about the cadence for fiscal '21, you've laid out expectations for global production to be down in the second half. that makes sense. some clear puts and takes with respect to net backlog impacts. more broadly, is there a first half versus second half range you could provide in terms of what the split could look like for adient's revenue and ebitda?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
it's hard to -- i would say that's hard to tell in some fashion. i would say q1, we would expect to be on the high side. i think our q1 is probably pretty strong. as we look out, it becomes a little murkier and -- but q2 you know has -- our fiscal q2 has the chinese lunar new year, which generally will bring equity income down as production is lower. so, in general, i'd say first quarter i think should be strong, but as you mentioned, the back half of the year will be -- we expect to be weaker right now with the current expectations.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
okay, got it. and then just for equity income, china production will still be up for fiscal '21. adient's revenue, i presume, unconsolidated revenue should also be higher. why should equity income trend flat year-over-year? i know you mentioned the negative impact of commodity prices, but i mean it just seems as though that that might not be the only headwind kind of factored into that guidance? can you provide any color there? thanks.
doug del grosso -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, so it's a good question. i mentioned in the call that we do expect our q1 equity income this quarter to be strong. we would -- it's typically pretty strong. we do see as china was shut down and has recovered better than the rest of the world from covid, we saw production spike up in our fiscal q3 a bit and then our fiscal q4 and we've seen that they're finishing the year, we'd say, strong.
as we look into next year, it's going to obviously depend on what their market does and sort of their ability to continue to produce at this rate, but current expectation is we'd expect sales to be a big part of it, we think sales in the first -- our first quarter are going to be quite a bit higher than where we're seeing q2 through q4.
and then we mentioned chemical prices and steel prices we think are both going to be a headwind in that region as well. so it's -- but it's primarily going to be driven by sales at this point and we don't see sales being that much different between '20 and '21.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
got it. thanks.
doug del grosso -- president & chief executive officer
yeah.
operator
our next question comes from brian johnson of barclays. your line is open.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. i know you put the regional profitability in the back, but want to drill in a bit on that. so two questions around emea and asia pacific. so emea, you've got back to a 6%-ish margin, pre-covid you're at 4%. and two questions around europe then, kind of is this 6% something to think about going forward? and second is the restructuring cash expense which you noted was 2 times higher in '21, primarily devoted to restructuring europe? and if so, can we expect further ebitda margin improvements from those restructuring efforts?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good questions. europe is the primary location where those restructuring dollars are going. as you know, it's more expensive and more challenging to restructuring europe than other parts of the globe in today's environment and that's reflected in our numbers. so i'd say the vast majority of what you're seeing in restructuring is earmarked for emea.
as it relates to margins, we do see continued opportunity to increase over the 6%. we've obviously had good improvement, that's been driven by a number of things. we mentioned the ss&m business continuing to perform better that's driving up margin, but number of things we're doing on their foam and trim as well as the jit side is driving that.
we would see opportunities to continue to go up. i think we'll have to probably leave it to say we expect it to go up, but kind of come back to you with where it can get to as we move a bit further. but the overall objective for the company, brian, as you know is to close the margin gap we have with some of our peers and europe is going to be a big piece of the story on that.
doug del grosso -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, maybe just a couple other points on emea. when we look at the year-over-year performance, i think in addition to jeff's comments, we've resolved some long-standing commercial issues that improved profitability. and when you look at year-over-year, the number of launches, and we expect that to continue as we move into '21.
they had a heavy launch cadence in '19 and into '20 that was a bit of a drag in contrast to the americas, which has got the heavy launch this coming year or '21 this year. they've got a lighter load. so we look at that level of performance as being sustainable. and then the restructuring just helps us on the overhead cost side of it.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
and secondly, asia pacific ex-china also 6% margins, is that about where we should expect it to stay or since that area had a significant volume headwind as -- can we expect typical incrementals to help boost that in '21?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, there is a lot of -- asia is a really interesting one for -- when you follow us. it's hard to predict because the margins are pretty different by country. but i would say key regions for us -- well, the key region for us there is really thailand. and thailand sales, the export sales have been down out of thailand, which hurts us and overall hurts our mix and thus our margin in the region and that's a bit of what you're seeing between from the reduction from fiscal '19, the heavy reduction across the whole region.
as you look forward, we do see some recovery. we continue to see, i'd say, better management within each region of all those things we can control. some programs will roll off in the coming years that weren't great for us that the replacement vehicles look to be quite better. so i'd say we have opportunity there, but it's going to be heavily dependent on the mix with those exporting countries thailand, japan, korea, having those export volumes go back up to where they were pre-covid will drive a lot of that margin opportunity for us in the region.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
and final question just broader margins, you mentioned, of course, closing the gap to your large competitor. you divested fabrics. i assume there were probably good reasons for that, but in discussions with the other company it appears that fabrics and leather are very high margin businesses that get them to that 7%-ish, 8% despite the lower margins on just-in-time seating just in time seating.
so i think two questions, one i guess fabrics wasn't that for you or you wouldn't have divest that? and two, with that us then just getting back to cash flow breakeven, where are the higher margin opportunities to get you to peer margins?
doug del grosso -- president & chief executive officer
sure. i'll start and jeff can comment. so for us, i would agree the jit business, albeit low margin is a great cash generator, so -- and a relatively low capex when you look across our network of plants, so we like that business. trim, cut and sew trim has historically been very strong, as well as foam. the perfect blend for us is when we have that vertical integration level, so we have complete seat and we have a lot of content that includes ss&m business that performs better. one, it's vertically integrated into a complete seat than when we're trying to sell it across a broader spectrum of customers.
the fabric business for us is, it's not bad business. we just didn't see it adding a lot of synergy to complete seat. it's sourced separate. it's sold across a number of different customers. you can't vertically integrate it. and to us, it's a market share volume business and we had a choice. either we increased market share, we are well positioned in europe, in the u.s. or we look to exit for us at the multiple we exited, we felt that was a better decision.
with regard to leather, i would say, yes, historically true. leather has been a good-margin business. we get the benefit of cutting leather high, it's not tanning them when we have the cut and sew business. so that's opportunistic for us. the only caution i would have on leather would be, if you look at the world going in green initiatives and you take a look at what volvo and what's happening in electric vehicles, you can make a pretty strong argument that leather content per vehicle is going to go down in the near-term.
i don't think there's a lot of people who want to have leather seats in electric vehicle. so i think we approach expanding into that -- agreed, historically, good margins. and on a go-forward basis, i think it's something that take a look at, if there is an opportunity we might pursue it, but right now it's not high on our radar.
mark oswald -- vice president, investor relations & corporate communications
all right. thanks, brian. jacqueline, it looks like we're at the bottom of the hour. so, i'll ask that we move to wrap up the call at this point.

operator
welcome, and thank you for standing by. [operator instructions] i would also like to inform all parties that today's conference is being recorded. if you do you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
i would now like to go ahead and turn today's call over to mr. mark oswald. sir, you may begin.
mark oswald -- vice president, investor relations & corporate communications
thank you, jacqueline. good morning and thank you for joining us as we review adient's results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020. the press release and presentation slides for our call today have been posted to the investor section of our website at adient.com.
this morning, i'm joined by doug del grosso, adient's president and chief executive officer and jeff stafeil, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. on today's call doug will provide an update on the business, followed by jeff, who will review our fourth quarter and full-year financial results. in addition, jeff will provide our outlook for fiscal '21. after our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions.
before i turn the call over to doug and jeff, there are a few items i'd like to cover. first, today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. these statements are based on the environment as we see it today and therefore involve risks and uncertainties. i would caution you that our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements made on the call. please refer to slide 2 of the presentation for our complete safe harbor statement.
in addition to the financial results presented on a gaap basis, we will be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures to the closest gaap equivalent can be found in the appendix of our full earnings release.
this concludes my comments, i'll now turn the call over to doug. doug?
doug del grosso -- president & chief executive officer
okay. thanks, mark. good morning. thanks to our investors, prospective investors and analysts joining the call this morning as we review our fourth quarter results and outlook for fiscal 2021. i hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy in these difficult times.
turning to slide 4, let me begin with a few comments related to fourth quarter, specifically adient's strong finish to a challenging fiscal year. remaining focused on our priorities, combined with increasing vehicle production continued to drive improved business performance in the most recent.
q4's adjusted ebitda of $287 million was up $72 million or 33% year-on-year, no doubt a strong result, but even more impressive when you consider adient's consolidated revenue was down about 8% in that same period. lower year-on-year global vehicle production and adient specific launches were primary drivers of the lower sales.
on the far right hand side of the slide, you can see our cash and liquidity. we're extremely strong at september 30th. total liquidity of about $2.5 billion made up of cash on hand of approximately $1.7 million and approximately $800 million of undrawn revolver capacity. as noted and included in our cash on hand is the approximate $500 million of cash proceeds collected during the quarter from closing on our previously announced strategic actions.
with our operations restarted, vehicle production is trending higher and proceeds from our previously announced strategic actions in the bank, the team began to voluntarily pay down a portion of the company's outstanding debt. just over at $103 million in principal of adient's 10 year 4.875% senior unsecured notes were repurchased using just under $100 million of cash. again, a strong financial finish to the year, jeff will provide additional details on adient's q4 and full-year's financial performance in just a few minutes.
turning to slide 5, focused and resilient are the two words that come to mind when describing adient in fiscal 2020. those traits were instrumental in enabling the company to deliver on its 2020 commitments. as the year began, the team was focused on advancing the company's turnaround plan, launch management, operational improvement, continued cost reduction and commercial discipline were cited as key enablers underpinning the expected improvement in adient's business performance.
with our operations and financial results steadily improving, the team pivoted and began to execute on a number of strategic actions, including the closure of our transactions with our joint venture partner yanfeng, sale of our fabrics business and the sale of recaro's automotive seating. in addition to these portfolio adjustments, the team also began efforts to de-risk the balance sheet as mentioned just a few minutes ago.
while executing the company's 2020 plan, adient's resiliency was brought to light as the team successfully managed through significant obstacles brought on by the global covid-19 pandemic. the slide highlights certain of the measures the team took throughout the year to mitigate covid's negative impact, many have been discussed on prior calls.
bottom line, executing and delivering on plans within our control while managing through unplanned obstacles, as we did in 2020, positioned adient for sustained success and, equally important, drives value to our future shareholders.
turning to slide 6, although the team is proud of the accomplishments achieved in 2020, we've turned the page and are now focused on 2021 and looking forward to build on that progress. the graphic on slide 6 should look familiar since adient's expected earnings growth in fiscal '21 is underpinned by the same focus areas that drove improvement last year, namely launch management, operational and cost improvement and customer profitability management.
let me spend a few minutes discussing a few of these focused areas in more detail on slides 7 and 8. first on slide 7, launch management will remain a key pillar supporting adient's turnaround. the team made significant progress in 2020 delivering several flawless launches throughout the year.
we plan to stay vigilant to ensure that these best-in-class launches continue. that said, and given the significant progress made throughout the last 12 months, the contribution from launch management to our expected earnings growth this year will be less impactful compared with contributions from cost and operational improvements and our customer profitability initiatives.
with regard to cost and operational improvement pillars, we've identified a number of initiatives the team is executing to drive improved business performance, and ultimately, earnings and cash flow growth. these initiatives span across the organization and include improved capacity utilization, especially within certain of our foam and trim facilities; align our manufacturing footprint to sales projections.
in europe, for example, we do not expect volumes to return to pre-covid levels for a number of years. in fact, certain third-party estimates predict production in 2025 will be below 2019 levels. as such, we're spending a fair amount of time and dollars restructuring the region.
purchasing is another area of opportunity, ensuring the business units -- adient's purchasing organizations are well aligned, including better make versus buy decisions is expected to drive significant performance enhancements in 2021. in addition to these actions, we tend to produce results relatively quickly.
we're also focused on how we can position the company to ensure improvements continue several quarters down the road. initiatives such as design for manufacturability where we're engaging the plant teams early in the design phase to reduce labor cost and improve quality; increase in automation and technology, again, looking toward the future to ensure improved cost and quality.
on the commercial and customer profitability front, we turn to slide 8. again, several initiatives are well under way. it begins with our mind-set. we want to become the supplier of choice for our customer in many ways and we're along that journey. as mentioned on previous calls, we spent significant time understanding the profitability associated with specific platforms and relationships with those customers.
this has resulted in the team better understanding who they want to grow with. of course, this needs to be profitable growth metrics such as return on capital employed, continue to drive program bidding for new and incumbent business. for programs in production that emerge in challenge, the team is focused on opportunities to improve margin profiles. we refer to this as our leakers and bleeders. one of the tools the team uses to enhance margin profile are va/ve initiatives.
the process has evolved significantly over the past several months into what we now refer to as cost and technology optimization. the team gathers inputs from various sources such as jd power, vave workshops, market research, iihs rating. by bundling and leveraging this available knowledge, we can create opportunities and value for our customers to improve market performance and increase adient's value add.
moving to slide 9, i'll spend a fair amount of time this morning discussing our 2020 accomplishments and how we plan to build on that progress in the new year. the key component of progress to date, expected improvement relates to seat structures & mechanisms business. although the ss&m business is managed regionally and is included in the america's emea's and asia regional performance, i want to take a few minutes to provide a brief update on ss&m.
the turnaround is solidly on track, the operations made steady improvements in fiscal 2020 and continue to trend toward being free cash flow neutral as we exit fiscal '21. as a reminder, free cash flow calculations is the simplifying definition, essentially adjusted ebitda for the unit less capex.
during the most recent year, we were able to cut 2019's free cash flow burn, which was approximately $400 million, by more than 50%. this was accomplished by improving both the profitability of the business, as well as reducing its capital expenditures.
we expect continued progress driven by a continuation of our targeted business selection process; improving cost competitiveness, essentially fixing the underperforming plants, creating cost-efficient designs and reducing our above-plant cost structure; making better make or buy decisions which will aid in asset utilization; ultimately improved earnings and focus on asset utilization employed [phonetic] to improve free cash flow for the business.
switching gears and moving to slides 10 and 11, let me provide a few comments on adient's recent business wins and the status of our launches. on slide 10, you see new business wins, which clearly show our continued focus on capital allocation, return on capital with targeting new or incumbent business has not limited our ability to secure business. we've highlighted a number of recent program wins here, including the replacement business for the jeep wrangler, jeep gladiator. new platform wins including tesla's model y, future ev program at ford, the ford transit, and geely/daimler smart.
in addition to those programs pictured on the slide, adient recently secured business awards for an undisclosed european manufacturer that is non-incumbent business and two gm future product programs which include an all new ev program, the replacement business for chevrolet and buick crossovers and also a gmc crossover, which is non-incumbent business to adient.
as our new book of business continues to launch, we expect the balance-in/balance-out platforms to further enable margin expansion. one additional note, as we've secured business over the past several quarters, we also experienced content growth for certain of our new incumbent wins, for example, include the addition of foam to the new ford f-150 and trim to the nissan pathfinder.
flipping to slide 11, we've highlighted several critical current and upcoming launches, including ford f-150, mustang mach-e, nissan rogue to name a few. i'm happy to report the launch is currently under way, including the f-150, one of adient's largest programs and they are progressing smoothly. the second f-150 manufacturing location in riverside, missouri is also well prepared for its first quarter launch.
as mentioned earlier, the team has made significant improvements to our launch management over the past several quarters as strong focus on process discipline around launch readiness is underpinning adient's successful performance.
at the bottom of the slide, we've provided how fiscal year '21's launch volume and complexity compare to last year. although volume and complexity are trending higher, especially in the americas region, we feel the team is well prepared. actual launch performance over the past few quarters provides positive proof points.
turning to slide 12, let me conclude my comments with an update on various macro factors we're watching that will likely impact the industry in adient's fiscal '21. on the positive side, continued monetary stimulus expected to result in positive economic growth. global vehicle production and mix remains strong, driven by improved consumer demand and a rebuild of inventory. and it appears advancements are being made with regard to covid treatment and vaccines, all of which is very good news and supportive of the industry.
factors we are watching that are tampering the expectations include the resurgence of covid-19 cases across europe and the americas, labor shortages, which have become increasingly the concern since we restarted our operations in q3. risk to the supply chain, although it's great to see vehicle production in the u.s. reach annualized levels of 16 million units, like we experienced in the fourth quarter, these sharp increases could fortunately put strains on the system. and an uptick in premium freight and increases in prices for certain commodities such as steel and chemicals.
summing up, we're entering '21 with an encouraging backdrop, driven by our self-help initiatives and improving vehicle production. we expect to encounter challenges along the way much of which we did in 2020, but be assured the team is ready to work hard to mitigate the headwinds that may arise.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff, so he can take us through adient's fourth quarter 2020 financial performance and our specific outlook for 2021 in greater detail.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
great. thanks, doug and good morning, everyone. let me echo doug's earlier comments and hope everyone is safe and well.
and starting on slide 14, and adhering to our typical format, the page is formatted with our reported results on the left and our adjusted results on the right side. we will focus our commentary on the adjusted results, which exclude special items that we view as either one time in nature or otherwise skew important trends and underlying performance.
for the quarter, the biggest drivers of the difference between our reported and adjusted results relate to restructuring cost, asset impairments, purchase accounting amortization and pension mark-to-market; details of these adjustments are in the appendix of the presentation.
sales were $3.6 billion, down 8% year-over-year, which, as doug noted, was driven by lower year-on-year global production and specific adient launches. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $287 million, up $72 million or 33% year-on-year, more than explained by improved business performance, lower sg&a, and an increase in equity income.
speaking of equity income, which is included in our adjusted ebitda result, q4 2019 included $14 million of income related to our interiors jv that we sold earlier this year. therefore, on an apples-to-apples comparison, adient's seating equity income was up $28 million or 47% year-over-year. finally, adjusted net income and eps were up significantly year-over-year at $109 million and $1.15 respectively. i'll also point out that a tax benefit contributed to the year-over-year improvements in net income.
the tax benefit was driven primarily by the write-off of certain deferred tax liabilities relating to the sales of wifi and adient's fabrics business. as a reminder, adient's effective tax rate is currently quite volatile and arguably provides little value as you model the company, given the valuation allowances recorded in recent years. as such, we'll continue to focus more on cash taxes.
full-year results are shown on slide 15. sales of $12.7 billion finished the year down approximately 23% compared with 2019. the significant impact of lower vehicle production, particularly in our third quarter as the covid-19 pandemic cost production stoppages at our customers was the key driver in the year-over-year decline. the significant reduction in volume more than explain the $114 million decline in ebitda. partially offsetting the negative volume were the benefits driven by the continued execution of the company's turnaround plan.
although year-over-year earnings -- although year-over-year earnings improved significantly -- although down year-over-year, earnings improved significantly in early 2020 -- fiscal 2020 prior to the impact of covid-19 and during adient's fourth quarter, where the impact of the pandemic lessened. and finally, the decline in operating income resulting from lower volumes dropped directly to the bottom line as adjusted net income and eps were a loss of $4 million and $0.04 respectively.
now let's break down our fourth quarter results in more detail. starting with revenue on slide 16, we reported consolidated sales of $3.6 billion, a decrease of $324 million compared to the same period a year ago. lower volume across north america, europe and asia primarily attributed to lost production volume associated with the pandemic was the key driver of the year-over-year decrease. adient specific launches also contributed to year-over-year sales decline, but to a much lesser extent.
worth noting, the call out on the right, consolidated sales in the americas was negatively impacted by production downtime for the ram classic. in emea, adjusting for the divestiture of recaro automotive seating, adient's sales were generally in line compared to the production within the european market.
in china, adient's sales were strong and outperformed vehicle production in the region. adient's favorable customer and platform mix continues to drive growth over market in the region. for markets outside of china and asia, adient's sales were impacted by export reductions in thailand and japan, primarily related to certain nissan and mitsubishi programs. the divestiture of recaro automotive seating in japan was also a contributor to the year-over-year decline.
with regard to adient's unconsolidated seating revenue, year-over-year results were up approximately 15%. in china, driven primarily through our strategic jv network, sales were up 18% year-over-year, excluding fx. the sales outperformance versus the market is attributable to adient's strong mix of business, specifically our exposure to luxury and japanese oems. outside of china, adient has a variety of unconsolidated jvs. these operations performed generally in line with production in the regions.
moving to slide 17, we provided a bridge of adjusted ebitda to show the performance of our segments between periods. the bucket labeled corporate represents central costs that are not allocated back to the operation such as executive office, communications, corporate finance, legal and marketing. big picture, adjusted ebitda was $287 million in the current quarter versus $215 million last year.
key drivers of the increase included; improved business performance, which consisted of lower labor and overhead freight and ops waste; lower sg&a cost across all regions driven by increased efficiencies and the positive benefits associated with the deconsolidation of adient aerospace and divestiture of recaro.
also important to note, between $5 million and $10 million of the sg&a savings should be viewed as temporary and are not expected to repeat next year. and in asia, a significant increase in seating equity income also contributed to the year-over-year increase in ebitda.
speaking of equity income, last year's ebitda of $215 million included $14 million of equity income related to the wi-fi investment we sold and stopped consolidating last december. partially offsetting the positive factors just noted was approximately $55 million of headwind related to lower volume and mix.
i'd like to point out that our adjusted ebitda margin, excluding equity income, increased by just under 200 basis points year-over-year to 5.5%. a good proof point adient's core operations are benefiting from the numerous turnaround actions executed to-date. i would caution, however, certain of the macro factors that benefited q4's margins are likely unsustainable such as the extremely rich mix of production.
as doug mentioned, we see certain headwinds on the horizon such as rising commodity prices and an uptick in premium freight that the team will need to manage through in the coming quarters. more on our 2021 expectations in just a minute. to ensure enough time is allocated to the q&a portion of the call, we provided our detailed segment performance slides in the appendix of the presentation.
let me now shift to our cash, liquidity, and capital structure on slides 18 and 19. starting with cash on slide 18, for the quarter, adjusted free cash flow defined as operating cash flow, less capex was $450 million. there were several factors that had a significant impact in the quarter's cash compared to our q3 ending balance.
these factors included, at a high level, first, just under $500 million of cash proceeds collected from the closure of the yanfeng transaction and the fabric sale; the reversal of temporary net trade working capital headwinds experienced in q3; higher level of operating income and partially offsetting these were -- these positive contributions was just under $100 million of cash used to voluntarily pay down $103.5 million in principal of adient's 10-year 4.875% senior unsecured notes.
on the right hand side of the slide, you can see we ended the quarter and year with approximately $2.5 billion of total liquidity, comprised of cash on hand of about $1.7 billion and just under $800 million of undrawn capacity under adient's revolving line of credit. just one more point to make before moving on; you can see within the table, adient's capital expenditures for the year totaled $326 million, down $142 million year-on-year.
the team continues to work extremely hard to reuse capital where appropriate, especially within the ss&m business, where capital spending was down just under $100 million compared to the last year.
moving on and turning to slide 19. in addition to showing our debt and net debt position, which totaled $4.3 billion and $2.6 billion respectively at september 30th, we've also provided a snapshot of adient's capital structure.
just a few comments here; adient's capital structure provided us with the flexibility to weather the covid storm and is now providing ample flexibility to voluntarily pay down debt, which we began during the fourth quarter with $103.5 million in principal pay down of adient's 10 year 4.875% unsecured senior notes. as uncertainty related to the crisis lessens over time, we look to pay down additional debt obligations.
as mentioned on past calls, over time we'd expect to have zero outstanding balance on the revolver and run with a cash balance somewhere in the $500 million to $600 million range, which points to significant opportunity for debt pay down in fiscal '21.
one final note on the slide, and related to our abl, capacity under the -- under adient's revolver is based on a one-month lag such that q4 availability was based on august ar and inventory balances. updating the ar balance and inventory balances to the end of september increased our revolver availability to just under $900 million in october or approximately $100 million more than the $787 million available at quarter end.
moving on slides 21 through 24, let me conclude with a few thoughts on what to expect for fiscal 2021. starting on slide 21, on the right hand side, we've laid out our planning assumptions for production and fx compared with fiscal '20. the production assumptions are based on the current environment and could be significantly different if a production stoppage occurred. we are not forecasting such a stoppage, however, with the escalation in covid cases, it remains a possibility.
as doug noted earlier, our current expectations assume global vehicle production will continue to trend higher, increasing year-over-year in each of the major regions. the foundation of our '21 plan is generally aligned with the october ihs estimates with certain overlays for known customer release schedules. although vehicle production schedules have remained robust entering fiscal '21, adient assumes second half fiscal '21 production will decline compared with the first half of fiscal -- compared with the first half of '21 production, which is also aligned with ihs forecast.
on the far right side of the table, you can see how we expect our sales to perform by region relative to production. bottom line, adient's consolidated sales are expected to outpace global vehicle production growth by roughly 300 basis points. if you adjust for the recaro and fabrics divestitures completed in fiscal '20, growth over market would be roughly 400 basis points.
within the regions, growth over market is expected in both europe and china. in north america, certain fiscal '21 headwinds such as tesla's decision to insource their seat manufacturing and lower volumes at nissan will likely result in sales lagging production growth.
now i'll review these assumptions and how they impact our 2021 outlook, beginning with sales on slide 22. we've included a bridge that walks our fiscal 2020 sales of $12.7 billion to our expected 2021 sales range of between $14.6 billion and $15.0 billion.
volume and mix are expected to have the greatest impact on our 2021 performance due to the overall industry growth. outside of volume, adient's positive backlog of new business and fx are expected to have a positive impact of between $350 million and $400 million for the year, partially offsetting the positive factors were the divestitures completed last year as well as customer pricing headwinds.
now turning to slide 23, we've also included a high level bridge illustrating our expectations for adjusted ebitda. walking from our fiscal 2020 results of $673 million, which included $408 million of consolidated ebitda, we expect several factors will influence adient's performance in 2021, many on the positive side including, benefits driven by continued execution of the company's turnaround plan, specifically related to operational improvements, cost containment and customer profitability management. higher volumes will also be a significant driver to improved year-over-year profitability, complementing adient's self-help initiatives.
these positive influences are expected to be partially offset by approximately $150 million of headwinds. certain of these headwinds are macro related, while others are specific to adient. for example, rising commodity cost, specifically for chemicals related to our foam operations and steel, are estimated to be an approximate $50 million headwind. launch cost associated with both the volume and complexity of launches, although not significant, are expected to be approximately $20 million more in fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20.
adient's portfolio adjustments namely the elimination of our interiors equity income and the sale of our fabric business will create a gap of approximately $20 million to $25 million. and finally, the non-recurrence of temporary benefits recognized last year as we pulled every lever within our control to cut cost and reduce our cash burn during the pandemic such as furloughing our direct labor, implementing salary reductions and spending the 401(k) plans.
i'd also mention brexit is a development we're continuing to watch closely. however, given the many moving pieces and uncertainty surrounding the event, placing an estimated dollar headwind is not possible at this time. bottom line, when sifting through the puts and takes, we expect adjusted ebitda to increase to between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in fiscal '21. our consolidated adjusted ebitda at the midpoint is expected to be about $800 million with a corresponding margin of 5.4%. this expected outcome is approximately $390 million better compared with last year.
important to note, this forecast is based on the current operating environment. specifically, we are not assuming production stoppages that may occur from supply shortages or customer downtime that is possible, given the uptick in covid cases taking place, particularly across europe and the americas.
now that we've covered our fiscal '21 expectations for sales and adjusted ebitda, let me quickly comment on our expectations for a few other key financial metrics on slide 24. starting with equity income, based on our assumption of production in china, the elimination of wi-fi interior's equity income and current fx rates, we'd expect equity income to be around $250 million, about flat compared with fiscal '20. again this is seating only. the negative impact of commodity prices is the primary reason for the relatively flat year-over-year expectations.
important to note, we're expecting equity income to be particularly strong in q1 as the market continues to make up for losses earlier in the year due to the pandemic. interest expense based on our expected cash balance and debt should be approximately $235 million.
cash taxes in fiscal '21 are expected to be around $85 million, which is slightly less than we paid in fiscal '20. it's important to remember that we maintain valuable tax attributes, such as net operating loss carry forwards and that these tax attributes can be used to offset profits on a going forward basis. so we expect cash taxes to remain low even as profits are increasing.
to assist with your modeling, although volatile with fluctuations between quarters as mentioned earlier, we're expecting an effective tax rate to be around 30% for fiscal '21. we'd expect that rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to valuation allowances and our geographic mix of income.
capital expenditures are forecasted to range between $320 million and $340 million, essentially in line with fiscal '20 results. although we see opportunity to reduce capital expenditures further in the out years, driven in part by a smaller ss&m business, the current year expenditures are supporting current launch plans.
and finally, one last item for your modeling, free cash flow is expected to range between breakeven and $100 million in fiscal '21. there are several one-off factors driving this result for '21 such as an elevated level of cash restructuring, which is expected to be around $200 million. the elevated spend which is about 2 times our normal run rate is necessary as we execute actions to right size the business, especially within our european operations where external and internal production forecast remain below pre-covid levels for a number of years.
in addition to an elevated restructuring spend, the 2021 free cash flow was negatively impacted by approximately $60 million of tax payments that were deferred from last year into 2021. stripping out these one-offs, adient's free cash flow is -- in a more normal year would have been expected to range between $160 million to $260 million, keeping all the other factors the same.
and with that, let's move to the question-answer portion of the call. operator, we'll take the first question.
",2020-Q4,ADNT
-1.0,0.99895,-0.7551,,":
operator
thank you. operator instructions] our first question comes from john murphy with bank of america. your line is open.
emlynn smith -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, guys. this is emlynn smith on for john. going back to that normalized adjusted ebitda margin of 6% to 6.5% that you commented on for the first quarter, running the math on your outlook, we get to an ebitda margin that's in the high-6% to low-7% range for 2020. can you talk about the cadence of the margin that you anticipate for 2021 with some of the headwinds you noted like chip shortages and raw mats. and on a normalized basis, should we be thinking about sequential improvement in margins through the first half of the year versus second half as we've been able to demonstrate in the past or are there some factors at work that we should be thinking about through the cadence of the year as we use that 6% to 6.5% as a starting point?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that's a great question, emlynn. it's, i will say, the tough year to forecast and some of these things which are just changing every day, primarily the production schedules relating to chip shortages are difficult to predict. the -- and commodity headwind is certainly going to have a negative impact on our margin. but we tried to highlight in the 6% to 6.5%, what i did -- what we did there, as we said, we had about $20 million to, lets say, $25 million of one-time commercial benefits, which we took out of that number when calculating that. and then we took out -- we had more than, let's say, 25% of our normal year's commercial settlements occur in the first quarter, so call that another $25 million. so we kind of backed out that $50 million in calculating it.
some of the other quarters are going to be under-represented on commercial recoveries because we did more in the first quarter. so, i'd say, you're going to see some bumpiness on our margin because of those few factors, the chip shortages, the commodity inflation and then the timing of these commercial settlements. but i will say, as we look at it, we continue to see the fundamentals of the business improve. so there is going to be some noise probably in the bottom-line margin, but fundamentally here we've been seeing improvements in performance that we do expect to continue to trend well, but do expect some noise in the quarter-to-quarter margin.
emlynn smith -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and second question, following up on the raw materials commentary. can you provide us with an estimate of what it was in the quarter? i wasn't able to follow it in the bridge. and specifically how you expect it to increase the magnitude for the remainder of the year? and then, can you just remind us how this gets shared with the auto makers via pass-throughs and escalators and if you have any hedging or other vehicles or mechanisms that you use to offset that?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, on the first question, there is about $5 million, give or take, in the first quarter of commodity. so we called out about $80 million now. so there's about $75 million in the balance of the year. i'd say, most of that is going to be q3 and q4. as you -- and that -- what we've also seen is freight -- the freight issues kind of multiply a bit. you've seen a shortage of containers primarily from asia, but that impacts a number of our regions. that has increased freight and it's also required us to do some other forms where we -- everyone unfortunately have to fly things because of some of the challenges in the freight side. i'd say really none of that hit in the first quarter and that's $10 million to $20 million that we're factoring in for the year.
as you asked about the recovery mechanisms, it depends on customer. some of our customers are immediate but other ones -- so there is immediate recovery and we have our index. and i would say, what you've seen with steel, as you've seen an unprecedented jump in steel prices and we tend to -- the way we model this is, we tend to lock in for a quarter or two. but then, as the year rolls, we have to -- where we've seen these big increases, we have to start to pay a higher price. and our customers, in some cases where they are immediate, we're able to grab that disconnect quickly. other ones where we have a year lag, which is pretty much all of our japanese customers which is significant for us, will take time. and that's why we don't see 70%, 90% of the increase is being recovered in fiscal '21. we see some of those things being pushed to '22. so they should be favorable for us that the prices maintain stability in '22, but that recovery on those particular customers will happen later.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and emlynn, i think the other point i would add to it is, that's myopically around just the way our agreements work -- the contractual agreements that we have in place. right now, we're experiencing really unprecedented, particularly in steel levels by -- and it's difficult to see when that will mitigate. so what we lump into that discussion with our customers is, how we think about annualized productivity in the midst of this environment and the midst of chip shortage. and as these issues all kind of converge at the same time, we're in discussions with them and other avenues that we can go down to mitigate some of the impact. so, you have this basket of goods kind of approach that you have to take into account. it's too early to really tell what's happening. i guess, the point i was trying to make is, even if we have a year lag that doesn't necessarily mean that's what we're willing to accept in environment we're operating in right now.
emlynn smith -- bank of america -- analyst
great. that's very helpful color.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
just to clarify something you said before, which you didn't -- you had mentioned our 2020 progression of ros. when i was talking to $6 million to $6.5 million, that excluded equity income. so i don't know if that was in your calculation, but that is an improvement. we haven't seen that level of margin even with those adjustments i put forward in any of the quarters in 2020. so this is, even after making those adjustments, would be an improvement over what we've seen.
emlynn smith -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, fantastic. that's very helpful. thanks for taking the questions.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from rod lache with wolfe research. your line is open.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi, everybody. can you hear me?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, rod.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, hey, rod.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. good morning. i was hoping you could talk about the targets for cost and business improvement that you're sort of looking out for over the next 12 months and how that could contribute upside beyond the $1 billion to $1.1 billion ebitda that you're looking at for this year. i think you've previously talked about $200 million of restructuring with a two-year payback. so, presumably that's about $100 million. and i think you said that ss&m would go from ebitda breakeven to cash breakeven, which was another $100 million and i'm not sure if that's double counting.
and then, presumably you have non-recurrence the semiconductor shutdowns and covid containment cost. so kind of high level, if we kind of fast forward hopefully a year from now, things are looking better and the world is kind of normalizing. and you've got your -- some of the things you've accomplished. i mean, what are some of those big items that we should be looking out for?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i'll start. the one that you didn't hit on, rod, which is spend, part of our overall plan and lags a little bit whether it occurs and evolves over time is the roll on and roll off of businesses. and what i've always commented on, we haven't necessarily put a specific target on it. but we said the last element in addition to what you mentioned would be just getting rid of the bad business that we couldn't drive the efficiencies, whether the labor and overhead or probably more importantly material sell ratios and we just have to have those roll off. so, that's really the buckets that we look to draw from.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
but nothing has changed around our target, rod, of really eliminating that gap we have to our peer margin. right. so if we think about going from $6 million to $6.5 million toward closer to $8.5 million, can you just maybe characterize the big buckets that you've got -- that you're kind of targeting, how large are each of these components whether it's restructuring or getting out of some of the weaker contracts that you've got?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, it's difficult to do in total high level. but some of the big pieces, the seat structures and mechanisms business, we mentioned a $40 million improvement in the quarter. i'd say -- and we put out a target to you guys some time ago to exit this year at a free cash flow breakeven, which compared to a couple of years ago was a $400 million outflow. that's a combination obviously of taking the $100 million of capex or so out of that business, but it's also a dramatic improvement in the ebitda.
we're in a great progression of that. i'd say, there's lots of work to do there. so that's a couple of billion dollar business, plus operation has an opportunity to lift as we get to where we want to be. and i think where we're starting to see some reasonable sites on where we can get it to, substantial portion of that margin gap that you noted, the combination of what we're seeing across each region as we go into our customers with different strategies around how can we take a bigger piece of their volume, control more of the spend, maybe control the foam and the trim and take that with the ve efforts and the benchmarking we've been doing, there is significant opportunity for us to take cost out of our customers product, while adding margin to our business.
that is taking route and doug had and all the regional presidents have been having really in-depth discussions with our customers on how to do that. and a lot of those activities have been implemented that trend, we see, will continue to drive and beat the other real engine on that growth.
as it relates to the restructuring and some of those, we continue to find efficiencies there as well. you mentioned the activities we initiated last year in the us have been able to take out the activities that in europe that are -- we'll say about halfway implemented in 2021, so we'll get some additional benefit as we get the full year effect of those in 2022 and we'll continue to lean out the structure. but i'd say there is going to be more emphasis on those first two pieces than the last -- that recovery.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yes, just want to add to it, rod, the reason, at least i was a little bit hesitant to ask is, as we've said before, it's really difficult to bucket these things and put labels on them, how much is going to be commercial, how much is going to be operational improvement, it encompasses everything, jeff just referenced. it's really working every element of the cost structure that we have in balancing that against the cost drivers, be they inflation area, material economics and the apatite that had -- that our customers have right now for cost reduction.
and the one thing i would say that's maybe a little bit different than what historically we've seen, which i think is good news for us. and not that we're changing our outlook or timeline, we've always labeled that timeline to be multi-year and taking us out to '24, '25. to close that gap is an increasing appetite, as jeff mentioned, our customers have for cost reduction. and they're really asking for ways to -- not just the traditional vave, can you make a small change. they're asking for fundamental change in the way they design and develop and market seat systems in their vehicles. and that's a huge opportunity, but you can't really call that cost reduction. it's really recasting how you think you commercially discuss those issues with your customer, the impact that it has on your own operation, and then what kind of sharing that you agree to put in front of them.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks. i just wanted to ask one other question. i'm sure you'd agree one of the most striking things that we've seen here in the industry over the past years is how much capital is being raised by new entrants. i was wondering if could you just maybe make a comment about how you are looking at it from adient's perspective. are you pursuing business with a dozen new potential customers or are you taking a somewhat more cautious view on that?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i would say, we're -- if i were to characterize, it's much more cautious. and that's not to cast a negative shadow on any particular entry that's out there. i think what we've learned over the last couple of years is -- and we've got a ways to go our business back on track, is really focus on fundamentals, focus on traditional customers to a certain degree.
there are some new oes that we are participating with. neo would be a good example. tesla is another example. we continue to pursue. but they've demonstrated to a certain degree sustainable volume that they can deliver to the market and again with our traditional customers coming on board with propulsion changes in their vehicles, there is opportunity for us to pursue that. as some of the new entrants demonstrate the ability, we'll reexamine it, but pursuing -- diversifying our customer base and pursuing, that is something we stepped away from a couple of years ago and we don't see that changing right now.
it's fairly risky and there is plenty of opportunity. if you just prioritize where is there opportunity for us to drive value, we see it in kind of our traditional markets and not necessarily in these new markets right now.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thank you.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, rod.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from james picariello with keybanc capital market. your line is open.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
hey, james.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
so, i really appreciate all the color on the guide and cadence for the year. can we just walk through the moving pieces, particularly within ebitda that leaves the full year guide unchanged? it sounds as though commodities are $35 million worse, another $15 million from premium freight, both of which are back-end weighted, and then on the positive side of the ledger you have commercial settlements and favorable mix in the first quarter. what did i miss there? any clarification would be great in terms of what keeps the full year guide unchanged, the puts and takes?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, james. i'd say, the biggest thing that keeps the year unchanged is the difficult of -- it's just the environment. one, we're very early in the year; but two, you just saw, if you read the journal, wall street journal this morning, a big article on ford, our second largest platform went down yesterday and shorter shifts for a while. we've seen that impact on the chip shortage throughout the world. that's significant covid, still being where it is. so all those things sort of weigh on us, but you grabbed the pieces, the commodity exposure, freight exposure, the timing of those commercial settlements, the fact that, i'd say, we had a little bit of an elevated, we call it, $20 million to $30 million benefit in q1 that we'd say is not repeatable. so, all those things factored in and just, with all that decided, wanted to see a little bit more of this year develop before we changed our outlook.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, got it. that's helpful. and then, just on the equity income outlook, you made the comment, second half or the first half 50% higher than the second half. so it's kind of a two-thirds, one-third breakout, what's that?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that was just a quarter reference, not a half year reference. we said -- so second quarter includes the chinese new year and we said the second quarter would be roughly half the amount of first quarter.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. all right. i got that, all right. just following up on the commodities then, so you're now looking at an $80 million headwind, you mentioned the customer recovery mechanisms likely hit next year. so, should we assume 75% of that $80 million is recovered next year, just what's the right way to be thinking about that in terms of the recovery? thanks.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and that one depends a lot on where the prices go. so, if prices stay steady, we'll eventually recapture the difference and we will no longer be running at a deficit because just think of it in any given market, if we're buying steel at $100 and our contract with the customers is $100, and just for metrics and then steel goes up to $110, we're still getting only a cost or a recovery from a customer based on $100. once the price goes up to $110, we eliminate that difference. so all that really happens if price stays steady is that, we essentially stop the bleeding on this. as prices eventually reduce, then we'll start to get -- we'll get recovery, because we'll have it work the other direction. yeah, hopefully that makes sense.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i guess i would add on top of that, in our opinion it's for you, draw the goal lines. we fully expect it will always recover material economics at some point. it's just a question of how long it takes. as jeff mentioned, if steel prices go down, then we'll recover it relatively quickly and it won't take extraordinary means for us to get it. if they don't, then it's a different dialogue with our customer because we won't sustain it for an extended period of time, even if market rates stay high. and so, whether it's true-up on a new product launch, that addresses it, or again, we just broaden the conversation to include other issues to mitigate the impact of it. and that's namely customer product -- annualized customer productivity.
mark oswald -- vice president, investor relations and corporate communications
thanks, james.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks.
mark oswald -- vice president, investor relations and corporate communications
operator, if we can move to the last question?
operator
thank you. our last question comes from brian johnson with barclays. your line is open.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
yeah, two questions. one, kind of more of a housekeeping; and the second, more strategic organizational. just as we watched the production schedules at ford kind of -- and tried to kind of get an accurate gauge on fiscal 2q, how should we be thinking about the revenue impact of every kind of week of downtime or every unit of downtime without getting too deep into your actual ford pricing?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's hard to do without getting deep into a ford pricing. the production numbers...
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
pretty quickly what our ford pricing look like, i guess i gave you that level of detail just because there is so transparent about the number last unit, so i'd be very reluctant to do that.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
well, i guess that's just -- given the slides, we all know how to make slide decks, but kind of as you put together the slides, as you kind of reviewed them before blasting them this morning, are you confident that the ford news was fully reflected in your outlook?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think so.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
okay.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i mean, what we know, now that doesn't mean that additional things. yeah, i would say.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
and second question, just kind of following on the theme of the other questionnaires around kind of visualizing the waterfall walk back to industry, competitor margins. yeah, i want to ask maybe a softer question, particularly doug, kind of as you look now versus where you came in, at some of the key organizational challenges, i know moving to regional they created accountability. where do you think you stand?
you must be looking at red, yellow, green charts endlessly, but just in terms of do you have the right people in the right roles, both facing off in terms of account management, working, partnering with the key oems, and at some of the key factories and key kind of supply chain positions, how has that evolved? what work is there left to do? is the team basically that you need on the field executing or are there still gaps you need to fill?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and not to be coy, i do not look at red, yellow and green charts to get an indication of how we're performing. we tend to look at numbers. and respectfully, that's just a different way that we're driving the business. right now, we focus a lot of attention and we talk the business and numbers and drive that deep into our organization, so everyone's understanding that we're not managing the kpis. we're managing to a bottom line level of performance, whether it's ebitda or ebit or return on investment or capital or how we're generating cash.
relative to the organization, actually it's interesting and time we ask that question. we just had a succession plan review with our board last week. and i was pretty happy to report that, although we'll constantly make tweaks in the organization to adjust to the environment, we feel really good about the organization that's in place right now. we're not foreseeing any major changes. we've brought a lot of new talent into the group and then we've moved the strong talent that we had here and adding into the right roles and then changed the way we're compensating them and how we expect them to motivate them. that's very much connected to the basics of customer satisfaction and then business financial performance. so, yeah, the regional move worked out well for us. there's no perfect organization, but i think breaking the company into some smaller parts that we could manage a little bit easier regionally.
i feel fortunate that we did that ahead of covid because it would have been, even with all the technology without having the right people on the ground in region, it would have been difficult to do manage the business. but we've got strong leaders in every single region, and then they've all reshuffled their team to some degree. and so, back to the succession plan, as we go layers deep compared to where we were maybe a year or two ago, we feel a lot better about that organization.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
and just a quick follow-up. okay.
mark oswald -- vice president, investor relations and corporate communications
thanks, brian. and unfortunately we're out of time here. so, for those of you who did not get a chance to ask your questions, i'll be available for a follow-up, please just feel free to reach out. this concludes the call for this morning.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, everyone.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

",0.9843,0.99975,2021-02-05 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
welcome to adient's 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] today's call is being recorded. if anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
i would now like to turn the call over to mark oswald. thank you. you may begin.
mark oswald -- vice president, investor relations and corporate communications
thank you, amanda. good morning and thank you for joining us as we review adient's results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. the press release and presentation slides for our call today have been posted to the investors section of our website at adient.com.
this morning, i'm joined by doug del grosso, adient's president and chief executive officer; and jeff stafeil, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. on today's call, doug will provide an update on the business, followed by jeff, who will review our q1 financial results and outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. after our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions.
before i turn the call over to doug and jeff, there are a few items i'd like to cover. first, today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. these statements are based on the environment as we see it today and therefore involve risks and uncertainties. i would caution you that our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements made on the call. please refer to slide 2 of the presentation for our complete safe harbor statement.
in addition to the financial results presented on a gaap basis, we will be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures to the closest gaap equivalent can be found in the appendix of our full earnings release.
this concludes my comments. i'll now turn the call over to doug. doug?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
great. thanks, mark. good morning. thanks to our investors, prospective investors and analysts joining the call this morning as we review our first quarter results for fiscal 2021. take a moment to wish or hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy at this very challenging time for all of us.
let me get started. let's turn to slide 4 and begin with a few comments related to our first quarter, specifically adient's strong start to the fiscal year. remaining laser-focused on our priorities combined with relatively robust vehicle production continued to drive improved business performance in the most recent quarter.
q1's adjusted ebitda of $378 million was up $81 million or just under 30% year-on-year. important to remember, last year's results included earnings from our interiors, fabrics and recaro businesses, which we divested post q1 2020. adjusting for those businesses, this year's first quarter ebitda was up $110 million year-on-year. equally impressive with respect to the absolute level of earnings was adient's adjusted ebitda margin performance of 9.8%, or 7.4% excluding equity income. that's a very strong proof point that adient can achieve margins equal to, if not better, to our nearest competitor.
no doubt a strong result, but even more impressive when you consider adient's consolidated revenue was down about 2% during the same period. adient's specific launches and impact of portfolio adjustments executed in fiscal year '20 were the primary drivers of lower sales. also shown on the left-hand side of the slide are adient's strong q1 ending cash balances and total liquidity, which were approximately $1.8 billion and $2.8 billion respectively. as you can see, adient's q1 financial metrics point to a strong start to the year, we believe, lays a solid path to adient achieving its fiscal '21 commitments.
on the right hand side of the slide, we've highlighted a few items that will give you further confidence in the team. these show that in addition to delivering strong quarterly financial results, we are also focused on the future to ensure sustained long-term success. that success will be driven in large part by adient's ability to provide world-class products and services to our customers.
as mentioned on previous call, adient is striving to become the supplier of choice for our customers. during the quarter, progress toward that goal was validated through a number of external awards. hyundai kia selected adient as one of their supplier of the year 2020 honorees for delivering several flawless launches, excellent quality and supply chain management.
adient's new floating seat pictured on the right-hand side of the slide won a bronze medal at the prestigious clepa innovation award ceremony. i'd also point out that adient supplied seats for the winners of the 2021 north american utility and truck of the year, the ford mach-e and the ford f-150. in china, daimler presented our bja joint venture with the loyal companion award, essentially recognizing adient for being a reliable supplier for beijing daimler for the past 20 years. we are among three suppliers who received the award from daimler, who just delivered its 3 millionth car in the market. and in thailand, daimler also presented us with supplier performance excellence award, the only seat supplier for this award.
again, i mentioned this recognition only to provide proof points that our team continues to execute on many fronts spanning across operations, products and customer relationships. when properly executed, we believe these focus areas will continue to drive value for all of adient stakeholders.
speaking of driving value, we understand that a commitment to positive environmental, social and governance-related business practice strengthens our company, increases our connection with our shareholders and helps us better serve our customers and the communities in which we operate. adient's commitment to operate its business in an environmentally responsible manner was recently outlined in the publication of the company's 2020 sustainability report.
as you can see on slide 5, adient's 2020 sustainability report outlines the company's key policies and actions regarding environmental responsibility, people and communities, governance and compliance and more. our aim is to ensure that adient manages risk in these areas and achieves our environmental, social and governance goals. we've included a link to the full report. please take a few minutes to learn how adient's incorporating these policies into our day-to-day operations.
turning to slide 6, let me provide a few comments on adient's recent business wins. on slide 6, you'll see a few of our new business wins, which shows that our continued focus on capital allocation and return on capital when targeting new and incumbent businesses has not limited our ability to secure a new business. we've recently highlighted a number of recent program wins here, including the all-new ev program with gm, the peugeot 3008 and 5008, both new programs for adient, and in china, we secured the lincoln nautilus program.
not shown but very important to our portfolio business, the team secured the incumbent gm traverse and enclave crossovers as well as the gmc acadia crossover, which is non-incumbent to adient. also, it should be noted that our recent business awards include a good mix combination of jet foam trim in metals business. as our new book of business continues to launch, we expect the balance in and balance out platforms to further enable margin expansion.
one last point on new business wins, specifically sourcing of the new business. fiscal 2021 is shaping up to be a higher-than-normal year for quoting and sourcing new and incumbent business. we expect the outcome to be favorable for adient, which will strengthen the business in the outyears. the uncertainty for the remainder of fiscal year '21 is the impact the customer productivity demands a nomination fees required to secure the business. this is not unusual, however, it's worth mentioning, considering the volume of sourcing is elevated this year.
looking the slide 7, we've highlighted several critical launches that are in the process, scheduled to begin in the near-term. i'm happy to report the launch is currently under way, including the f-150 are progressing well. second, f-150 manufacturing location in riverside, missouri is well under way and progressing up the launch curve as planned. the launches and platforms show not only impact adient's jet facilities but also span across our network of foam trim and metal facilities. the entire team is performing at a high level as evidenced by our current performance.
as mentioned on prior calls, the team has made significant improvements in our launch management over the past several quarters, a strong focus disciplined around launch readiness is underpinning adient's successful performance. i might add, we have no intention of letting up on this activity.
turning to slide 8, let me conclude my comments with an update on various macro factors we're managing through and are expected to impact the industry and adient in the coming quarters. the list should look very familiar as many of these factors were highlighted as we entered fiscal year '21. on the positive side, continued monetary stimulus is expected to result in positive economic growth. and the economic growth is forecasted to accelerate later in the year, as the number of individuals who are vaccinated against covid-19 virus increases.
all of this is very good news and supportive of the industry. that said, there's several factors we're managing through that are tempering our expectations. they include supply chain disruptions primarily related to semiconductor shortages, which are resulting in near-term production downtime across the industry impacting adient's customers.
continue to monitor the situation at this time, it's too early to know if lost production in q1 or q2 will be made up before the end of adient's fiscal year. putting the temporary production disruptions aside, the current level of global production appears to be supported by improving consumer demand and the rebuild of inventory.
moving on commodity costs, specifically steel and chemicals have continued to escalate versus our original estimates. the teams are working hard to help mitigate these increasing costs. important to remember, even though escalators and agreements are in place to help recover these costs, the agreements do not cover 100% of the increase. in addition, the time and method for true-ups vary by customer, resulting in a time lag as to when adient begins to receive recoveries. jeff will provide additional detail on the topic in just a few minutes. few other items noted on the slide include labor shortages and premium freight in all regions and an elevated launch cadence in the americas.
as mentioned earlier, adient's launch performance has improved significantly and we feel well positioned ahead of the launches. that said, we're very aware of the hard that lies ahead and we're not taking the current or upcoming launches for granted.
to sum it up, our strong start in 2021 provides a solid path to achieving our fiscal '21 commitments. the path appears to contain a few speed bumps, but rest assured the team is working hard to navigate around them. i'm confident adient will manage through these obstacles much as we did in 2020.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff to take us through adient's first quarter 2021 financial performance and what to expect as we move through the rest of fiscal 2021.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, doug. good morning, everyone. let me echo doug's earlier comments, and i hope everyone is safe and well.
i'll start my comments on slide 10. adhering to our typical format, the page is formatted with our reported results on the left and our adjusted results on the right of the page. we will focus our commentary on the adjusted results, which exclude special items that we view as either one-time in nature or otherwise skew important trends and underlying performance. for the quarter, the biggest drivers of the difference between our reported and our adjusted results relate to restructuring cost and purchase accounting amortization. details of these adjustments are in the appendix of the presentation.
sales were $3.8 billion, down about 2% year-over-year, which, as doug noted, was driven by portfolio adjustments executed in fiscal '20, which impacted the year-over-year comparison by about $70 million. in addition, adient's specific launches such as the f-150 also contributed to the year-over-year decline. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $378 million, up $81 million or just under 30% year-on-year, more than explained by improved business performance and lower sg&a cost, partially offset by a decrease in equity income.
speaking of equity income, which is included in our adjusted ebitda result, q1 fiscal '20 included $17 million of income related to our jv that we sold earlier last year. therefore, on an apples-to-apples comparison, adient's seating equity income was up year-over-year. i'll detail the drivers within the equity income in just a minute. finally, adjusted net income and eps were up significantly year-over-year at $162 million and $1.71 per share respectively.
now let's break down first quarter results in more detail, starting with revenue on slide 11. we reported consolidated sales of $3.8 billion, a decrease of $88 million compared to the same period a year ago. the key drivers of the year-over-year comparison included just over $70 million of lower sales attributed to portfolio adjustments executed in fiscal '20, namely the divestitures of our fabrics and recaro businesses.
in addition to the divestitures, volume and pricing contributed to just over $80 million of revenue decline. the biggest drivers included lower volumes in the americas, primarily the result of adient's specific launches such as the f-150 and, to a lesser degree, tesla's decision to insource complete seat production. for markets outside of china, in asia, adient's sales were impacted by export reductions in thailand and japan. a positive impact of currency movements between the two periods of about $67 million partially offset the impact of the divestitures and lower volume.
in china, adient's sales were strong and outperformed vehicle production in the region. adient's favorable customer and platform mix continues to drive growth over market. with regard to adient's unconsolidated seating revenue, year-over-year results were up approximately 11%, excluding fx. in china, driven primarily through our strategic jv network, sales were up 13% year-over-year, excluding fx, and the sales outperformance versus the market is attributable to adient's strong mix of business, specifically our exposure to luxury and japanese oems.
moving to slide 12, we've provided a bridge of adjusted ebitda to show the performance of our segments between periods. the bucket labeled corporate represents central costs that are not allocated back to the operations such as executive office, communications, corporate finance, legal and marketing. big picture adjusted ebitda was $378 million in the current quarter versus $297 million last year. the key drivers of the increase included improved business performance, which consisted of normal course, commercial settlements, lower labor and overhead, freight and ops waste.
regarding the commercial settlements, these settlements as discussed in the past tend to be lumpy in nature between quarters. settlements are common toward the end of the calendar year as our customers close out their fiscal year. settlements tend to be pretty consistent from one year to the next, but the timing is not uniform throughout any given year. i'd also say that we saw an elevated number this quarter and thus expect slightly elevated number in 2021 as a result, call it about $20 million to $30 million. we would say this elevated portion is not expected to repeat. it's also worth mentioning that our commercial accrual balance is slightly up year-over-year, again suggesting that our charges to and releases from the accrual tend to remain in balance over the course of the year.
sg&a was another strong contributor in the quarter across all regions, driven by increased efficiencies and the positive benefits associated with the divestitures of fabrics and recaro. partially offsetting the positive factors just noted was about $37 million of headwinds, primarily associated with lower equity income of $21 million, lower volume and the mix of $9 million and the impact of fx call that about $7 million.
with regard to the biggest driver, equity income, as mentioned just a minute ago, the year-over-year comparison was impacted by the absence of interiors equity income resulting from the yfai divestiture of about $17 million. in addition, equity income contained approximately $15 million of headwinds, including a $10 million tax refund recognized in q1 fiscal '20 that did not repeat this year. these headwinds were partially offset by the positive contributions of volume and efficiencies this year totaling about $12 million.
i'd like to point out that our adjusted ebitda margin, excluding equity income, increased by 260 basis points year-over-year to 7.4%. even adjusting for the one-time commercial items i noted and normalizing the commercial settlements noted earlier, we would estimate our margin, excluding equity income, would be between 6% and 6.5% and thus showing nice improvement over recent quarters.
these results provide a solid proof point that adient's core operations are benefiting from the numerous turnaround actions executed to-date and, more important, demonstrates the earnings power of adient and its ability to achieve peer-like margins are better.
speaking of the turnaround, we're also encouraged to see continued progress at adient's ss&m business. for the quarter, americas and emea metal manufacturing combined improved by about $40 million compared to last year's first quarter. the team is working extremely hard to improve the profitability and the free cash flow of that business.
despite the strong first quarter results, i would caution certain of the factors that benefited q1's earnings and margin should not be calendarized or extrapolated to the full year. for example, the timing of normal course commercial settlements and equity income favored q1 and our first half results and are not expected to have the same impact on future quarters this year. in addition, it is unlikely the extremely rich mix of production experienced in q1 will be sustainable. and finally, as doug noted, we see certain headwinds on the horizon to supply chain disruptions and rising commodity prices that are expected to have a greater impact on our results as we progress through the year.
on our q4 call last year, we noted that we expected between $40 million and $50 million of commodity headwinds in 2021 but that number has increased -- has been increasing and, today, we estimate the impact to be closer to $80 million, or $90 million to $100 million if you add increases related to freight. essentially none of this headwind was experienced in q1 and the vast majority will be seen in q3 and q4. more on that in the outlook discussion.
to ensure enough time is allocated to the q&a portion of the call, we've provided our detailed segment performance slides in the appendix of the presentation. improved business performance, including normal course commercial settlements; positive operating performance, which includes lower freight, ops waste and labor and overhead; and lower sg&a cost, partially offset by the impact of rising commodity prices, is the primary takeaway from americas and emea region.
in asia, the reduction in ebitda is explained by the sale of our interest in yfai, the non-recurrence of certain benefits recognized in last year's q1 that did not repeat this year such as the $10 million tax refund, which was partially offset by improved performance in china and volume-related weakness elsewhere in asia.
let me now shift to our cash, liquidity and capital structures on slide 13 and 14. starting with cash on slide 13. for the quarter, adjusted free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capex was $160 million for the current quarter versus $148 million in q1 fiscal '20. the year-on-year increase was the result of the combination of several factors, the most significant being the $81 million improvement in adjusted ebitda, an improvement in trade working capital and lower cap spending. partially offsetting these positive drivers was an expected increase in restructuring, higher interest paid, elevated non-income related taxes, specifically vat payments and some commercial activity. with regard to vat payments, we'd expect these to be neutral over time due to the timing of certain payments. we're expecting a negative result this year and reversing in fiscal '22.
as noted on the right hand side of the slide, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.8 billion in total liquidity comprised of cash on hand of about $1.8 billion and approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity under adient's revolving line of credit. no doubt, a very strong cash and liquidity position that we believe should provide protection against near-term macro uncertainties and enable significant debt reduction as the company progresses through fiscal '21.
speaking of that and flipping to slide 14. in addition to showing our debt and net debt position, which totaled just under $4.4 billion and approximately $2.5 billion respectively at december 31st, we've also provided a snapshot of adient's capital structure. just a few comments here. we believe adient's capital structure provides us with flexibility to weather near-term macro uncertainties such as covid or supply chain-related production stoppages and provides ample flexibility to voluntarily pay down debt.
as you are aware, we began our voluntary debt pay down during the fourth quarter with $103.5 million in principal pay down of adient's 10-year 4.875% unsecured senior notes. with the exception of a small repayment on our eib loan, in part triggered by q4's voluntary debt pay down, adient hit the pause button on voluntary debt repayments in q1 as the uptick in covid cases and supply chain disruptions clouded the near-term production outlook. we'll look to reinitiate our debt pay down initiatives in the near-term as uncertainties just mentioned lessened, which we hope is not too far away. as mentioned on past calls, over time, we'd expect to have zero outstanding balance in the revolver and run with a cash balance somewhere in the $500 million to $600 million range, which points to a significant opportunity for debt pay down in 2021.
moving on to slide 15, but sticking with the overall debt team, we included a trend chart for adient's net leverage going back to our spin date. as you can see, at the time we became an independent company, our net leverage was just under 2.0 times. unfortunately, operational issues, which were well documented throughout 2018 and '19, drove an increase in leverage. that increase was exacerbated with the impact of covid, specifically about the stoppage of vehicle production across emea and americas, which resulted in a significant drop in ebitda during our q3.
after peaking in the middle of calendar year 2020, we've seen a steady decline in our leverage ratio. the biggest drivers of the decline include the successful continuation of adient's turnaround plan, which is leading to a significant ebitda improvement and better cash generation, the lessening of covid on vehicle production and proceeds related to certain non-core divestitures that took place in fiscal '20. we'd expect the positive trend to continue as improved business performance continues to drive earnings and cash flow growth.
moving to slide 16, let me conclude with a few thoughts on what to expect as we progress through fiscal '21. while we would definitely characterize our q1 as a good quarter, it demonstrates the momentum of our turnaround efforts. i know many of you may be tempted to take our q1 results and multiply by four to get a revised full-year estimate. i wish it was that easy. we're just one quarter into the year though and the team will keep working to keep the momentum going. however, it's important to point out that there are certain adient-specific factors and macro headwinds that give us pause, it prevents us from annualizing the strong start to the year.
let's break down the specifics. starting with revenue, although we are not changing our guidance, we now expect consolidated revenue to trend toward the upper end of the range provided back in november, call it approximately $15 billion. currency movements over the past few months is the primary driver. i'd also note that even though the production and mix has remained relatively in line with our assumptions heading into the year, elevated risks of production downtime resulting from supply chain disruptions, the most significant related to semiconductor stoppages or shortages, tempers expectations in the near-term.
in fact, just yesterday, ford announced temporary production reductions for the f-150, adient's second largest vehicle platform. ford's announcement comes in the heels of gm's announcement earlier this week announcing downtime at three of their facilities beginning the week of february 8. although receiving advanced notice of downtown helps to lessen but not eliminate operating efficiencies on our side, the team is also managing through stoppages with little notice, which, as you know, has cost and inefficiencies at our facilities. of course we're working closely with our customers to understand if or when these temporary reductions can be made up.
given adient's september fiscal year, our current outlook does not assume production is made up before september 30th. outside of these near-term supply -- near-term temporary disruptions, we continue to assume second half fiscal '21 global production will decline compared with the first half of fiscal '21 production, especially in china. this assumption is aligned with our current ihs forecast.
regarding ebitda, it's early in the year and there are many uncertainties such as commodity inflation, supply chain disruptions leading to production uncertainties and the incredible uncertainties related to the direction covid will take us. given these uncertainties, we continue to forecast adjusted ebitda in the range between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, as i mentioned previously though we're pleased with our -- i should say, though we're pleased with the strong start to our year.
as doug and i mentioned, macro headwinds, including rising steel and chemical prices and premium freight, will have a much more significant impact on adient as we've progressed through the balance of the year. with regard to rising commodity prices, just a reminder, even though adient has a formal recovery mechanism, including indexing agreements in place for a significant number of our customers, the agreements provide a partial offset to price increases, let's call it, between 70% and 90% on average.
however, it's important to remind you that a time lag exist until the price adjust, as our agreements for certain customers provide for relatively quick true-ups or settlements, while other agreements, primarily with our japanese-based oems, are settled on an annual basis. given our relative overexposure to customers with more infrequent true-ups, a large proportion of the recoveries will occur in fiscal '22.
moving on to equity income, which is included in our adjusted ebitda, continues to track on plan, call it approximately $250 million. as a reminder, and noted on the right hand side of the slide, we continue to expect equity income will mirror seasonality patterns of china's vehicle production, strongest in q1, followed by a substantial decline in adient's fiscal second quarter, which tends to be impacted by lower production surrounding the chinese new year holiday. in fact, we're expecting equity income to be halved in our second quarter compared with our first quarter just completed.
interest expense, based on our expected cash balance and debt should be approximately $235 million. this forecast does not include the positive impact that would materialize with future voluntary debt pay down. cash taxes in fiscal '21 are expected to be around $85 million. it's important to remember that we maintain valuable tax attributes such as net operating loss carry forwards and that these tax attributes can be used to offset profits on a going forward basis. the cash taxes on adient's operations should remain low even as profits are increasing.
to assist with your modeling, although volatile with fluctuations between quarters, as mentioned earlier, we continue to expect adient's effective tax rate to be around 30% for fiscal '21. we'd expect that rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the valuation allowances and our geographic mix of income. capital expenditures are forecasted to range between $320 million and $340 million, essentially in line with our fiscal '20 results. although we see opportunity to reduce capex further in the outyears, driven in partially by a smaller ss&m business, the current year expenditures are supporting current launch plans.
and finally, one last item for your modeling, we continue to expect free cash flow to range between breakeven and $100 million in fiscal '21. as mentioned back in november, there are several one-off factors driving this result for fiscal '21, such as an elevated level of cash restructuring, which is expected to be at $200 million. the elevated spend, which is about 2 times our normal run rate, is necessary as we execute actions to right-size the business, especially within our european operations, where external and internal production forecast remain below pre-covid levels for a number of years.
in addition to an elevated restructuring spend, the fiscal -- the 2021 free cash flow is negatively impacted by approximately $60 million of tax payments that were deferred from last year into 2021. stripping out these one-offs, adient's free cash flow in a normal year would have been in the $160 million to $260 million range.
with that, let's move to the q&a portion of the call. operator, we'll take the first question.
",2021-Q1,ADNT
,1.0,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from john murphy with bank of america. your line is open.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, guys, and thanks for all the details. it's incredibly helpful. maybe just -- a first question is if you look at slide 16, business improvements of $35 million to $60 million in the second half of the year versus the first half, that's pretty good momentum that's continuing. how much more do you think there is to go there? i mean are you looking at that as getting back to normal industry margins on seating, is that the way we should think about that? or is there any way to sort of delineate exactly what you're going after [indecipherable] particularly in line of this pent-up restructuring spend this year, you just mentioned jeff, of $200 million?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. good question, john. thanks for the comments. the goal still remains the same to bridge or eliminate the gap we've had to our closest competitor from a margin standpoint. so, we look at that business improvement as continual portion of that. some of that is factory floor driven, some of it's better commercial success in a way more vertical integration of our business attaching to better programs, etc., of having some of the old programs that were somewhat challenging to roll off. there is a lot of components in that and all kind of falls in that business improvement. but bridging that margin gap is key.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. if i would just add to it, the historic issue we always face in the business, we have to look at the expectations that our customers have from annualized productivity and inflation, and the basis is that we have enough internal activity that more than offsets that. only thing i would add is, i think -- and this has been a theme of a few of our calls, but it's even more focus now, there is an absolute renewed interest and our customers are finding ways to drive cost reduction in their product. and that's more than just the normal bev [phonetic] activity. i can't think of a single customer that we have right now that's not at an executive level actively engaged with us to find ways to drive cost out of the product. so, i see that as incremental pathway for us to support that improvement in our financial performance.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. but sort of [indecipherable] rule of thumb is typically sort of an 18 to 24-month payback on rationalization or restructuring spend. i mean, is that the kind of thing that we should think if you're spending $200 million this year that that flows in at some reasonable level close to that by the end of two years or is that maybe too aggressive?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's about the right path for the portion of our restructuring that was efficiency aligned. you'll notice -- you'll remember that we said about a third of what we are putting out there was just responding to capacity or sort of lower volume expectations in europe, which doesn't have the same payback on that unfortunately. but about two-thirds of it should have the rough dynamics of what you said and it just sort of depends by region and people. but that's a good rule of thumb.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. in a number of places in the presentation, you kind of have these walks of factors i think like -- particularly if you look at 19 with the americas, volume and mix was small positive. but just seems like we're hearing from other companies, particularly the automakers themselves that mix was incredibly strong in the quarter. so, i'm just curious why you may not be seeing that, or is that still on the come? if we think about the first half versus second half, what kind of benefit or headwind would mix create for you? just -- because there's a lot of focus on these higher-end vehicles. i've got to imagine you got more content on them. so, i'm surprised the mix might not be stronger for you.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's a little bit of a mix, because -- no pun intended, we have just a lot of disruption in our high-end vehicles. i'd point to the ford f-150 is being one of those vehicles that i think distorting that picture a bit for us. and i would say what we're confident is once some of the chip shortage issues get resolved, we do believe there'll be a favorable mix for us. and we've always said, we've got pure compared -- a really favorable mix. but whether it was in the first half with some of the problems we had with petrochemical that created some disruption and deteriorated some of that performance or just pure volume in the second half is, again, i think what's distorting the picture for us.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly, you made some comments about your market share in bev being very strong. in europe, you're saying 50% or maybe even better. i mean, obviously, with that kind of market share would be hard to maintain in any segment. but, i mean are you really hearing there's a concern that you're going to lose out as bevs grow over time? it just seems like you have a right to play and you actually may even get better content to some degree on the trim levels to start. it just seems curious that people are concerned that as bev ramps up that you will somehow not be as well positioned, and if anything i would kind of argue the latter that you'd be better positioned. is there any reason to believe that content would go down or you'd lose market share? it just doesn't seem rational irrational line of reasoning to me.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
no. it's -- we agree with your assessment. we think we're very relevant. we think jet delivery, seat systems are still financially viable option for our customers. we think our expertise in the product particularly with new starts who just don't have that technical competency where we can provide them an array of seating products from luxury vehicles to low-end a, b segment if cost is -- of the focus of their brand strategy. so, we completely disagree with the concept.
i think the other point we'd suggest is once everyone has got evs in the market, the fact that it's just an ev isn't going to differentiate them. everyone's going to have similar products with similar range, and in some of the things that will attract buyers to a vehicle will be the functionality of the interior system. and that function drives content and our technical capability there, we think, provide solutions for our customer. that's -- so i'd point to someone like neo who has done some really creative things in their seating system. right now, we're essentially the exclusive seat supplier to them. they picked us because of our technical capability to help them with that. and i see that replaying across a broader customer group.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. great. thank you very much, guys.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, john.
operator
our next question comes from james picariello with keybanc capital markets. your line is open.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
as we think about the guidance and the helpful detail you provided in terms of the second half versus first half split, can you just confirm what the commercial settlements figure was in the quarter? it seems like it was probably $100 million plus. i just want to confirm that. and just regionally across your segments where does this have the greatest impact?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. probably europe would be the greatest impact in the quarter, where -- that amount for any given year for us is pretty similar as we said. and it's a reasonable size amount. so, maybe $300 million give or take on an average year is probably pretty reasonable for us. and just, you can see by that chart, sort of the amount of stock in the first half versus the second half, with europe being probably the big portion of activity in the second quarter.
james picariello -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then the -- within equity income, it's $20 million lower now. is that mainly or exclusively driven by the sja jv sale? and has the company already completed that divestiture? and then as we consider the broader jv transformation, right, the $1.4 billion in net proceeds coming in, any color on the timing there? and maybe where the company's net leverage heads for next year? you raised your free cash flow for fiscal '21. if we get through this year's noise into what hopefully is a cleaner recovery next year, what could be an achievable net leverage range on a pro forma basis as we sit here next year -- at the end of next year? thanks.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, i'll try to unpack a little bit of that. the sja transaction, which is part of what we announced in 12th of march, did complete at the end of the quarter. and a portion of the reason we brought our equity income down and you could see as about half attributable to that and half of it is attributable to lower volume expectations primarily driven by -- or really driven by chips, i could say. we've seen the challenges of chip availability bringing down production schedules globally and china is not immune to that either. so, that's what's reflective in our guidance.
as it relates to the timing of the transaction for the yfas deal we announced in the 12th, we're still looking really at the -- right at the end of our fiscal year. our current view is around september 30th. now, that could move a little bit, but we do expect it to be completed within calendar 2021.
as it relates to the leverage and then sort of our expectations of leverage, we did give a range of 1.5 times to 2 times as a target. we do really see ourselves to getting there. and it could be on the better side of that. a lot of it really depends on what the earnings or the operating environment looks like in 2021. as you've heard us talk about, we think the things that are within our control continue to improve, but if production is up as high as where ihs is predicting it right now, it could be a good year and it could help sort of amplify some of that deleveraging impact. but we see ourselves sort of in that range and potentially better depending on the operating environment.

our next question comes from brian johnson with barclays. your line is open.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
yes, thanks. so, in terms of your commodity recovery and the timing there, i'm thinking steel, resin/foam, is there anything else we should be looking at? and if you, by the way, if you have a good bloomberg ticker for a foam surrogate, would you look at that might be helpful?
and two, is this the kind of thing used to have a normalized cadence of getting good recoveries in fiscal fourth quarter and then giving bad recoveries the other direction in fiscal 1q, that didn't seasonality, which might have been a hallmark of the [indecipherable] ceo, is that out the door. so, i guess, the questions are kind of, one, what are the key commodities? two, timing? and then three, how does affect between the quarters?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, maybe at a high level, i'll start, and then, jeff can be a bit more specific. as far as the categories, steel and foam chemicals are certainly the most significant for us. and then when you look at recovery, you literally have to go region-by-region and customer-by-customer, but i would say all commodities are recoverable over an extended period of time. many of our customers, i would say, are traditional customers, have index agreements in place, and that allows recovery to happen on a quarterly basis. some stretch into six-month timeframe and the rest falls under an annual calculation. and then we have some customers that tend to mix things together. so, they look at a basket of issues, including commodities, and then, we negotiate those on an annual basis and takes into account all other inflationary elements. but if you extend the book and it's long enough, we think you get full recovery, at least that's what we would project at this stage.
i don't know, jeff, if you [speech overlap] little bit more specifics.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's right. i wouldn't say there's so much of the seasonality impact to it. as you mentioned, the japanese customers tend to do it once a year around their fiscal year-end, end of march. some of our customers do it every six months. some of them do it, as you said, every quarter. so, it does vary. but we tend to look at it over a three-year time horizon. and as doug said, we generally see that coming back to us. so, next year, we do see, as i mentioned, there's a tailwind for us.
brian, you also mentioned -- i couldn't actually help you on a bloomberg terminal, but we do look at the icis index for foam chemicals. so, look at tdi, mdi and polyol, and it ranges by region. and crude prices, again, by -- for hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel, we would look at those as well.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
okay. a follow-up question. just a bit of broader one. so, when you came in, it will be three years this fall i believe, doug. you had a book of business that the prior ceo had put out, frederick [phonetic] before, the interim ceo, had done and what was generally perceived in the industry is a bid to win, build the book and wait and see what happens on the billings, you talked about that it might. how do we think about what's left of the underpriced under-engineering estimated book that you came with? and how much is just a matter of having two, three years left in some of the younger programs that might have started when you were chart [phonetic] before, in effect -- i used to do a lot of work in insurance, the poorly underwritten business just rolls off?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say, the vast majority of what was underpriced or i think more importantly was stagnated in price recovery that we would normally get, because we were struggling more of the operational performance side, we just couldn't engage with the customer. i would say that's largely behind us if i were to quantify it. i think you're -- it's in the 80% range, maybe 20% are some programs that we just can't touch, because it's strategically not worth pressing the issue or they've got a couple of years left to build out and we were better to leave them alone. and that's how we always arrived at this timeline of 2024-2025 when we thought on a consolidated basis, we could close the gap on a margin perspective. so, i mean we're generally on that timeline. we've made some improvements to achieving that goal. and we mentioned, we're about a year ahead on metal and mechanism business. and that has been largely more cost driven than it's been price driven. we had some negotiations early on, we settled.
but what we found in that business is that there was a lot more opportunity to drive on the cost side than what we originally anticipated. and so that's why we were able to, i would say, expedite that improvement in that business segment over and above what we thought. so, it's always difficult to really break it down if it's price or cost and to very specifically quantify it, because many of them are just a combination of the two. it's driving costs, maybe the customer needs to approve but us being allowed of retainer, a certain portion of that. so, i don't know how you want to bucket that whether it's price or cost driven. let's just -- it's one of the nice things about our business, is that there's a lot of opportunity because of the complexity of our module to drive on the cost side and engage with our customer in commercial negotiations.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thank you.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, brian.
mark oswald -- head of investor relations
and, julie, it looks like we have time for one more question.
operator
thank you. our last question comes from joe spak with rbc capital markets. your line is open. thanks. maybe just a few questions. the first one here is, obviously, we've seen a strategy at the automakers and players is partially building these vehicles. and i know seating is generally sort of just in time. but are you still believe you're still shipping to these partially built vehicles? and if so, do you have any indication of how much that may have sort of impacted you relative to final vehicle assembly?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i don't think it's had a direct impact on us. with one -- maybe one isolated case with ford on their f-150 where we had to retrofit-i think it was some 20,000 vehicles due to petrochemical shortages. with that as an exception, in which we've now provided those and those vehicles have been retrofitted, the partial-built shouldn't have had an impact on us at all, since we would have been able to recognize that revenue, because we delivered the product and they installed in the vehicle even though they vetted on the sideline until they can get semiconductors in.
joseph spak -- rbc capital market -- analyst
okay. and then just maybe -- just -- sorry i understand there's some commercial settlements like -- it sounds like it was a sizable number in the quarter, but just so i understand maybe the accounting, i look at that sort of in a modified cash flow statement, it looks like it $70 million cash outflow. so, is there a timing difference between when you recognize the settlement and when you actually get the cash?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, a lot of times what you're seeing on that portion of it is movement in the accrual in the quarter. but think of it as -- as i've always kind of said, every month, every day we accrue for some element of customer give back or maybe other issues that are out there with the customer. and then, just in time nature of our business has many commercial tie-ins to our customers that agree on shift patterns and the like. so, if things vary significantly, we might have a claim to a customer. but what you generally saw in the quarter is that there is a number of things that we settled out with our customer that went to the -- essentially to lower our accrual balance during the quarter, and that's what you see in the cash flow. every other period, we expect that accrual will continue to build in other periods. and there is just more settlements of commercial activity in the quarter. it was some conducive for it with the nature of where covid was sitting and production levels that we closed on a lot of our 2021 productivity agreements with our customers during the quarter.
joseph spak -- rbc capital market -- analyst
so, when we think about your free cash flow [speech overlap] is that relatively neutral for the balance -- for the entirety of the year?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, we think it's going to be neutral for the entire year. but for the quarter, it had the impact.
joseph spak -- rbc capital market -- analyst
okay. thanks for that clarification.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. anything else, joe?
joseph spak -- rbc capital market -- analyst
no, we're good. thanks.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay.
mark oswald -- head of investor relations
great. thanks, joe.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer

mark oswald -- head of investor relations

",-0.8782,1.0,2021-05-06 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
welcome, and thank you for standing by. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the call over to mr. mark oswald, head of investor relations. sir, you may begin.
mark oswald -- head of investor relations
thank you, julie. good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review adient's results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. the press release and presentation slides for our call today have been posted to the investors section of our website at adient.com. as usual this morning, i'm joined by doug del grosso, adient's president and chief executive officer; and jeff stafeil, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. on today's call, doug will provide an update on the business, followed by jeff who will review our q2 financial results and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. after our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions.
before i turn the call over to doug and jeff, there are few items i'd like to cover. first, today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. these statements are based on the environment as we see it today and therefore involve risks and uncertainties. i would caution you that our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements made on the call. please refer to slide 2 of our presentation for a complete safe harbor statement.
in addition to the financial results presented on a gaap basis, we will be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures to the closest gaap equivalent can be found in the appendix of our full earnings release.
this concludes my comments. i'll now turn the call over to doug. doug?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
great. thanks, mark. good morning, and thanks to our investors, prospective investors and analysts joining the call this morning as we review our second quarter results for fiscal 2021. i hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy.
turning to slide 4, let me begin with a few comments related to our second quarter. simply put, adient delivered solid results despite turbulent production environment. remaining focused on our priorities, which continue to drive improvements in adient's business performance, enabled the company to partly offset a variety of macro and industry-related headwinds.
focusing on the left-hand side of the slide, adient's q2 adjusted ebitda of $303 million was up $92 million or 44% year-on-year. if you recall, last year's results included the negative impact of significantly lower production in china, which impacted adient's equity income. production stoppages across europe and the americas were just beginning toward the end of march as covid-19 started to impact the industry in those markets.
adient's adjusted ebitda margin performance of 7.9% or 6.5% excluding equity income was up 190 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively, versus q2 of last year. i point this out as a proof point that the company continues to close the margin gap with our nearest competitor. just one more point on adient's adjusted ebitda. the performance in q2, much like q1 of this year, was aided by the phasing of our commercial settlements, which for fiscal year '21 is heavily weighted toward the first half. jeff and i will have additional color on half one and half two influence in just a minute.
adient's q2 ending cash balance and total liquidity were approximately $984 million and $1.9 billion, respectively. cash balance was impacted by approximately $700 million of cash used during the quarter to voluntarily pay down a portion of the company's debt. specifically, $700 million was used to successfully tender $640 million in aggregate principal of the company's 7% senior notes. subsequent to the quarter, adient exercised an early redemption option of $80 million in principal on the 7% notes, leaving a small stub of $80 million of 7% notes outstanding, which we expect to take out relatively soon.
lastly, keeping with capital structure theme, adient amended, extended and upsized its term loan b. no doubt these actions are good first steps in transforming the company's capital structure. jeff will have more on the topic in just a few minutes.
on the right-hand side of the slide, we've highlighted a few of the negative headwinds the team has and continues to manage through as a result of unplanned production stoppages at our customers. these disruptions were driven by the well-documented semiconductor and petrochemicals supply chain disruptions, which ultimately resulted in lower sales; operating inefficiencies, as many of the stoppages and production happened with little or no advanced warning; increased freight costs, which were rising as we ended the quarter, but increased significantly due to petrochemical supply chain issues in north america to name a few. continued improvement in the company's business performance helped lessen the impact of these headwinds. i wish i could report 100% of these issues are behind us. unfortunately, certain of the headwinds, such as production disruptions driven by chip shortages have continued in our fiscal third quarter. as you would expect, the team is working hard to help mitigate the negative impact.
turning to slide 5. in addition to executing actions to mitigate current headwinds and strengthen the business in the near term, adient also begin to execute actions to transform the business long term. the first action involves adient strategic transformation in china. as announced in mid-march, adient entered into definitive agreements with our joint venture partner yanfeng to end its yfas joint venture in china. the transactions complemented -- contemplated by these agreements upon closing will allow adient to independently manage our business in china, which is expected to result in a variety of benefits, including capturing growth in profitable and expanding segments; improving the integration of the company's china operations; and allowing for more certain value realization relative to the status quo, where cash and value are generated from dividends at entities not in adient's control.
as mentioned in march, we expect to remain a leader in china market. projections of what the china business looks like will include: annual sales of about $4.5 billion, including both consolidated and non-consolidated sales; we'll have nine major entities with extensive customer and geographic coverage; our complete in-house engineering capabilities will be seconded [phonetic] and non-supportive by three global tech centers with more than 800 engineers. this is expected to result in adient being on par with and among the top three complete seats players in the market, which based on our estimates, equates to a market share of just under 20%.
we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for adient in the china market. equally exciting is the transformation that is under way with adient's capital structure. executing the company's strategic transformation in china, combined with the cash on balance sheet and improvement in business performance provided a unique opportunity for adient to make transformational changes to our capital structures. i just manage -- mentioned the progress made through april with 7% notes, tender offer, early redemption of the term loan b agreement. these actions placed us on a solid path to de-risking the balance sheet and achieving our leverage target between 1.5 times and 2.0 times.
turning to slide 6, let me provide a few comments on adient's business wins and how we're strengthening our leading market position. the big part of the story, as we've communicated over the past several quarters, has been our intense focus on profitable business wins. these include new business, conquest business and replacement business. alternative powertrain programs, such as b-e-v, or bev, have also been a big component of our recently awarded business. although the seating business is generally immune to the market shift toward bevs, we're excited to see the company's success at capturing bev programs accelerating. not only with these programs strengthen our diversification, they also provide adient with an opportunity to participate in clean technologies.
a question was recently raised as to whether or not adient can retain its leading market position given the proliferation of bev platforms, especially, platforms produced by non-legacy manufacturers. the simple answer is, yes. adient's acceleration of bev wins and the production assumptions associated with the platform suggest that our future market share will be commensurate with adient's current leading market position. let me share a few steps that give us reason to be optimistic.
in emea, adient is presently the market leader with approximately 50% share of complete seat bev market. we expect the wins to continue, giving us confidence that we'll retain our leadership position over the next few years.
in china, legacy oems and new entrants wins with oems like xpeng and nio are expected to drive a steady increase in adient's market share at the complete seat bev market over the next several years, outpacing bev sales growth over the same period. speaking of nio, i'm pleased to report adient's joint venture cq-adient was recently awarded the nio quality premium partner award for 2021, a great accomplishment and another proof point of adient's ability to provide quality products and services to all of our customers, both new and legacy.
in north america, where adoption of bevs has lagged other markets, adient is well positioned given our recent accelerating wins. in fact, if i look over the next several years, we expect our complete bev sales to grow appreciably versus our current bev sales. adient's expected pace of growth far exceeds the bev sales growth rate over the same period.
turning to slide 7. as we typically do we've highlighted several critical launches that are complete, in process or scheduled to begin in the near term. i'm happy to report at the midway point, in this fiscal year, the team's continued focus on process discipline around launch readiness is underpinning adient's successful performance. in addition to the ford f-150 launch, which is in the rearview mirror, the team has also completed successful launches of the volkswagen id.3, mercedes b-class and faw-vw golf a8. we're pleased with our continued success, especially considering the heavy launch load, particularly in north america, and many temporary production disruptions that took place during the quarter. we have no intention of letting up and look to finish the year strong with the launches that are in process and scheduled to begin in the third and fourth quarter.
turning to slide 8, my commentary this morning touches several components of how the company is driving value to our stakeholders. first, the team's continued execution of the company's turnaround plan, the success, the actions implemented are very transparent as illustrated within our improved financial results, not only for adient's second quarter results announced today, but for the past several quarters. business improvement has spanned across operations and segments, most notable being the improvement within adient's metal business, which as we highlighted last month at an investor conference, is now forecast to be free cash flow breakeven in fiscal year '21, one year ahead of schedule. although we've made significant progress in closing the margin gap with our nearest peer over the past 12 to 18 months, more work lies ahead, which we're confident will drive few other -- further earnings and cash flow growth.
second, we continue to strengthen our leading market position with profitable new business wins. as i mentioned just a few moments ago, an accelerating component of that growth is the -- is related to ev platform wins across legacy oems and new entrants.
third, with operations steadily improving and our market position strengthening, adient is now in a position to execute strategic transformations to the business. actions executed and announced to date include: various portfolio adjustments made in the fiscal year '20; the strategic transformation announced for adient's business in china; and the transformation that is taking place with adient's capital structure. we're confident this comprehensive plan, when properly executed, will further adient's for a sustained long-term success driving additional value to our stakeholders.
of course, this is the auto industry and we're going to see speed bumps along the way. it's important we stay focused and manage through the headwinds, much like we did last year through the first two quarters of 2021. rest assured, the team is working hard to navigate them. team is working hard not only to deliver on our fiscal year '21 commitments, but also to position the company for sustained success. our first half results provide a solid pathway to achieving our goals.
before turning the call over to jeff, let me conclude my remarks with few comments around the major influences that drove adient's first half performance, and more importantly, what we're expecting for the second half of our fiscal year.
on slide 9, you can see the overlap of the two circles. improved business performance, including launch performance, lower ops waste, and lower normal course sg&a costs drove improved profitability in h1. we'd expect the trend of ongoing business improvement to continue in the second half of fiscal 2021. as mentioned earlier on the call, a portion of the improved business performance have been partially offset by temporary operating inefficiencies resulting from unplanned production stoppages, adverse weather and covid-19. these influences had a significant impact on adient's second quarter results and are expected to influence our third quarter results as well.
looking at the far left circle, we've highlighted influences that provide a significant benefit to our first half results. but due to timing or changing macro conditions are not expected to have the same impact in our second half results. these include:
commercial settlements, excluding the approximate $25 million in one-time settlements called out on our q1 earnings call, the absolute size of settlements expected in fiscal year '21 are similar compared to past performance. however, the phasing of commercial settlements this year are heavily weighted toward half one. this is especially true in europe and driven by a number of factors, including timing of lta payments, timing of recoveries and lower volumes in fiscal 2020, which drove settlements and accrual true-ups in early 2021.
strong volumes and temporary covid savings supported our h1 results. however, as we look at h2, volume is expected to be down versus h1 and temporary savings from covid actions will be much smaller.
two other h1 influences expected to shift as the year progresses include: equity income, strong in half one, however, half two results will be negatively impacted by the expected decline in volume and divestiture of our sja joint venture; and adient's engineering spend, which is expected to be greater in half two versus half one. the shift or heavy concentration in have two is largely driven by previous program delays.
in addition to the changes expected to the major h1 influences, we also expect increased commodity prices and increased freight cost to have a much more significant impact in our second half results.
with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff to take us through adient's second quarter 2021 financial performance and to provide a little bit more color on what to expect as we move through the second half of fiscal 2021.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
great. thanks, doug. good morning, everyone.
i'll start on slide 11. and adhering to our typical format, the page is formatted with our reported results on the left and our adjusted results on the right-hand side of the page. we will focus our commentary on the adjusted results, which exclude special items that we view as either one-time in nature or otherwise skew important trends in the underlying performance.
for the quarter, the biggest drivers of the difference between our reported and our adjusted results relate to a gain on the sale of related to the sja divestiture, transaction cost, financing-related adjustments specifically the premium paid to repurchase the debt and write-off the deferred financing charges, our restructuring cost and purchase accounting amortization. details of these adjustments are in the appendix of the presentation.
just one more comment before jumping into the results. you'll notice the company continued and will continue to report yfas earnings in equity income until the transaction closes as we legally still own our 49.99% interest. if you recall, we had stopped recording yfai equity income last year when we announced the sale, because we were in an impairment position, which required us to effectively impair our investment based on the recoverable amount via the sales price. we're in a much different situation with the yfas transaction.
for the quarter, sales were $3.8 billion, up about 9% year-over-year, which were in line with internal expectations and primarily driven by improved volume across the regions. portfolio adjustments executed in fiscal '20, which impacted the year-over-year comparison by about $32 million, was a partial offset.
adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $303 million, up $92 million or 44% year-on-year, more than explained by an increase in equity income, volume and mix, and improved business performance. the improvement in business performance was achieved despite numerous temporary operating inefficiencies stemming from supply chain shortages, adverse weather in north america and ongoing covid-related influences; more on that in just a minute.
finally, adjusted net income and eps were up significantly year-over-year at $110 million and $1.15, respectively.
now, let's move down our second quarter results in more detail. starting with revenue on slide 12. we reported consolidated sales of $3.8 billion, an increase of $308 million compared to the same period a year ago. key drivers of the year-over-year increase included a $219 million benefit related to higher volumes and the positive impact of currency movements between the two periods of about $121 million. the positive benefits of volume and fx were partially offset by just over $30 million of headwinds related to portfolio adjustments executed in fiscal '20, namely the divestiture of our fabrics business.
as you can see from the table on the right-hand side of the slide, adient's consolidated sales achieved growth over market in americas, emea and china, primarily driven by a strong product mix in adient customer composition. adient sales in korea faced some temporary headwinds, driven by customer launches and model changeovers.
with regard to adient's unconsolidated seating revenue, year-over-year results were up approximately 70% excluding fx. in china, where the majority of our unconsolidated seating entities exist, unconsolidated sales were up 87% year-over-year excluding fx. adient's sales outperformance versus the market is attributable to adient's strong mix of business, specifically our exposure to luxury and japanese oems. as a reminder, q2 production in china last year was significantly impacted by production stoppages resulting from covid-19.
moving to slide 13. we provided a bridge of adjusted ebitda to show the performance of our segments between periods. the bucket labeled corporate represents central costs that are not allocated back to the operation, such as executive office, communications, corporate finance, legal and marketing.
big picture: adjusted ebitda was $303 million in the current quarter versus $211 million last year. key drivers of the increase included:
an increase in equity income of $43 million. the improved equity income was driven by higher volume and strong vehicle mix in china. if you recall, last year's q2 production in china was significantly impacted by covid-19 production stoppages.
increased volume and strong mix were also present across americas and europe. in total, volume and mix benefited the quarter by approximately $33 million year-on-year.
in addition, improved business performance, which consisted of normal course, commercial settlements, lower launch and ops waste, and lower labor and overhead drove a $24 million net benefit to the most recent quarter.
important to note, the business performance bucket contained several temporary operating inefficiencies that in effect masked the ongoing -- true ongoing operating performance of the company. the temporary inefficiencies, which included ops waste and labor and overhead inefficiencies and increased premium freight, to name a few, were primarily driven by supply chain disruptions and unplanned production stoppages related to the semiconductor shortages, petrochemical disruptions, and to a lesser extent covid-19. in total, approximately $40 million of inefficiencies were recognized in q2 fiscal 2021. we expect certain of these temporary headwinds to continue into the second half of the year; more on that in a few minutes.
outside of the temporary operating inefficiencies, net commodity increases impacted the quarter by about $8 million, and other employee compensation measures impacted the sg&a bucket by approximately $25 million. in the end, given all of the moving pieces, the team worked hard to lessen the impact of the temporary headwinds to deliver the $92 million year-over-year improvement.
i'll also note at the bottom of the slide, metals continues to move in a positive direction, as that business was up about $29 million compared to last year's second quarter.
to ensure enough time is allocated to the q&a portion of the call, we've provided our detailed segment performance slides in the appendix of the presentation. a high level, improved volume and mix benefited each of the regions. ongoing business performance continue to trend in a positive direction, however, temporary operating inefficiencies resulting from the unplanned production stoppages masked to the overall improvement;
sg&a costs continue to trend lower, however, the temporary benefits recognized last year did not repeat, partially offset this quarter's performance. this was especially true in the americas where planned production stoppages, inclement weather and premium freight resulted in approximately $30 million of temporary operating inefficiencies. sg&a in the region was impacted by about $25 million of headwinds, stemming from temporary benefits recognized last year. in asia, increased equity income, which benefited from improved volume and mix in china, was the primary driver of the segment's improved results.
now, let me shift to our cash, liquidity and capital structure on slides 14 and 15. starting with cash on slide 14, i'll focus on the year-to-date results as the longer timeframe helps move some of the volatility in working capital movements. adjusted free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capex, was $14 million. the $145 million improvement in adjusted ebitda net of equity and $60 million reduction in cap spending was more than offset by expected increases in restructuring of $60 million, increase in interest paid of $30 million, elevated non-income tax related -- taxes, specifically vat payments, and timing of commercial activity. with regard to the vat payments, while some of the year-to-date outflow will reverse in the second half, we'd expect larger than normal outflows in fiscal '21 and '22 related to government approved delays from 2020 related to covid accommodations.
as noted on the right-hand side of the slide, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion total liquidity, comprised of cash on hand of about $984 million and approximately $945 million of undrawn capacity under adient's revolving line of credit. cash used during the quarter to voluntary paydown debt totaled about $700 million.
speaking of debt and flipping to slide 15, in addition to showing our debt and net debt position, which totaled just under $3.7 billion and approximately $2.7 billion, respectively, at march 31st, we've also provided a snapshot of adient's capital structure. as noted on slide, efforts to transform the balance sheet began in earnest during q2 and subsequent to quarter end. actions included:
the successful completion of a tender offer for $640 million in aggregate principal of the company's 7% senior first lien notes due in 2026, which occurred in march. subsequent to the quarter end and sticking with the 7% notes, the company exercised an early redemption option on $80 million in principal of the notes, leaving a small $80 million stub outstanding at the end of april. a second early redemption option of the remaining $80 million of principal is expected to be exercised and completed relatively soon, which will fully take out these 7% notes.
also following the quarter end, the company successfully amended and extended its term loan b. the amendment, among other changes, extends the maturity date of the loans outstanding to april 8, 2028, reduces the interest rate to libor plus 350 versus libor plus 425, our previous term loan, and establishes incremental term loans in aggregate principal of $214 million. adient is solidly on track to make a transformational change in its capital structure as we progress through 2021.
moving to slide 16, let me spend a few minutes expanding on doug's comments around the major influences that drove adient's first half performance, and importantly, what we're expecting for the second half of our fiscal year. specifically, how these influences, doug spoke to on slide 9, impact adjusted ebitda in the second half of the year.
on the left-hand side of the slide, you can see our actual first half results, with consolidated ebitda of $534 million and equity income of $147 million, which combined totals $681 million. based on the midpoint of our '21 -- fiscal '21 adjusted ebitda guidance, which remains at between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, the implied second half adjusted ebitda would total about $370 million, comprised of consolidated adjusted ebitda of about $285 million and equity income of about $85 million.
the table to the right highlights key factors that are expected to influence full year earnings and compares the expected impact on adjusted ebitda in the second half versus the first half of the year. the phasing of commercial settlements, for the reasons discussed, is expected to be the biggest factor of the lower earnings in the second half versus the first half, call it, between $125 million and $150 million. again, absolute full year levels are in line with prior results, excluding the $25 million of one-offs noted in q1, but fiscal '21 is significantly skewed to the first half.
rising commodity prices, as mentioned on previous calls, are much more significant in h2, call it, between $50 million and $75 million.
timing of engineering spend and non-repeat of temporary covid benefits expected to impact the second half -- are expected to impact the second half by between $25 million and $50 million, and $10 million in $35 million, respectively.
and finally, the lower level of volume that is expected in h2 versus h1 will impact second half comparison by between $25 million and $50 million.
masked by these temporary influences is a continued upward trajectory and business performance of between $35 million and $60 million. in total, these influences are expected to result in h2 consolidated adjusted ebitda, declining between $200 million to $300 million compared with h1.
and finally, incorporating the approximate $60 million reduction in equity income that is expected in h2, total adjusted ebitda will likely decline by some $260 million to $360 million versus the first half results.
two important items to note: first, business performance continues to improve as we progress through the back half of the year; and second, many of these factors are temporary in nature are driven by timing. in fact, if you look at the far-right column, we provide an early view on how we expect these factors to impact fiscal '22.
first and foremost, continued business performance is expected -- improvement in business performance is expected; volume based on third-party forecast is expected to trend higher; net commodity prices should become a tailwind; commercial settlements and engineering spend are expected to be relatively flat; and equity income, adjusted for the completion of our strategic transformation in china, should be relatively flat.
no doubt the temporary factors just discussed are having a significant impact on fiscal '21. in fact, if you adjust for approximately $85 million of commodities, $40 million in event -- inefficiency and $35 million of volume impact at the back half of '21 would be around $160 million better compared to the back half of fiscal 2019, which demonstrates the improved business performance of the company.
with that, let's flip to slide 17 and review our complete outlook for fiscal '21. starting with revenue, our guidance has not changed. we continue to expect consolidated revenue to trend between $14.6 billion and $15.0 billion. looking at second half production, as mentioned earlier, we continue to assume second half fiscal '21 global production will decline compared with the first half of fiscal '21 production. in addition, risks of production downtime resulting from supply chain disruptions remain elevated, especially in the near term.
we just walked through the drivers of adjusted ebitda, which we are forecasting to range between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion.
moving on to equity income, which is included in our adjusted ebitda, is now forecast to be around $230 million for the year. the $20 million reduction from previous forecast, provided back in february, reflects the divestiture of our sja joint venture and lower volumes due to the semiconductor shortages.
interest expense, based on our recent debt paydown, term loan b amendment and expected cash balance, is now forecast to be approximately $215 million, with $250 million of actual cash interest spend. this forecast does not include the positive impact that would materialize with future voluntary debt paydown.
cash taxes in fiscal '21 are expected to be around $85 million. it's important to remember that we maintain valuable tax attributes, such as net operating loss carry forwards and that these tax attributes can be used to offset profit on an ongoing or on a going forward basis. so, cash taxes on adient's operations should remain low, even as profits are increasing.
to assist with your modeling, although volatile with fluctuations between quarters, as mentioned earlier, we expect to adient's effective tax rate to be in the mid 20% range, down slightly versus the previous guide of around 30% for fiscal '21. we'd expect that rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the valuation allowances and our geographic mix of income.
no change to our capital expenditures, which we expect to range between $320 million and $340 million, essentially in line with fiscal '20 results. although we see opportunity to reduce capital expenditures further in the out years, driven in part by a smaller ss&m business, the current year expenditures are supporting current launch plans.
and finally, one last item for your modeling, we now expect free cash flow to range between $50 million and $150 million in fiscal '21, up $50 million from our previous estimates, primarily driven by better than expected dividends in china.
as previously mentioned, there are several one-off factors driving this result for '21 such as an elevated level of restructuring, which is expected to be around $200 million, the elevated spend, which is about 2 times the normal run rate is necessary as we execute actions to right size the business especially within our european operations where external and internal production forecast remain below pre-covid levels for a number of years.
in addition to an elevated restructuring spend, the 2021 free cash flow was negatively impacted by approximately $30 million of tax payments that were deferred from last year into 2021. stripping out these one-offs, adient's free cash flow, in a normal year, would have been in the $180 million to $280 million range.
with that, let's move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. operator, first question please.
",2021-Q2,ADNT
-0.9592,1.0,,0.96465,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question is from rod lache with wolfe research. you may go ahead.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning, everybody. a couple of things. one is, i was just hoping you can clarify the $200 million commodity headwind that you described for next year, that's just the 30% of the $650 million, i believe. just to confirm, is that relative to 2021? or is that relative to 2020 and because you did -- you are absorbing about $80 million this year?
and then secondly, can you just discuss the nature of the inefficiencies? you mentioned on one slide, $300 million for the year, which i think included some revenue impact, but -- and separately, you talked about $53 million for the quarter, which may not have included anything. i'm not sure if that's apples-and-apples. but basically, should we view the $300 million impact is a likely tailwind at some point once production normalizes?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, rod, i'll start on those. the first question as it relates to the material inflation and the net impact, that $200 million was compared to 2021, and you're right, 2021 at $80 million. and it doesn't exactly -- i think the computation was about that 30%. it's sort of a mix of the lag we have and then the timing of the recoveries. so it's -- that would be if we just ran through with the mechanical agreements as they stand today.
as i mentioned, we're working just with the size of the increases, those mechanisms don't make sense for a supplier like ourselves that essentially is putting value add to materials. so we're working with our teams and our customers to help improve that, but that's where it would fall out if no actions were put forward, about $200 million in 2022 versus 2021.
as it relates to the second part of your question on the $300 million, about $200 million of it relates to volume. and you can say the rest, there's the chemical supply chain issues were a bit over 40-ish. there's some container and freight type of issues, which were north of 25%. there are still some covid-related issues that were sort of the balance there to get to the... [technical issues]
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and what is a reasonable kind of aspirational target for recovery of commodities? and if you could just maybe help us a little bit with bridging beyond 2022. i mean you'll do $950 million of ebitda this year. you'll lose about maybe $200 million or so from the china equity income sale, but you're going to recover at least this $100 million of inefficiency and i presume this $80 million of commodities.
and then in your last 10-q, there was some disclosure about 5,000 remaining headcount reduction, which might be $300 million. so just kind of high level, what are you sort of aspiring toward as far as margin recovery as we think beyond this? i know you've got the longer-term mid-8% margin, but as we think about -- maybe 2023.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. no, all good questions, rod, and we're in the process of putting a lot of that together, but i'll give you a few crumbs here and we'll obviously work to expand. but right now with -- i guess i'd start with volume running at 14.3% to 14.5% or so in volume this year, we think that's a depressed level. as -- and timing of chip production coming back is a bit uncertain here. we expect to probably hit at least our first quarter of 2022 still in some fashion, if not further. but we would expect volume to improve.
we certainly would expect a lot of those inefficiencies to improve, if not fully go away. we'll continue to chip away at the material inflation issues. we'd also get a big benefit if we start to see some reductions in material prices. every i highlight the steel forecast, everyone you look at, continues to show that the next month or next couple of months, it's going to start to go down. it just hasn't done that yet, and that's created some of the challenges for us. we continue to drive the things that are internally within our control.
i see nice improvements on our cost structure, see nice improvements on our manufacturing efficiencies, our ci benefits, et cetera, the vave program we've put in place. so the margin expansion and the benefits we have from the restructuring are still there. so it's really going to be largely dependent upon the success we have of going after that material inflation and the pace of recovery on the underlying market.
doug del grosso -- president, chief executive officer
yes. rob, this is doug gogo. so i would just add to that, relative to material inflation, i would characterize that it is somewhat concentrated across a small group of customers. as jeff has mentioned, we've got a wide variety of agreements. some are working reasonably well and others are working less well, and that's why we've had the impact that we've talked about for this year. and so as we go after that, we're approaching it kind of in three ways. one is it can naturally correct itself.
we're not sitting on our hands waiting for that to happen. we're heavily engaged with the concentrated customer base where we have those issues. i would say it's a customer base that i feel pretty confident that we can make some ground in those discussions. i'm not here today to peg a number, but it's customers that we've got excellent relationships with. and our level of patients is going to be measured to a certain degree on a longer-term outlook with those customers.
right now, we've not done anything i would call super aggressive as we deal with this issue because we always have to keep in mind we want to sustain relationship with these customers and taking into account our backlog and new business opportunities is on our mind as we engage in those discussions.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question is from brian johnson with barclays. you may go ahead.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
yes. obviously, margins being the topic of the day. if we -- how do we get a sense of in emea, it still looks like even if you exclude the $18 million business inefficiency to step down from last quarter. you talked about commodities. and obviously, that went up in americas where you, of course, have the metalforming working on winding down. but what has to happen in emea? and what's your level of confidence in getting that segment back to 7% and eventually pure margins?
doug del grosso -- president, chief executive officer
well, i'll start. and obviously, jeff can comment as well. i think when you look at emea, what we talked about last quarter was i don't want to say a bit an unusually high level of commercial settlements that occurred.
they occur every year, so it's not completely unusual. it was just calendarized a higher level than normal that i think distorts a little bit of the margin picture. and i would suggest you have to look at emea margin over a longer period than a quarter-to-quarter because of that phenomenon where we just settle up on a lot of issues, and that tends to occur in q2.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. q1, q2. as i think you look at the emea picture, the ss&m business has been improving. i think we continue to hit all the operating metrics and other portions there. the metal movements are not helpful for that. so margin is certainly there. and it's a region that's been -- i highlighted in my comments, the short time frame that we've had to react to call-offs in volume in americas, but the europe situation is very similar and their ability to react to those is even less from a worker standpoint to flex cost base.
so the operating environment has not been helpful for emea in where we're sitting. but from an overall metric standpoint, i think we've been pleased on the operating performance with that region. the restructuring that we're continuing to put through there will continue to drive some improvements as well. but we need a much more stable operating environment. and ideally, a quicker and better sort of mechanisms to deal with the current commodity inflation issues.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
okay. and then secondly, when i set plants, one plant-to-plant manager majors actually one of your competitors was that there's -- the jit plant is just the tip of the iceberg. there's a whole supply chain, including freight, cross-docking facilities upstream from that. so to what extent is the nature of your supply chain driving premium freight? and then can that be part of your recoveries?
doug del grosso -- president, chief executive officer
sure. with the exception of, i'll say, ocean freight, which has had a pretty significant impact on us when we're bringing components in from namely asia, both in the u.s. americas and emea region, i would say the impact has been relatively small at this stage. now that as these mounting pressures continue, certainly, our suppliers will want to come in and talk about it. but we've not experienced a lot of supply chain.
in some cases, we've got directed suppliers, who we're completely immune from any issue associated with it. so i would characterize the issue, the inefficiencies, mainly in our internal operation and the fact that we're -- we've got a fair amount of vertical integration. so it's all inclusive. yes, it hits us hard in the jit environment because when the customer shuts down with one or two days' notice, we just have to stop immediately. in the -- as we go further down the supply chain, we have an ability to manage that a little bit more effectively.
we can build inventory. i think you've seen a little bit of increase in inventory as we moved into this quarter, so we can offset some of that. i don't know we've got jerome here who runs her operations and in the americas regions. anything you want to add to that, jerome?
jerome dorlack -- executive vice president
yes. i mean i think as doug said, within the jit site and jeff quoted some numbers earlier around one to three days and in that even maybe smaller window that flows down then to our component plants, we're at 60% of notification falls into that, and it really puts the challenge on jit. but as you slow down in because of our vertical integration, it's not such an impact no.
the west coast, specifically the west coast and the port delays there for parts coming in from asia has been a real constraint for us, and we've actively worked to reroute freight away from the west coast. so bring it in either on the east coast of the u.s. now or bringing it in further north into canada and moving it down. so i think, brian, we've done everything we can to really actively manage those aspects of it to mitigate the impacts further down in the supply chain. jit has really been the bigger issue for us.
doug del grosso -- president, chief executive officer
but we have paid a lot of [indecipherable] and dedicated. yes. i'd say the biggest issue to us has been on cost. freight expense has gone up, driver shortages, all kinds of things have -- and i mentioned a $27 million bump in our overall freight. also just with when the chemical supply issues hit us, we were sending airplanes of chemicals to meet customer demand. so freight has definitely been an issue, but it's been more on the cost side.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. and that's embedded in that $300 million number that we put out in the beginning. so that was very much a specific incident that drove those inefficiencies into the supply base. but not really characteristic, i'd say, overall chip shortage.
brian johnson -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from joe spak with rbc capital markets. you may go ahead.
joe spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, good morning. as we look through some of the walks in the back, i get the operational impact from these temporary inefficiencies you're talking about, i also noticed, i guess, like in americas, for instance, and i believe in emea as well, there was a year-over-year headwind from launch. so i guess you guys have performed better on launch. is this just like a lack of execution on launch or just actual like launch costs are higher because you're launching more programs?
jerome dorlack -- executive vice president
yes. good morning, joe. so this is really around -- if you take the americas, in particular, it's the volume of launch that's running through the system. so it isn't an efficiency associated with launch is just year-over-year launch load. and so if you look at like p42q1 and the programs we're launching in tennessee for nissan, as an example, that's a full value chain program for us.
so we have the jit, the trim, the foam and the metals. and so it's a good business. it just -- it's a significant amount of launch load coming into the business. but in terms of launch inefficiency and successive launch, we continue to trend very well from that standpoint. and it's reflected, doug talked a little bit about the customer awards. nissan was one in particular for a recent launch that we had. and so i'd say we have a high level of control on our launches. it's just the launch flow that's coming into the business on a year-over-year standpoint.
doug del grosso -- president, chief executive officer
and not a year ago in covid, there were no launches.
joe spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes, that's -- i guess that's what i was sort of getting at. and then sorry if i missed this, a little bit of busy morning. but is there sort of any more refined timing update on all the china transactions when that can close and when we can sort of see that new balance sheet?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. no, the good news is no expected changes at this point. we're still on target. we think, to close the transaction in september by the end of september. and just -- and the proceeds dynamic is still the same as we outlined on march 12 when we announced the transaction. so roughly half the dollars come in on that date and then the rest is paid by the end of december. and we still expect that time line
doug del grosso -- president, chief executive officer
december of '21.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. correct. yes, this december.
joe spak -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question is from dan levy with credit suisse. you may go ahead.
dan levy -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning, thank you. i apologize if i missed this earlier, but i think you mentioned in your slides slides about the commercial negotiations. there's a little bit of roll up your sleeves. so maybe you could give us a sense of how the dynamics work on the commercial negotiations given the higher input costs?
what's the typical timing of when you might be able to recover that? and then maybe you could just give us the latest on how that would comp versus typical recoveries, which i think you said is like $300 million in a typical year. so just trying to size out what the commercial recoveries could be? and then what's left on call it, lower hanging fruit, which i think you said is mostly exhausted?
doug del grosso -- president, chief executive officer
yes. so i'll start at a macro level. dan, this is douglas del grosso. and then, obviously, jeff and jerome can provide some additional details. so i'd first start out, we signaled commodity economics inflation was going to be an issue in -- during our q2 call. so this isn't anything that we didn't see coming.
what's been challenging is what we felt the impact was going to be versus what it is now has been continually changing. and that's the one slide we have in the deck that just shows every preceding month forecast is at a higher level for an extended period of time. that said, we've gotten in front of every single one of our customers. this has not been, i'll say, a traditional discussion that we've had.
we've gone to extremely high levels of our customer, explaining with a great amount of transparency, the impact that it has relative to each one of their recovery mechanisms and why this is such an issue for us, not only in fiscal year '21. but if inflationary costs continue continue into '22, and it needs to be addressed. as i mentioned, it's concentrated across a few customers.
in some cases, we have mechanisms that are in place that better manage the situation. the issue that they have is these mechanisms are historic mechanisms that have been in place for quite some time in most cases. and the change these is a pretty fundamental change for our customers to enact. it's not like a specific commercial issue. they felt that they've got a mechanism in place, and it's just this really erratic situation we have right now that's causing it not to work.
but they understand it. i think what i feel good about is with those customers. they are customers that we're pretty well positioned with. i think we've got outstanding relationships with, and i think they appreciate the value we bring. it's -- the only reason i would say i'm reluctant to put a time on it is it's still a pretty fluid situation. and as commodity costs continue to increase, it's hard to really peg what the final impact is going to be and put some brackets around it.
so we'll be working on it through this quarter, we'll have better visibility of where we're at as we go to q4, and we start talking about our '22 outlook. but it's going to -- it's more than an issue that will take a quarter to resolve. but i'm fairly confident that over time, we'll be able to work this out with the customer base where we have the most significant problems with.
dan levy -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. and then just as a follow-up, i know that once your transaction on the china site closes, the pro forma leverage is going to be far below the -- i think the 1.5 times to 2 times range that you typically flagged.
what would be the timing on potentially pursuing other capital allocation options once you get below that target leverage? or could there be a period where you're a bit more conservative on the capital allocation side given some of the supply chain issues that we're seeing?
doug del grosso -- president, chief executive officer
yes, great question. i think as we finished this year and we'll come to you guys with our guide for expectations for 2022, and we'll give you a better definition around where we see things. but to your point, the more volatile the market, the more, i guess, uncertain things are the more we'd probably delay a little bit or under those situations, i could see us delaying a little bit.
but at the same time, we do think the big element here and what we've earmarked a lot of that cash for us to deleverage, that is our primary path forward here. but you're right, i think we have a real good path to get under those metrics that we've outlined in the past and we'll start to outline what the intentions are on capital allocation here. we don't expect the disruption in the market to continue indefinitely.
dan levy -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thank you.
mark oswald -- vice president-investor relations
thank you. and it looks like we're at the bottom of the hour. so again, if there's anybody that has additional questions, please feel free to reach out to me. i'll be available for all. operator, thank you very much. this concludes the conference call for today. thanks, everyone.

operator
welcome, and thank you all for standing by. [operator instructions]
and i would now like to turn the call over to mr. mark oswald. thank you. you may begin.
mark oswald -- vice president-investor relations
thank you, sue. good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review adient's results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. the press release and presentation slides for our call today have been posted to the investors section of our website at adient.com. this morning, i'm joined by doug del grosso, adient's president and chief executive officer; jeff stafeil, our executive vice president and chief financial officer; in jerome dorlack, executive vice president, head of americas seating.
on today's call, doug will provide an update on the business followed by jeff, who will review our q3 financial results and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. after our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. before i turn the call over to doug and jeff, there are a few items i'd like to discuss. first, today's conference call will include forward-looking statements.
these statements are based on the environment as we see it today, and therefore, involve risks and uncertainties. i would caution you that our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements made on the call. please refer to slide two of the presentation for our complete safe harbor statement. in addition to the financial results presented on a gaap basis, we will be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures to the closest gaap equivalent can be found in the appendix of our full earnings release. this concludes my comments. i'll now turn the call over to doug.
doug del grosso -- president, chief executive officer
doug? great. thanks, mark. good morning. thank you to our investors, prospective investors and analysts joining the call this morning as we review our third quarter results for fiscal 2021. turning to slide 4. let me begin with a few comments related to our third quarter. as we anticipated heading into the quarter, the ongoing supply chain disruptions related to semiconductors and resulting in customer production stoppages combined with escalating commodity prices provided a difficult operating landscape for the industry and adient. i'll dig deeper to those macro pressures in just a minute.
despite the many challenges, the adient team remained focused and successfully lead executed items within our control, while at the same time, took proactive actions to lessen the impact of the production stoppages and lost sales. starting on the left-hand side of the slide. adient's revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, up significantly from the $1.6 billion reported in q3 fiscal '20. last year's results, as you're aware, we're significantly impacted by vehicle production shutdowns across europe and americas due to covid-19. although revenue increased year-over-year, this year's top line was also impacted by significant headwinds, specifically the numerous production stoppages at our customers due to semiconductor supply disruptions.
adjusted ebitda for the quarter totaled $118 million. and as pointed out on the slide, this included just over $50 million in premiums and temporary operating inefficiencies, again, primarily driven by chip shortages and unplanned production stoppages. adient's june 30 cash balance totaled $1 billion. i'll point out that the cash balance does not include about $270 million held in other assets as a deposit related to certain assets adient is acquiring from the yfas joint venture as part of our china strategic transformation. in addition, about $190 million of cash was used during the quarter to repay a portion of the company's debt. finally, speaking of debt, adient's gross and net debt totaled just over $3.7 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. approximately $180 million of principal debt prepayment occurred during q3. jeff will provide additional color on adient's financial results, including our capital structure in just a few minutes.
achieving the results just discussed was hard thought, especially considering the near perfect storm of temporary headwinds that impacted the industry and adient. these included supply chain disruptions and unplanned production stoppages, increased freight costs, significant increases in commodity prices and continued costs associated with covid-19, just to name a few. rather than dwelling the negatives, the team looked ahead and began to implement actions to help lessen the impact. on the right-hand side of the slide, we've highlighted certain of those proactive measures.
actions taken included pulling ahead preventive maintenance, reallocating our resources between plants, implementing involuntary/voluntary layoffs at our plants in the u.s. and canada, fortifications for impacted salary team members and keeping very tight controls on discretionary spending, including travel, which is essentially limited to launch activities and hiring. the list shown is not exhaustive, but should provide you an idea of how the company continues to drive the business forward, essentially executing on actions that are within our control. turning to slide 5. let me shift gears slightly and spend a few minutes discussing the current operating environment as the factors shown on the slide are really dominating and influencing the business near term as evidenced in our q3 results.
first, despite the many negative headlines, there are a number of positive influence impacting the industry, including consumer demand, which remains extremely strong, vehicle inventories which are at near historic levels and will continue to drive strong production for several quarters as manufacturers look to rebuild inventory. vehicle mix, which remains strong as manufacturers continue to protect reduction of their most trucks and suvs, and finally, covid treatments and vaccines are generally driving the reopening of many economies.
we continue to watch closely a certain variants such as the delta variant could result in disruptions along the way. that said, in focusing on the headwinds column, there are a number of headwinds, which we view as temporary that are masking or limiting the full benefit for the positive influence just discussed. they include ongoing supply chain semiconductor shortages, which continue to result in production downtime at our customers. as seen with our q2 and q3 results, these unplanned production stoppages are leading to premiums and operating inefficiencies across our network. that said, for fiscal 2021, we estimate supply chain disruptions and resulting loss production, operating efficiencies, premium freight, et cetera, will have a net impact on the top line of about $1.1 billion and adjusted ebitda by approximately $300 million.
i wish i could tell you this will be limited to 2021, unfortunately, as shown in our callout box on the far right, the visibility of our customers' production schedules has not improved in the course of the past few months. discussions and commentary from our customers suggest improving supplies of chips and production schedules in the coming weeks and months. unfortunately, we continue to experience very short notice of production downtime, and it's likely this trend will continue through the rest of our fiscal year even into 2022. also having a significant impact on the business, as mentioned in our q2 earnings call, continues to be escalating steel and chemical prices.
as noted on the slide, steel prices in the americas are up approximately 3 times versus the beginning of the year. and although it has certain mechanisms and pass-through agreements with our customer, they were never intended to cover movements of this magnitude for this long of duration. for 2021, we estimate the net impact to be about $80 million. this is in sync with what we shared in our q2 call. although these items appear to be temporary in nature and should lessen over time. they are placing a significant amount of strain on the near-term business.
question remains, when will these pressures subside? our best guess is the supply chain disruption and increased commodity costs will likely persist as we enter 2022. jeff will dig deeper into the impact, the rising commodity prices is having on adient in his prepared remarks. turning to slide 6. shifting back to the theme of executing actions within our control. let me provide a few comments related to adient's long-term objectives. first, we are on track with our strategic transformation in china.
this includes, among other agreements, the termination, the yfas joint venture and the acquisition of an additional 50% equity in interest in cqymas, resulting in us owning 75% interest in cq and 100% equity interest in the yfas. i hope to share news that the completion of the agreements in the not-so-distant future. as a reminder, adient is expecting cash proceeds of about $1.4 billion after tax with the first tranche of proceeds collected at the closing and the remaining proceeds collected prior to the 2021 calendar year-end. completed transaction will enable adient to drive our strategy in china independently, which is expected to result in a variety of benefits, including capturing growth and profitable and expanding segments improving the integration of the company's china operations and allowing for more certain value realization relative to the status quo where cash and value are generated from dividends at entities, not in adient's control.
as mentioned in march, we expect to remain a leader in china market, essentially a position on par with and among the top three seat suppliers in the market. based on our estimates, this equates to a market share of just under 20%. equally exciting and as part enabled by the china transformation is the work underway to transform adient's capital structure. as mentioned earlier, during q2, we paid down the final $160 million in principal of the company's 7% first lien notes. in total, so far in fiscal '21, the company has prepaid approximately $840 million in debt, when combining the 7% note paydown in the preapayments made to the european investment bank loan, i'd also remind you the company made $100 million of voluntary debt prepayments at the end of fiscal 2020, bringing our total voluntary debt paydown to $940 million since the beginning of the capital structure transformation in q4 fiscal year '20.
adient's capital structure has a lot of flexibility and callability remaining. we expect to continue our deleveraging efforts on completion of the china transaction and collection of the related proceeds. whether it's the longer-term strategies just discussed or the day-to-day initiatives such as improving our plant operation and flawlessly executing on launches, adient is executing actions within our control despite the macro headrooms that are temporarily impacting the industry. the continued push to improve the business has had a positive impact on our relationships with customers as well. we've seen adient's customers recognize value-added product and process initiatives.
at the bottom of the slide, we've included a few awards recently received, including stellantis best supplier competitiveness award toyota superior supplier diversity award, gm's excellence and on-time shipping award; and finally, the outstanding quality launch performance award from nissan. i mentioned this recognition only to provide proof points that the team continues to execute on many fronts, continually looking for ways to drive the business forward. turning to slide 7. let me provide a few comments on adient's business wins and how we're strengthening our leading market position.
what hopefully has been clear is that we reported our key wins over the last several quarters is the fact that adding continues to focus on capital allocation, return on capital when targeting new or incumbent business wins has not limited our ability to secure new business. our year-to-date win rate for both targeted new business and targeted incumbent business is tracking in line with our expectations. we've highlighted a number of recent program wins here, including a number of key replacement wins this past quarter, including toyota tacoma, mercedes a-class, mercedes gla and the nissan patrol.
in addition to these replacement wins, adient also secured new suv program with xpeng in china in the new ev cuv platform at honda. it should be noted that our recent wins, awards include a good mix of combination of jit, foam, trim and metals business as our new book of business continues to launch, we expect the balance and balance out platforms to further enable margin expansion. turning to slide 8. as we typically do, we've highlighted several critical launches that are complete in process or scheduled to begin in the near term. i'm happy to report we're heading in for the final few months of the fiscal year, and the team continues to focus on process discipline around launch readiness and has driven a very high level of performance, especially considering the launch load and the complexity of launches that were planned for this year.
in addition to the number of launches and complexity, the disruption to production schedules presented another layer of challenges to the team successfully managed through though. again, a testament to the discipline around our processes. we have no intention of letting up and look forward to finishing the year strong with the launches that are in process and scheduled to begin entering fiscal 2022.
before turning the call over to jeff, flipping to slide 9, let me just conclude my remarks with a few comments about adient's guiding principles. these principles are intended to drive adient ford while focusing on what's most important: the key drivers, customer quality, people, community and financial discipline, guide and inform our business strategy and our culture. as pointed out today, remaining focus on these drivers enable the team to drive the business forward even while operating in a challenging environment we're currently facing. i'm proud of what we've been accomplished and i'm excited about what lies ahead. and with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff to take us through adient's third quarter 2021 financial performance and provide a little bit more color on what's expected as we wrap up 2021.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, doug. good morning, everyone. before jumping into the financial results, which, to a certain extent provides less insight into the ongoing operations, giving me given the abnormal operating environments in both q3 of last year and this year. let me spend a few minutes discussing commodity inflation. specifically, what we're seeing today, how it's impacting the business and steps the company has taken to lessen the impact, especially as it relates to the out years. first, on slide 11, we've provided a chart illustrating price movements and expected price movements for hot-rolled steel in north america.
as you can see, despite repeating forecast that prices will fall, prices have continued to increase while forecast for price decreases continue to be pushed out. for adient, this has resulted in more than a 3 times increase in the cost over the last 12 months for steel. assuming prices remain constant, the impact on our cost for steel and chemicals would be approximately $650 million higher in -- or more than 2022 than prices paid in 2020. the $650 million is based on current market conditions, such as hot-rolled steel prices in excess of $1,800 a ton. if the current market conditions hold and we do nothing commercially to pass-through this increase to our customers beyond our current commercial agreements, net commodity price headwind for fiscal '22 would be approximately $200 million versus 2021.
however, as you would expect, we're taking aggressive actions to mitigate the impact, which i'll discuss further on slide 12, and for that reason, it's premature for us to know how much of this headwind will be realized in 2022. we've spoken at length on prior calls with regard to adient's recovery mechanisms that are in place to recover material cost changes. as a reminder, our pass-through agreements differ by customers and two key attributes lag in percentage of contractual recovery.
for lag, certain customers are nearly immediate. others, such as our japanese headquartered customers tend to be trued up on an annual basis or essentially a 5-quarter lag. this results in an average lag for adient of a little more than two quarters. for the contractual piece, some customers have 100% pass-through with lag, while others might have only a 60% contractual pass-through. these pass-throughs have generally been effective despite the lag and protecting the company over the cycle as commodity prices have fluctuated. the mechanisms tend to work best against minor, short duration price movements. they are not designed for the extreme increases impacting the business today.
turning to slide 12. on the left-hand side of the slide, we've provided an illustrative example of how movements in commodity prices impact adient's financial results. in general, as you would expect, adient's financial results are negatively impacted as prices rise, but positively impacted as prices decline. important to point out, prices through the cycle have generally reverted to the mean. as material cost goes up, the revenue change, a true-up from the customer will lag, resulting in reduced ebitda.
only when the cost goes down and when revenue change again lags, will we recover the lost profits and vice versa. adient generally recaptures approximately 70% of commodity inflation through automatic mechanisms, while the remaining 30% must be negotiated through hard thought, rollup-to-sleeves-type negotiations. you'll also see on the chart, we have included a pair of dotted lines, which we view as normal movements in commodity prices over a cycle, call it, somewhere around 15%, plus or minus. as discussed in the prior slide, adient's mechanisms and in place today, combined with manual commercial negotiations have enabled the company to recapture nearly all cost increases over time in this environment.
unfortunately, this is not the environment we're in today and is the reason the company is executing aggressive actions in an attempt to mitigate the impact of rising commodity costs. these include, but are not limited to, renegotiating commercial agreements with our customers to reduce time lags associated with true-ups and reducing ideally and ideally eliminating adient's portion of the pain share agreements recognizing adient's position as a value-add supplier. and finally, making sure the underlying indices that underpin the true-ups are actually aligned with the commodities being purchased. for example, we currently have an agreement in place with one customer where the true-up is based on a scrap steel index, which is not reflective of steel being purchased.
as you might expect, the discussions are not one-size-fits-all. we're tailoring the discussions based on the size of the exposure relationship with the customer, et cetera. given adient's timing of commodity purchases and continued escalation in steel prices, and to a lesser extent, chemical prices, it appears commodity prices will remain a headwind entering 2022. that's why it's imperative we move quickly to address this headwind. that said, the outcomes of these ongoing discussions will ultimately determine the magnitude of the headwind next year and that's why it's premature for us to dimension the risk at this time. speaking of 2022, the team is in process of developing our fiscal '22 plan we've discussed one of the big unknowns, commodities.
the other driver will be vehicle production. as doug mentioned earlier, our visibility into our customer production schedule is currently quite low. we hope as we exit fiscal 2021 and/or fiscal '22, visibility improves and sense especially as it relates to the semiconductor supply chain. i anticipate sharing our 2022 planning assumptions with you as we typically do during our q4 financial results conference call in early november. now let's move to slide 14 and shift gears to adient's q3 financial results. adhering to our typical format, the page is formatted with the reported results in the left and our adjusted results on the right-hand side of the page.
we will focus our commentary on the adjusted results, which excludes special items that we view as either onetime in nature or otherwise skew important trends in underlying performance. for the quarter, the biggest drivers of the difference between our reported and adjusted results relate to indirect tax recoveries in brazil, write-off of deferred financing charges resulting from debt repayment transaction costs, restructuring costs and purchase accounting amortization.
one other significant adjustment important to note relates to a derivative loss on the yanfeng transaction. as a reminder, the proceeds associated with the china strategic transformation were negotiated in rmv. adient executed a hedge to protect our cash proceeds, movements between the usd and cny resulted in a noncash loss. details of these adjustments are in the appendix of the presentation. for the quarter, sales were $3.2 billion, up significantly compared to our third quarter results last year, where much of our production across europe and america was shut down due to covid. although year-over-year, adient's sales in the most recent quarter were significantly impacted by lost production, primarily driven by supply chain disruptions related to semiconductors.
adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $118 million, up $240 million year-on-year, more than explained by an increase in volume and mix. unfortunately, the benefits from increased volume were significantly offset by numerous temporary operating inefficiencies, which, by the way, masked business performance improvements made to the core ongoing operations. for example, of the approximate $600 million in lost sales in our americas operation, we received notification of the reduction less than three days in advance, while we received more than seven days notice in less than 20% of the time. this is obviously a difficult environment to run a jet operation. in addition, rising commodity costs and lower equity income also had a negative impact in the quarter.
i'll expand on these key drivers in just a minute. finally, at the bottom line, adient reported a net loss of $50 million or a loss of $0.53 per share. now let's break down our third quarter results in more detail. starting with revenue on slide 15. we reported consolidated sales of $3.2 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion compared to the same period a year ago. the primary driver of the year-over-year increase was attributed to higher volume and mix, call it, $1.5 billion, and to a much lesser extent, the positive impact of currency movements between the two periods of about $68 million.
portfolio adjustments executed in fiscal '20 provided a very minor offset to the benefits of volume and fx, call it, about $16 million. focusing on the table on the right-hand side of the slide, you can see our consolidated sales to keep up with production in both the americas and emea. the primary driver was adient's customer mix, which was heavily weighted to manufacturers that were significantly impacted by the semiconductor shortages. these customers included ford, daimler, stellantis, renault and vw. looking at the various third-party production forecast, it's estimated adient's portion of the lost q3 production volume was about 30% and 45% in the americas and emea, respectively. of course, we view this as temporary as temporary and should reverse as the supply chain stabilizes.
with regard to adient's unconsolidated seating revenue, year-over-year results were up approximately 4%, adjusting for fx and executed portfolio changes. significant year-over-year increases were recorded in both americas and emea, again, largely driven by the fact that these operations were all but shuttered in q3 of last year. in china, unconsolidated sales were relatively in line with industry production despite an approximate 7% decline at yfas. similar to what we saw with our consolidated results, sales at yfas were heavily impacted by supply chain disruptions at their customers.
moving to slide 16. we've provided a bridge of adjusted ebitda to show the performance of our segments between periods. the bucket labeled corporate represents central costs that are not allocated back to the operation, such as executive office, communications, corporate finance, legal and marketing. big picture, adjusted ebitda was $118 million in the current quarter versus a loss of $122 million last year. the primary driver of the increase is detailed on the page, but effectively compares two very suboptimal quarters.
last year was obviously overwhelmed by covid-related shutdowns, while this quarter was materially impacted by external factors outside of adient's control, such as the semiconductor shortage and a storm in texas earlier this year and its related fallout impact to the chemical supply and cost to name just a couple of the factors. therefore, i do not plan to go into depth end up discussion on this page, but we've outlined the movements year-over-year in detail for your information.
and that said, to give comfort or some proof points on adient's turnaround in the last couple of years, let me give some statistics comparing q3 '21 to q3 2019 over the last q3 period without significant externally generated shock to our business. compared to that 2019 q3, our admin expense was approximately $20 million lower this past quarter, while launch expense, ops waste and premium freight were also better by $30 million. we also realized approximately $70 million of improvements in other operating metrics, but these were unfortunately more than offset by approximately $125 million due to lower volume.
$30 million in net commodities, $15 million in fx, $30 million in inefficiencies from chemical and semiconductor supply chain issues among others. clearly, the operating environment has been challenging and masked many of these performance improvements. one area worth mentioning in the q3 2021 versus q3 2020 comparison is the decline in equity income of roughly $24 million. the year-over-year decline was related to performance and material economics at yfas, and to a lesser extent, the divestiture of our sg&a joint venture.
in the end, given all the moving pieces, the team worked hard to lessen the impact of the temporary headwinds to deliver the $244 million year-over-year improvement. to ensure enough time is allocated to the q&a portion of the call, we've provided our detailed segment performance slides in the appendix of the presentation, high level, improved volume and mix benefited each of the regions. ongoing business performance continued to trend in a positive direction, however, in americas and emea, temporary operating inefficiencies resulting from unplanned production stoppages masked the overall improvement. let me now shift to our cash, liquidity and capital structure on slide 17 and 18.
starting with cash on slide 17, i'll focus on year-to-date results as the longer time frame helps smooth some of the volatility in working capital movements. adjusted free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capex, was $176 million. the $445 million improvement in adjusted ebitda net of equity, $72 million reduction in spending and significant improvement in trade working capital was partially offset by an expected increase in restructuring of $57 million, increase in interest paid of $36 million, elevated income taxes -- elevated non-income-related taxes, specifically vat payments and the timing of commercial activity. with regard to vat payments, while some of the year-to-date outflow will continue to reverse as we progress through q4, we'd expect larger-than-normal outflows in fiscal '21 related to government approved delays out of fiscal 2020 due to covid accommodations.
as noted on the right-hand side of the page, we ended the quarter with more than $1.8 billion in total liquidity comprised of cash on hand of about $1 billion and approximately $850 million of undrawn capacity under adient's revolving line of credit. also noted in the call out the june 30 cash balance excludes approximately $270 million held as other assets related to funds on deposit to acquire certain assets of yfas. cash used during the quarter to voluntarily pay down debt totaled about $190 million, which includes both principal and premium paid. speaking of debt and flipping to slide 18.
in addition to showing our debt and net debt positions, which totaled just over $3.7 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, at june 30, we've also provided a snapshot of adient's capital structure. as you can see, the 7% first lien notes were entirely repaid at quarter end as the final $160 million in principal was paid during the quarter. in addition, $20 million of principal of the european investment bank loan was also repaid in q3. it's clear the transformation of adient's balance sheet is well underway with approximately $940 million of debt prepayment complete going back to q4 of fiscal '20.
the good news is we're not done. additional voluntary debt -- voluntary paydown of debt is expected as we progress through calendar 2021, with proceeds expected to be received from china -- from adient's china's transformation. with that, let's flip to slide 19 and review our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '21. adient's fiscal 2021 guidance has been updated to reflect the company's year-to-date results through june, our completed portfolio transactions, executed debt paydown and the current market conditions. expectations for consolidated sales have been reduced to between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion.
the significant impact of production stoppages at our customers resulting from semiconductor shortages is driving the decline. the impact of lower-than-expected sales combined with temporary operating inefficiencies, driven by continued unplanned production stoppages, elevated commodity costs and increased freight is expected to place downward pressure on adient's adjusted ebitda. our current forecast is between $925 million and $975 million. moving on to equity income, which is included in our adjusted ebitda continues to be forecast at about $230 million for the year.
interest expense based on our debt and cash position is expected to be $215 million, which is consistent to earlier expectations. cash taxes in fiscal '21 have been revised down modestly, call it, about $80 million. to assist with your modeling, although volatile with fluctuations between quarters, and as mentioned earlier, we continue to expect adient's effective tax rate to be in the mid-20% range. based on our customer launch plans, we expect capital expenditures to total about $310 million for the year.
and finally, one last item for your modeling. we now expect free cash flow to be approximately $100 million in fiscal '21, which is in line with our previous range of between $50 million and $150 million. the team has worked hard to offset the top line and ebitda pressures. in addition, our cash restructuring, which was previously forecasted at $200 million for the year has now been reduced to about $150 million. the total remains elevated compared to our typical spend of around $100 million or less.
in addition to an elevated restructuring spend, the 2021 free cash flow is negatively impacted by approximately $30 million of vat payments that were deferred from last year into 2021. stripping out these one-offs, adient's free cash flow guide would have been approximately $180 million. with that, let's move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.

operator, for question, please.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from rod lache. your line is now open.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning, everybody.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
hey, rod.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
i'd like to just maybe hear a little bit more about how you would characterize the bridge from what you're suggesting you'll experience in fiscal '22 to a more trend-like environment. so, you're talking about 79 million units of global production. if normal, it's more like 90 million units, that looks like that it's 13% or so, maybe $1.8 billion or $1.9 billion of revenue, i'm thinking, and maybe you can just comment on how that would convert.
and then, in the second half of the year, you had $118 million of inefficiency. i can't remember what it was in the first half, but that and the $195 million of commodities that you're saying you're absorbing in '21 and 2022, can you maybe just give us some color on how that -- those kinds of things might get recovered?
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. great question, rod. and as we look through and when ihs cut back '22 production and we started to see that the impact of -- that we were seeing in 2021 would carry over, we've spent a lot of time thinking through what 2023 and what the market will look like as we get to the other side of this. but breaking that down -- and i did reference back to page 5 of the presentation at the end of my remarks there a second ago, the 2021 impact to revenue, we had estimated about $1.9 billion. we have a pretty similar, and maybe even a tick higher of what we think has come out of our 2022 build or production given the macro issues that we're facing. so, call it about $2 billion in sales.
i think, from a contribution or flow-through on that, you're talking, 15-plus percent, so call it $300 million-ish perhaps and change. and we also had, similar to last year, we expect similar to 2021 to have a pretty similar level of inefficiencies. i mentioned we're having to overstaff a lot of our operations with -- the production environment has been nothing short of -- well, i was going to say awful, but there's probably several other words to use characterize it. so, all those inefficiencies are effectively, we think, duplicating themselves in fiscal '22, and then you mentioned the commodity headwind.
so, as you start to look forward, we do see a significantly higher volume picture, which should have great flow through impacts for us. we'd see in an environment where we weren't having that to not have those inefficiencies flowing through. and the commodity situation, we do content -- expect to continue to get better either through commercial negotiations or the time period of our lags and cost recovery mechanisms with our customers to catch in.
rod lache -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. so it sounds like you do believe that ultimately the full impact of these two years of commodities and inefficiencies get recovered. just wanted to clarify that because you also mentioned trade and energy and a number of other things that are kind of influencing your views on the outlook.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would -- rod, i would say, from a commodity standpoint, they ultimately get recovered. it's a question of how long that takes. right now, we're kind of using extraordinary measures from commercial negotiation because the mechanisms we have in place falls short. but over time, as commodities stabilize or go down, those mechanisms will ultimately address the issue. we're trying to bridge that gap in the near-term.
energy and ocean freight are the most emerging issues that are having an impact. on ocean freight, we think there's a lot of self-help we can put in place, but that takes a little bit of time as we look at alternative manufacturing locations. and as we mentioned in the call, we can even change pack density. some of that ultimately may result in a commercial negotiation because we don't expect to bear that burden if ocean freight rates don't come back down. and they're, as you know, extraordinarily high right now.
energy, i think, is really a new emerging issue that we have in europe that we're getting our arms around and assessing what that full impact is going to be. that's probably less of a commercial issue for us. and whether it's transitory or not is difficult to predict at this time, but it's relatively smaller issue in comparison to the other two.
operator
our next question comes from john murphy with bank of america. your line is now open.
aileen smith -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, everyone. this is aileen smith on for john. i understand why it's tough to give a formal outlook on adjusted ebitda and free cash flow into next year. but i want to ask the question around free cash flow and whether it's possible to provide maybe a directional read in the same way you gave for adjusted ebitda or perhaps a way to think about free cash flow conversion from ebitda into next year. just trying to get a sense of whether on an operational basis you think you could be free cash flow generative next year outside of some of the cash tailwinds you'll get for strategic actions.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, just on a free cash flow basis, aileen, what i would expect is for a negative free cash flow in the first half of the year, primarily with the working capital movements of when volume sinks pretty heavily for us, you can go back to the covid-19 time frame when we were shut down a year-and-a-half ago or so and see what that did from a working capital standpoint. it was negative, but it worked back through the system.
our expectation right now is that while we'd have a first half negative, it would come back, and i don't think it's breakeven-ish, maybe a little better, maybe a little worse, just depending on where the overall environment sits next year. but i would -- and a couple other, i guess, key points you mentioned in there, we would expect restructuring to be down, interest down -- interest expense to be down, capex slightly up from an overall year standpoint. cash taxes are about neutral, i think, year-over-year.
aileen smith -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. that's helpful.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the big volatility is this is going to come from working capital.
aileen smith -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah. understood. and then, i wanted to follow-up on one of the headwinds that was cited on the ebitda walk about the non-repeat of various commercial settlements. is that solely just the one-time benefit from renegotiating contracts with your customers that obviously doesn't repeat or should we read into that as you're getting into the eighth or ninth inning of sorts on those discussions with your customers? and so, settlements should naturally abate going forward, but the offsetting factor is that you've got more economic contracts in the business and the consolidated numbers now. just trying to make sure there isn't anything nefarious to read into there with the commercial settlement is not repeated [phonetic].
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the way you want to think about them is -- particularly in our business is when you have a tremendous amount of volatility as we did in '19 and '20 because of covid and really extraordinary material economics. we sometimes settle those commercial negotiations, and they're delayed and there's retro pieces and that's why they occur typically in a quarter when we go through that reconciliation. will that repeat itself? based on what i just said, you could argue that it might because when we have major disruptions in the flow of the business, it takes a while to resolve those issues and they usually get settled out of period. that's how i'd think about it.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. and just one other point to that, a specific point that i made in my comments. we had called out at the end of first quarter last year about $30 million of settlements that were really out of period, where we had finally reached that settlement with the customer and we called that out. a year ago, if you look back and said, a part of the reason, i think, we did something close to $380 million in the first quarter of last year and we said about $30 million of it relates to some -- really out of period items. well, a lot of this stuff just kind of mixes with the overall period year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter profitability, that $30 million was somewhat unique and special for the year and i didn't want you to add it into your pro forma numbers going forward.
aileen smith -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. that's really helpful. thanks for taking the questions.
operator
our next question comes from emmanuel rosner. your line is now open.
emmanuel rosner -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hello. thank you very much. first question is around your revenue expectations for fiscal '22. so, i'm looking at slide 20, and where you show your sales forecasts versus ihs. would you be able to give us a sense of where you feel there's the industry production to check out better than ihs? and maybe a sense of your backlog, how much in that new business do you think is the benefit embedded in your base case?
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
so, relative to ihs, like we said in our prepared comments, the crystal ball is pretty cloudy. ihs just recently came out with the best case, worst-case scenario. and if you factor in those numbers, you can see that there's a -- would have a considerable impact. right now, it's two things, i'd point to. one, it's really unclear what our customers' capacity is to run because they're still on allocation with semiconductors and their outlook is pretty near-term on what that capacity looks like the. the reason that is a problem for us is because we run just in time plans. so, our customers have not pulled back on releases. so they're releasing, which is forcing us to, as jeff mentioned, to run at full rate and then we're getting very short notice on whether or not they have the ability to run at that rate.
so, when i think about revenue, those are really the factors that make it very difficult for us to predict. so, you can look at ihs best case, worst case, that might give you some insight. but i don't think there's really anyone out there right now that has great visibility on what the volume could be and how it unfolds. and if we continue to have this disruption that we've had in the second half of the year, that's a very different outcome than just reduced volume because of the way we have to run our jet plants.
emmanuel rosner -- deutsche bank -- analyst
i fully agree with you. i'm just trying to better understand what's embedded in your base case scenario for [indecipherable] you do have a sort of like revenue directional outlook. so, any way you could tell us within that, how much net new business you're expecting because obviously two of the positive influences are volume and net new business. and i'm just trying to understand in your base case what is in there.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we do have a bit more coming in than we have going out, emmanuel. and that's referenced with the market being relatively flat and we're coming in with, let's say, 400 basis points better than the market. and that's just driven by good mix and some good vehicles coming online versus those that are coming off. so that's a positive.
i will say, just back to the question, every one of our customers would like to produce more than they are right now. and they're all telling us they're going to produce more than ihs as effectively saying. so, where could we have benefits? it's going to really depend on the complexities of the supply chain to get there and labor markets to be able to produce. if you go into a dealer right now, i was in one last weekend and there were zero new cars on the lot inside. there's a desire to make them. it's just going to be a question. and that becomes really difficult to predict because the complexity of the overall supply chain is enormous and any particular part can shut the vehicle down.
so, that's what we're managing right now, but i do think that there's upside. it's just very difficult to pinpoint where. but it should be noted, there's probably some element of a downside too, if you -- doug mentioned the ihs pessimistic and optimistic cases and there's a pretty wide range for 2022.
operator
thank you. our final question comes from colin langan with wells fargo. your line is now open.
colin langan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hello. great. thanks for taking my question. just as a follow-up, i guess, on this walk from the '21 ebitda to '22. i mean, you called out some of the big buckets of commodity of $125 million and commercial settlement of about $30 million. but you also, at the beginning of the presentation, talked about $450 million of inefficiencies. so, i guess, one, is any saving -- is any of that sort of inefficiencies in the plan for sort of slightly down next year or is that all just assumed to be over a year out? and of the other -- any framing of the other buckets of mix, launch and engineering, how big are those? maybe i'm underestimating how big those are in terms of headwinds.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. just on the topic of the premiums, the $450 million we called out on page 5 of the presentation, that had -- it was a mix of the contribution loss on the loss of volume and the inefficiencies. so, if you use the $2 billion roughly and you use 15%, you can think roughly $300 million of it is loss contribution margin and $150 million of it is inefficiencies in premiums that we've incurred.
when we look at 2022, the makeup and the constitution of those premiums are going to be different, but they're pretty similar year-over-year. we don't have the texas storm -- well, hopefully we don't have the texas storm in 2022, but we have a pretty similar, let's say, semiconductor impact. and we're also seeing higher freight and some of those pieces which essentially give the total for the year pretty similar level.
as it relates to some of the other pieces here, i'd say, those are -- that particular equation we just talked about is what's dramatically driving the numbers and makes the outcome of the overall ebitda extremely volatile and difficult to forecast. there's definitely a little bit of engineering. it's, call it, 20-ish or so, maybe a little higher of additional engineering that we would expect. the mix you can kind of calculate probably on your own. just think of you have several basis or several hundred basis points higher contribution margin and maybe even like 50% higher contribution margin in asia region than you do in the rest of the globe. so, with china being down in the ihs numbers by 4%, that definitely plays a bit of an impact on mix.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the only thing i would add to that is -- and the reason why we did give specifics on each one of those buckets is, many of those issues are in negotiations with our customers and it takes time to sort those out. and what the ultimate impact will be, the net impact is still unresolved right now. so, more to come on that and we'll continue to chip away and look to mitigate some of those impacts.
colin langan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
i guess, my second question, just to be clear, the commodity headwinds, you got it down pretty impressive improvement from $200 million to $125 million. is there any more opportunity and if you were just alluding to that? and you also, on one of the slides, talked about alternative commercial solutions with customers. is that looking for concessions beyond the traditional commodities? again, just trying to get any more color what you're referring to there.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, i would say, there's more opportunity whether it's going to come in our customers making adjustments in the way they compensate us for commodities or i always go back to we have a basket of goods and commercial issues that we can negotiate around. it's the nature of the business that we're in slightly unique just because we have such a complex module that there's so many moving parts that are impacting cost, both negative and positive. we're working our way through that.
our customers have expectations for productivity next year that we have to put on the table and negotiate against the backdrop of rising commodity costs. so, all that's in discussion right now. and it's just too early to really peg, though, i would say into your point, we are pleased -- modestly pleased with the progress we made to-date on material economics. but a lot of work ahead of us on that front.
colin langan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. thanks for answering my questions.
doug del grosso -- president and chief executive officer
great. and with that, it looks like we're at the bottom of the hour, so that will conclude the call for today. as usual, i will be available throughout the day, today, tomorrow for additional post-earnings call. so feel free to call and i'd be more than happy to address your questions at that point. but thank you.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

welcome and thank you for standing by. [operator instructions] i would like to inform all parties that today's conference is being recorded. if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
i would now like to turn the conference over to your host mark oswald. thank you. you may begin.
mark oswald -- vice president, investor relations and corporate communications
thank you, daniel. good morning and thank you for joining us as we review adient's results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. the press release and presentation slides for our call today have been posted to the investors section of our website at adients.com.
this morning, i'm joined by doug del grosso adient's president and chief executive officer; and jeff stafeil, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. also joining the call today is jerome dorlack, executive vice president of the americas. on today's call, doug will provide an update on the business, followed by jeff who will review our fourth quarter financial results and outlook for fiscal 2022. after our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions.
before i turn the call over to doug and jeff, there are a few items i'd like to cover. first, today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. these statements are based on the environment as we see it today and therefore involve risks and uncertainties. i would caution you that our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements made on the call. please refer to slide 2 of the presentation for a complete safe harbor statement.
in addition to the financial results presented on a gaap basis, we will be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures to the closest gaap equivalent can be found in the appendix of our referral earnings release. this concludes my comments.
i'll now turn the call over to doug. doug?
operator
thanks, mark. good morning and thank you to our investors, prospective investors and analysts joining the call this morning as we review our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2021 and the expectations for fiscal 2022.
turning to slide 4, let me begin with a few comments related to our fourth quarter and 2021 fiscal year. essentially, the fiscal year can be best described as a year of two halves. in the first half of the year, adient delivered significant year-over-year earnings and margin improvement, driven by the company's focus on launch, costs, operational improvements and customer profitability management. exiting our second quarter significant macro pressures, including numerous unplanned production stoppages at our customers primarily related to the petrochemical and semiconductor supply chain disruptions and rising commodity prices began to impact the industry and adient. these headwinds persisted throughout the second half of our fiscal year.
despite the many challenges, the adient team remained focused on successfully executing items within our control. a few notable examples include the closing of our china strategic transactions and the significant progress made throughout the year on deleveraging our balance sheet. that said, the accomplishments achieved in fiscal '21 were hard fought, given the very tough operating environment.
on the right hand side of the slide, you can see that the tough operating environment had a significant impact on our q4 results. adient's revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, down from the $3.6 billion reported in q4 fiscal year '20. the decrease was driven by the significant reduction in vehicle production year-over-year, combined with adient's customer mix, particularly in europe. the lower revenue, combined with premiums and temporary operating efficiencies, resulted from unplanned production stoppages dropped right to our earnings with adjusted ebitda declining $169 million year-over-year to $118 million in q4 fiscal year 2021.
cash was a bright spot, $1.5 billion as of september 30. the cash balance include $695 million of proceeds related to the first tranche of proceeds collected from the china transactions. jeff will provide additional commentary on adient's financial results, including our cash and capital structure in just a few minutes.
turning to slide 5, let me spend a few minutes discussing the current operating environment. the factors shown on the slide are significantly dominating and influencing the business near-term as evidenced by our q4 and second half fiscal '21 results. on the left-hand side of this slide, we've listed several of the headwinds we're facing. no surprises here, as many of these macro headwinds surfaced at the end of our second quarter, including ongoing supply chain semiconductor shortages, which continue to result in production downtime at our customers.
as seen with our q3 and q4 results, these unplanned production stoppages are leading to premiums and operating inefficiencies across our network, which, as you would expect, we're working hard to mitigate. for fiscal 2021, we estimate supply chain disruptions and the resulting loss production, operating inefficiencies, premium freight, etc, had a net impact on the top line of about $1.9 billion and adjusted ebitda by approximately $450 million. unfortunately, these supply chain disruptions have not lessened as we've entered our new fiscal year. as shown in the middle column, the visibility of our customers' production schedules has not improved over the course of the past few months.
discussions and commentary from our customers suggest that the supply chip and production schedules could improve in the coming months. unfortunately, there is no evidence of this happening at this time. as such, we're continuing to run the business with the assumption that the challenging operating environment will continue.
jeff will discuss our overall fiscal year '22 planning assumptions in his prepared remarks. these include our assumption that global vehicle production remains relatively flat year-over-year, up modestly in some regions, down in others. as such, it's likely that the unplanned production stoppages will continue, leading to premiums and operating inefficiencies like those experienced in the second half of 2021.
in addition to the supply chain disruptions and unplanned production stoppages, elevated input costs such as commodity prices, freight and energy costs continue to place downward pressure on the near-term results. as noted on the slide, steel prices in the americas continue to be approximately 3 times higher than at the start of the year. as mentioned on our q3 call, although adient has certain mechanisms and pass-through agreements in place with our customers, they were never intended to cover the movements of this magnitude or duration. for 2021, we estimate that the net impact was roughly $70 million, generally consistent with our earlier expectations.
if we set aside the macro pressures and look at our core business performance as highlighted on the far right hand side of the slide, we're continuing to see an upward trajectory. a few points worth noting; stabilizing the operations in fiscal year '19, we achieved approximately 500 basis points increase in the company's adjusted ebitda margin. fortunately, we have about 400 points of headwinds, masking the performance. roughly speaking, 250 basis points from volume, 40 basis points from net commodities and 100 basis points associated with temporary operating inefficiencies.
the team is very much focused on driving down sg&a costs, executing both temporary and permanent actions. in our operating cost structure, engineering design efficiencies and cost reduction implementations are all performing well. what has really emerged over the past several quarters driven by inflationary pressures are commercial issues that we're working to address. as mentioned, the macro pressures impacting the business and adient are believed to be transitory in nature. based on this belief, adient has executed numerous actions to lessen the impact.
in the middle of the slide, you can see examples, which include commercial negotiations with our customers to claw back the increased commodity prices over and above the contractual agreements in place. if you recall, during our q3 earnings call, we mentioned potential risk fiscal year '22 of about $200 million. through the recent negotiations, we were able to reduce that exposure to roughly $125 million.
from an sg&a perspective, we've executed targeted reductions in our workforce, implemented a salary reduction and stock replacement program at our executive level and made other temporary benefit actions such as delaying merit increases and the 401(k) match in the us. to help lessen the impact of rising freight costs, the team is implementing changes to our pack density and optimizing our freight footprint based on open capacity. we've also experienced an acceleration in vave efforts with our customers. again, these are a few examples to illustrate adient is not standing still.
important to remember from a historical view, our business has had little inflation customers have effectively priced on a value add. that said, the level of cost increases from multiple angles that we are experiencing today is unprecedented and requires either quick market correction or a change in customer pricing. if it's determined that the inflationary pressures are sticky, not transitory in nature, alternative customer -- commercial solutions need to be negotiated.
switching gears and focusing on those actions within our control, let me provide a few comments on how the team continues to drive the business forward. first, on slide 7. you can see that we're executing day in and day out. it starts with the back-to-basics mindset improving every aspect of the business. as mentioned just a few minutes ago, the core business has seen significant improvement since 2019. stripping out the temporary operating inefficiencies, the business is running well on many fronts such as launch execution, lower ops waste, increased utilization and reuse of capital, to name a few. adient's q1 and q2 results this past year highlighted this improvement.
we're also working hard to ensure the long-term outlook is bright by securing new and incumbent profitable business wins. we've done this at a very steady pace. and as we've mentioned on our calls throughout the year, this includes a very healthy portion of vave wins, which will continue to strengthen our leading market position. as noted on this slide, over 20% of the wins in fiscal year '21 relate to ev platforms.
program wins are a testament to the much improved relationship with our customers that we've nurtured over the past two to three years. aided by the company's es3 initiatives, the ability to provide award-winning seat solutions, including innovative solutions for ev platforms, adient is quickly becoming the supplier of choice. in addition to blocking and tackling operationally and commercially, adient recognizes the company's full potential cannot be achieved unless we commit to positive environmental, social and governance-related business practices. during fiscal year '21, the company increased its commitment to esg efforts with the adoption of science-based targets in kpis. details to be provided in the 2021 sustainability report due in january of 2022.
outside of the day-to-day and turning to slide 8, we've made great progress in fiscal year '21 with regard to long-term strategic actions. on september 30, we announced the closing of our strategic transformation in china. the completed transaction enables adient to drive our strategy in china independently, which is expected to result in a variety of benefits, including capturing growth in profitable and expanding segments, improving the integration of the company's china operations and allowing for more certain value realization relative to the status quo which where cash and value are generated from dividends and entities not in adient's control.
we expect to remain a leader in the china market, essentially a position on par with and among the top three complete seat suppliers in the market. based on our estimates, this equates to a market share of just under 20%. at closing, adient received its first tranche of proceeds totaling $695 million. not only does the completed transactions in china allow us to chart our future in the country independently, but they also enable the company to accelerate its balance sheet transformation, which we view as another key accomplishment in 2021.
during the 2021 fiscal year, the company executed approximately $840 million in voluntary debt pay-down. with the proceeds from china in the bank, we will further progress on deleveraging in fiscal '22. adient will continue to prioritize its capital allocations toward a debt pay-down until the company reaches its targeted leverage threshold of 1.5 times to 2 times net debt to ebitda. bottom line, we're executing and delivering on items within our control.
turning to slides 9 and 10, let me make a few comments related to our business wins and launch performance to ensure enough time is allocated to jeff and our expectations related to fiscal year 2022. i'll be brief with regard to these slides.
as you can see, slide 9 is our typical new business win slide. we highlighted a few of adient's recent wins. bottom line for the quarter just completed, similar to what we've disclosed throughout the year, the company has had good success in capturing new conquest and incumbent business. the win rates for our fiscal 2021 were strong and in line with internal expectations.
i already mentioned ev wins accounted for approximately 20% of our business booked in '21, a very good outcome as growth in this area will continue to strengthen our leading position. i'd also point out we're pleased with our seating solutions of delivering world-class products to our customers as evidenced by a number of recent j.d. power awards for adient seats in the ramp up of [phonetic] f-150 and mustang mach-e.
flipping to slide 10. as we typically do, we've highlighted several critical launches that are complete and processed were scheduled to begin in the near-term. the company continues to focus on process discipline around launch readiness and has driven a high level of performance, especially considering the launch load and complexity of launches that were planned for the year. in addition to the number of launches and complexity, the disruptions to production schedules presented another layer of challenges. the team successfully managed through, again, a testament to the discipline we've instilled around the process.
as you can see at the bottom of slide, we've provided some color on what you can expect from fiscal 2022 with respect to the volume and complexity of launches. generally speaking, volume is up. this is primarily driven by launches that were delayed from '21 to '22. the complexity is mix, up slightly in the americas and in china, relatively flat in europe and asia, excluding china. i'm confident we'll maintain our focus on process discipline around launch readiness, driving results similar or better versus 2021.
before turning the call over to jeff and turning to slide 11, let me conclude with a few summary comments. as discussed and highlighted with this presentation, adient is executing many actions to provide the company for a sustained long-term success. advancing our back-to-basic strategy continues to be a key enabler going forward. we'll continue to drive the business forward despite the near-term macro headwinds. no doubt, the operating environment in 2022 will be difficult given the persistent challenges impacting the industry. that said, we'll continue to manage through the difficulties executing actions along the way to lessen their impact. the underlying fundamental of the industry remains strong. once the near-term temporary headwinds abate, adient will be in -- well positioned to capitalize on the recovery.
with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff to take us through adient's fourth quarter '21 financial performance and provide additional detail on what to expect in the coming year.
jeff stafeil -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
great. thanks, doug. good morning, everyone. let's jump into adient's q4 financial results on slide 13. adhering to our typical format, the page is formatted with our reported results in the left and our adjusted results in the right-hand side of the page. we will focus our commentary on the adjusted results, which exclude special items that we view as either one-time in nature or otherwise skew important trends and underlying performance.
for the quarter, the biggest drivers of the difference between our reported and our adjusted results relate to a gain in the sale of our unconsolidated, partially owned affiliate, yfas, and an associated derivative loss in the forward contract used to lock in the exchange rate on the transaction proceeds. other adjustments related to pension mark-to-market adjustments, purchase accounting amortization, restructuring and transaction costs. details of all the adjustments for the quarter and the full year are in the appendix of the presentation.
high level for the quarter, sales were $2.8 billion, down about 23% compared to our fourth quarter results last year. the most recent quarter was specifically impacted by loss production, primarily driven by supply chain disruptions related to semiconductors. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $118 million, down $169 million year-on-year, a decrease in volume and mix, numerous temporary operating efficiencies driven from the challenging operating environment drove the decrease. i'll expand on these key drivers in just a minute.
finally, at the bottom line, adient reported an adjusted net loss of $23 million or a loss of $0.24 per share. note that our gaap net income was $950 million, driven by the completion of the china transaction.
slide 14 provides a similar high-level summary of adient's full year key financial metrics. as doug mentioned earlier, the full year results can be best summarized as a tale of two halves, strong first half performance with significant year-over-year earnings and margin improvement. adient's second half results significantly -- were significantly impacted by the overall macro environment, customer production disruptions and rising commodity prices.
for the year, sales were $13.7 billion, up 8% compared to last year. adjusted ebitda was $917 million, up $244 million compared with the covid-impacted results in fiscal 2020. you can see we noted the ebitda margin, excluding equity income, commodity headwinds and temporary operating inefficiencies, would have been greater than 6% even with an abnormally low sales level. we see this as clear evidence that the company continues to execute well on items within its control. and at the bottom line, net income of $199 million compared to a net loss of $4 million in 2020.
within the outlook section of this presentation, we've provided a full-year revenue and adjusted ebitda walk from the reported results to a pro forma 2021 view. the pro forma view essentially accounts for all of the portfolio adjustments made throughout the year and should help with the walk to our 2022 expectations, and more on this in a minute.
now let's break down our fourth quarter results in more detail. i'll cover the next few slides rather quickly as detail for the results are included on the slides, and this should ensure that we have an adequate amount of time set aside to review adient's expectations for 2022.
starting with the revenue on slide 15, we reported consolidated sales of $2.8 billion, a decrease of $826 million compared to the same period a year ago. the primary driver of the year-over-year decrease was due to a lower volume, call it, just over $800 million, portfolio adjustments impacted the quarter by about $35 million. these negative headwinds were partially offset by approximately $17 million due to fx movements.
focusing on the table on the right hand side of the slide, you can see our consolidated sales generally kept pace with production in both americas and emea. in asia, adient experienced an outperformance versus the market, driven by our customer and content mix, specifically in japan and in thailand. in china, the underperformance was driven primarily by certain of our customers such as daimler that were more heavily impacted by semiconductor shortages. of course, we view this as temporary and should reverse as the supply chain stabilizes.
with regard to adient's unconsolidated seating revenue, year-over-year results were down about 10%, adjusting for fx and executed portfolio changes. the performance was better than the market in china, primarily driven by a positive mix at yfas.
moving to slide 16, we've provided a bridge of adjusted ebitda to show the performance of our segments between periods. the bucket labeled corporate represents central costs that are not allocated back to the operation such as executive office, communications, corporate finance and legal. big picture, adjusted ebitda was $118 million in the current quarter versus $287 million last year. the primary drivers of the decrease are detailed on page. simply put, the quarter was down over 20% in volume, but the impact was exacerbated by numerous abrupt and last minute adjustments to production schedules at our customers, which continued to drive inefficiencies in our operations. in addition, similar to our third quarter, elevated commodity prices also pressured earnings.
the significant headwinds were partially offset by improved core business performance such as lower launch cost, ops waste and improved net material margin. sg&a was favorable year-over-year by $41 million, primarily driven by adjustments to performance-based compensation and the net impact of accrual true-ups. in summary, sg&a for the year is representative of our spend, but our q4 level is lower than we'd expect on an ongoing basis.
i do not plan to go into a detailed discussion of this page, but we've outlined the movements year-over-year in detail for your information. important to note, although the macro pressures, which are largely out of adient's control, significantly impacted our q4 and second half results, the team is not sitting idle. we're continuing to execute actions to improve our business performance and reduce our cost base.
similar to past quarters, we've provided our detailed segment performance slides in the appendix of the presentation. high level for americas and emea, improved ongoing business performance and lower sg&a costs were more than offset by the impact of lower volume, the negative impact of temporary operating inefficiencies and elevated commodity cost. in asia, the benefits of slightly higher volumes, lower sg&a and improved business performance modestly outweighed the negative impact of temporary operating inefficiencies and the negative impact of portfolio adjustments.
let me now shift to our cash, liquidity and capital structure on slides 17 and 18. starting with cash on slide 17, i'll focus on full-year results. as the longer time frame helps smooth some of the volatility in working capital movements, adjusted free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capex was breakeven for the year. this compares to a cash outflow of about $80 million in 2020.
the year-on-year improvement was partially driven by higher earnings, increased dividends from our china operations, underpinned by the agreements related to our strategic transformation and lower capital expenditures. these benefits were partially offset by an increase in restructuring, nearly $300 million increase in inventory balances and an increase in vat payments and, finally, the timing of commercial settlement activities. the vat payments, as mentioned throughout 2021, are larger than normal in '21 and relate to government-approved delays out of 2020 due to covid accommodations.
just a few comments related specifically to 2021. restructuring was elevated approximately $150 million. we'd expect that trend to trend back to closer to $100 million or perhaps inside of that in the coming years. inventory trended higher as we secured commodities and other components to prevent disruptions to our customers, bought extra supply due to pending increases in commodity prices and, overall, experienced higher commodity prices than a year ago. and, finally, the capital expenditures were lower than expected as customer launches were pushed from fiscal '21 to '22 and the team continues to find ways to increase our capital utilization.
flipping to slide 18. as noted on the right-hand side of the slide, we ended the quarter with about $2.8 billion of total liquidity, comprised of cash on hand of about $1.5 billion and approximately $740 million of undrawn capacity under adient's revolving line of credit. also noted, the september 30 cash balance includes approximately $695 million in proceeds from the china transaction. final after-tax proceeds of about $625 million are expected prior to calendar year-end.
adient's debt and net debt position totaled $3.7 billion and $2.2 billion respectively at september 30. as doug mentioned earlier, a significant progress was made throughout the year to transform the company's capital structure. since september 2020, we repaid approximately $100 million of 4.875% unsecured notes, fully repaid the $800 million 7% first lien notes and repaid approximately $40 million of our eib loan. in addition, we opportunistically amended and extended our term loan.
given our cash balance and the additional proceeds from the china transaction that are expected prior to year end, we expect to continue our deleveraging efforts as we progress through fiscal 2022. clearly, the transformation of adient's balance sheet is solidly on track.
with that, let's flip to slides 20 through 23 and review our outlook for fiscal '22. to begin with, the persistent macro headwinds, primarily supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures on such things as commodities, freight, energy, etc, are expected to have a significant impact on the industry and adient in fiscal 2022. on the right-hand side of slide 20, we've laid out our planning assumptions for production and fx compared with fiscal '21. the foundation of our fiscal '21 plan is generally aligned with the october ihs estimates with limited overlays for known customer release schedules.
as you know, the current operating environment is very fluid. visibility into the production is cloudy at best. supply chain disruptions and resulting production stoppages could result in significantly different outcomes. to emphasize the point, many of our customers continue to project volume far in excess of ihs volumes that we're using, thus requiring us to staff our operations with more headcount than what is implied by our projections. this creates a higher than normal decremental margin impact if the ihs volumes turn out to be correct.
as doug mentioned earlier, our current expectations assume global vehicle productions will be about flat for adient's fiscal year, up in americas and emea and down in asia. the production forecast is expected to result in a mixed headwind in fiscal '22, given that our higher margin business in asia is down or projected to be down. i'd also point out that in europe, despite overall production trending higher, adient's sales are forecast to be modestly lower as we expect the impact of the microchip shortage to disproportionally impact our business, similar to what we experienced in 2021.
now, i'll review how these assumptions impact our '22 outlook beginning with sales on slide 21. at the top of the slide, we've included a bridge that walks our fiscal 2021 sales of $13.7 billion to our pro forma 2021 sales of $14.3 billion. the pro forma sales reflect the impact of portfolio adjustments executed throughout the year. over the last two years, we have done a fair amount of portfolio rearrangement as part of our back-to-basics strategy. some of the changes were quite big while others were relatively small. in addition, some of the moves are very recent, so we pulled together a pro forma view of 2021 to help you understand the total impact.
as you can see, the china strategic transaction adds roughly $870 million to our consolidated sales. small divestitures in china of a leftover piece of our fabrics business and some entities obtained through the futuris acquisition reduced pro forma sales by approximately $120 million. note that these small divestitures represented businesses where we had not won nor did we expect to win replacement business and thus had fairly immaterial proceeds.
we recently sold our interest in a metals operation in turkey to an unconsolidated jv we have in the same country. this will impact our consolidated sales by about $100 million. other minor footprint actions across emea and americas total about $50 million and primarily related to small plant closures for business that was running off. bottom line, if these transactions had happened at the beginning of fiscal '21, adient's consolidated sales would have been about $14.3 billion versus the $13.7 billion reported.
now, walking the $14.3 billion to our forecast for fiscal '22. volume net new business, the impact of commercial and commodity recoveries and fx are expected to provide tailwinds, but partially offsetting the positive influences are customer pricing headwinds. in the end, based on the current environment and positive and negative influences, we're forecasting fiscal '22 consolidated sales of about $14.8 billion.
turning to slide 22, we've also included a high level bridge illustrating our expectations for adjusted ebitda. similar to sales, we've provided a pro forma walk at the top. key drivers include the impact of the china strategic transaction, which benefits consolidated ebitda by about $90 million and reduces equity income by roughly $155 million. this impact to equity income is slightly higher versus our original estimate due to better than expected performance at yfas in the fourth quarter.
the other china transactions, namely the leftover piece of our fabrics business, some entities obtained through the futuris acquisition and the impact of adient selling its 50% equity interest in its sja joint venture, which was announced concurrently with the china strategic transaction, will impact ebitda in total by about $15 million.
the emea jv deconsolidation will decrease consolidated ebitda by $20 million, partially offset by an increase in equity income of about $5 million. proceeds related to this transaction will total about $50 million, $40 million of which was collected on october 1. the $50 million in total proceeds reflect the unique challenges to this operation relating to winning and launching the replacement business in turkey. the footprint actions in the emea and americas primarily represents several small operations that were closed due to expiring contracts, for example, the tesla business in california that we have discussed in the past.
with all of the puts and takes, adient's fiscal '21 adjusted ebitda would have been roughly $810 million, adjusting for the portfolio changes, versus the $947 million reported. by quarter, the $810 million would be calendarized as follows: approximately $320 million in q1, $290 million in q2; $125 million in q3; and $75 million in q4.
now, walking the $810 million to our forecast for fiscal 22. starting with the positives, the volume, although muted, given the production expectations in asia, is expected to have a year-over-year benefit, temporary compensation actions such as suspending the company's 401(k) match in the us, our e-band salary reduction and rsu replacement program, and other similar actions. similarly, our back-to-basics strategy is expected to drive further operational and cost improvements. and finally, commercial profitability actions and the impact of fx will provide much needed tailwinds.
unfortunately, offsetting these benefits are several headwinds such as significantly elevated commodity cost net of recoveries, which are forecast to be approximately a $125 million hit year-on-year. we assume commodity prices will remain at their current levels if prices drop and, depending on when the drop occurs, this could translate into an upside within our forecast. this compares favorably to the previous estimate of a $200 million impact that we discussed on our last call as our team has developed mitigation strategies to offset some of the impact.
in addition, higher freight and energy costs are expected to pressure earnings. while we are actively pursuing and implementing mitigation plans, we've seen costs for freight lanes increase 7 to 10 times over the last year. mix will contribute to the downward pressure as higher margin regions such as china and southeast asia are expected to experience lower volumes, lower equity income compared to our pro forma adjusted results driven by outperformance in fiscal '21 and the impact of net commodity costs at our unconsolidated joint ventures.
engineering and launch costs are forecast to be higher in fiscal '22 versus '21. certain of this increase is attributed to various programs being pushed from '21 into '22 as fiscal '21 experienced an unusually low level of spend. finally, certain of the benefits recognized in fiscal '21 are not expected to repeat in 2022. one such example is the roughly $30 million of commercial settlements we called out in q1 fiscal '21 that we considered one-time in nature.
bottom line, when sifting through the puts and takes at this moment, we expect the headwinds to modestly outweigh the tailwinds for 2022 to be somewhere less -- and for 2022 to be somewhere less than our pro forma 2021 results. given the volatility around inflation inputs, the challenges around securing labor, especially given the uncertainties around the impact the vaccine mandate will have and other challenges we've discussed, providing more specific guidance on full-year fiscal '22 adjusted ebitda with reasonable certainty is not possible at this time. that said, we will continue to provide regular updates to the market as clarity hopefully returns.
it's also reasonable to apply the same impact to fiscal 2022 as summarized on slide 5 of this presentation. the shortfall in our expected revenues due to supply constraints appears approximately consistent year-over-year, as do our inefficiencies. meanwhile, the commodity headwinds have increased further $125 million.
one final point on our fiscal '22 ebitda forecast, we'd expect our first quarter results to be the lower watermark for the year. in fact, q1 ebitda is currently expected to settle at or modestly higher versus the quarter just completed after adjusting for our footprint changes.
two key reasons: first, we will experience a step-up in our negotiated steel prices, which took effect october 1; second, we benefited from several true-ups, as mentioned earlier, to our year-end accruals in fiscal '21's fourth quarter such as our incentive compensation and medical accruals, effectively meaning that we had over accrued in earlier quarters and trued them up to actual results in q4. we largely expect these factors to offset the benefit of slightly higher revenues in our first quarter.
now that we've covered our fiscal '22 expectations for sales and adjusted ebitda, let me quickly comment on expectations for a few key financial metrics on slide 23. starting with equity income, based on our assumptions of production in china, the portfolio actions implemented in fiscal '21 and fx rates, we'd expect equity income to land around $80 million to $90 million. interest expense of about $150 million includes an assumption of a further $1 billion of principal debt prepayments in 2022.
cash taxes in fiscal '22 are expected to be around $80 million. our booked cash taxes are expected to be slightly higher, call it about $100 million at this time. during fiscal '22, we might see our adjusted effective tax rate higher than normal and fluctuations among quarters due to valuation allowances in our geographic mix of income. that said, it's important to remember that we maintain valuable tax attributes such as net operating loss carry-forwards and that these tax attributes can be used to offset profits on a going-forward basis. so, cash taxes on adient's operations should remain relatively low even as profits increase. capital expenditures are forecast to be about $300 million to $325 million.
just a few comments regarding the forecast as it's elevated versus the 2021 spend. first, the majority of spend supports customer launch plans and the timing of those launches. fiscal 2021 spend was unusually low, under 2% of sales, as certain launches were pushed into fiscal 2022. a slight uptick year-over-year is driven by the consolidation of cq-adnt and the lundfung [phonetic] entities as part of the china transaction, call it around $15 million or so.
as you can see at the bottom of the slide, given the backdrop of the current operating environment, providing specific full-year estimates for adjusted ebitda, equity income and free cash flow with reasonable certainty is not possible at this time.
with that, let's move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call. operator, first question, please.
