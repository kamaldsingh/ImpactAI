thank you. (operator instructions) our first question comes from michael lasser of ubs. your line is now open.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
good morning. thanks a lot for taking my question. tom, your comparisons are going to get a lot tougher in the next couple of quarters. if we just go through the two-year stack, (technical difficulty) negative comp, how are you going to be able to think low to mid-single-digit comp rate that (technical difficulty) over the last quarter?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
hey. good morning, michael. we feel pretty good about where we're situated for the year. the important metrics that we track to drive comp improvement are working well for us. we look at them every single week and in some cases daily. so, when we look at upt, our primary e-com metrics. our loyalty program, which is speed perks, we're excited about some refinements we've made there, that we're rolling out. on the pro side, dynamic assortment is helping with our stock rate and close rate. so we really track the input metrics. and as we see those input metrics translate the sales improvement, we are confident that we continue to build on the two-year stack that we put up in the first quarter. and that's kind of how we plan the year. obviously we're starting to lap growth and we're excited about that. we want to continue to drive growth and have comp sales at or above the industry average. and overall, we're pleased with the fact that both pro and diy grew in the first quarter, and that's the goal for the rest of the year.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
that helps. my follow-up question is, you see good gross margin expansion in the first quarter, but (technical difficulty) moderated from where we've seen over the last few quarters. that coupled with one of your competitors reporting similar trend yesterday, it started to raise the question, is the auto parts retail sector (technical difficulty) gross margin, can you comment specifically on that topic and then what outlook for advance gross margin (technical difficulty) next quarter?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure, mike. we've had a number of initiatives that we've had in place for a while. our material cost optimization is something that's ongoing. we're always looking for ways to minimize costs. we're working very collaboratively with our supply partners in terms of minimizing those costs, and we obviously saw some evidence of that this quarter. we think that can continue. we work with them day in and day out. we've been through the various categories in aapcq and we're continuing to do that as we work through with ai and worldpac. so, we look at that -- obviously we look at our assortment, we look at private label, that's another area that we're addressing. so, for us in particular, we think we have a number of areas that we can focus on to continue to drive cost down and keep our margins where they're at or better.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
so, just to clarify, we should assume that price transparency starting to creep in the industry and everyone is having to promote a little bit more to drive sales.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
i wouldn't necessarily assume that, michael. we've been consistent in terms of how we look at the business that really, especially on the professional side, product availability is king. and then you've obviously got other factors in there, the relationship we have with our customers. obviously, you've got to be competitive on price, but there is other levers that are more important. so, we're looking at pricing very closely in addition to what jeff said. i mean, the material cost optimization work is excellent that mike broderick and his team are leading. we do feel we have a disproportionate opportunity that grow our private label business relative to others maybe. we have a lower starting point. but we've got to look strategically across our business at pricing. and where it makes sense, we're going to be more intense and more competitive. and in other places, we see opportunities to expand margins. so, we've got a tremendous opportunity to grow gross margins, and that's a big part of our long-term plan.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from chris horvers of jpmorgan. your line is now open.
chris horvers -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
chris horvers -- jpmorgan -- analyst
a couple of questions. so, on the investment side, can you talk about how much investments were put in, in the first quarter, i think you talked about roughly 100 basis points of investment pressure over the year. how much did you put it in the first quarter? and then laterally, can you also talk about how you think about the growth rate of sg&a dollars or perhaps leverage over the balance of the year so the cadence how you're thinking about that?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, sure. as it relates to the investments, chris, as a reminder, we indicated the $80 million to $120 million of what we're calling opex investments back into the business, and that's a combination of technology-related people and marketing, and we're very much on track. we've reinvested that and it's going to continue to ramp during the year. but we're very much in line with that guidance that we provided you.
chris horvers -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and then, in terms of like how you think about just the overall, say, sg&a leverage, i think on the last call you talked about sort of steady improvement over the year from a leverage perspective on sg&a?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. if you remember, we talked about our sg&a to be consistent with what we saw in 2018. we finished the year at 36.3%, and we anticipate we'll be in line with that in 2019.
chris horvers -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. and then, just broadly you talked about improvement to your stacks in the comps diy and commercial up, how did the stacks shake out on the diy and commercial front? and you didn't mention northeast as an outperforming region, was that an area that you saw more of sort of underperformance relatively on the diy side?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, we called out the top performing regions. we have 12 of them. and honestly, we grew everywhere. we're happy with our overall comp performance. the northeast was a little bit behind, not significantly behind, actually was close to being in the top 5, if you will, chris. but overall, we continue to be happy with our business up there.
chris horvers -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and then, the diy versus commercial, any comments on stacks in the first quarter relative to 4q?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. both of them grew on a two-year stack basis. and as we said, both diy and pro grew. pro outperformed diy by a little bit. i mean, this has been a couple of quarters in a row where we've been relatively close. there isn't a huge outperformance in aggregate. the professional business is coming together under bob cushing where we're kind of packaging our entire lineup under the professional banner that we call advance professional. and then, obviously diy omni-channel, we're integrating the online experience with the in-store experience, and that's performing well. so, relatively close by professional outperformed diy in the quarter.
chris horvers -- jpmorgan -- analyst
excellent. best of luck, guys. thanks.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from bret jordan of jefferies. your line is now open.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, bret.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
could you give us an update as to where we are on the walmart partnership and the omni-channel initiative?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. we're very excited about this one, bret. we're very much on track with what we've talked about. we're building an automotive specialty store on walmart.com where our customers will have access to our parts, accessories and maintenance items, et cetera, in addition to walmart's other offerings. and we're really working together on delivering a differentiated experience. we believe we can bring speed, convenience and trusted advice to the large number of diy customers who are already going to walmart.com everyday. we're on track to get started in the front half, we'll build the capabilities for the year. i don't expect this to be a big factor in the second half, because we want to make sure that the customer proposition is absolutely best-in-class at each stage of our roll-out. we meet on this every week, and it's something that we're very aligned with the walmart team on. so, going well and more to come.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. then a follow-up. as far as the progress and closing some distribution infrastructure, any experience do you have as far as converting systems and maybe fill rates and stores where you're seeing some dc shutdowns?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we've -- i think we've hardened that process, brad. we've now closed three buildings. we're now looking at how we can further optimize our existing dcs, and that includes our cross-manner replenishment initiative, which we've spoken about. we're now making daily replenishment deliveries to a group of carquest stores from an advance dc. and within this pilot, we're still in the learning phase, but we expect to be complete at that by summer. separately we've got a pilot that's replenishing in advance store from a carquest dc. so, the plan here is to take what we've learned from these pilots and really scale them to other dc store combinations later in the year and into 2020. so, we're getting the process down when we point a store at a new distribution center, we're making sure that we don't lose any momentum. and the intent there is to do it in such a way that the catching dc is ready to go when we point that store at the catching dc. so we haven't seen any deterioration in fill rates. i mean, we've finished up the three. i think we finished up the most recent one in the first quarter of this year, and we're excited about it. there is a tremendous opportunity for us to take cost out with this initiative.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thank you. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from mike baker of deutsche bank. your line is now open.
mike baker -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you. i just wanted to ask you about trends throughout the first quarter. were you impacted by tax refunds at all? how does that impacted february and what has happened since then? this is particularly long quarter for you guys. and i guess you mentioned the weather impacts. so i'm wondering if you could quantify that.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. first of all, mike, on tax refunds, we looked at the scans by week. we get the syndicated data from npd, and we did see a bit of a lag there but it did come back as the quarter ended. so it really wasn't a factor for us at all. and weather was volatile, it always is in the first quarter. i would say that generally some of these season's straddle quarters for us, whether it's winter between q4 and q1, or even now, as you think about the spring selling season, it was a little warmer in april this year than it was last year. it's been a little cooler to start off may, so the spring selling season has been somewhat elongated in that regard, but i wouldn't say there was any material impact on the first quarter results for us.
mike baker -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. and then, i guess, related to that and really to follow-up on chris' question, so you comped at 2.7, which is above your full year guidance of 1 to 2.5, so that either suggests that you decelerate through the year or there is upside to that guidance. so, in your opinion, which is more likely, and do you expect to comp positively in all four quarters?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
that's certainly the plan is to comp positively in all four quarters. we do have more difficult lapse in the back half of the year. we're confident in our full year guide. our goal obviously is to be at or above the industry average. so, clearly we're focused on beating the number. but that said, we're sticking with our full year guide and we're confident we'll achieve that.
mike baker -- deutsche bank -- analyst
and one more related to that. was the first quarter 2.7, how is that in line with your internal plan?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it was slightly lower than our internal plan for the quarter. but as we look at the full year, we did front-end load the plan. that's what we like to do here to make sure that we make it difficult to start the year, and we remain confident in the full year guide.
mike baker -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. i appreciate all the color. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from seth basham with wedbush securities. your line is now open.
seth basham -- wedbush securities -- analyst
thanks a lot, and good morning. my question is around cross-banner replenishment. you gave a little bit more color. but i was wondering if you could be more specific as to when you expect to have the chain up and running fully on cross-banner replenishment. is it 2020 or 2021 then?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure, seth. yeah, very exciting initiative for us. appreciate the question. we were using -- reuben slone is leading this work. we've got some special software that we're using that allows us to be much more freight logical in our design of our system. we have all the assets we need to succeed. we've got 50-plus distribution centers, as you know. and many of them are positioned in urban markets like a chicago and dallas, et cetera, and they operate in a silo today. so we'll be able to use those dcs very definitely, think about dallas, texas. we've got a blue dc sitting in dallas. we've got a whole bunch of stores there, but we don't ship them from dallas, we ship them from houston actually. so, as we stand all this up, it's going to really help our -- not just our cost, but our availability and our speed to get product to our stores. the plan is to get out these dc store combinations in the back half of this year. we see it continuing through '20. it might bleed into the front half of '21. we're going to be very careful about this change. obviously as we have been with dc closures to-date, we want to make sure that we're executing flawlessly and we're not disrupting the customer. so, the plan is to essentially start the ball rolling in the back half of this year. next year will be a busy year as we transfer stores to new dcs, and again it might drift into the front half of '21, but we'll be realizing the full benefit of these savings and the availability improvements by that timeframe.
seth basham -- wedbush securities -- analyst
really helpful color. and then, secondly, a follow-up just around gross margins this quarter. jeff, was there any lifo benefit or charge this quarter?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. there was the lifo charge this quarter of $26 million that was largely -- more than offset by changes in our supply chain costs that we were capitalizing on the balance sheet. so, what we call, our inventory related costs were de-minimis this quarter, and that's consistent with the year-over-year quarter as well.
seth basham -- wedbush securities -- analyst
okay. now a bit more color around the adjustment you made on gross margin this quarter with out of period adjustments?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, sure. that was something, as we were closing our books, we came across that. it really relates to prior years as we were going through and looking at some of the processes we had around matching some of our invoices. there was a lot of really small invoices that have added up over the years, should run through the inventories as far back as 2014. so none of that relates to 2019, which is why we want to call it out separately.
seth basham -- wedbush securities -- analyst
fair enough. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from simeon gutman of morgan stanley. your line is now open.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning, everyone. my question, it's sort of a follow-up on a few questions regarding the rest of the year and sales. so you are outperforming the peer group for a bunch of quarters. now it's somewhat underperformed in the first quarter. you do have tougher comparisons now in the back half. so, can i ask it in this way, if you look at the initiatives around sales for this year versus ones that were in place last year, are they any -- are they more incremental, are they more marginal or are any of the initiatives you're working on should result in -- i'd like a step change to the sales overtime or thinking about distribution longer term, that's the next layer that's going to unlock better throughput?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
that's great question, simeon. i mean, i think, look, we're obviously very cognizant of where we're situated. we're pleased that we're competing in a very healthy industry that's growing. that's something you're hearing from everyone, very excited about the prospects for 2019 and beyond as that vehicles in the sweet spot continues to grow. our agenda is a complex one, as you know. i mean, we're primarily focused on delighting our customers and improving execution and drive sales growth, but we're also very focused on delivering margin expansion, profitability and cash flow. so, we're taking a balanced approach to executing our strategy. we're going to continue to drive the initiatives that i spoke about earlier to drive more top line. of course, we'd like to have more sales and we want to be gaining share, and we're balancing that with the need to deliver the p&l overall.
i think, in terms of specific initiatives, i'm probably most excited about the launch of our speed perks loyalty program in the back half of this year. that should help us with diy significantly. we're focused on our most loyal customers. we've had a pilot market in place for a couple of periods now that we're beginning to scale. we see some big upside there. obviously online continues to perform extremely well.
and i think bob cushing, on the professional side, we are seeing significant momentum in our two-year stacks there as we kind of package together our overall offering. you've got cross-banner visibility now in place. myadvance is working well for us. we're seeing increased adoption of our advance pro catalog, more online ordering. so there's a lot going on, and we're trying to balance everything that we're doing in a way that we continue to execute flawlessly.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. my follow-up is on distribution. you just laid out the timeframe for, i guess, progress overtime and some of the big changes. you increased pay, you mentioned that last quarter. can you talk about -- i don't think it would have the same impact. and if you increased pay at a store, you might see better productivity. can you talk about what that changes meaning to the distribution center, i guess maybe through turnover and is productivity improving from those changes alone?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, for sure. first of all, there's nothing more important than our team members. i want to emphasize that to our success. we're focused on attracting the very best people that we can. and we knew there was going to be higher wages this year in 2019. we reviewed our exposure to each dma. i think as you know, simeon, we've made a big investment in our frontline team members in the store -- stores themselves through our unique fuel the frontline stock ownership program, which now in its third full year. we also substantially improved our 401(k) platform that is available to everyone. so we're making sure that we're helping our team members with even retirement planning, if you will.
in the dcs, reuben felt pretty strongly that our wage increase in the dcs would help reduce turnover, and i've been quite surprised at how rapidly that impacted our turnover in the dcs. we've seen a pretty significant drop very quickly, and it has helped us. i mean, it's helped us with the fill rates, the reliability, the accuracy, and also we've taken several days off our reclamation in the dcs. so, i think overall it's helping our execution, and i know reuben is very committed to standardization, and really getting much more commonality across our buildings. and i think that will help us also. so, clearly when you make a wage investment, there has to be an output metric that you can attribute to the investment you're making in wages. and i think we're connecting those dots pretty well.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from scot ciccarelli of rbc capital markets. your line is now open.
scot ciccarelli -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good morning, guys. scot ciccarelli. so, i know it's an ongoing process, but can you guys update us kind of where you are in the process of renegotiating terms and pricing with your vendors?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. first of all, scot, i think it's really an iterative process. we're never going to be done. but when we talked about sort of the first round, we were specifically focused on aapcq, we're about 90% there. we've gone through the major categories. we're ramping that up, but again it doesn't stop. we're going to go back and we're going to be looking at worldpac. we're looking at some of the categories that started over a year ago. and so, it's going to be an ongoing process. like you said earlier, we're working very collaboratively with our supplier partners. and so, we expect to continue this process as we look for margin improvement and we look for strong relationships with our vendors.
scot ciccarelli -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then, a follow-up. can you also provide -- i know you talked a bit about cross-banner, product sales and how that distribution back end is changing. is it possible to provide some color or range, however you want to describe it, regarding how you think about the contribution margin performance and how that will change as you guys try to optimize the back end?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
can you expand on that a little bit, scot? i want to make sure i understand your question.
scot ciccarelli -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
tom, specifically on the cross-banner sales -- cross-banner product sales. my understanding has been that the profit margins on the sales had been relatively modest. and as you guys optimize the supply chain and delivery and distribution part of it, there is an opportunity set for those margins to expand. if you can just kind of help us frame it some way, i think that might be helpful for the group.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, for sure, we're again starting to make progress on that one. we weren't clear on what the impact of cross-banner visibility was going to be when we first rolled it out. i mean, you're making worldpac parts visible to our advance pro -- our advance customers in that respect and vice versa, et cetera. so, now we've got a pretty good handle on what are the brands that our customers weren't able to get before, but now that they can see a broader array of parts they are now able to get. so, we've been able to map that out, and now we've had meetings dma by dma that reuben is leading to ensure that we're essentially moving the parts around in market as efficiently as possible.
we start to lap this, i think, in the second quarter. we did see our expenses. our transportation in market fleet expenses came down a little bit in the first quarter from where they've been. so that optimization work is happening. and i think as we get into the second and third quarter, i think it be -- we'll be in a position to start actually potentially saving some money in those lines.
scot ciccarelli -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
understand. okay. thanks, guys.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from chris bottiglieri of wolfe research. your line is now open.
chris bottiglieri -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my questions. first one is just on leverage. it looks like given the lease accounting changes that you adopted, your leverage metric decreased about half a turn from that change. so what is, i guess, figure out if that's the way the ratings are looking at it in credit investors? and then, mike, given the methodology change, should we still rely on the historical 2.5 to 3 turns a leverage under this new methodology or has that also changed?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, obviously i can't speak for the ratings agencies or how they're going to look at this. when we looked at it, the 6 times rent expense was really a proxy for what we thought an obligation would be. with the new lease accounting standard, we now have that on balance sheet, we have it quantified in accordance with the methodology that should be used consistently across the industry. so we just felt like it was a better indicator of what our true obligation was. so to be clear into your point, the old model if you want to use the 6 times rent expense, you're right, we'd be at 2.6. so we're still very close to our stated objective of 2.5, but we do think the new methodology is better because it's a true reflection of what that obligation is and you can clearly see that on our balance sheet.
chris bottiglieri -- wolfe research -- analyst
got you. makes sense. and then, big picture question on the supply chain. autozone yesterday raised their mega hub strategy to 60 to 90 hubs. o'reilly disclosed for the first time they secretly had 80 super hubs. a while back you guys had been experimenting with, i forgot if you call it super hubs or something to that effect. just curious where you stand today on those and if you think your current distribution infrastructure is adequate to compete in today's evolving commercial landscape. thank you.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. first of all, i think honestly everybody defines these things a little bit differently. the way we look at it is we have 50 million square feet of buildings, and we're going to put the most optimal parts in the closest to the customer locations we can. and that's the exercise that we're going through. i mean, you think about, we have carquest dc that has a lot of parts in it, it's only servicing the blue network today. i think we're in a very different starting point than some of our industry peers. and we're looking at optimizing those assets and making sure that we're connecting basically the customer back work that we're doing, which is to really understand on the professional side job-by-job, what are the requirements for the parts that they need, which ones are acquire rapid delivery, which ones maybe there might be a more of a willingness to wait, if you will. so it's using all of our asset base and working back. i think, in that respect, we're taking the assets that we have and optimizing those, and there's plenty of room for us to improve the cost structure of the company as we do that.
chris bottiglieri -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. then just like one final follow up there. i think earlier in the call you had mentioned, looking to -- bob was looking to -- or reuben (ph) or other looking to standardize like the (ph) physical laying out the dcs. as i've understood, the carquest dcs were a lot smaller in square foot print, much more of the nutritional legacy, call it like diy dcs or how you want to frame those. so i want to get a sense for, to what extent you're able to standardize the entirety of the supply chain and how those two legacy infrastructures will complement each other? thank you.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. good question, chris. i mean, i think the -- reuben is really in execution mode on supply chain. i think you start with just improving basic execution, and we talked about running common. this is a very basic supply chain concept. but for a variety of reasons, mostly systems related, we weren't actually doing this. so, getting to a common platform, even though the building might be different in size and shape, you can get the common method throughout the building, right. that's a very important process for us.
i talked about the dc optimization quite logical. i think the other piece that we are working on is investing in a single warehouse management system to replace legacy systems within advance and carquest. and this will significantly improve, what we call, labor management standardization or lms. so that's an important priority for us with reuben. we believe we can get much more common in terms of the processes, you think about people, process, technology. people, making investments in the people that we have to make sure we've got the best people working in our dcs. we're reorganizing the processes that they have to make their jobs easier, and then we're supporting the technology. so that's really his agenda in that regard, and he is making a lot of progress. he is building a great team and we're excited about the prospects for supply chain not just in terms of cost optimization, but in terms of availability.
chris bottiglieri -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. thanks for all the detail. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from elizabeth suzuki of bank of america. your line is now open.
elizabeth suzuki -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, thank you. this may have been asked already, but just wanted to touch on it. has there been any material impact on the business or the industry yet from the step up in tariffs and what have you guys seen in inflation in the last couple of quarters?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so, in terms of tariffs, this is something we've been analyzing for a while, both the tariff that already have taken place last year as well as the potential impact. and we feel like we've taken the necessary steps to mitigate it. but a couple of things, relative -- in relative terms, our industry has less exposure to tariffs than most other retail sectors. obviously i can't speak for everyone in our industry, but for us, the categories that are impacted are less than 10% of our total direct imports. as it relates to indirect imports, it's a little more difficult, but we think it's in that same range about 10%, so a total of 20%. to-date, we've been able to pass on the impact of tariffs. given the key categories that have been impacted to-date, we haven't seen a material change in unit performance, and that's going back to the tariffs that took place in 2018.
and then, we've taken several steps to mitigate the impact, including sourcing refinements and working collaboratively with our suppliers. and they are equally motivated to mitigate the impact of the tariff. we feel like we're positioned competitively as our industry peers are generally in the same position. we've managed through the first round. but without a doubt, the 25% of tariff for this round is a meaningful increase passed on to our customers. but the industry historically has been able to pass on these increases, particularly on the pro side where the cost is embedded in the cost of the job. diy, there's obviously a little more risk, but we feel like we've done everything we can to mitigate the impact, and we'll continue to monitor this very closely.
elizabeth suzuki -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and is there any impact from inflation to-date or in the last quarter that you can break out for us?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
we've seen a little bit of inflation. obviously labor rates, we continue to see there has been some cost increases, but it's been in line with our expectations. kind of that 2% to 3% range is what we've been seeing, so nothing out of the ordinary, i would say.
elizabeth suzuki -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. but in terms of the contribution of comp in the quarter, of that 2.7%, was there any sku for sku increase in price?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, we did take some pricing actions again to offset -- remember, we've got the tariffs that took place in the fourth quarter, so we had cost headwinds in the quarter, but that was more than offset by the pricing and some of our mcl efforts. but, yeah, we did have some price, but again nothing significant and obviously didn't have an impact on rate.
elizabeth suzuki -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it, ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from michael montani of evercore isi. your line is now open.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking the questions. just wanted to build on the last question a little bit. if you were to assume the next $300 billion plus of imported goods were to get tariffs, would that basically have the effect of doubling the 20% exposure that you all have had from section 301 or how should we think about the potential exposure?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's tom, michael. no, i mean, when we look at it, we look at the whole -- all of the list, one, two, three, everything that's in there. and that's the number we gave. so -- and just a little more color when jeff was talking about. i mean, we obviously have been tracking list one, list two, list three. so those things that have been impacted, we haven't seen a meaningful change in unit movement. others have been around this industry a lot longer than i have, but they've said consistently, you've heard that we don't expect this to have an impact. we're very cognizant, 25% is a big number, but we haven't seen an impact to -date. so that's obviously something we have to monitor very closely.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. and then, within the comps, so the 2.7 that you reported, can you give some incremental color around what the ticket did versus the traffic in the quarter and how that compares to trend?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, it depends on the business, of course. but consistent with previous quarters, we are seeing diy retail continues to be challenged on traffic. and that's something that we're very focused on. we've launched a new advertising campaign. we're seeing improved awareness, top-of-mind aided awareness, unaided awareness, all improving. so we feel like we're making progress there. but unfortunately, michael, that's still a negative number. and then obviously average ticket has been able to offset that, e-commerce is strong on both ends, professional stronger on both, but diy retail transactions is the one that we remain concerned about. we measure e-commerce transactions, whether it's buy online, pick up and store or ship to home. so we put the transactions for diy e-com inside the e-com number. so, the diy retail transactions are pure -- somebody walking in the swinging doors.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. and just the last one from me was around leverage point. so, given the investments of $80 million to $120 million, and there's obviously discrete offsets that you have in the cost structure as well. what kind of comps would you all need to kind of lever sg&a into the back half of the year? and maybe just bigger picture, you could give us an update on some of the gross cost savings opportunities over the years, there has been different years, $0.5 billion, $750 million plus, what kind of a bucket have you realized so far out of that and how much remains to go?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, i think, on the comps, i mean, we obviously constructed our plan to deliver on the guidance we provided. so, we gave a guide on sales, we gave a guide on margin expansion and embedded in that margin expansion obviously we're focused on making the investments that we feel we need to in order to drive the long-term growth of the company, which is in four big areas. and we've talked about that.
the opportunity that we have is substantial. i think we're quite unique in terms of our overall margin expansion opportunity. i mean, we're growing our sales and at the same time, we believe we can drive our margins significantly higher. and that's going to come from improved sales and profit per store, which is a big opportunity for us. supply chain, which we've spoken about, improved category management of the different categories we have and then reduction in sg&a. when you put all that together, we believe we can close the gap we have with our industry peers pretty significantly over the next several years, and we're going to try and get to our stated goal of mid-teens as rapidly as we can. so that's kind of where it is. we've talked about 2019 and 2020 having some pretty big investments in order to set up our technology platforms to enable that longer-term outcome. at the same time, we're on track with those initiatives, and achieving the milestones we need to do to get there.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you and good luck.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from daniel imbro of stephens incorporated. your line is now open.
daniel imbro -- stephens incorporated -- analyst
hey. good morning and thanks for taking my questions, and thanks for all your color today. tom, a bit of a follow-up actually on the last few questions. and in the prepared remarks, we've talked a lot about in-store technology as well as some dc technological investments you're making. can you just help us think about a time frame. i think you just referenced a minute ago, but when we should begin to see some of those benefits showing up on the p&l, whether that's through higher sales numbers or through some cost efficiencies in the stores, so what kind of timeframe should we be thinking about before we start seeing the benefits there?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. good question, daniel. i mean, first of all, it varies widely unfortunately. i'll try and give you a bit of color. when you talk about the technology and e-commerce investments that we're making, it's by far the biggest part of the opex investments over half. we've really changed the investment profile of the company when we think about opex or capex. we use to invest primarily in new stores, and now we've shifted that investment profile to much more technology and e-commerce space. so, when you're talking about when will we see payback. well, you talked about integration-related items, so getting to a single payroll system. okay, getting to a single back-office system, getting to a single warehouse management system, all of those are in flight, we should start to realize the sg&a benefits associated with those starting next year and then mostly as we get into '21. because you have to -- the problem here daniel is, you have to keep the old system operating as you basically sunset -- sorry, as you stand up the new system. and in some cases, we're moving our platforms to the cloud, et cetera. so it's a little bit complicated there, but we have very high level of confidence that we can take the commensurate cost out at some point in time in the future.
in addition, we're making big bets in the e-commerce area. so there, you're starting to see more early returns. so, we're getting high growth there. we're getting more people to our website. we're driving more top line growth. that's an important part of our overall sales and profit per store input. so that's a bit of a different piece of it.
finally, we're currently installing a next generation store network across the entire chain. and i can't tell you how excited our team members are about this. i mean, sri donthi, who is our chief technology officer, has rolled this out. we're going in store by store and replacing a very slow legacy system with a much more rapid, much more connected, much more modern point-of-sale system catalog and phone, and it's having great success out of the gate. we've done several hundred stores already. we plan to complete that project this year. i would expect that to start realizing benefits now in the current stores. obviously -- until we get to 4,000 plus, we will get the full benefit, but next year, we'll get the full benefit of that. so, it depends on what you're talking about in terms of these technology platforms. but the idea is to really differentiate ourselves versus our competition with our online experience, be that in professional or in diy, to make the job easier for our team members in the stores or distribution centers, and of course to integrate the company, which is long overdue and something that we're very focused on.
daniel imbro -- stephens incorporated -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thanks. and then a quick follow-up jeff. just on capital allocation, under the new leverage you noted kind of a multi-year low. but looking at the cash flow statement, i don't think you guys repurchased any shares since the 4q report. so i was just wondering if you could update us on your thinking about capital allocation from here as you invest in all these technological and different opportunities, but free cash flow should be improving from here. so, any update on that front?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, sure. and just as a reminder, our capital allocation priorities as we want to maintain our investment grade rating, reinvest in the business and then return excess cash to our shareholders. couple of things just on the cash return front, we did two things this quarter. first, we did repurchase $127 million worth of stock in the first quarter. we don't have anything else planned right now for the rest of the year, but we continue to look at that, that's obviously very fluid and we will be opportunistic with that. but there is currently no plans right now. we did buyback debt in the first quarter. so that was another $300 million of debt that we retired early which would come due next year. and we're very much on track with our investments that we've been talking about and we feel confident that we're going to be well within the range of the guidance that we provided last quarter. so we feel like we're doing all of the things that are consistent with our capital allocation priorities, and we're very much on track with everything that we've indicated.
daniel imbro -- stephens incorporated -- analyst
thanks so much, guys.

thank you. and ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. i would now like to turn the call back over to tom greco for any closing remarks.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. a couple of quick comments in closing. my team and i look forward to kicking off our second annual american heart association fundraising campaign throughout the stores next week. and the aha, as many of you know, is an organization that's extremely important to all of us. and well, i'm proud of the fundraising accomplishments we had last year. we're looking forward to exceeding our campaign goals this year. so look forward in our stores, heart diseases, the number one killer of americans, and all of us at advance are committed to help change that statistic.
and before i conclude, i want to take a moment to express our sincere gratitude to all our nation's heroes who have served, especially those men and women we honor this memorial day weekend who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country. i wish you all a safe, healthy and happy holiday weekend, and we look forward to discussing our second quarter results with you in august.

welcome to advance auto parts first quarter 2019 conference call. before we begin, elisabeth eisleben, vice president, investor relations will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be discussed on this call.
elisabeth eisleben -- vice president, investor relations
good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2019 results. i'm joined by tom greco, our president and chief executive officer; and jeff shepherd, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.

now, let me turn the call over to tom greco.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, elizabeth. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our first quarter 2019. i'd like to begin with recognizing our more than 70,000 dedicated advance team members and our superb network of carquest independents. their unwavering commitment to say yes to our customers enable advance to deliver progress in q1, while making necessary investments to solidify the achievement of our long-term strategic goals.
in the first quarter, net sales increased 2.7% to $3 billion and comparable store sales were also up 2.7%. our adjusted operating income margin of 8.3% increased 46 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. and our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17.1% to $2.46. in a few moments, jeff will speak to the details of our financial results. however, i wanted to share some highlights from our q1 performance first.
in the first quarter, we delivered broad-based positive comp sales with the highest growth coming from our midwest, mid-atlantic, appalachia, carolina's and central regions. from a category perspective, we saw strong growth in brakes, motor oil and batteries. in the first quarter, we experienced some weather-related volatility, primarily in the diy segment. this is not unusual in this timeframe. at the same time, we're pleased that our comparable store sales were positive in both diy retail and professional in q1.
in addition, our e-commerce team delivered meaningful growth throughout the quarter. we achieved this while delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and an improvement on our two-year stack versus q4. our professional business was strong throughout the quarter. we believe that improving industry fundamentals are benefiting our professional business. we're seeing increased adoption and utilization of our unified front-end portal myadvance with our professional customers, which we expect will drive meaningful growth for both existing and new customers. as a reminder, myadvance is a one-stop shop of our full suite of tools for professional customers to build their business, including our new enterprise catalog advance pro.
advance pro has now been extended to fully support our carquest locations, bringing all the benefits of advance pro to more professional customers as we've now enabled our independence to leverage many of the catalog features we've rolled out in our company-owned stores. additionally, we recently expanded our tech-net program. tech-net is a business solutions partnership program designed to help independently owned repair facilities, grow their business and develop customer loyalty, while maintaining their own identities and serving their local communities.
the enhancements will help us grow this network of more than 9,800 tech-net shops across the us and canada. the enhancements were created with direct input and requests from existing tech-net partners. we're committed to being the trusted first call for all of our customers and continue to leverage feedback from our professional field team, carquest independence and tech-net customers to ensure they have the tools they need to succeed.
in addition to investments we're making for professional customers, we're also cognizant of how diy customer shopping patterns are evolving. we invested in key diy platforms in q1, including moving key capabilities to the cloud, enhancing our customers' digital experience, increasing site speed and improving shipping capabilities. we also made several back-end investments such as updating sku availability and accessibility on our website.
on the marketing side, we're making progress on elevating the advance brand and are pleased with the roll-out of our new campaign think ahead think advance. since launching the campaign, we've seen an increase in both purchase consideration and increases in website traffic with year-on-year increases outpacing the vast majority of all retailers. importantly, we've also seen continuous improvement in the overall awareness and brand recognition of advance through recent brand tracker surveys, which are the highest we've seen since we began tracking these metrics in the first quarter of 2017. in fact, our top-of-mind awareness scores improved both sequentially and year-over-year. this improvement is a direct result of our strategic focus on our omni-channel and an ongoing investment priority of our transformation.
finally, to round out our top-line growth initiatives, we're rolling out new tools for our frontline team members to make their daily tasks easier and allow them to focus on what really matters, serving and delighting our customers. one of our most important initiatives is our next-gen store network, updating outdated technology throughout our stores. several of our legacy systems and capabilities create delays and frustration for our frontline team members when they're not able to easily view our rapidly toggle between necessary tools such as our catalog, delivery dashboards, and training modules.
our next-gen network significantly increases speed and reliability, including a new connected phone system that allows us to serve customers better than ever. as one example, our team members can lookup parts much faster with an average 85% improvement in the speed of catalog lookups, ultimately providing faster and more reliable service for our customers.
our next-gen network is an example of our focus on reducing non-value-added tasks. unfortunately, our team members were spending an inordinate amount of time on these tasks, which takes them away from customer-facing value-added work. we're working to reduce these tasks throughout the enterprise. and as an example, in our stores, we recently launched myday, a tool that groups several modules to manage and direct the administrative and back-office work in our stores.
since early in q1, our gms report that they're reducing administrative work hours and can dedicate more time to customer-facing sales and team member training in their stores. we expect these investments will not only improve productivity in our stores and our customer support centers, we're also confident these initiatives will reduce turnover rates as we make it easier for all our team members to do their job. we continue to make excellent progress on improved retention. and in the first quarter, we reduced turnover by approximately 15%, among our core (technical difficulty) frontline team members. our goal in 2019 is to reduce turnover in each of our core frontline roles for the third consecutive year as advance (technical difficulty) the reputation of being the very best place to work for great parts people.
as we drive sales at or above the industry's average, we're equally focused on our unique opportunity to expand margins in four key areas. first, in terms of improving sales and profit per store and our footprint optimization strategy, we remain consistent in our approach to store closures and consolidations in the first quarter. in line with this commitment, during the quarter, we closed and consolidated 38 stores while reducing the cost of our overall rents obligation as we right-size our asset base. with our improved approach to store closures and consolidations, our overall rate of professional sales retention has consistently exceeded both historical and planned retention, and our field team is doing great work to retain top talent while working with our large network of stores to place team members. we've also had some significant wins on lease negotiations and have been successful in meaningfully reducing our lease liabilities. all of these factors will continue contributing to improved cash flow for aap.
in parallel, we also continue to look market by market for opportunities to drive growth. we're pleased with our execution of openings during the quarter, which included three new retail stores and three worldpac branches. we're also very excited to welcome 20 new independently owned carquest locations that joined the advance family in the first quarter. we'll continue to look for opportunities to optimize our footprint and drive our sales and profit per store to targeted levels.
second, in terms of supply chain, we're focused on the long-term optimization of our distribution center footprint as we improve execution day in and day out. with respect to q1, we made progress on our critical cross-banner replenishment initiative, which will enable us to ship parts from our legacy red dcs to legacy blue stores, and similarly with our blue dcs and red stores. this is a significant unlock that will reduce stem miles and improve customer service. once fully implemented, we expect to improve product availability, drive inventory turns and deliver significant cost productivity. in terms of execution, improving performance is primarily focused on standardization, and what we describe as running common in terms of processes across all dcs. for a variety of reasons, including systems, we do not do this today. i remain confident in the supply chain team's ability to transform and integrate our supply chain, while improving execution in 2019.
our third margin expansion opportunity is category management, where we're making progress in our ongoing material cost optimization efforts, development of private label and strategic pricing. finally, we remain focused on every single line within sg&a, once again leveraging store labor amid wage inflation, driving reductions in rent through our store footprint optimization efforts, while reducing insurance and workers' comp related costs with our dedicated focus on the safety of our team members. in terms of safety, we're seeing meaningful improvements in our incident rates, which is translating to the p&l. we're committed to further improvement as we continue executing on our detailed health and safety agenda.
overall, our operating margins improved again this quarter. that said, we know we still have a material opportunity ahead and continue to focus on ensuring the customer is first in everything we do. with this disciplined execution, we're confident we'll drive revenue growth and margin expansion.
before turning over to jeff, i want to thank him for his commitment to ensuring the financial success of advance by serving in dual roles over the past year, while we conducted an extensive search for the best candidate to succeed him in his controller and chief accounting officer role. after a thorough search, i'm pleased to announce that andrew page joined the advance team as our senior vice president, controller and chief accounting officer last week. andrew brings over 25 years of broad-based accounting experience with him, most recently as senior vice president and chief accounting officer for under armour, and we're thrilled to have on the advance team.
with that, i'll turn it over to jeff for details on our financial performance.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, tom, and good morning, everyone. i want to begin by welcoming andrew to the advance team. i'm confident that his experience will be a great addition to our finance organization and help deliver our finance division to drive customer and shareholder value through a world-class finance team. i'd also like to thank the entire advance team for their continued efforts in q1, which enabled another quarter of positive results.
in q1, our adjusted gross profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of 3.6% from the prior year quarter. on a rate basis, our adjusted gross profit margin of 44.6% improved by 37 basis points from the prior year quarter, driven by improved pricing that more than offset cost headwinds we're incurring, together with continued improvement in our inventory management throughout the enterprise. these gross margin benefits were partially offset by planned investments in supply chain wages as we're focused on reducing turnover and improving execution throughout our distribution centers.
in addition, our margin expansion was partially offset by an increase in shrink as our distribution centers have made significant progress in backlog tests. despite the headwinds, i'm confident our actions are building a foundation for much improved dc performance. the improved reclamation process will improve our level of service and inventory accuracy. related to improving inventory assortment and availability, we continued the deployment of our top 25 categories using dynamic assortment in the first quarter. we've seen a meaningful increase in incremental sales since the initial launch and we continue to roll out this program. we plan to complete the roll out to all stores by the end of 2019 and will expand the categories included.
our adjusted sg&a was $1.1 billion in the first quarter, an increase of $26 million year-over-year. the primary drivers of this increase were due to minimum wage and planned merit increases, professional services related to our it and e-commerce investments and a year-over-year increase in fuel and transportation expenses related to the utilization of our cross-banner visibility. however, on a rate basis, our adjusted sg&a improved by 8 basis points compared to the prior year quarter to 36.4%. we are once again able to leverage store labor as a percent of net sales in q1. additionally, as safety continues to be a top priority for advance, i'm pleased with the continued expense reductions directly correlated to our lower incident rates and claims.
adjusted operating income in q1 was $243.6 million, an 8.7% increase from q1 2018. our adjusted operating income margin increased 46 basis points to 8.3% in the quarter. adjusted eps for the quarter increased 17% to $2.46. this excludes the one-time cost related to the early redemption of our bonds that would have come due in 2020. in terms of capital spending, we invested $61 million in capital projects in q1 compared to $34 million in the same period of the prior year. our largest investments were information technology related as we remain focused on the complete back-office integration throughout advance. related to our capital spending, the investments made have had corresponding operating expenses that are in line with our expectations in the quarter. we anticipate that we will continue to ramp up capital investments throughout 2019 focusing on information technology, supply chain and e-commerce.
as part of our ongoing efforts of managing our working capital, we continue to make progress on our ap ratio. notably, our ap ratio for the quarter was 74%, an increase of approximately 550 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. this improvement, together with our disciplined working capital improvements, help enable another strong quarter of free cash flow growth. in q1, our free cash flow was $143 million, which increased nearly 20% compared to the prior year quarter. as we previously discussed during our call in february, in the quarter, we completed the early redemption of our $300 million bonds due in may of 2020. in line with our financial priorities, we are pleased that our leverage ratio of 2.1 times is now at the lowest point since the gpi acquisition.
additionally, through our focus on cash flow and disciplined approach to capital allocation, we returned over $130 million in share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. our team's unrelenting focus has enabled a solid balance sheet that provides us financial flexibility and security. i'm confident our ability to generate meaningful cash flow combined with the strength of our balance sheet will differentiate advance and create financial stability regardless of economic trends that may impact the industry. we believe that the fundamentals we set in place for the quarter are crucial, and we will continue to focus on meeting our goals for the balance of 2019.
with that, let's open it up to addressing your questions. operator?
",2019-Q1,AAP
1.0,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions]. our first question comes from michael lasser with ubs. your line is open.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
good morning. thanks a lot for taking my question. tom, in your prepared remarks you referred to some of the pillars of your long-term plan. but how do you respond to those to stay now you've had two consecutive quarters of gross margin degradation and you've made a lot of progress over the last few years in harvesting cost savings to how realistic is it that you will get to a low to mid-teens operating margin over the long run as you've outlined previously?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, first of all, i think, the gross margin, just to give you some background on that michael it is important to explain this. we had a couple of atypical elements in the gross margin in the quarter. the biggest factor within gross margin was our investments in our loyalty program. the coupon redemptions in the quarter were up 14 million versus year ago, which is what we outlined in our prepared remarks. we knew this was going to be higher in the quarter as we planned investment behind speed perks 2.0 but the sign up and the transactions as a percentage of our total transaction significantly exceeded that of our lead markets, so the coupon redemptions were more than we expected
over the long term, this is a very good thing. we're absolutely committed to winning in diy omnichannel. we had meaningfully invested in our loyalty program prior to q3. the customer and team member response to speed perks 2.0 has been fantastic and it positions us well for the long term . we're going to leverage the first-party data we get from speed perks to personalize our offerings and we expect the incremental investment on speed perks to subside over the next few quarters with incremental growth.
so, that was a very big factor in gross margin in the quarter. and secondly, we incurred one-time incremental cost within the supply chain related to the work stoppage in kutztown, so we don't think what happened in the quarter is something that is going to have any impact on our ability to achieve our long-term margin goals both within gross margin and in sg&a. we had a couple of atypical elements in the quarter on gross margin.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
indeed, the launch of speed perks 2.0 drive incremental sales in the quarter, and this is important because the comp spread versus those others in the industry is back to widening and shouldn't we take that as a signal that some of your efforts to close the performance gap are now flipping and would you attribute all of that to speed perks 2.?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, we certainly benefited from speed perks in the quarter, but it's difficult to say how much. with the number of increased sign-ups we had obviously the purchase frequency in our category is much lower than typical category. so we'll see that over time. we also had a higher percentage of our transactions, much higher than we've seen historically and even in the lead markets, so that's going to benefit us over time, because we use the data to personalize the overall 14 million if you do the math that's about a 60-basis point headwind pox sales right from our total number.
so that's the value of the coupons clearly somewhere between 0 and 60 we benefited from speed perks but in the quarter the cost of the coupons outweighed the benefit of speed perks.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
ok, just to clarify that. so , can you help us understand how it was a net positive if you're seeing $14 million hit to sales, but it drove incremental comp or incremental sales.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's difficult to quantify the incremental sales at this point. what we've modeled is that over time the incremental revenue associated with speed perks is going to be significant, you're essentially increasing your member base, we started at 11 million, we added a significant number of new members in the quarter, we had a net increase in our membership base in the quarter. we're going to increase the percentage of transactions, so we're talking about a substantial improvement in our diy sales over time. in the short term, you can't really measure michael is how many of existing customers that were already coming in the store, are now transacting as speed perks customers, it's very difficult for us to break that out, but we know the value of the program in terms of the impact it has on the p&l and over time, this is a meaningful benefit for us. we're very excited about it.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
okay, good luck with the fourth quarter. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from simeon gutman with morgan stanley, your line is open.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, good morning. my first question is for q4. you've provided a fairly wide range of comp i think 0 to 1.5 or 1.6 depending on the math. can you give us a sense, i mean there is only 6 weeks left, where -- where we're headed so far, and then it looks like if we hold the sg&a rate from the third quarter, which may or may not be the right assumption that gross margin could be up a decent amount in the fourth quarter 20-30 basis points.
can you comment on those two points?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. simeon, good morning. i'll let jeff handle the second question. on the sales guide, yes, i mean we're essentially guiding in line with what we expect. obviously, the last six weeks of the year can be very volatile, but we like what we see so far and we're well positioned to deliver within the sales guidance. as we said, we will have continued coupon redemptions in the fourth quarter. the reason is, we've got a number of coupons from the original program that are still unredeemed. so once the end of the year comes into play, those are no longer available and will only be dealing with the coupons from speed perks 2.0, so that's essentially the reason and let jeff answer your second question.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. and just to build on the gross margin, we are continuing to see the coupon headwinds that tom talked about. the original speed perks program those coupons have a 6-month life, so those are going to roll off basically in the fourth quarter a little bit of bleed into the first quarter, but not much. but we're still modeling those headwinds, as well as the headwinds associated with commodity and tariffs, right now we don't see any changes in the tariffs into the fourth quarter, so we still think we're going to have those headwinds . having said that, everything we're seeing right now in sg&a is still positive. we've got excellent controls in place to control our costs, consistent with what we did during the third quarter and we fully anticipate we'll be able to do that into the fourth quarter.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so just to clarify that point. it sounds like there is still going to be headwinds to gross margin, but it's sg&a that if that will provide the leverage to the margin in the fourth quarter.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, yeah, that's right, simeon, and just to make it really clear, and speed perks hurts same-store sales because coupons go against net sales right and in the quarter -- in the third quarter that was a 60-basis point impact on same-store sales, so we might have gotten a few more transactions but it hurts net sales on a net basis in the short term. over time when people return more frequently, we benefit from speed perks but in the short term, it's a net sales headwind
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. okay and then my followup question. the supply chain transformation. you mentioned it briefly in the prepared remarks, tom, can you talk about where you are in it, what you've accomplished so far, what are the tasks that are going to get done next. and then can you assess any execution risk in some of the next steps, please.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
there are really exciting progress on supply chain, simeon, i think reuben is really getting some momentum there. we've obviously began to execute the cross banner replenishment initiative, which is a significant productivity driver for us and allows us to reduce stem miles to the stores and to optimize our dc network so that's well under way and we've had the pilots in the respective red and blue networks and we're now beginning to move stores to the relevant dc that we've got a number of those plan for the balance of this year, there'll be hundreds of them executed next year and into the front half of 2021 and we'll finish it at that point. just in terms of raw execution, we are seeing very good progress there across all the key metrics. we are also beginning our work on a standardization of our warehouse management system that reuben is leading that will allow us to improve our labor management in the distribution centers.
finally, we've begun to integrate the worldpac and ai organizations and supply chains, including the ai stores, so that will help us over time. so very confident in our ability to deliver the supply chain productivity that we've discussed and we're beginning to see the benefits of that, as i said in the prepared remarks, we actually leverage supply chain in the quarter in spite of a pretty significant cost associated with the kutztown work stoppage
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and just to clarify one more followup on that tom, is we keep talking about the benefits of these initiatives won't be done till i think the middle of 2021. but does that mean the benefits from some of these initiatives, don't show up until 2021 or they start to show up now and rolling into next year.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we'll start to see some -- on the supply chain we will start to see benefits next year as we execute the dc store changes that i mentioned in terms of the full benefits of the cross-banner the full benefit of the warehouse management system implementation and they starts to come later, but we will see benefit from supply chain next year.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thank you. thank you.

our next question comes from seth sigman with credit suisse. your line is open.
seth sigman -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey guys, good morning. just first on the pro business, i think you categorized it as strong in the quarter, can you just discuss how it performed relative to the second quarter, did it actually accelerate. and then i think you highlighted worldpac and independents as the strongest channels within, what's working there and maybe different than what you're seeing core aap and carquest. thanks.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
first of all, seth, our pro business did accelerate versus the second quarter, we had a terrific two year stack the best we've ever seen on our pro business by the way on aap business as well, not just the other businesses. i think that what's working well broadly inside of pro is bob together all of the key elements of our pro offering. everything from the catalog, which we obviously call advance pro, we're getting increased usage on the catalog, people are seeing the merits of our assortment. we're executing its dynamic assortment across the enterprise, which is enabling us to improve our stock rate and close rate on key items in the backroom, cross banner is benefiting us continued benefits from cross banner. so we're able to source from the various entities at higher levels than we used to in the past. so we're very happy with where our pro business is when we look at the reported results to date , we feel good. we feel like we're performing at or above the market and our independent business there we were able to present some of the things that bob is pulling together for the broader corporate entity here and present them to potentially new independents who want to fly the carquest flag, and the net benefit there we're starting to see as well. so strong conversions in the quarter on the independent side but also good comp sales for our independents -- existing independents, which is very important
worldpac is just a terrific business, they've got a great model, their online platform is best in class, bob has built that over many years with a terrific team out there at worldpac and we've opened more branches this year than we've ever opened before, they're driving top line growth. they are expanding margins, they're focused on being very complementary to the broader enterprise. so there's a lot of things that are working well with worldpac that we're taking and bringing to the broader enterprise. so i'd say generally speaking, those are the things that are helping us on the pro side.
seth sigman -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. so given some of the positive changes happening in the store, presumably that should be helping diy also what do you view as the fundamental challenge facing the diy business, obviously online is growing for you, but just i guess store level diy some of the challenges that you may be facing there?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think, first of all we did improve our transactions and unit performance in the quarter on diy, the net sales number as we said, obviously the coupons are entirely attributable to the diy business weighed down the net sales number in diy in the short term, as we said, but i think, jason mcdonell is our new cmo, we couldn't be more excited about having jason here, he is focused on traffic job one, improving our traffic inside the diy business. he has done a lot of work in the short time that he has been here, i feel very good about the plans that are coming together for 2020. we've done a lot of work on the customer journey to develop integrated programming. i think that was an opportunity seth to your point to make sure that the marketing that we're spending is very well integrated with the merchandising plans and the in-store execution speed perks 2.0 will be a driver of top line growth next year. as we start to bring more people into speed perks and we start to get a higher share of transactions, we are able to personalize our offering and we know there is a big share of wallet opportunity there. third, the media plans big opportunity there. again, jason is working that very hard right now, we're going to shift non-working dollars that we were spending in marketing to working and that will drive awareness, which we made progress on last year, but we kind of stall that 32% and now we need to take that up, because we are significantly behind the industry leader on that one.
and finally the partnership that is developing with walmart will start to be a factor as we get into 2020. so there's a lot of things that are happening right now in diy that we feel really good about as we head into next year and it will give us what we need on the other side of the box, if you will, as bob continues to drive the pro business
seth sigman -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. all right. thanks, tom.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from christopher horvers with jpmorgan. your line is open.
chris horvers -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks, good morning. so first, a couple of followups on the comp guide, what specifically is the implied comp guide 4q, is if you held a two year stack it would imply a bigger number than the range that was asked in a prior question. and then could you quantify how much kutztown actually impacted gross margin?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we're not going to, we're going to not going to talk kutztown chris. i'll just -- i'll just say that obviously, it's important that we have a very, very competitive cost structure in our supply chain. so we had to do what we had to do in kutztown and we accomplished it and we feel really good about where we ended up there, but we're not -- we're not going to break that out
chris horvers -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
did that sustain? the kutztown sustain?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
no. it's obviously we had a several week work stoppage. right. so you've got, you've got all the costs associated with that -- that are built up in there and we knew we were going to have those costs in the quarter and ended up being where they ended up being. so in terms of the stacks, we're obviously going to continue to drive as high of a two-year stack as we can. the big factor is the -- is the coupons, which we've talked about several times. if you also look at the 3-year stack, you'll see it more in line with the --, with the third quarter. so that's essentially where we ended up, but i think the thing to call out is the net sales.
the coupon impact on net sales in the fourth quarter based on the lower sales number and the redemption, this is probably going to be kind of a similar number, which is a percentage higher.
chris horvers -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. so just to, so -- so you really looking at a three-year and that's what was the sort of guiding light for the 4th quarter comp guide?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
that's right, that's right, we've seen -- we've seen continued improvement on that 3-year stack, so we're kind of focusing on that to factor out the back half of '17 which we all know was a difficult time for us
chris horvers -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it and then another one, on the diy did that also accelerate despite the coupon headwind, which is about 120 basis point headwind to the comp in the third quarter on the diy front,
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it absolutely accelerated on pos sales. yes. and that's why the transactions improve, the units improved. in fact, our unit share chris. when we look at our relative performance on unit share through syndicated data also improved by about that's similar, the relative growth improved by about 150 bps. so on a same-store basis in the most recent period, we actually held share on units which i feel great about. and we haven't done that in a long time. so, selling more units, getting more people signed up to speed perks, higher percentage of transactions over time this is going to be a good thing.
chris horvers -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. lastly, and then can you talk about, jeff can you talk about how much lifo was a headwind in the quarter, it was about 70 basis points in the second quarter. do you -- was that -- where did end up in 3q and how are you thinking about lifo into fourth quarter and then into next year, really as that play out over the year, assuming the price environment stays as it is,
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, so for third quarter lifo was an impact of $34 million and we publish our -- our 10-q later on today, those were 100% offset by what we call some of the inventory related costs, warehouse cost capitalization. we saw improvement there along with store -- store and dc cost changes. so the net impact of that was zero. obviously, the $34 million with a headwind in the third quarter on a stand-alone basis . the fourth quarter. i would expect to see similar level just given the fact that we're still in this higher rising cost environment. so i would anticipate that into the fourth quarter. and i do think in the fourth quarter could be more of a headwind. especially, on a year-over-year basis. if you remember last year we purchased a bunch of inventory as a result of dynamic assortment and some early buying related to the spring selling season. they gave us a little bit of a tailwind and we're not going to see that again this year or this quarter for sure. so on a year-over-year basis it's certainly going to be a headwind. going into 2020, if we get cost stabilization. i would expect to see a similar level of impact is all we can get it to stabilize, we can drive down that inventory. obviously we will pick up that headwind, but we're still working through our plans for 2020, we will have a lot more detail when we talk to you next quarter.
chris horvers -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and so when you see similar level. is that similar dollar, so the rate impact moderates, are you seeing the rate impact should be the same over the year.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
similar dollars in terms of what we're seeing in the third and fourth quarter.
chris horvers -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. understood. thanks very much .
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt mcclintock with raymond james, your line is open.
matt mcclintock -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. yes, good morning everyone. tom, you mentioned that you expect walmart to be -- thewalmart partnership to be material next year or i don't know if you used those words, but i assume that's what you meant. could you maybe talk a little bit about how you have improved the customer experience now that you've launched there the improvements that you have been trying to make there and then how far away are we before buy online and pickup in store options are available through that partnership.
thanks. sure. yeah, just to clarify, i don't think i used the word material, we definitely feel that it can be helpful next year, it's definitely going to be material over time. i think the big things that we've done so far is on the engagement front, we've obviously stood up the website , their significant branding, on the website for us that the walmart team has been terrific in helping us enables and we begun to work the fitment work with them to make sure that the experience, the customer has when they're buying a specific product is world class, and i know the walmart team is very committed to that outcome.
we don't want to start adding parts and jobs when that would be the experience for the customers a world-class. so that's what we're working on with them right now, we've made a lot of progress, we're adding skus, all the time as they build fitment capability in the various categories . we're very excited about getting in store pickup stood up, we haven't got a firm date on that at this point but we're shooting for the first quarter of 2020 that's the goal.
and then kind of as a followup, can you maybe discuss the engagement levels that you've seen with your current on improvements of the buy online pickup in-store experience?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, definitely seen great progress there. i mean we're getting excellent growth on in-store pickup. we are now paying the customer right away as soon as they send us their order we're letting them know the order is ready. the team is executing extremely well and making sure that the product is ready for them when they come in the door. so we're beginning to see that and we've had obviously a cold snap here in parts of the country, we can see it, we can see the benefit of the in-store pickup starting to have an impact on our overall sales because of that and increasing as a percentage of our sales. so we're very excited about the opportunity there. i know, jason is also thinking through how to engage consumers and build awareness on that capability, because it's, you can get it very quickly and we want to make sure people know that not only can you pick them up quickly at advance but we will install your battery for you, or install your wiper blades. so we can do other things when you're there so excited about the new capability. we're building there.
matt mcclintock -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks a lot for that . best of luck.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from gregory melich with evercore isi. your line is open.
gregory melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. great. i have a couple of questions . first on the top line, tom, you had mentioned on the cross banner initiatives in categories that have been converted to have advance pro and the cross banner items, you've seen a nice improvement. how many of the top 25 categories have been converted already.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well good morning, greg. first of all we've done is we've rolled out the top 25 into stores. so it's really a case of how many stores have received that right. so when we, when we do it, we put all 25 categories, and we basically do a changeover in the store that we've done the top 25. so we're pretty much through all of the chain. i think we have got to all of the so-called red stores by the end of the year. the blue stores come in the first quarter next year, but the top 25 will be rolled out completely by the first quarter
and i think i think what we said in prepared remarks is that if you take the store and product combinations. it's about 11% of the backroom sales. so that gives you a sense for it and we're just going to continue to use this and we're seeing a couple of points, about 2 points of growth associated with it because the items that we're adding obviously are contributing a lot more than the items that we're deleting,
gregory melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
so just to be simple on that. does that mean if it's 11% you're getting 2 points of growth --20% lift in the stores when you do this in that category?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
we are seeing big growths in the categories we're doing -- you're using, yes that's correct.
gregory melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
two points.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
two points in the in the category.
gregory melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
[speech overlap] okay, i understand. and then second, inflation, i know a lot of ebbs and flows years, we hear different things from different people anything from 150 bps to 300 bps. what is your perspective. now on the amount of the pass-through of the tariffs and other cost input inflation that you've seen.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we look at cost per unit, greg. that's the best way to measure it because when you see average ticket price and pro, there's a whole bunch of other factors come into play, but it's 2.5% to 3% on a per unit basis is what we're seeing
gregory melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and then last, jeff, maybe more on the free cash flow side, when you guys are using the $700 million plus, how much of that is from the working capital improvements and how much of it would be from everything else, my rough math gets to 750, then take off capex of 270 and you get around $500 million to $550 million of free cash flow before working capital gains. is that right?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that's right. most of it's going to come from our working capital initiatives. if you look at what we've done most specifically in the area of payables. we've increased that substantially, our ap ratio is at an all time high at 77.5% and we think that's going to continue to improve. so the working capital as we increase our inventory turns that will help us as well. but we really think we're going to get the vast majority of that improvement through the working capital that we're going to, that we're not only doing, but it's going to continue to manifest itself through the fourth quarter and into 2020. so, yes, that's exactly the way to think about it.
gregory melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
and then lastly on that point of the buyback, a lot in this quarter, it looks like you were sort of opportunistic. how should we think about that. now that you're down to the two times leverage i guess if you include leases, maybe 2.5. but how do you think of that going forward. does this all the free cash flow come back is buyback or would you ever take a look at the dividend again?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i mean dividend something that we've talked about quite a bit. we do have the $700 million additional. so that gives us a lot of flexibility. we're still in the transformation. we still have our same investment priorities, we want to continue to invest back in the business this year with a heavy investment year next year is going to continue to be a heavy investment year. having said that, that we want to continue to be opportunistic and the $700 million gives us that flexibility to be opportunistic as we were here in the third quarter.
gregory melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. good luck, guys.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer

thank you. our next question comes from daniel imbro with stephens, inc. your line is open.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yeah. hey, good morning guys. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to start on the supply chain. you had mentioned the work stoppage that lasted about two weeks. but as you guys progress on your supply chain rationalization from here. tom, you mentioned those cost shouldn't continue, but in your updated long-term plan do you think that those kind of negotiations could lead to other higher wage pressures in your supply chain or how you are thinking about the impact into your other distribution centers from that works stoppage you had
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, good question, daniel. i mean obviously that's the point. we only have 5 union facilities out of our 50 odd dcs and that's why it was important in this case, to make sure that the cost structure there was competitive, so that there is no essentially sphere of influence for our non-union sites. so we were able to accomplish that. and we feel very confident in our -- first of all, we made an investment this year, as you know, in dc wages proactively nothing to do with what happened in kutztown, to make sure that we reduced turnover and rubens has done a great job there, we dropped our turnover basically in half in the dcs and that's why we're getting much better execution in the dcs we are not turning as many people
so it for sure the glide path on supply chain is very clear. the productivity agenda has been laid out, and we're executing against it and obviously contemplate the relevant wage increases that we need to do over time in order to be competitive, so no change there really.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. a quick followup to that, i guess you mentioned turnover coming down significantly but you think the issue that led to the work stoppage and the eventual kind of negotiations were facility specific or these pushbacks are getting from employees in other facilities as you push more products and rationalizing the supply chain
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
no, very much facilities specific unfortunately in that case and we're committed to rebuilding the team in kutztown, it's a great group of people. i know our leadership team has spent a lot of time with them . this was a long-standing situation that's been going on literally for years and we all look to our people -- it's a really -- do a better job of engaging with them directly and that's the plan from here. but it's very much facility specific.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. and then last one from me just on working capital. i think this is the fourth quarter of actual inventory dollar growth on the balance sheet as a result of dynamic assortment. as we have lap over that and the fourth quarter of last year, should we begin to see inventory levels resume their kind of trickle down as you guys work that out or should inventory continue to grow as you invest in product availability. thanks .
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, i think we're going to start to see that to stabilize and then work itself down, i think in fact in the fourth quarter, i think we're going to see inventory come down from where they're at today and probably be in line with what we saw at the end of last year. and then as we have the dynamic assortment stabilize, we will continue to triple that down going into 2020.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
all right thanks. best of luck.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

thank you. our next question comes from chris bottiglieri with wolfe research. your line is open.
chris bottiglieri -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. so i wanted to take it -- congrats on improving market share data on the diy side . i was wondering if you held your market share in q3 equal to q2, what would that impact of comps had been -- like how much of the market share and diy help your comps this quarter.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think the, change would be the relevant number. i think there chris would be about 30 bps something like that, the improvements. so i think it's -- npd doesn't capture everything, so to be clear. i'm just giving you the npd number but it's 29 categories. it's not everything in the front room, but it's a good proxy. but that's the number .
chris bottiglieri -- wolfe research -- analyst
got you. okay, that's helpful. and then obviously there's a lot of the innovation, you're making a lot of changes, but would you -- what would you attribute that improvement in market share for was it speed perks was it's kind of like walmart was just everything else we're doing online thoughts there.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well we for sure believe that speed perks contributed to improve transactions in the quarter. i mean, we saw a 150 change. now some of that was industry related in terms of the improvement in transactions, but for sure speed perks had some contribution. i think the in-store pickup was well executed, our team is very focused on these initiatives, i mean to speed perks itself we called out the changes. i mean we challenged the field to do a good job executing speed perks. in the lead markets, we had a 30% increase in sign-ups and in the national roll out. it was 80%. okay transactions as a percent of sales lead market 28% national rollout 40%. so i do feel the field team is executing better than they ever have. we see that in our net promoter scores that's obviously helping us. and when we launched something like in store pick, it's, it's much more -- it happens faster . our ability to get it done happens faster. so i mean, as we continue to build the initiatives chris on diy i'm much more confident that we will execute them well.
chris bottiglieri -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. got that. and then, big picture, i mean, i think you're very much ahead of your peer group online doing a lot of great work there, but i would say this industry has historically been kind of online-resistant, which frankly were in the hard way the last couple of years, but big picture what do you see the online presence in this category, growing over the next several years. are you making a calculated bet that online penetration picks up or is just, this is where you think you could be most differentiated any thoughts that would be helpful.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, absolutely we expect it to pick up. and also think about online chris as pro as well. right. it's not just diy so your pro experience. we've got obviously worldpac which is primarily all online right, then you have the aap business, which is much lower. i think on average for something like 38% of our of our pro orders come in through online platform. so we expect that number to go up. and obviously that has over time benefits for us because we're not on the phone handling the customer over the phone. so that number goes up each year we see that number going up each year. on the diy side, we've certainly quantify what we believe the online penetration is going to be. we think it grow substantially, both shipped to home and buy online pickup in store over time and that's why we want to make sure the buy online pickup in-store experience is world class, because that's where we think we can really differentiate ourselves
chris bottiglieri -- wolfe research -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from kate mcshane with goldman sachs. your line is open.
kate mcshane -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking our question. i wondered if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing with labor costs versus the improvements you were able to make in the labor related cost during the quarter and is this a dynamic we can see for the next several quarters.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we've done a really good job kate, managing wage inflation. we talked about supply chain earlier on the call that we did make an investment there and that was intended to reduce the turnover inside of supply chain. meanwhile, on the store side, which is of course the majority of our people, we have a unique program that no one else in the industry has which is fuel the frontline, we're now up to 18,000 grants of company stock. we are absolutely convinced that this is lowering our turnover meaningfully in the key jobs that we have, that's the general managers in our stores, the customer account managers, the commercial parts pros, dms rather. so those four comprise 15000 people they are critically important for our company, we want the very best parts people in the industry and those, those four jobs are central for the success. so we make sure that we're highly competitive there.
and we've seen our turnover drop across the board there. so to me that's the best asset test, if you will, on how you're compensating your people and the type of roles you're providing and on well we're still seeing inflation obviously in wages. and we've got states that are increasing minimum. we contemplate all of that as we package our value proposition -- employee value proposition together and we use the fuel the frontline to really augment that so we can keep our best people.

thank you. our next question comes from scot ciccarelli with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
scot ciccarelli -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good morning, guys.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
good morning scot.
scot ciccarelli -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
so, we've talked a lot about kind of speed perks this morning and how is a $40 million dollar drag in both sales and gross profit in the quarter but can you help us better understand why the sales and gross margin drag would actually decline as the membership and usage of program growth because i thought that was the implication
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, the biggest factor is, we still have outstanding coupons unredeemed from the original speed perks scot and they'll basically be gone by the end of the year. so that's a big factor because we're redeeming not only the coupons from speed perks 2.0 but from the original program. so as the year ends, those coupons are no longer eligible, they basically expire. so as we get into 2020, we will see that subside but we contemplated it for the fourth quarter and as we get into 2020, we start to see incremental revenue. we see more frequency people come back more often, we signed more people up and by the way, we have people -- less people leaving. we are seeing improvement across the board on each one of those, you think about how do i attract new members. how do i graduate members from one tier to the next tier. and how do i retain existing members and the way we measure that scot is did somebody transact in the past year.
so we saw an 80%, an increase in new. we saw a significant improvement in our retention of the people with that were in speed perks and then obviously, we're trying to graduate people up the tier. so that's the intent. and what you'll see is revenue going up with everything we've modeled, everything we've seen in the lead market. the revenue will be going up and the cost will be coming down
scot ciccarelli -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. so in other words, you have two parallel programs where you're kind of getting hit, but only one kind of revenue source. and then over time that first piece kind of goes away and then you're going to just have a higher contribution margin on incremental sales as you build that base.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, the pure speed perks program, the math on the pure speed perks 2.0 is very attractive. it's just in this interim period. we knew coming into the back half of the year that we going to have to deal with these existing unredeemed coupons from the original program which now you've got a whole bunch of awareness to them and there was a lot of them out there.
scot ciccarelli -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. okay, all right. understood. thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from liz suzuki with bank of america. your line is open.
elizabeth suzuki -- bank of america -- analyst
great, thank you. can you talk about the monthly trajectory comps. are there any particular months in your quarter that there were significantly better or worse because they know it can be a bit volatile or more so for advanced versus some of your peers. just given your geographic exposure.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, there wasn't a huge swing liz as there have been in the past quarters i think the -- it started out very strong in kind of our northern geographies. and then i did tail off in our northern geographies and of course, now in the last week, we've seen that bounce back. so if you think about our periods 8, 9, 10, 8 and 9 were better than 10. it's not unusual for us to see that, especially in the northern geographies and we call our top performing areas west coast, midwest we were a little challenged in the back-end on in the northeast and great lakes, which is again up in those northern locations.
elizabeth suzuki -- bank of america -- analyst
great. and just sort of a longer-term, can you explain some of the bigger gaps in your margins versus peers on gross margin in particular just mix side versus diy versus pro, just can you talk about some of the low hanging fruit on the margin side that over time you think you can get closer to some of your peers.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, what we've called our four key territories liz that we're executing against, so sales and profit per store where we're making good progress, we started this journey at [phonetic] 1.5 million, we want to get to a 1.8 million and then there is a number of initiatives to drive profit per store including everything that you would expect inside the four walls of our stores themselves. the supply chain is a very big factor. we talked about that earlier on the call, we're executing against the initiatives there. the category management piece is one that we're excited about where we're standing up essentially a strategic pricing capability next year and we've made a pretty big investment in the new pricing engine, which is going to allow us for regional pricing and an adaptive pricing approach to omni channel that's going to deliver a seamless customer experience. we're also driving private label, our customers are really responding well to carquest, i wish we could roll it out faster to be honest, we've got a number of categories that were initiating now that we're going to continue to drive that. but private label as a percent of sales is a big opportunity for us.
so inside of category management, you've got the ongoing material cost optimization, you've got strategic pricing and you've got a private label as a percent of sales. and then in terms of sg&a, i feel great about where we are. there is a number of initiatives under way there. you saw the performance in the quarter, you're going to continue to see that going forward. and then there is the erp system that jeff is executing against for finance where we're -- essentially a lot of the sg&a initiatives are about the -- the integration of the company, which is now well under way. okay.
we are integrating the company in many places, we've already done workday in terms of hr systems , we're in the process of erp, talked about warehouse management systems and sri donthi who is our chief technology officer is doing a lot of things in the it world to bring the systems together
elizabeth suzuki -- bank of america -- analyst
on the private label point specifically, i mean, what percentage of your sales is that now and how big do you think that can ultimately get.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we're in. it depends how you look at this, we have different, different, different categories where we see big opportunities there but we think we're well under penetrated versus peers. i know that there has been a lot of commentary on that. but when we do the benchmarking we feel that there is an opportunity for us to significantly grow private label as a percentage of sales. and i think this year, we're up about a point liz, but there's still a lot of room to grow in terms of percentage of sales.
elizabeth suzuki -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mike baker with nomura. your line is open.
michael baker -- nomura -- analyst
thank you. two questions, one, if i'm right about my math, it looks like the 4th quarter, the midpoint of the guidance, if just you sales and the implied operating profit, it looks like you're looking for an operating profit increase is better than you've done year-to-date. i get about 60 basis points at the midpoint. and i guess related to that an improvement in the operating profit dollar growth, is that right? and if so why should the 4th quarter, margins on a year-over-year basis look better than they have year-to-date?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, i think you're directionally correct. again we know we're going to have headwinds in the gross margin. we're going to be working very hard to overcome those -- i really like to see a positive gross margin counter from a rate basis year-over-year, but a lot of the efforts that we're seeing within sg&a, we talked about standing up and being able to leverage labor in the 4th quarter. 4th quarter it's a volatile quarter, but what we've seen so far, going into the quarter, we think we can get a significant amount of leverage in terms of the sg&a, that's really going to drive that growth on a year-over-year basis.
michael baker -- nomura -- analyst
okay. so it's in the sg&a side?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
it also about supply chain. look we improved leverage slightly and that included these one-time costs, but we're not going to see again in the 4th quarter. so our expectation is that supply chain is going to continue to leverage in even more significantly in the 4th quarter.
michael baker -- nomura -- analyst
okay, understood. and then one more if i could, just on the speed perks, where are you -- is this just a catch-up in terms of the offering to customers relative to your competitors or are you now getting more aggressive in prices, this has always been as space that has been thought of as being very rational in pricing, but you're talking a lot about a new loyalty program and presumably better for the customer. so we are in pricing the space. are you getting more aggressive versus peers or you just catching up to them?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think it is a rational environment. let me start by saying that, but we do feel we have the best offer in the industry. there is a number of drivers to that, mike, that we feel pretty good about and the receptivity has been fantastic. i mean our team members are incredibly enthusiastic about it. they are talking to the customers about it. they can see the -- we've allowed them to see the status of the customer on the point of sale systems. so they're talking it up in the stores. we think we can get the percentage of transactions up significantly. if you benchmark versus broader retail, we are very low, and it's important that we have that first-party data we want to know what kind of car somebody drives. we want to know everything about that person in terms of what they're buying in our stores and today, we have a lot of customers who come in but we don't know that. so this is our opportunity to get them into the program, and make our offering much more sticky. so that's the intent behind it. that's what we saw in the lead markets, and that's what you're going to see us do.
michael baker -- nomura -- analyst
okay. so effectively, you're getting more people to sign up by giving them a better offering?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. our offer is, we believe the best in the industry right now. we do.,
michael baker -- nomura -- analyst
and so, is there the risk that others follow you in terms of that offering?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i can't comment on what others are going to do. i just feel that our program is one that can really help us get the first party data we need to drive share of wallet with existing customers. we know that they don't buy all of their auto parts needs in our stores. that's a fact. we've got a very clear picture on the various levels. we've got 3 levels within the platform. we have our lead members. we have our bip . we have our club members and we have a pretty good idea of what our share of wallet is in each of those peers and the goal obviously is to drive more and more people up -- graduate people up the ladder. so that their share wallet increases.
michael baker -- nomura -- analyst
okay, thank you. understood.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from seth basham with wedbush. your line is open.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
thanks a lot and good morning. i just had a couple of follow up questions diving into gross margins a little bit more deeply. first of all, in terms of the supply chain leverage in the quarter. a, would you care to quantify and b, could you give us some color as to where it's coming from, is it from freight rates or your stem miles et-cetera?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it was relatively minimal now granted, we did have the cost of the work stoppage that we called out that was in the number and we still leverage. so i feel pretty good about it. so if i take that cost out, we actually did pretty well. it's really across the board. i mean we're executing better in the dcs. i think we're managing our turnover much better in the dcs as we said and that allows us to get our unit fees per hour, all of those picking, packing, receiving all of those things that need to be done flawlessly. we're making progress on.
clearly, we are starting to see benefits by optimizing our fleet. we're going to see much more of that over time. we start to get to cross banner that's where you're going to see the big numbers come out. we have fewer distribution centers now. i mean, we're now up to -- we've announced a total of 4, and we still got the [phonetic] erma facility to close in balance of this year early part of next year, but that will be four or less buildings. right. so you've got all of the reduced cost associated with that.
i think we're working much better across the banners. so reuben is looking across all of the banners of aap to figure out how to be more productive in terms of how we move things around. we move a lot of auto parts around in this company. so moving around less is going to save us money. so finally, safety is a improving inside of our buildings that doesn't show up necessarily in supply chain, but it's important, it shows up in sg&a. so i think the productivity agenda for supply chain is when we feel really good about. and i think we're starting to see the benefits from.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
got it. that's helpful color and just other piece of gross margin, i was interested in is the impact from mix, mix shift the online channel first any category mix shifts that you experienced this quarter?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, we did see headwinds associated with mix, and we look at it, sort of 2 different ways. one is the channel or banner mix and as expected, we continue to see the shift from diy to pro. your question on the product mix, we did see it in two categories, one was in batteries and the other was in wipers and the first one was just a mix within the category. the second one was just broader of volume out of the category, which is a very, very high margin categories. so that's what we saw in terms of category mix.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
got it. either of those mix shifts impact to your gross margins, more or less than the last quarter,?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
they are about the same.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
thank you.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
just to add one thing on that, seth, i mean obviously we -- the question came up earlier, but we fully contemplate all the mix changes that are going on inside the industry as we guide and look at our go-forward plans, whether that's our long-term plan or 2020. so all of the shift to online, the shift to pro, the shift to large customers and pro, those are all contemplated and we end up netting out from that. so those are known headwinds that we believe are going to happen one way or the other.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you, this concludes the question-and-answer session. i would now like to turn the call back over to tom greco for closing remarks.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks everyone for joining us today. as you heard this morning, we're going to continue to work diligently to execute our strategic objectives and we're confident we're putting the necessary steps in place to deliver growth in the balance of 2019 and beyond. we recognize we still have work to do, particularly in diy but we believe we're on the right path to 60. i'm proud of the team we have in advance and i'm grateful for our team members unrelenting focus on saying yes to the customer while creating significant long-term shareholder value growth.
before we conclude, and in order of veterans day yesterday, i want to take a moment to thank our veterans from all branches of the military for their service. it goes without saying that we are all deeply embedded for their sacrifices including our more than 6,000 advance team members who previously served. we are honored to partner with several organizations to recruit, support and engage with service members, including building homes for heroes the uso and hiring our heroes. we're committed to fully further the partnership with these great organizations working together to support our veterans.
thanks for joining us this morning and we look forward to sharing our 4th quarter results and 2020 outlook with you in february.

now, let me turn the call over to tom greco.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, elisabeth. good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2019 results. i'm proud to report another quarter of good progress toward our long-term strategic objectives . this would not be possible without the relentless dedication of our more than 70,000 team members and network of carquest independent.
i want to take a moment to thank them for their unwavering commitment and passion for the customer. in the third quarter net sales increased 1.6% to $2.3 billion. in comparable store sales increased 1.2%. this is now our sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. our 2-year stack on third quarter comp sales accelerated to 5.8% and was the strongest we've delivered in 8 years.
we also expanded margins as our adjusted operating income margin of 8.9% increased 36 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11.1% to $2.10. jeff will speak more about our financial results shortly.
first, i'll highlight some details around our third quarter performance. consistent with recent trends, our professional business was strong in the quarter. we grew in each of our professional businesses with worldpac and our independent business leading the way .
in addition to opening 9 worldpac branches and adding 29 net new independents over 2019, our dynamic assortment roll out is enabling top line improvements. as a reminder, dynamic assortment leverages machine learning to better understand customer demand and improve the quality of our assortment. we merit lookups by location with several other variables and we expect this will drive increased turns in profitability of our industry leading assortment of national brands oe products and own brand private label. dynamic assortment together with advance pro and cross banner visibility enabled us to improve stock and close rates in the quarter in those categories that have been deployed.
we expect to complete the deployment of our top 25 backroom categories by year end. separately, we've implemented multiple enhancements to our online my advance platform including integrated promotions and connected customer service. this includes continuing improvements to advance pro our catalog for pro customers within my advance which now has customized versions for strategic accounts. in fact, we saw double-digit increases in my advance user sessions in the third quarter. we are still early in implementation, the initiatives we've launched over the past several quarters are resulting in continued improvement in our ability to say yes to professional customers
moving to diy omnichannel. we continue to deliver impressive sales growth in e-commerce with strong double-digit growth once again in q3. we continue to see substantial increases in website traffic along with steady progress in conversion rates. we know speed and convenience are critical to the omnichannel customer and remain committed to delivering a frictionless experience. in q3, we improved the customer experience for buy online, pickup in store. this included enhancements in the mobile experience such as improved order status via text messaging. we also rolled out a standardized area for order pickup in stores , close to the front door for easy access and convenience.
as part of our diy omnichannel strategy, we also made progress with our walmart.com partnership. in q3, we continue to build our assortment and are on track to enable additional customer fulfillment options since the launch of our partnership, traffic, units and sales have accelerated each month. notably, the majority of customers who have ordered through the walmart.com site are new to advance. our diy retail business remains a work in progress. in q3, we saw pressure in transactions, which were negative in the quarter although improved versus q2. in q3, we rolled out our new speed perks 2.0 loyalty program following successful pilots in two lead markets during the first half of 2019. speed perks 2.0 is an important platform to help us improve diy performance both short and long term. our goal here is to improve customer loyalty and share of wallet by leveraging first party data to personalize our offerings. prior to launch, speed perks transactions were approximately 25% of total diy transactions. this is low versus loyalty programs across broader retail. in the third quarter, we began to address this by providing new and improved benefits for our diy customers. in addition, speed perks 2.0 includes technology enhancements for our team members to see speed perks member status at the point of sale.
our team did an outstanding job launching the program delivering an 80% increase in new member sign ups, 45% growth in the number of speed perks transactions and improved upt performance versus year-to-date trends . these are all important elements to the long-term success of our loyalty program. in total, our q3 launch resulted in sequential improvements in diy transactions and unit sales in q3. as part of our investment in this new program, we also saw a significant increase in reward redemptions during the quarter.
while this was expected, given our test market experience, the investment in our new loyalty program resulted in incremental coupon redemptions in q3 and exceeded the lead markets. the incremental investment year-over-year was approximately $14 million in the quarter impacting both net sales and gross margin. we expect this to abate over the next few quarters and believe this is a good investment to delight existing customers and attract new customers. i am confident that as we sign up more speed perks members and increase speed perks transactions as a percentage of sales, we will leverage this first-party data to drive sales and share of wallet. while this was expected given our test market experience, the redemptions during our national roll out exceeded those of the lead markets and resulted in a coupon redemption headwind in the quarter impacting both net sales and gross margin. we expect this to abate over the next few quarters and believe this is a good investment to delight existing customers and attract new customers.
i am confident that as we sign up more speed perks members and increase speed purchase transactions as a percentage of sales, we will leverage this first-party data to drive sales and share of wallet. to summarize our top line results by channel, professional and e-commerce continued to perform well and while diy retail improved sequentially, we're not satisfied at all with our results here and remain focused on addressing traffic, loyalty, and overall performance as rapidly as possible
all channels accelerated on a 2-year stack basis and at a category level, we saw the strongest growth in brakes and batteries with high single-digit growth while delivering sequential improvement in cooling, optics, and engine management
from a geographic perspective, we saw the strongest growth in our midwest, west coast and appalachian regions. in addition to making important improvements in the customer experience, we continued our footprint optimization efforts in q3 to drive profitability and cash flow. as we closed or consolidated an additional 23 stores, bringing the total number 82 stores year-to-date. we've made meaningful progress over the past 18 months to fix and or close underperforming stores and we continue to be very disciplined in optimizing our store footprint in a market by market approach.
all of our top line initiatives are focused on driving sales and profit per store, which is the first of 4 pillars in our margin expansion plans. in the quarter, we completed the rollout of [phonetic] mydet enabling us to get to a single labor management system. this unified and improved system will help our staff, our stores more efficiently to meet customer demand.
in q3, we also made great strides in our second margin expansion territory supply chain. for the first time in 8 quarters we leveraged supply chain expenses as a percentage of net sales in q3. we accomplished this while absorbing incremental costs attributable to the work stoppage in kutztown. while we clearly did not plan for or want the work stoppage, ensuring our long-term supply chain cost structure is competitive throughout our entire network was a critical objective in our negotiations in kutztown. we're pleased we came to an amicable resolution, which enables us.
separately, the consolidation and integration of our multiple supply chains is well under way. in terms of advance and carquest , we are now in execution mode of cross banner replenishment as we transition stores to the most paid logical distribution center in a disciplined market by market approach. substantial savings are expected here as we reduce stem miles and further optimize our advance and carquest dc network with the completion date of mid 2021
in addition, the integration that worldpac and autopart international is also now under way. here, we expect additional savings and growth related benefits to be fully captured by the end of 2020. finally, reuben slone and his team are laser focused on improving operations across our supply chain. execution is improving as we standardize processes, reduce turnover and improve fill rates. as we build a performance culture throughout supply chain, we expect efficiency gains to drive cost savings.
moving on to our third pillar of margin expansion, we remain disciplined in our material cost optimization and category management efforts. despite material cost headwinds, this year from inflationary costs, we continue to work diligently with our supplier partners to mitigate increases and our pricing to cover inflation in a rational environment
we remain focused on increasing skew count including expanding our offerings for late model vehicle coverage. additionally , we're making great progress on improving carquest private label offerings and increasing private label as a share of our mix. i'm confident these efforts will enable top-line growth on our well-respected carquest private label brand as well as meaningful margin improvement over the next several years.
the fourth pillar of our margin expansion strategy includes sg&a productivity. jeff will expand on other cost savings we saw within sg&a in the quarter shortly. however, i want to highlight our performance on team member safety and the benefit this is delivering across our business. our team has been incredibly disciplined in creating a safety first culture, including building awareness through education and training programs to ensure our team members are empowered to do their job without incident and return home safely each and every day
the detailed focus of this team is benefiting all areas of advance including significant improvements in our accident and incident rates. our emphasis on safety has reduced our total year-to-date recordable injury rate by 11% and our lost time rate improved by 14% this quarter. importantly, our vehicle collision rate has improved by 19% year to date, surpassing our target for the year. more broadly, i'm very proud of the progress we've made in building a performance culture at advance this year, and confident we're creating an environment where team members can excel. we're improving our competitiveness every day with a stronger more experienced leadership team and through innovative offerings such as our fuel the frontline program which rewards top performing frontline team members with advance stock . we've also made important wage investments in our supply chain, which has dramatically reduced turnover to ensure we are as effective and efficient as possible within supply chain
the investments we're making in our team members inclusive of ongoing training and development is evidenced by the continued improvement in our overall annualized average turnover, which declined by 14% in q3 compared to year-end 2018. i am pleased with the progress we've made to date and look forward to sharing more details about our esg focus as well as our people first culture when we publish our second annual corporate sustainability and social report in 2020.
with that, i'll turn it over to jeff for details on our financial performance.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, tom, and good morning everyone. in the third quarter, our adjusted gross profit was $1 billion, an increase of nearly 1% from the prior year quarter. on a rate basis our adjusted gross profit margin of 43.9% declined by 39 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the increase in the investment in our loyalty program and the incremental costs related to the work stoppage in kutztown. despite the work stoppage, we were very pleased with our ability to leverage supply chain in the quarter. as tom also mentioned, our investment in speed perks 2.0 negatively impacted gross margins in q3. we remain confident this new program will significantly increase customer loyalty. we expect this investment will normalize over the next few quarters. our adjusted sg&a performance was very strong at $810 million in the third quarter as compared to $814 million a year ago. on a rate basis, our adjusted sg&a as a percent of net sales was 35%, an improvement of 74 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.
this was a direct result of our focus on cost controls and driven by improvements in occupancy, labor-related costs and a reduction in insurance claims from continued progress in team member safety. these excellent results more than offset important long-term investments in information technology. as we've consistently communicated, we expect information technology costs will remain elevated through the balance of the year and into 2020 as we work to build new digital capabilities and fully integrate multiple technology platforms across the enterprise.
adjusted operating income in q3 was $205.1 million, a 5.9% increase in q3 2018. our adjusted oi margin rate increased 36 basis points to 8.9% in the quarter. adjusted diluted eps for q3 was $2.10, an increase of 11.1%. during the third quarter, we continued to be extremely disciplined in managing our cash. this is clearly illustrated as we improved our ap ratio to 77.5% which is an increase of nearly 530 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.
our ap ratio has now improved 840 basis points since the first quarter of 2017. we remain laser focused on working capital management and are confident in our ability to continue generating meaningful cash growth to drive shareholder value. our free cash flow for the third quarter was $539 million compared to $576 million in the third quarter of 2018. the year-over-year decrease of free cash flow was primarily result of increased capital investments to drive sustainable sales growth and continued margin expansion going forward.
year-to-date , we increased our capital spending by 61% to $169 million. we continue to make investments in our stores, warehouse system consolidations and other information technology initiatives such as our finance erp system as part of our business transformation. our leverage ratio was 2.0 , which is in line with our capital allocation priorities of maintaining an investment grade rating, reinvesting in the business and returning excess cash back to shareholders. during the third quarter, we returned nearly $340 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 2.4 million shares of advance stock .
in addition, i'm pleased to announce an additional $700 million share repurchase authorization. this new authorization is further evidence of the confidence we have in delivering on our sales and margin objectives as well as our ability to generate significant free cash flow and drive shareholder value. consistent with our commitment to provide transparency with our transformation plans and expectations for this year, i want to take a moment to provide an update to our outlook for the balance of the year.
we remain confident in our ability to deliver results within the full-year guidance we provided earlier this year and updated last quarter. we also recognize that the top end of our comparable store sales may now be challenging to achieve as a result of the continued investment in our loyalty program with higher than anticipated coupon redemptions impacting net sales and gross margin in the fourth quarter.
therefore, we believe it's prudent to narrow the top end of our sales guidance while maintaining the bottom of our current comp sales range. our updated guidance includes net sales in the range of $9.65 billion to $9.75 billion. comparable store sales range of 1% to 1.5%. our adjusted oi margin guidance is unchanged with an adjusted oi margin expansion of 20 to 40 basis points for the year.
similarly, we are confident that with the continued strength of our working capital efforts that we can deliver our free cash flow guidance of a minimum of $700 million which we increased in the second quarter . i'm proud of what we've accomplished with the first three quarters and our entire team is focused on additional progress in the fourth quarter.
with that, let's open it up to addressing your questions, operator?

[operator instructions] matt mcclintock with raymond james. your line is open.
matt mcclintock -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. good morning, everyone. tom, i was wondering about the initial guidance for 2020. just the comp expectation is 0% to 2%. can you kind of give us an idea of how you factored in the warm weather from december into that expectation?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. good morning, matt. so let me provide some color on that. first of all, we're very dedicated to the long-term strategic objectives we've laid out before and that includes some investments this year that we're making as we communicated in the past, both '19 and '20 being somewhat similar in that regard. and those investments are designed to enable top line growth and additional margin expansion down the road. so as we looked at the sales guide, we did a lot of work on the december-january time frame, and we factored in the impact of what -- at least at this point is an extremely mild winter, compared it to other years, you guys have written about some of this 2017, 2012, it was one of the warmest in history for north america this year december-january. and given our northern footprint, we valued the impact that's going to have on top line sales really in the front half of the year.
considering this, and the fact that it's very early in the year, we're being prudent on the sales guidance. that said, there's a lot, we're very excited about for 2020 in longer term on the sales front. as you've heard from others, the industry drivers of demand are very positive. the car park is continuing to grow. we're going to cross $280 million this year. miles driven continues to increase, and the vehicles in the sweet spot. in addition to that, the vehicle is about seven years and greater is growing. so those are all positive impact and that will benefit the whole year.
separately, obviously we've got a number of top line initiatives across pro and diy that will build throughout the year including -- pardon me, our launch of diehard. so in terms of margin expansion and cash flow, our plans are very robust and we're continuing to execute against them. so that was kind of the thinking that went into sales. the building blocks of our plan are continuing to work nicely together. we've got a great team that's poised to deliver against the guidance. we've delivered sales growth and margin expansion two years in a row and we intend to do that again in 2020.
matt mcclintock -- raymond james -- analyst
and then just as a follow-up on diehard specifically. could you talk through how we should conceptualize the launch? how you plan about going about launching it? how we should think about the benefit from that launch? thanks.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, as we've talked when we issued the original press release, there is a tremendous amount of strategic and financial rationale for us behind diehard. it gives us the opportunity to really differentiate within, particularly inside of diy. as you know, diy traffic is our number one customer and business issue. and all the work that we've done says that diehard can really help us with that. it enables us to differentiate with diy customers brands, matter to diy customers, and we'll be able to differentiate there. we also plan to build out a unique position on pro with diehard, so we're excited about that also.
but as you think about the launch, we're not communicating any specific timing or anything like that right now, but we're obviously working very diligently to build out the launch plan for diehard, and needless to say, it will benefit us more in the back half of the year than the front half.
matt mcclintock -- raymond james -- analyst
i appreciate the color. best of luck.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

seth sigman -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey guys, good morning. thanks for taking the question. just -- i'm going to ask a couple of upfront. just the q4 cadence, obviously, december was very challenging. i'd love to just see your observations what you guys were seeing prior to that, because it seems like seasonally it should have been in a better place. so just any color on how the quarter was performing prior to the december slowdown?
and then just second, as you think about the guidance, the margin guidance for 2020, up 10 basis points to 30 basis points excluding the extra week. can you just break this -- break that down a little bit more between gross margin and sg&a? and just that sg&a piece related to the fourth quarter, the sustainability of some of the benefits that you saw this past quarter? any color on that. that'd be helpful. thank you.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and good morning, seth. i'll take the first one i'll flip it the second question over to jeff. in terms of december -- october, november, december, i mean, it wasn't that different at the national level. we did see a slowdown in december, but it was a market difference geographically, as we called out in our script. first of all, in the west, in the midwest, in central, there -- it was very cold in october, we had a very strong october, november in those geographies. we didn't get that benefit necessarily in the northeast, mid-atlantic and great lakes and as we got into december when it was much warmer in those geographies that really pulled down our business in december overall. so i think the headline there is the difference. the distribution was quite wide geographically for us in the quarter. as we said, over 600 basis points between the top three and bottom three.
jeff, do you want to cover off the other?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, sure. i'll start with the fourth quarter, seth, and then work into the guidance for 2020. fourth quarter, you saw sg&a improved a 125 basis points. three broad categories, the labor and labor-related, we did leverage store labor in the fourth quarter. we saw some improvements in our marketing programs as jason mcdonnell comes in and looks at some of the underperforming spend, we pulled back on some of that. and then for the fourth quarter in a row, we've seen improvement in insurance and claims, and this is really some favorability around some of our actuarial assessments. so throughout the year what we've seen is improvements in both the volume of claims and the severity of claims. and those are two key contributors to an it -- actuarial valuation to estimate out into the future what do you think your costs are going to be. those are going to come down albeit slow. so that sort of gets into 2020.
we think we're going to continue to see improvements in the areas of labor of supply -- sorry of safety. safety what i just discussed; labor, we're going to continue to leverage my day. we believe we can continue to see improvements there. we have integrations going on in the back office we've talked about the erp, we're going to see second half savings there, and we're also integrating ai and worldpac. so as we continue to get synergies around that, we'll see savings in sg&a.
now stepping back to 2020, as we think about where we're going to see the expansion, we do think we're going to see savings, but we also have a significant amount of investment. similar to what we guided last year, we're going to continue to have opex investment this year in marketing, in people, in supply chain, and in it. we -- at this point, we think we're going to see more of the improvement in our margin -- in gross margin.
and that's largely driven by two factors: first is the supply chain, and we've been working on this for a couple of years now, and we said it was going to take more time. we're going to start to see those improvements in supply chain in 2020. and then the second is category management, which is a combination of mco, material cost optimization, private label, and pricing. and the combination of those items we really think we're going to see the benefit as we sit here today more in gross margin and less in sg&a as we take on some of those opex investments within sg&a.
seth sigman -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. great. thank you for all the color. appreciate it.

michael lasser with ubs. your line is open.
atul maheswari -- ubs -- analyst
good morning. this is atul maheswari on for michael lasser. thanks a lot for taking our questions. first question is on the weather commentary. so why have you factored in the weather impacting only the front half of the year. back in 2017 when we kind of had a similar mild winter, i believe it led to subdued sales for the industry throughout the year. so why would this be any different?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we didn't actually find that. we did the work category by category, geography by geography, we compared the differences, we did see it in the second quarter, but we did not see an impact in the back half of those years, at least for our sales.
atul maheswari -- ubs -- analyst
got it, and it's very helpful. and as my follow-up question. can you talk about the current trends in the first quarter? basically, where are you tracking compared to your flat to zero -- flat to 2% comp guidance for the full-year? basically, i'm better trying to understand the degree of acceleration needed in the back half to achieve this guidance?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we're not going to comment on in-quarter performance, but obviously we did say that january was very warm. so our -- implied in our guide is acceleration in the back half of the year.
atul maheswari -- ubs -- analyst

simeon gutman with morgan stanley. your line is open.
michael kessler -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey guys. this is michael kessler on for simeon. thanks for taking our questions. first, i just wanted to ask about the comp relative to the operating margin growth expectation for 2020. it seems like comp is a fair guide given the backdrop and still guiding to solid margin expansion. i just want to ask you, how confident are you that you can achieve that given potentially a lower comp with the weather headwinds? and how much of the margin expansion, especially on gross margin is really not even dependent on sales growth? do you think you can get it regardless of the top line?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, first of all, we're excited about the fact that in the fourth quarter we delivered margin expansion amid a quarter where we -- our sales were lower than we expected. so we've always known we've got a tremendous opportunity to expand margins. we've been working on our agenda for a couple of years now. and the four big territories that we have for margin expansion, the majority of that upside is not sales dependent. so if you think about supply chain, we're going to essentially roll out cross banner replenishment, which is nothing more than repointing a store at a distribution center that's closer to the store than the previous one, so that's in full roll out right now.
we're standing up a warehouse management system platform that will enable us to standardize our labor management throughout the supply chain, that is not sales dependent. we're integrating worldpac and ai, as jeff just mentioned. big opportunity there for us to not only save money, but also to improve our assortment offering and availability to our customers, but most of the supply chain agenda has nothing to do with any sales dependency. separately, we're rolling out inside of category management, our own brand platform. jeff has stood up a pricing function, we've got a new pricing platform that were software tool that we're standing up in the middle of 2020 that will enable us to price right down to store level and price regionally, which we can't do today. so again, not necessarily sales dependent.
and then sg&a, jeff just covered, but really nothing inside of their sales dependent, whether that's the integration of our back office platforms, improves safety performance, indirect procurement, improving our performance on medical, all of those things are going to happen independent of sales. so i think the key point is, obviously, we want our sales to grow as rapidly as possible and we remain focused on building on our plans there, but our opportunity to expand margins is not as sales depend as it might be in other companies.
michael kessler -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. appreciate that and the color. and just as a follow-up. so we've been hearing that some suppliers are advising, you know, some of the major diy auto distributors that the parts supply out of china could be constrained by what we're seeing with coronavirus. i know you guys a little less exposed to diy than some of your competitors, but could you comment on what you're seeing or hearing thus far and whether there is any contingency you're building in at your guidance for any disruptions?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yes, well first of all, from a business standpoint, to be clear, our guide does not contemplate any impact from the coronavirus. as you said, it's pretty much a level playing field. all of the major players in our industry source from china. but even compared to other industries, auto parts is relatively low, i think we've communicated in the past, at least at advance, we're in the teens roughly in terms of products sourced from china. we have several months of inventory depending on the product we've got. obviously, our own infrastructure here in the us, we've also got a distribution center that has additional inventory in shanghai. so we're going to continue to monitor closely. but at the moment, we don't see any impact in supply disruption from us -- for us in 2020. but it's obviously a very dynamic situation and we've got to continue to monitor it very closely.
michael kessler -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you.

seth basham with wedbush securities. your line is open.
seth basham -- wedbush securities -- analyst
good morning. my question is around your supply chain progress. clearly, you're making a lot of progress integrating your supply chain. could you give us some perspective on types of financial benefits and other things that you're realizing from the dcs that you converted thus far, that would be really helpful.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure, seth. i mean, first of all, i'm really excited about what reuben slone and his team are doing inside of supply chain. again, it's taken us longer than we might have liked, but we're not only improving the effectiveness -- the efficiency of the supply chain, the effectiveness is going up as well. and as you know, it's one of our biggest opportunities to not only expand margins, but improve availability.
so i think he has really three big chapters that they're focused on: the first, is driving execution where there has been a number of leadership upgrades and a focus on reducing turnover in those dcs, which we made a lot of progress on in 2019, i believe we'll continue to make progress on in 2020.
the second is, we call invest to make it better, i cover those a minute ago, but again that's really changing the physics, if you will of our supply chain dc optimization, cross banner replenishment, driving execution through the wms system and i actually was at our first distribution center that we've stood up the new wms system very exciting. i mean, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we've had multiple warehouse management systems, a lot of manual processes and to go to a single warehouse management system across the entire advance, carquest network has huge upside for us. it will help us improve our availability and obviously standardize the actions are going on in those dcs. we've talked about worldpac and ai separately, which is also part of this invest to make it better chapter.
and then third, we talked about innovation. and in there, we've got things like our dc automation projects that we're working on. so, the value of the supply chain productivity agenda is significant. i think we've indicated, it's right there at the top of our opportunities to expand margins, and i'm very confident in our ability to improve within supply chain and not only expand margins as i said, but to improve availability and drive top line growth as a result.
seth basham -- wedbush securities -- analyst
that's really helpful. and just as a follow-up, as you think about the financial benefits from the supply chain initiatives. do you expect them to ramp through the year 2020. and similarly, would that mean that gross margin improvement over the year should also ramp?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i mean, we're now at a point where we expect to leverage supply chain through the year. and i think it's pretty evenly distributed throughout the year in the case of supply chain. and in other areas, i mean, jeff mentioned the coupon investment that we've made inside of speed perks that's mostly a front half investment on the gross margin side of the house. so that will improve in the back half, but the supply chain is relatively uniform through the year.
seth basham -- wedbush securities -- analyst
thank you very much.

scot ciccarelli with rbc. your line is open.
sullivan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. this is actually sullivan [phonetic] calls on for scot. thanks for taking our question. so just quick one on, just wanted to get to know if you can sort of quantify the gross margin comp impact during the quarter from the coupon redemption?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yes, what we've said is that it was similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. we're not going to break it out specifically, but think about a comparable number on a rate basis. and so it had a comparable impact on our net sales, gross margin than we saw in the third quarter.
sullivan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then -- that's helpful and then anything on just sort of on a go-forward basis, you just kind of mentioned, it's going to impact the first half year and it's going to be similar, kind of, decelerating? to what degree? that would be helpful.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yes, what we said was that we did, obviously the coupons associated with the original speed perks platform are no longer available, so they're expired. so we're seeing less redemption than we did in the back half of the year, it's still greater than we saw at the beginning of 2019, but it's less as on a rate basis, but we think this is an important investment for us to be making it gives us, we were able to add new members. as we said, we added about 1 million members to speed perks. we also are seeing less -- if you think about traction, retention and graduation, so we're attracting new members in, about a million in the quarter. we're losing less people, so our net number is continuing to grow. and then, we're graduating people up the tiers, and that allows us to personalize and leverage first-party data. so, very excited about speed perks and its ability to improve our loyalty with our most loyal customers.

daniel imbro with stephens, incorporated. your line is open.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. thanks for taking our questions. jeff, one for you. starting on mco, it was a big success, it sounds like, in the fourth quarter, helped kind of limit the gross margin degradation. i think about a year ago, you guys said you're about 80% through capturing the material cost optimization savings. how far along are we today in terms of capturing those savings? and should that tailwind diminish through 2020 or have you guys unlocked more opportunity there?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, sure. the material cost optimization is really an iterative process. so, we have been through all of our categories. so, we're in the process now of going back through certain categories that, maybe a year ago, we've already been through, but we're looking at all of the various aspects, whether it'd be costs, whether it'd be packaging, whether it'd be supply chain financing. we still think we have a significant opportunity there. and so, we're going to continue to do that on an ongoing basis. and we're also looking at it at an enterprise level. because when we first started, kind of the first round, aap/cq was our focus. we're now going back as an enterprise focus to bring in ai and worldpac. so, again, really going to iterate on that. we believe we're going to continue to see benefits to that in 2020 and beyond.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc -- analyst
helpful. and then, maybe just follow-up to an earlier question. tom, i think you mentioned and talked to the cadence of gross margin expansion in 2020. but as we take a step back and think further, when should we see the full run rate savings from the multiple warehouse systems and the new systems there? is that a first half of 2021 time frame or kind of when should that be full run rate in the cost?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think inside of -- the different initiatives, right, have different timelines, daniel. so, in terms of dc optimization, that's going to spread out over a couple of years, ok? that's two to three years. in terms of cross banner replenishment, we expect to complete that by the middle of 2021, ok? so, that's essentially 18 months out. we're in the process of pointing stores at a more freight logical location right now and we're just kind of going through that market by market and we'll realize the full benefit by that time frame.
in terms of the warehouse management system, that's going to take a little bit longer than that. we've, obviously, got to make sure that we've got everything ready. we're going through that market-by-market as well. we stood up one building. that's more like 2022, 2023 time frame. we haven't landed on the final date there. it depends on how quickly we're able to make the transition with these dcs and the training and everything that needs to go there. worldpac/auto part international integration, early 2021. so, you've got a combination of things there. but as i said, we will leverage the supply chain this year. and next year, we expect to leverage supply chain and then get the full benefit. i think you'll see into 2022, you're going to see the full benefit of most of the big initiatives.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thanks, guys.

michael montani with evercore isi. your line is open.
antonio tabet -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, this is actually antonio filling in for mike. i just want to shift gears a little bit to talk about multi-channel. so, also, can you give a breakdown -- before that, can you give a breakdown of how the diy consumer is performing? because i know, earlier, you mentioned commercial is strong, but also from the walmart.com partnership, are you seeing a meaningful impact to the diy segment? thanks.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yes. first of all, in terms of diy, in isolation -- i'm going to take diy in total. we did improve in the back half of 2019 versus where we were in the front half. we do attribute at least part of that to the launch of speed perks. there's so much upside there yet for us that we're going to really tap into this year based on all the big initiatives that we've put in place that we're still very focused on the improvements there, but we did improve in the back half of the year.
walmart is not a meaningful number yet, and we're continuing to work with the walmart team, they've been a great partner on this. what we're very focused on is making sure the customer experience is best-in-class. and as we go through each initiative with them, we've got to ensure that the online experiences working for our diyer and, obviously, the fulfillment experience is working well. so, we're adding those categories, those skus where we feel comfortable with that and they feel comfortable with that. and when we're ready to launch, we've got to make sure that the customer experience is right before we launch the different categories, i guess is the key point.
antonio tabet -- evercore isi -- analyst
all right. and just a quick follow-up to that. is it fair to say that some of that benefit you're seeing there will be realized in 2020? or is this more of a long-term initiative that you'll see in 2021, for example?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
we'll definitely see some benefit in 2020. but to your point, this is very much a multi-year long-term partnership with walmart. and with all the initiatives that we have going on and they have going on, we're making sure the customer experience is best-in-class. that's kind of at the center of everything we do when we meet together with that team. we're very focused on making sure that the customer experience is where it needs to be.

good morning, bret.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
could you talk about what you saw from inflation in the fourth quarter and what you're expecting inflation impact on 2020 to be?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, sure. in terms of pricing inflation, we saw right around, on a like-for-like sku, about 2.8%. and we're modeling for 2020 about 2% from a pricing inflation standpoint.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
and that 2% will be skewed to the first half before you lap the tariffs or is that sort of evenly equated?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. yes. so, that's including -- tariffs are sort of the same.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then, a question on dc optimization. as you start rolling out some of the cross banner. what do you see the right number of dcs being? if you've got 50 in three years, what's that count? and how many of the dcs you see in the future do you currently own or what, kind of, dc buildout might you require?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yes. first of all, we're not going to provide a specific number there, bret, obviously. we've announced these dc closures very thoughtfully. and we've got our own people in those buildings. we want to make sure that we do it the right way, etc. so, we're not going to break any of that out. but, obviously, there is a big opportunity for us to further rationalize inside of our network. and we do that by looking at the sales in the out years and geographically, how can we ensure that we don't have a service challenge. we did close armonk in new york and repointed stores at relevant dcs, and that's gone very smoothly.
so, we've now -- i think we're up to four in total that we've closed to date. and we've got it down. so, it's just a matter of phasing that out over time. so, you'll hear more about that when we have something to say and we've had our chance to speak to our people first. in terms of own -- yes, i don't think -- jeff -- yes, we'll have to get back to you on that, on owned versus lease. we'll get back to you on that. we've [speech overlap]
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
the question was more what's in the portfolio. if you see a 30 dc network in three years, are there dcs that you're going to need to build out or do you have most of what you need to rationalize your distribution?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
we do feel we have most of what we need. keep in mind, we also have worldpac out there in places like california. so, as bob starts to integrate the assortment across all the banners, we look at all of the assets of the company. so, it's not just red and blue, if you will.

now let me turn the call over to tom greco.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, elisabeth, and good morning. and thank all of you for joining us to discuss our q4 and full-year 2019 results. i want to begin by recognizing and thanking every single aap team member in our network of carquest independent for their dedication throughout the year. with an unrelenting focus on delivering against our strategic priorities, we made progress on many initiatives throughout 2019 and we plan to continue strengthening the company as we begin 2020.
in q4, we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of top line growth with an increase in net sales to $2.1 billion and comparable store sales up slightly, compared to the prior year. we also expanded our adjusted operating income margin rate by 106 basis points in the quarter. this focused effort to deliver margin expansion with lower-than-anticipated sales growth translated to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.64, an increase of 40.2% in q4.
in the quarter, we also completed our acquisition of the iconic diehard brand, which we're excited to add to our industry-leading assortment of national brands, oe parts and own brands.
for the full-year 2019, our net sales increased 1.3% to $9.7 billion with comparable store sales growth of 1.1%. we delivered adjusted operating margin expansion of 36 basis points year-over-year; adjusted diluted earnings-per-share growth of 14.9% and generated $597 million in free cash flow. following our second consecutive year of sales growth, margin expansion and strong cash generation, as well as our confidence and ongoing improvements in 2020 and beyond. our board approved the first increase to our quarterly cash dividend since the 2014 acquisition. in fact, this was the first increase since aap introduced it's quarterly dividend in 2006.
before i turn the call over to jeff for more details on our financial performance. i want to highlight the operational performance improvements we implemented in 2019, as well as several exciting new initiatives planned for this year, which we expect to enable ongoing top line growth and adjusted oi margin expansion in 2020 and beyond. in q4, our professional business led our growth rate, highlighted by worldpac, canada and our carquest independent businesses. as we continue to bring all our professional assets under one roof, we remain focused on providing best-in-class parts availability; improving order to delivery speed and consistency; and strengthening our overall value proposition to our customers.
this includes ongoing enhancements to our one-stop shop professional online platform myadvance, as well as improvements to our best-in-class online b2b catalog, advance pro. myadvance improves the customer experience with fully integrated access to promotions, product information, our pro rewards program, but of reconciliation and key performance indicators. this enables us to leverage customer data to drive engagement, while improving visibility to enroll promotions and customer involvement.
additionally, we expanded the categories included in the roll out of dynamic assortment with 50 categories now rolled out across nearly 4,000 stores representing over 50% of our back room sales. dynamic assortment is continuing to improve stock and close rates in key categories. once fully implemented, we expect dynamic assortment to drive top line improvements through a better understanding of customer demand and utilizing multiple data points to improve availability and help ensure that we have the right part in the right place at the right time.
in terms of our diy omni-channel business, we had a challenging q4, particularly in the north. that said, the heavy lifting, we did in the back half of 2019 has resulted in a much stronger diy plan for 2020, which we believe will build momentum throughout the year. there are four primary areas of focus here: one, launch diehard; two, build awareness; three, drive loyalty and four, execute with excellence.
but first we're very excited about launching the iconic diehard brand throughout the advance network in 2020. diehard is the number one battery brand among all customers and presents us with several ways we believe we can differentiate our offering and drive increased customer traffic to our retail stores. our goal of diehard is to build on its strong reputation, creating a differentiated value proposition, while we're confident the addition of diehard to our industry-leading assortment will drive incremental growth for diy omni-channel. we also see the potential to leverage diehard with our professional customers and independent carquest partners. in the future we also believe there is a significant opportunity for brand extension into other categories and geographic expansion of diehard. without question both the advance team and our carquest independent are very excited about diehard.
second, we're focused on significantly improving awareness of advance. our unaided awareness improved in 2019, but still lags our primary competitors by a wide margin. our 2020 plans are highlighted by a new marketing campaign, including a significant increase in media, which we sourced from pre-existing, lower performing marketing spend. we're confident this new advertising will differentiate the advance brand over time.
additionally, we're very excited to leverage our recently announced partnership with penske racing and our new driver ryan blaney. we'll also continue to drive awareness by improving our digital experience as we know that most transactions start online. our diy online business continued to grow traffic and transactions, resulting in double-digit e-commerce growth in both q4 and the full-year. our team is also making progress on the expansion of product offerings on walmart.com, including the addition of product reviews that facilitate a frictionless experience for our customers.
third, we continue to make progress on our loyalty program speed perks, and we're excited about the launch of our new mobile app or diys in q1. our app will make speed perks and our mobile experience even more accessible to our loyal customers. when we relaunched speed perks 2.0 mid-year under 25% of our diy transactions were speed perks transactions at that point. we finished the year at close to 36%, this enables us to leverage first-party data to personalize our offerings.
in q4, we added close to 1 million new speed perks members, finishing q4 at close to 12 million active members. in addition, we saw increasing graduation rates from one spending tier to the next. we'll continue to build loyalty behind speed perks by leveraging personalization and communicating directly with our customers.
fourth, our field team continues to improve on key execution metrics, including units per transaction, weekend coverage and net promoter score. in 2020, we plan to improve both the quality and execution of our automotive training for our team members, while improving the customer experience for buy online, pickup in store. the fact that our turnover in front line customer facing role decline in both 2018 and 2019, that's helped us improve execution overall.
in terms of category performance, our q4 growth was led by brakes, batteries and filters. due to a weak december, we underperformed on winter-related products, such as starters and alternators, as well as radiators. geographically, our regional performance was highly vary with our midwest, west and central regions delivering mid single-digit growth in q4, and the largest sales increases on both a one and two-year stack, compared to prior years. these geographies significantly outperformed our weakest geographies in the quarter with our great lakes, northeast and mid-atlantic regions trailing the top performing regions by over 600 basis points on average.
to summarize our growth initiatives, we've elevated our focus on differentiating and improving the customer experience for both our pro and diy omni-channel business. we remain relentlessly focused on delighting the customer across all of our businesses. our pro business continues to build momentum across all banners and we continue to integrate key platform to simplify and improve the customer experience across advance pro and myadvance. in terms of diy omni-channel, while it remains a work in progress, we have the strongest marketing calendar of activity on diy omni-channel in years, with a plan to launch diehard, build awareness, increase loyalty, and improve execution.
moving onto our key pillars of margin expansion for 2020 and beyond. our first priority is to improve sales and profit per store. this includes optimizing our existing footprint, expanding where we're under penetrated, and closing unproductive or underperforming assets where appropriate. starting with our largest business on the professional side, our team continues to expand our professional footprint to drive share growth. in 2019, we opened 17 new worldpac branches and continue to add new carquest independent locations. in addition to the growth of our existing locations and sourcing new opportunities, our team has also started the consolidation of our worldpac and autopart international banners to deliver improved productivity and product assortment across our professional business. this effort will continue throughout 2020.
in addition, behind consistent gradual improvements in execution across our advance and carquest stores, our average sales per store has increased from $1.5 million at the end of 2017 to roughly $1.6 million per store at the end of 2019. we're confident we'll continue this growth and are on track to achieve our goal of $1.8 million per store over time. separately, we continue to address more structural opportunities within our retail stores, which includes a strengthened store refresh program and the ongoing optimization of our store footprint. we expect the actions we're taking to improve sales and profit per store will benefit both diy and pro.
our second margin expansion priority is within our supply chain, and i'm pleased to say we're now in full execution mode on this critical area of our transformation. our supply chain team has done a thorough review of our entire footprint and we're now executing plans that we believe will significantly enhance our enterprisewide supply chain. with 50 distribution centers today, we have a clear opportunity to further rationalize our footprint over the coming years. importantly, we will work to optimize the network while improving our service to customers. it's imperative that our dcs have the right part in the right place at the right time, so we win more often.
one of our major supply chain productivity initiatives is cross banner replenishment, which we began to deploy in late 2019. following the successful lead markets, we're now beginning to scale this capability throughout our dc and expect to be completed by mid-2021. once fully implemented, we expect we will improve product availability, drive turns, and deliver significant cost productivity.
in addition, we are continuing to invest in the consolidation of several warehouse management systems or wms for short, the one system across our advance and carquest network, which as you can imagine is a significant undertaking. when we began our supply chain transformation, we were dealing with multiple wms systems, along with extensive manual processes and high turnover in our dcs. not only is our turnover down significantly in our dcs, our safety performance and engagement scores are now trending in a positive direction. well, it took time to build the right team and stabilize operations before we introduced a new wms system, i'm confident we now have the right team in place to help us further our transformation progress.
importantly, our team recently completed the first conversion to our new wms platform in one of our largest dc, and that dc is off to a terrific start. we expect this initiative coupled with the implementation of a new labor management system will allow us to run common across our dcs. so we can provide better product availability at more optimal inventory turns and costs. we're currently on track with our supply chain agenda, and i'm excited for what this will deliver in 2020 and beyond.
our third pillar of margin expansion focus is on category management. here we've implemented a standardized approach across key categories to facilitate material cost optimization, own brand expansion, and unit and profit growth through strategic pricing. this has been a highly collaborative effort with our supplier partners. in terms of material cost optimization, while unplanned tariffs reduce the benefit of our performance in 2019, we made good progress on mcl, both in q4 and for the full-year.
for own brand expansion, we began to roll out additional carquest branded products in the back half of 2019. we're working to ensure the highest of quality in our carquest brand roll out as this brand resonates so strongly with our professional garages. in parallel, we have been exploring own brand opportunities for diy with our suppliers, with diehard being the best example of this to-date.
finally, we expect to deploy our new pricing platform by mid-year. this will enable single price execution across all channels to provide consistent and more efficient management of our pricing. a big benefit of this new capability will be the ability to centrally price right down the store level if needed.
finally, sg&a productivity rounds off the fourth pillar of our margin expansion. sg&a was a highlight of our 2019 performance as our team continues to make excellent progress in managing our costs. in the fourth quarter, we were able to leverage our labor-related costs, including store labor as a percent of sales, in spite of wage inflation and lower-than-expected sale. this was largely driven by the improvements from our new store level labor management system, which we rolled out in q3.
additionally, our diligent efforts to build a culture of safety is becoming ingrained in how our team members work, leading to a reduction in our liabilities and claims expenses across the organization, which benefited the quarter and the year. in fact, we lowered our total recordable injury rate by 8% in 2019 and our ltir or lost time injury rate, which represents the worst safety incidents was reduced by an impressive 17%, compared to 2018.
finally, we continue to make progress on rent in the quarter and in the year. for the full-year, we leveraged our occupancy in base rent by roughly 20 basis points. to wrap up, our sg&a performance we made good progress across multiple lines, enabling us to leverage sg&a to drive margin expansion, while at the same time we made significant investments in technology, e-commerce and supply chain in 2019.
in summary, 2019 was a year of continued progress for aap, as we registered another year of top line growth and margin expansion, while making important long-term investments. in terms of our outlook for 2020, we previously discussed that this year would be similar to 2019 in terms of investment requirements. with that said, some additional items for you to keep in mind. first, as you probably know, we've just experienced the warmest january in history, which is expected to impact demand in the front half of the year. from an aap standpoint, we also expect the elevated coupon investment we're making in our loyalty platform to continue in the front half of 2020.
on the positive side of the equation, industry dynamics remain very attractive. this includes continued increases in the car park, miles driven, as well as an increase in vehicles greater than seven years old. all of these are projected to have a favorable impact on demand throughout 2020. further, we also expect our pro and diy initiatives to build top line momentum through the year.
finally, i'm confident in our team's ability to continue our margin expansion trajectory and deliver further progress against our strategic objectives in 2020. all of these factors are contemplated in the full-year guidance we introduced in our press release this morning.
in summary, we remain very excited about the tremendous opportunity ahead to fully unlock the potential of aap, and we're committed to driving consistent improvement across the enterprise over the next several years.
with that, i'll turn it over to jeff for details on our financial performance.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, tom, and good morning everyone. in the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit was approximately $929 million, which was essentially flat, compared to the prior year quarter. adjusted gross profit margin of 44% declined 19 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by lifo headwinds, as well as the expected headwinds from continued investment in our enhanced loyalty program speed perks 2.0. these headwinds were partially offset by pricing actions taken in the quarter.
our adjusted sg&a was approximately $779 million in q4 2019, compared to approximately $802 million in q4 2018. as a percentage of net sales, our adjusted sg&a expenses improved by 125 basis points to 36.9%. i'm pleased with our team members' dedication to control costs throughout 2019, which enable us to leverage expenses every quarter. in q4, we leveraged labor-related costs, and once again reduced our insurance and claims expense, the key training programs and focus on safety, drove improvements across the organization.
adjusted operating income in q4 was $150 million, which improved nearly 18%, compared to the prior year quarter. our adjusted oi margin rate increased 106 basis points to 7.1% in the quarter. adjusted diluted eps for q4 was $1.64, an increase of 40.2%. for the full-year, net sales were $9.7 billion, an increase of 1.3%, compared to 2018, and comp sales improved 1.1%.
adjusted gross profit for the year increased 1.1% to $4.3 billion, and adjusted gross profit margin decreased 12 basis points to 44%. adjusted sg&a for the year was flat, compared to 2018 at $3.5 billion. on a rate basis, our full-year adjusted sg&a was 35.8%, which was an improvement of 48 basis points, compared to the previous year.
adjusted operating income for the year was $795 million, an increase of 6%, compared to the end of 2018. our adjusted operating margin was 8.2% for 2019, which increased 36 basis points, compared to the full-year of 2018. adjusted diluted eps increased 14.9% to $8.19, compared to $7.13 at the end of 2018.
moving to free cash flow. we delivered $597 million in 2019, which was lower than our expectations. factors negatively impacting working capital includes higher-than-expected increases in both our receivables and inventory. we also realized an unfavorable payment term mix within vendor payables. this was driven by an increase in worldpac inventory, associated with the opening of worldpac branches, which carry shorter payment terms, as well as an unfavorable mix impact within advance and carquest vendor payables. these factors resulted in higher cash outflows at year-end than we previously modeled.
consistent with increasing capital spend throughout 2019, our capex in q4 was $101 million, bringing the full-year spend to $270 million, an increase of 39.4% year-over-year. as we have previously discussed, our investments are primarily focused on information technology and supply chain projects. and in 2019, more than 60% of our capital spend was concentrated on these two critical areas.
our it initiatives continue to address long-standing lack of investment in critical systems and back office integrations, which we expect to continue in 2020 and beyond. nearly one-third of our it spend in 2019 focus on customer-facing systems, and i'm pleased with the near completion of our nextgen store system upgrade across our footprint. in addition, throughout 2019, our team worked diligently on our finance erp project, which integrates our back office finance systems. we went live with our first release in this new system at the start of our fiscal 2020, and i'm confident the continued roll out of this initiative will create significant efficiencies across our organization.
in addition, our supply chain team worked relentlessly throughout the year to stabilize existing operations. we invested in dc improvements in 2019, with additional plans for 2020, including network upgrades and continued roll out of our single warehouse management system across our legacy advance and carquest network to enable improved accuracy and efficiencies within the distribution centers.
in line with our financial priorities to maintain an investment grade rating, invest in the business and opportunistically return capital to shareholders. under our current share repurchase program, we repurchased nearly $11 million of advance stock during the fourth quarter, and a total of approximately $487 million for the year. importantly, we remain confident in our ability to generate meaningful cash from the business.
as you saw yesterday, we are pleased to announce our board has approved a meaningful improvement to our quarterly dividend, which was increased from $0.06 to $0.25. we're committed to a balanced approach in returning capital to our shareholders, while making important investments to drive our transformation. as we begin 2020, we remain focused on our strategic objectives and discipline in our execution to deliver against our financial priorities.
with that said, this morning, we introduced our 53-week full-year 2020 guidance for several key metrics; including net sales of $9.88 billion to $10.1 billion; comparable store sales growth of flat to 2%; adjusted operating income margin expansion of 20 basis points to 50 basis points; capital expenditures of $275 million to $325 million; focusing on continued it and supply chain investments. the 2020 tax rate is expected to be 24% to 26%, and as we continue our disciplined approach to cash management, we expect to deliver a minimum free cash flow of $600 million.
as a reminder, 2020 includes the 53rd week. our financial outlook provided today includes an estimated $125 million to $150 million in net sales, and approximately 10 basis points to 20 basis points of margin expansion from the 53rd week contribution.
in summary, i want to reiterate our gratitude that tom began with today to all our team members and independent partners for their efforts throughout 2019, which enabled our continued progress toward our transformation objectives. we remain committed to further improvements in 2020 to remain disciplined in our approach to capitalize on the significant opportunity still ahead for aap.

certainly. [operator instructions] michael lasser with ubs, your line is open.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
good morning. thanks a lot for taking my question. if we take the midpoint of your guide -- of your operating margin guidance for this year, it implies that you'll have achieved around 30 basis points of annual margin expansion between 2019 and 2021. recognizing that there is some covid costs in there, but why wouldn't there be more margin expansion given the investments you've made, the store closures and the year has started off strong with double-digit comps so far this year? and if you could also talk about the flow of margins over the course of this year, it would be very helpful? thank you.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, michael. first of all, yeah, we're very excited about the start of the year. in terms of the overall margin expansion, our long-term goal is to dramatically accelerate our margins, as you know. we're pretty excited that we're going to share an update with you on our long-term plans on april the 20. 2020 was our third consecutive year of comp sales and operating income growth. and we have said, as you highlighted, that 2021 and beyond it's going to have a significant acceleration of margin expansion and that's going to come from a number of areas that we've talked about before.
so we're going to talk more about that on april the 20. i mean, i think the biggest factor in what you described is the covid-related costs that we still have embedded in our annual guide this year, and that remains an unknown at this point. we still have some uncertainty out there regarding covid-related costs and we saw that late in the year spike significantly as infection rates across the country went up and we remain very focused on accelerating margin expansion. once that comes out, as we've said, at $60 million for the full year that will be a big number for us to expand our margins with.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and my follow is, tom, you have the advantage of having more exposure to markets that were hit harder in 2020 as well as exposure to recovery in the professional market, which has been florida to improve thus far. so as you think about 2021, compared to your peers, how much of the gap are you expecting that your sales should improve more than the industry this year? a bit of the -- you're recognizing that you guided to 1% to 3% comp, but that seems pretty modest in light of these benefits that you will have, especially relative to the rest of the industry?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, for sure, we definitely saw that difference last year. if you look at the miles driven, which is the most -- one of the significant drivers of demand in our industry, miles driven were down the most in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions. the southeast and southwest were down the least. and then on the other hand, from a channel perspective, we know that diy outperformed pro. so both of those things, we start to lap in april and may. and we do expect the northeast and mid-atlantic to come back strong.
it's obviously once again a function of how quickly the economy returns to those markets, how quickly people start to return back to work. but there is an expectation that those markets will outperform and that pro will outperform diy this year. so we feel we're very, very well positioned in that regard and we're going to watch it very closely. we've looked at the full year, the lapse for each geography and each channel. and we feel very good about how we're positioned to take advantage of that resurgence in demand in the mid-atlantic, the northeast in our professional business.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
okay. thank you very much, and good luck.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.

seth sigman with credit suisse, your line is open.
seth sigman -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. thanks for taking the question. i wanted to just follow-up on that guidance for the full year for next year. jeff, on the 8.7% to 8.9% ebit margin, i assume that excludes the impact from lifo. can you just confirm whether lifo was expected to be a headwind or a tailwind in '21? and just so we're all comparing apples-to-apples, if you exclude the lifo benefit in '20, are we looking at ebit margin in '20 more like 8%. so effectively you're guiding 70 to 90 basis points of expansion. i just wanted to confirm those numbers?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. first of all, we did exclude lifo from the guidance that we provided in 2021. so we had that as a slight headwind as we were modeling it, but it's not in the aop that we've put out -- the guidance that we've put out today. and then you're right, as it relates to 2020, you would have to back out that $14 million that we had in favorability in lifo in 2020. so that gets you closer to an 8% on a 52-week basis.
seth sigman -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, great. so effectively guiding a little bit more than that improvement. okay. and then just on the gross margin, if we look at the drivers this quarter, lifo was a factor. but can you just help us better understand some of the fundamental drivers that are supporting this improvement? and sort of within that guidance we just talked about, what are you assuming for gross margin and sort of the phasing of the benefits, really the supply chain and some of the other initiatives? thank you.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. our initiatives are really beginning to take shape. so as it relates to category management, for example, we saw improvements in both product costs as well as improvements in price. and then we once again leveraged supply chain as the initiatives around cross banner replenishment are continuing to remove costs and we're taking an advantage of that. so in addition to shrink in the lifo, as you just called out, the channel mix was also positive, although i will tell you that that was offset by product mix, which is related to categories such as brakes, labors and lighting, similar to what we saw in the third quarter.
now looking forward into the guidance, into '21, it's a lot of those same initiatives. and those are the reasons that gross margin is going to be the driver for our margin growth when we look at '21 compared to '20. so the strategic pricing. we've got it in place. we're starting to implement that. we're already starting to see early results. and similar to the category management with changing over into private label and we're going to start to see the impact of that early on and then throughout the year. so with those initiatives that are in place, we're taking the actions now and we're going to see that benefit going into '21, and those are going to be the drivers that lead our gross margin.
seth sigman -- credit suisse -- analyst
very helpful. thank you very much.

chris horvers with j.p. morgan, your line is open.
chris horvers -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everybody. so i guess, a couple of questions on cadence. how are you thinking about overall same-store sales cadence over the year? and any additional detail on how you're thinking about pro versus diy?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, chris. the cadence is much more volatile than historic, right? we're going to be -- pardon me. we're going to be lapping a minus 9% in the first quarter and then we go to a 7% plus and a plus 10% and then there is variation across the channels and there is variation across the geographies. so we've done a tremendous amount of work on this to try and understand what to expect for the year. clearly, the first quarter will be very strong. we highlighted low-double-digit growth quarter-to-date, and that's prior to the widespread shutdowns that happened late period three and into period four.
period -- sorry, the second quarter, you'll recall, the professional business was still challenged. diy surged. that we're factoring in, etc. so i think about looking at the two year numbers, i mean that's what we're looking at closely obviously is the two year numbers to kind of factor out the volatility of last year. but even there, you've got to put some judgment against it. but we obviously expect to get off to a great start and build on the momentum. we're excited about the way the year has started off, and we're going to continue to build from here.
chris horvers -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
got it. and then similar question on the margin. given that the supply chain and wms completes over the year, at least the supply chain and then wms, does the gross margin expansion weight more to the back half? the inverse of that is the sg&a or sg&a dollars were flat in the first half, but up very high in the back half. so is there some inverse going on between gross margin and sg&a over the year?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there will likely be some, chris. the gross margin we, to your point, we continue to see improvements, cross banner replenishment is a great example of that. as you take out those stem miles, you get that savings immediately will be completed with the first set of stores that were identified in the end of the third quarter. so you get that full run rate in the fourth quarter. so we will continue to see that improvement throughout the year.
sg&a, again, that's a little bit more tricky. with the covid costs, almost all of them are in sg&a. that one is a little bit more difficult to predict. certainly, we saw a surge here late in the year and then early into '21. but as we've said, we are modeling less the covid cost in '21 as compared to '20. when that happens, remains to be seen. and then we will be lapping some difficult dollars in sg&a in the second and third quarter around payroll.
so we had -- we were taking hours out, we were reducing time, we were closing early and we're going to be returning to normal ideally. and we'll have full store hours, which requires the store labor, it requires the training, it requires the normal replenishment and stocking and all the other types of things that we had to pause in the second and third quarter. so you're going to get some volatility throughout the year.
chris horvers -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
got it. thanks very much.
operator
seth basham with wedbush securities, your line is open.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
thanks a lot, and good morning. my question is firstly around the fourth quarter inventory shrink. did you call out how much shrink helped gross margins in the fourth quarter?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we didn't call out the number. it was a significant number, which is why we wanted to call it out. it's a bit of an anomaly. normally what happens is, we do these physical inventory counts throughout the year. and what that does is, it inform your -- what we call our shrink rate. what's been driving -- the type of reserve that you need on your balance sheet for the estimated shrink, that's out there. because we were pausing that, as i just mentioned, in the second and third quarter, we had to catch all that up in the fourth quarter. it was a positive adjustment, but it took what we probably would have recognized in the second and third quarter and pushed it all into the fourth quarter.
so on balance, we still saw improvement on a year-over-year basis. we just saw that primarily in the fourth quarter. and we're going to continue to -- with our efforts around shrink, we're very pleased with the results, although it was -- all came in the fourth quarter. we're going to continue with those standard operating procedures and hope to get further benefits in shrink going into 2021.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
okay. so how material was shrink as a benefit for the fourth quarter and the year? and do you expect it to be a benefit in your margin guidance for 2021?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it was a benefit for sure in the fourth quarter and the full year. as i said, we haven't called out exactly what the number is. for the full year, as i said, it was also a benefit. and we expect to get a further benefit in 2021. it won't be as significant. i wouldn't expect it to be a primary driver when you compare it to all of our other initiatives and gross margin, especially around category management and pricing and the efforts that were going into our supply chain initiatives.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
okay. got you. and just to think through the outlook on gross margins in 2021 a little bit more, can you rank order the drivers of gross margin expansion in 2021? would pricing be at the top of the list or would supply chain? how do we think about the most important drivers?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, seth. they're both very big. the category management initiative has the own brand expansion and the strategic pricing, which we're really getting traction on. and then the supply chain has some big initiatives in there that we're getting traction on. they're relatively close in size. so they're not that different, they're both meaningful. and we've got benefits from both of them this year. and that's why our margin expansion this year will be more gross margin-related than anything else.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.

scot ciccarelli with rbc capital markets, your line is open.
scot ciccarelli -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good morning, guys. so wanted to follow-up on the shift toward store expansion. basically, tom, why do you think now is the time to shift toward expansion from your prior consolidation efforts?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, scot. yeah, we really feel good about how the stores have come along and the leadership team, the field organization has put much more disciplined into how we're running the stores. the say/do ratio is very strong. we've had three straight years of, basically, closing stores, as we highlighted, about 250 stores closed. so we sort of optimized the underperforming stores inside of our fleet. and meanwhile, we've had comp sales growth in the same timeframe.
so we feel confident that we can start opening stores. we did open stores last year. we've got some experience back in doing so. we're ahead of our targets on the stores that we've opened. and the field is extremely excited about store openings. so we do feel it's the right time for us to inflect. we've got a lot of opportunity geographically to expand our footprint. we're advertising diehard nationally. we're advertising advance. these are things that can be scaled.
our omnichannel catalog is available throughout the country. and providing not just a storefront, but a fulfillment node in these new geographies is something that we feel can allow us to grow. it's still a very fragmented industry, as you know. clearly, we're in a position to gain share within the industry as i think the other players have done for a period of time. and then finally, the commercial real estate market is pretty attractive right now. so there's a number of factors that have led to this decision. but we're very excited about it, and it will help us add revenue growth on top of the comp sales growth.
scot ciccarelli -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i appreciate that. and then what geographies might we see prioritize?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
we're not going to break that out, but we've got a pretty disciplined architecture in terms of how we look at the north american landscape, and each one of them presents a different opportunity. so more to come. we'll share a little bit more on april the 20 on that, scot.
scot ciccarelli -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.

greg melich with evercore isi, your line is open.
greg melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. thanks, guys. i'll just start on looking back at how much was inflation a factor last year? remember, we had tariffs the year before and some of that flowed through. just sort of what it was last year? and in your guidance this year, what you're expecting on inflation?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, let me start, greg, and i'll let jeff get the inflation number. but what we saw last year was a big uptick in average price per transaction. we really did see a significant uptick there, and some of that was category-related. so as we saw migration to categories like batteries, your average selling price goes up pretty significantly, similarly in some of the hard parts categories. so we did see asp go up quite a bit.
on a unit-per-unit basis, jeff?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. 1.5% was the total for the year, and that's above what we're modeling for 2021. we're seeing some headwinds early on. and as we start the year here, we're seeing some pressures around commodities, currency and transportation. so we know we're going to get some early on headwind. but for the year, we're sort of modeling between 1% and 2%. so 1.5% at the midpoint.
the key component to remember to that is, we always try to negotiate the best cost possible. when we do have to take on a cost, we've been relatively successful in passing that along to the consumer in the form of price. that's obviously what we want to do last, but we have been successful in doing that, and 2020 was no exception.
greg melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
[technical issue] last year, we heard from some of your competitors that in an attempt to maybe get a little more promotional in certain categories, to keep some of the traffic won on diy, how would you guys describe the promotional environment? and how you're thinking about it currently and into this year?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
two things there, greg. first of all, i would say, it's been rational. we obviously look at competitive price indices across all our categories routinely. i would say, this is one of many areas where we're catching up. i mean, our level of sophistication in pricing is just below that of our peers, to be blunt. and we're beginning to take some actions there that i think are going to really help our margins.
we haven't seen any kind of unit fall off as we started to initiate some of these pricing actions. we're getting more version. we're getting more regional on our pricing. we're getting smarter about how we leverage coupons. and all of that are things that we believe that over time can help us drive, not just margin expansion, but unit growth is what we're seeing. so we haven't experienced any major competitive dynamics. we haven't seen any major competitive dynamics category-by-category.
greg melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. and then last, just want to clarify, did you guys say that pro is now running as strong as diy or that's your expectation for this year? in other words, has the year-to-date pro caught up?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the year-to-date, we're off to a very good start on pro. i mean, we did see it begin to improve late in the year in december. we're off to a very good start. it's still underperforming diy, but it's off to a very good start. and beginning in period four, period five of this calendar year, that's where we expect to really inflect because that's when the installer base that we serve essentially shut down as it pertains to remote work. and then that continued on, greg, for several periods. and we started to recover in the third quarter, but we see lots of upside in pro. there are a lot of people that are not driving as much as they did. if you look at the major metro markets, like new york and boston, you're still talking double-digit miles driven down and we expect to start lapping that in period four or five, which should be very good for our industry and very good for us.
greg melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's great. thanks. good luck.

kate mcshane with goldman sachs, your line is open.
kate mcshane -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good morning. just a quick housekeeping question. i think you'd mentioned that there was maybe some deferred capex and that capex would be a little bit higher in 2021. can you remind us what that number is and what it means for any additional opex as a result of that deferred capex from 2020 to 2021?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. what we had said previously is '19 and '20 were going to be our big investment years and then we would start to see a reduced level of capex. obviously, that was a comment pre-pandemic. and as a result of having to temporarily pause many of our programs for several months, that's pushed it into 2021. so we're guiding $275 million to $325 million. we do think it will continue to attract a certain amount of opex, not the levels that we have seen in the past. i think we had done $80 million to $100 million in the past. it certainly won't be to that level. but the $275 million to $325 million, prior to the pandemic, we would have expected it to be something lower than what we were experiencing guiding for '20. so if we were at $300 million, we would have been something lower. now we think we're going to be in that consistent range to get caught up.
kate mcshane -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. thank you.

simeon gutman with morgan stanley, your line is open.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, good morning. my first question is on the adjusted operating margin guidance for '21. did you say -- i know you said most of it's going to come from gross margin. could you tell us what you're assuming for lower year-over-year covid costs? and then second of all, i realized it's not in the guidance and it's not a reconciliating item, but the lifo, can you say what's the slight headwind? can you quantify that what you're assuming for '21?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i'll start with the lifo. i mean, it was -- it is a small number. and it's really just based on the fact that we were looking at what do we think our inventory was going to do from a year-over-year basis, and at this point, we're assuming slightly down. there's always factors that can change that quite dramatically. i mean, we saw that we were up here at the end of the fourth quarter, end of the year in terms of our inventory balance, but it would have been single-digit million, something like that.
going back to the covid, we're not going to guide on our covid. we obviously believe it's going to be significant. we are saying it's less than what we incurred this year, which was $60 million. this is just an assumption we're making that certainly in the first half of the year, we're going to continue to incur covid costs and they could likely be meaningful. we could be drastically right or drastically wrong. and we don't really want to put guidance out there and be held to that because i don't think anybody really knows where this is going to take us into '21.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. fair enough. my follow-up is on the top-line. i think tom mentioned in the prepared remarks that the spread -- i forget if it was between difm and diy or the spread between markets that were more impacted by miles driven was starting to narrow. my question is on geographies and some of the assumptions that are embedded in your 1% to 3% comp outlook? can you talk about that mix? and i know, tom, you mentioned you'll start to face easier comparison period four or five. but if you see a complete narrowing across markets and you see miles driven recovers in some of those more impacted regions, i'm trying to understand the conservatism in that 1% to 3%, if we can see a comp that's even better than that range?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, we certainly -- it's very early in the year, right, simeon? i mean, that's the short answer. but there's no question that we believe the northeast and mid-atlantic, which are huge geographies for us, very important geographies for us, we believe will accelerate in the second quarter and then balance of the year. the narrowing that we referenced, i mean, if you think back the second quarter of last year, i think we called out roughly 2,000 basis points gap and then it narrowed to about 1,000, and it's continuing to narrow. so, you're talking about meaningful differences in geographic performance, at least for us. and from everything we can see from syndicated data, really for the entire industry. pro versus diy, you can look at the reported results of the major players and infer from that.
so is there upside? possibly. but it's february right now, there's still uncertainty out there. we're off to a terrific start. we've actually got a winter this year. i mean, across the country, if you look and see what's going on, it's very different than it's been the last two years. so there are some things that would lead you to believe there could be upside there. but it's early in the year and we want to be thoughtful about the uncertainty that's there. and we feel very confident in our guide at this point.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.

brian nagel with oppenheimer, your line is open.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i appreciate all the guidance. so my first question is on the guidance. i guess, you're a little more qualitative in nature, but clearly, your sector benefited to a certain extent. you capitalized well upon improved diy demand early in 2020. so as you look to 2021, how are you thinking about just the sustainability of that, either from a new customer acquisition standpoint or looking to the other side, just a potential phase as consumers potentially get back to more normal habits once covid-19 headwinds or disruptions begin to abate here?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. good question, brian. we obviously have done a lot of work on the customer base that's been coming into our stores. fortunately, we have a loyalty platform, speed perks. we mine that data. we're trying to continue to learn from the new customers that are coming in. and we've sort of outlined a number of reasons that have driven this. everything from people looking for more efficient ways, inexpensive ways to repair and maintain their vehicles, the fact that people have time on their hands, the mass transportation aversion that's going on there, people not necessarily going to larger boxes, there's a number of factors that are out there.
and the question is, how sticky are those factors? and what we're trying to do is engage very closely with our customer base. what we know is that the new customers that have come in are a little bit younger than our traditional customers. they spend more time online. they're a little more affluent. we've got a pretty good idea of how to engage those customers, and personalization and leveraging first party data is very important for us. so our goal is to drive share of wallet.
again, pretty fragmented industry, lots of opportunity for us out there. if you look at the broader diy market, we're only roughly about $4 billion in sales in a market that's close to $60 billion. so we do see lots of upside for us on diy yet, even though there was a surge last year and a bit of a pretty disruptive shift in consumer behavior.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
that's helpful. i appreciate it. my follow-up question, i guess, near-term in nature, but you talked a bit about or a lot about the uptick in sales trends here in early 2021 so far. so what are the actual drivers? is it -- i mean, how -- just let me ask another question. to what extent are easier comparisons than the weather helping to drive or are there other factors at play?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
certainly, we believe the industry is off to a good start. the weather was not favorable in january of last year. i think it may have been the warmest and wettest january in many, many years. so that's been favorable overall for the industry. stimulus happened early in this year. so there was money that came into the market. from our vantage point, we see market share data, and we like our market share data in the first part of the year.
we advertised diehard very deliberately in the fourth quarter, knowing that that's going to build into the early part of the year. and we're continuing to advertise diehard this week in a pretty significant cold snap across the country, which should drive battery failure. so we're pretty confident that the diehard advertising is resonating with our customers. it's bringing new customers into our stores, we know that. and that's going to help us drive market share and traffic beyond the first quarter. so building awareness of the advance brand is something that was very important to us. it's a key objective for us. and you're going to continue to see us focus on that.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
got it. thank you.

bret jordan with jefferies, your line is open.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
you talked about your merchandising or your supply chain initiatives around engine management and undercar. i guess, is this a shift to private label? and will you be using the diehard brand there? and if you could maybe give us some feeling for size of those two categories and the margins you might pick up with this supplier shift?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, bret. first of all, we're going to continue to have a pretty balanced approach in this area. national brands are very important to us. and we engage with our national brand suppliers routinely and are working very collaboratively with them to help build their brands. so it's a balanced approach. now there are some categories where we saw an opportunity for own brand penetration. clearly, engine management was one of them. suspension and ride control is another area of focus for us.
and we're not going to give you exact numbers, but there is a significant difference in the margin profile of those categories from a branded perspective versus own brand. and we continue to work with the suppliers. we'd obviously like to continue to sell the national brands, but where it's an obvious economic gap for us potentially due to pricing across other channels, we're going to make those decisions.
it's a gradual migration over time. this is not a light switch. you've got to gradually make these changes. but i think our merchandising team is doing an excellent job transitioning where we are making those changes across categories. and it's driving not just margin expansion, but unit growth because our customers voting with their clicks and they are voting for carquest. they love the carquest brand. it's a great brand. it's got a great reputation with installers and you're going to continue to see us grow it.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. and then you commented you picked up about 50 new carquest independents in '20. is there a particular distribution network you're picking up independents from or is it just random?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
it's definitely not random. it's a very focused approach. we've got a very wide funnel at the top and we put every one of those potential new independent partners through that funnel. but i think the ones that have decided to come to carquest are really happy with what they've decided. but it's really across a blend of various alternative banners. but the cool thing that our head of carquest independents, junior word is doing a terrific job. he and his team have done is they've engaged the independents in the journey.
we've got an independent advisory council they meet with routinely. they are part of the solution. they're helping us get better as a company. and they work very closely with them to construct their plans. and by the way, help them strengthen their technology backbone in their operations. so it's a number of things that we leverage to make those changes. but there's a lot of independent auto parts stores out there, and you're going to continue to see us grow that business.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.

elizabeth suzuki with bank of america, your line is open.
liz suzuki -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you. just how did your e-commerce mix shake out for the year in terms of what percentage of customer orders were placed online and then what the year-over-year growth was in those orders? and then just the percentage of picked up in store, buy online, pick up in store, if you could share that?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. first of all, it was quite a year on that front, liz, as you recall. there was an early surge, a massive surge in march and april, a little bit into may when people were just -- they just didn't go out and they were afraid to go into a store. we jumped on that. as you'll remember, we launched advance same day suite of fulfillment services. we offered curbside pickup. we offered same day delivery. and that enabled a surge in our e-commerce business in that timeframe. the good news is that, as time went on, those customers started to migrate into our stores. and we've been increasing -- our store traffic has been increasing since that point through the year.
the online order piece is still a substantial part of our business, but it is largely pick up in store. even though we have same day delivery, shipped to home is a relatively small part of our overall business. and that's because the customer likes to come in and get the trusted advice from our team members who've been out there throughout the global pandemic, making sure that america is on the road. we've got a terrific set of general managers out there who engage with the customers and they prefer to come into our stores and get the trusted advice they need to repair their vehicle.
liz suzuki -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
david bellinger with wolfe research, your line is open.
david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst
he, thank for taking the question. so your guidance embeds an expectation for miles driven to improve, but remain below 2019 levels. so can you walk us through how you get there? is there a way to quantify how much lower miles driven are versus 2019 levels in your forecast? and are you expecting a faster pace to recover in the northeast and mid-atlantic with overall miles in those regions to continue to lag other regions of the country?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, it was a pretty rigorous process we went through. we did our best, david, to reach out to whatever industry sources we could to get a sense for this. and i'll caveat all of this with -- this is an estimate at this point and there is a lot of uncertainty out there. but if you look at what happened last year, the year-to-date number is at the kind of october-november timeframe, which is based on the sources we have, are the most relevant or most accurate numbers that we can get. they would show the northeast and mid-atlantic down the most, as i said, like high-double-digits in that case and the southeast and southwest are down 13%, something like that and then the aggregate number is kind of in between.
so you start to lap that as you get into april-may, and we do believe that it edges back up. in other words, if you say the year is down double-digits, it's not going to get back to the level it was in 2019, but it's going to be greater than it was in 2020. that's the fundamental assumption. how much comes back, we've got an estimate in there, we're not going to put that out there. but it is improvement over 2020 as people gradually start to return to work.
we'd look at the return to office metrics, which are readily available out there. and you can see that people are gradually returning to office. now many people are talking about hybrid approaches, people are talking about remote work, but there are more people coming back to the office now than there were at the height of the pandemic. so that's really the key assumptions underlying our estimate.
david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and my follow-up on wage rate. just reminds us here, how much exposure do you have to a nationwide increase to $15 per hour? what actions have you taken over the year or so to sort of offset that? and also talking about your guidance, i believe it doesn't include any impact at this point. how much of a swing factor can this be on operating margins going forward?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, certainly, we would be impacted by a federal minimum wage. i think we would see more of an impact on the stores. so sg&a versus the gross margin or supply chain. we've invested heavily in supply chain. it's been highly competitive over the last year. and in order to be competitive, we've had to keep up with, among other things, increased wages in the dc. so it would largely be in the stores. obviously, there's a number of factors, but we're assuming wage inflation anywhere from 2% to 5%. so we're going to continue to increase wages this year with or without a federal minimum wage.
so the big factor, it really depends on a couple of things. first, obviously, it has to pass. and then how that looks in terms of how it graduates over time. is it $1 a year? what is it going to be to get to $15? so there's a number of variables there. it's clearly -- it's not in our guidance, but we're thinking about it and we're continuing to make investments. and i guess, the only other comment i would make is, it's going to be a level playing field. this is going to impact the entire industry. it's going to impact our competitors the way it's going to impact us. so we're monitoring it very closely. but to be clear, it is not baked in there that we will be paying everybody $15 an hour.
operator
your next question comes from the line of zachary fadem with wells fargo. your line is open.
zachary fadem -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for fitting me in. so last year at this time, you expected to spend about $90 million to $100 million for opex investments like it and marketing in 2020. now with the year behind us, could you talk about how much of this planned spend was completed? does any get shift to 2021? and can you walk us through any new opex investments planned this year?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
many of the opex investments are going to be similar. it's largely attracted by the capex investments that we have, whether it be it, supply chain, stores. we did not -- we came in under the guidance, largely because we had to pause those programs. so we came in under that guidance that we put out there last year. we don't anticipate that we're going to have that level going into 2021.
so it's certainly going to be south of that. and it's really just a continuation of those projects. we don't have anything new that we haven't spoken to you about other than new store opening. that's probably the only thing that's different that obviously attracts some capex and a little bit of opex. but our initiatives, our growth initiatives remain unchanged. we're laser focused on them. and those are going to continue to be the drivers for both capex and opex.
zachary fadem -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. and then assuming at least 50 new store openings this year, it looks like you are guiding sg&a per store to be down year-over-year or maybe up slightly ex the extra week. just wanted to confirm that that's accurate?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i'm sorry. the sg&a for 2020?
zachary fadem -- wells fargo -- analyst
2021 sg&a per store. what the guidance implied?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it would be down slightly.
zachary fadem -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. thanks for your time, guys.
operator
our final question comes from the line of michael baker with davidson. your line is open.
michael baker -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay, thanks. two quick ones because it's getting late. one, i appreciate that you're not guiding to covid costs specifically, but those are ongoing in the first quarter, i assume, and maybe even who knows how the vaccines roll out, but maybe into the second quarter? so is it fair to say you're not assuming that that $60 million from last year goes to zero? is that right? so you're going to save some money, but not the full $60 million. is that right? and that's what's in the guidance?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's right. it is still going to be a meaningful number in '21. it's not zero. it's not $60 million. but it's going to be a meaningful number based off what we're estimating.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, we said, mike, that we're going to prioritize the health, safety and well being of our team members and our customers, and that doesn't change. clearly, we want to build trust. and we're very excited that our team members are appreciative of everything that we've done. our org health scores are up. our turnover is down. our customers are rating us higher on net promoter scores. so we want people to feel safe coming into work and we want our customers to feel safe coming into shop. so this is something that we've got to continue doing. now over time, we do expect this to go away. we hope it goes to zero. it's just a question of when.
michael baker -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah. okay. that makes sense. one more, and i hate to ask a bigger picture question at 9:10, but hopefully, it's not too long of an answer. but it does seem perhaps that this whole industry will shift a little bit more toward diy because some of those trends you talked about, people being averse to public transportation, lots of people think those will be with us for a while, even when a vaccine rolls out. on the other hand, a lot of people will do hybrid or work from home. for those higher end, those difm customers might just drive less permanently or at least for a number of years. so have you thought about that? and how does that impact any of your ongoing strategies or anything like that if the whole world does go a little bit more toward diy versus difm versus pre-covid?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
we have. and the reality is, we agree with your statement that it doesn't go back to the way it was. i mean, that's underpinning your statement. now how far does it go back to the way it was? because it doesn't -- it's not going to -- we don't think it's going to be like it was in 2020 either, right? so it's somewhere between what we saw last year and what we saw in 2019 is the answer to the question. but the reason why we're planning on opening 50 to 100 stores is because of the reasons i said earlier, and we do believe diy is going to have some legs in the near-term for sure. and this is an opportunity for us. we've got diehard, which participates in the largest category for diy. we're advertising this brand, so we're going to continue to drive. and diy is a great business. it's a very profitable business. it's a margin accretive business, and one that we're going to continue to stay focused on.
michael baker -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
that makes perfect sense. appreciate the color. thanks.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks again for joining us this morning. we're gaining a lot of confidence regarding our initiatives. obviously, we're respecting the economic and operational landscape that we're competing in. and as increasing covid-19 vaccinations happen throughout the year, we expect the stability to continue to improve. we're looking for continued recovery for critical factors such as miles driven and further increases in the average age of the car parts.
operationally, we've narrowed and sharpened our focus on the most important initiatives to accelerate margin expansion and deliver increased value for our customers and for our shareholders. and we look forward to publishing our third sustainability and social responsibility report next month and sharing additional details on our strategic efforts at our upcoming investor event on april the 20. thanks for joining.

welcome to the advance auto parts fourth quarter conference call. before we begin, elisabeth eisleben, senior vice president, communications and investor relations will make a brief statement concerning the forward-looking statements that will be discussed on this call.
elisabeth eisleben -- senior vice president, communications and investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our q4 and full year 2020 results as well as our 2021 outlook that we highlighted in our earnings release this morning. i am joined by tom greco, our president and chief executive officer; and jeff shepherd, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.
before we begin, please be advised that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. all statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding our initiatives, plans, projection and future performance. actual results could differ materially from those projected or implied by the forward-looking statements. additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found under the caption, forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report on form 10-k and subsequent filings made with the commission.
now, let me turn the call over to tom greco.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, elizabeth, and good morning to all of you joining us today. i hope you and your families are healthy and safe amid all that we've endured over the past 12 months. here at advance, we are incredibly grateful for the way our entire team persevere. when the reality of covid-19 defended on our communities in march of 2020, we found ways across aap to meet new unfamiliar challenges with innovation and agility. i'd like to thank all of our team members as well as our independent partners for their commitment to safely serve our customers. as an essential business, their efforts have been critical to keep america moving during a time of great needs.
as you've heard from us throughout this pandemic, we remain focused on three overarching priorities. first, protect the health, safety and well being of our team members and customers. second, preserve cash and protect the p&l during the crisis. and third, prepare to be even stronger following the crisis. our results in q4 and for the full year demonstrate that our unwavering focus on these priorities has enabled meaningful progress toward our long-term goals.
from the beginning, we've invested in compensation for our frontline and distribution center team members, enhanced benefits, cleaning, personal protective equipment and innovative ways to serve our customers. this helped ensure that our team members and customers feel safe coming into work and to shop. our store and distribution center team members continuously stepped up throughout the year, and they are the true heroes for us. in spite of many obstacles for our team, we saw significant improvements in organizational health and increased engagement scores throughout the year.
fundamentally, we are building trust in the advance brand at an enduring time for the world and one that our team members and customers will always remember. we're confident our covid-19-related investments, which we believe will subside over time, are strengthening our employment brand, our customer brand and our corporate reputation for the long-term.
in q4, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 4.7% and margin expansion of 17 basis points. this includes an 82 basis point headwind related to covid-19. adjusted diluted eps improvement of 14% to $1.87, including a $0.22 headwind related to covid-19. for the full year, we delivered top-line growth resulting in record net sales of $10.1 billion. adjusted operating income improvement of 4.1% to $827.3 million, including a $60 million headwind related to covid-19. record adjusted diluted eps of $8.51, including a $0.66 headwind related to covid-19. and we also returned $515 million to shareholders through share repurchases and our continued quarterly cash dividend.
jeff will cover more on the details of our financials shortly, but first, let's review our operational performance. covid-19-related factors continued to affect channel performance in q4 across our industry. diy omnichannel led the way, as it has since q2. it's well documented that consumers are spending more of their time at home, likely contributing to the shift in discretionary spending from services to goods. given economic uncertainty and elevated unemployment, many consumers are choosing lower cost options for vehicle repairs and maintenance, benefiting our diy omnichannel business.
our professional business continued to recover with positive comp sales in both q3 and q4. miles driven remained below prior year, in particular, for higher income workers working remotely who generally take their cars to pro shops. this has limited growth in certain professional sales channels and in key categories like brakes. geographically, all of our eight regions posted positive comps in the quarter, led by our southernmost regions, including both the southeast and southwest. meanwhile, our mid-atlantic and northeast regions remained below our reported growth rate.
as previously discussed, large urban markets in these regions have been more impacted by covid-19 with the most significant decline in miles driven. the good news is that while there remains a gap between our highest and lowest performing regions that spread continues to narrow. we're cautiously optimistic this will further narrow in q1 based on improving trends and more favorable winter weather early in the year.
as we highlighted in our earnings release this morning, through the first four weeks of q1, our comp sales were trending in the low-double-digit range with strength across both diy and professional. with respect to categories, diehard is driving record battery sales and led our growth in q4. in addition, appearance chemicals remained strong, a trend that began with the stay at home orders last april.
across our professional business, our team continues to leverage our industry-leading assortment of national brands, oe parts and own brands. for pro customers, there is nothing more important than having the right part in the right place at the right time. to enable this, we continued to strengthen our dynamic assortment tool, which is now live in all our corporate stores and more than 700 independent locations that have opted in. this machine learning platform has enabled significant improvements in product availability, helping drive over 60 basis point improvement in q4 close rates.
in addition, we continued to make enhancements to our online portal, myadvance. the ease of access and wide array of resources available now includes features like virtual training, which has been essential during the pandemic. the resources we provide through our carquest and worldpac technical institutes allow our pro customers, including all technicians within those shop to attend interactive virtual training.
additionally, we continue to update our comprehensive catalog of technical service bulletins through our motologic platform. we believe pro customers are recognizing and appreciating our investments to improve parts quality, product availability, delivery speed and the digital experience, resulting in higher enterprise pro online sales and share of wallet. these actions have also enabled growth of our technet customer base with approximately 1,400 new technets added in 2020. finally, we continued increasing our carquest independent locations in 2020, welcoming 50 new stores. our independents remain a valuable component of our overall strategy and our team remains focused on further expansion.
moving on to diy omnichannel, we gained share in every region and across most categories in both q4 and for the full year based on the syndicated data available to us. we believe our share gains are the result of our focus in four areas. first, the launch of diehard. second, building awareness in regard of advance through differentiation. third, improving customer loyalty through speed perks. and fourth, improving store execution.
starting with diehard, despite the challenges of the pandemic, our team successfully launched diehard as planned and executed a marketing plan unlike anything we've ever done before at aap. our diehard is back campaign, featuring bruce willis, let consumers know that the iconic diehard brand was back and they can now buy diehard at advance and carquest. this campaign is already improving top of mind and unaided awareness for diehard.
our speed perks program is an important tool to drive customer loyalty. our team continues to invest in personalization for speed perks members, driving higher engagement, long-term loyalty and increased share of wallet. in 2020, we grew our vip members, those with an annual spend of $250 to $500 by nearly 15%. and our elite members, those with annual spend of more than $500 by more than 20%.
to wrap up the discussion on diy omnichannel, we continue to see improvement from our initiatives, including our net promoter scores. this gives us confidence that we're on the right track to sustained sales and share momentum in 2021.
moving on to an update of our four pillars of margin expansion, i'll begin with sales and profit per store. as a reminder, following three consecutive years of declining sales per store, we finished 2017 at approximately $1.5 million per store. over the last three years, we've been optimizing our footprint, including the closure of 273 underperforming stores. our sales per store have now grown for three consecutive years. and we finished 2020 at nearly $1.7 million per store.
we're also executing a focused agenda to leverage payroll, while reducing shrink, returns and the factors to drive four wall profit per store improvement. in addition, the ongoing focus on team members is enabling us to attract the very best parts people and to reduce turnover. our team members are a differentiator for advance. and four years ago, we made a commitment to dramatically improve retention. continued investment in our unique fuel the frontline program with more than 22,000 stock grants awarded since inception is creating an ownership culture.
in the current environment, with an increased competition for talent, we are reducing store turnover and enhancing our employment brand. we now have three straight years of comp sales growth and the closure of underperforming stores behind us. we're excited to announce that we plan to expand our store base and geographic footprint this year and expect to open 50 to 100 new stores.
our second margin expansion pillar is supply chain. while we paused our cross banner replenishment and warehouse management system initiatives early in 2020, our team found ways to innovate and make progress on these productivity opportunity later in the year. the expansion of cross banner replenishment is on track with the timing we communicated in november. as we finished the year with just over 40% of the originally planned stores completed, we are on track to complete the originally planned stores and dcs by the end of q3 2021 and the full run rate savings will come beginning in q4 2021. in addition, the implementation of our new warehouse management system or wms continued in q4. we converted our fourth dc by year end as planned and we're on track to complete our largest buildings this year. we believe we can capture roughly 75% of the savings from this initiative in 2022.
moving on to category management, the expansion of our own brand assortment is a key component. this includes an increase of carquest-branded assortment in engine management and undercar. carquest has an excellent reputation with installers and new products have been very well received by both pro customers and carquest independents. in 2020, we also launched our strategic pricing initiative to enhance our capabilities, while incorporating customer decision journey insights into price and discount decision making.
finally, our fourth pillar of margin expansion involves reducing and better leveraging sg&a. the successful execution of our field restructure, back office consolidations and safety initiatives benefited sg&a in the quarter and will enable further improvement in margin expansion going forward. as we called out in november, sg&a was elevated in q4, primarily due to covid-19-related expenses and other factors that jeff will detail shortly.
to summarize, we're now in execution mode on our key growth and margin expansion initiatives. our mission is passion for customers passion for yes. with the goal of serving them with care and speed, we've made many necessary changes at aap in recent years. but one thing that has not changed is the current technology, the passion and the commitment of our team members and independent partners. our actions have strengthened advance, enabling us to compete more vigorously. finally, we're very excited to share our third sustainability and social responsibility report next month, and we'll be providing a strategic update of our long-term plans on april 20.
with that, i'll pass the call to jeff to discuss our financial results in greater detail as well as our 2021 guidance.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, tom, and good morning. i too would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to all our team members for the extraordinary focus and effort throughout 2020 despite the unprecedented times. our entire team adjusted, adapted and continued to execute our priorities. in q4, our net sales of $2.4 billion increased 12%. adjusted gross profit margin expanded 192 basis points to 45.9%. driven primarily by inventory-related items, cost and price improvements as well as supply chain leverage. as our primary focus throughout the year was on the health and safety of our team members and customers, we temporarily paused our physical inventory counts earlier this year. when we resumed these in q4, our actual shrink rates were far better than we had anticipated. this resulted in a benefit in inventory-related costs due to a reduction in the reserve to reflect the positive result.
lifo-related impacts were a tailwind this quarter versus prior year. this will be the last quarter we included lifo impacts in our adjusted financial results as we will begin reporting in q1 2021 excluding any benefits or expenses from lifo and our adjusted financial measures. we believe this adjustment creates a more accurate picture of our operational results and is more in line with industry practices.
our q4 adjusted sg&a expense was $913.5 million. on a rate basis, this represented 38.6% of net sales compared to 36.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019. the single biggest driver of this increase was $19 million in covid-related costs directly attributable to the unanticipated spike in case rates. we also incurred higher q4 medical claims as a result of lower claims during the prior quarters. in addition, our short-term incentive compensation for both field and corporate team members was higher than prior year.
separately, we invested behind the launch of the diehard is back campaign. we also incurred lease termination costs related to the ongoing optimization of our real estate footprint. we believe these expected investments in diehard and lease optimization will result in top and bottom line improvements. despite higher sg&a expenses, adjusted operating income increased 14.6% in q4 to $171.8 million. on a rate basis, our adjusted oi margin expanded by 17 basis points.
finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.87, up 14% from prior year despite a $0.22 impact in the quarter from covid expenses. for the full year, which includes an additional week versus 2019, we delivered record net sales of $10.1 billion, which increased 4.1%. the 53rd, added approximately $158 million to sales. our adjusted gross profit increased 5% year-over-year and adjusted gross profit margin expanded 38 basis points.
adjusted sg&a expense for full year 2020 increased 5.2% from 2019 results. this was primarily the result of covid-related expenses discussed earlier as well as the 53rd week. we estimate the additional week resulted in a headwind of approximately 1.5% to our sg&a costs in the year. our adjusted operating income increased 4.1% to $827.3 million. and our oi margins was 8.2%, flat compared to prior year.
adjusting for the $60 million in covid costs, our adjusted operating income margin expanded 59 basis points. our full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.51, which is a new record for advance and includes a headwind of $0.66 related to covid costs. we estimate the impact of the 53rd week was a tailwind from approximately $20 million to adjusted operating income and a benefit of approximately $0.23 to our reported adjusted eps for the year.
our capital expenditures in q4 was $75 million for a total investment of $268 million for the year and in line with our previously stated expectations. as we've noted, some of the critical transformation investments we expected to make in 2020 will pause for a portion of the year. as a result, we expect our capital spending will increase this year compared to 2020.
our free cash flow for the year was a record $702 million compared to $597 million in 2019. this increase was driven by several factors, including efforts we have made to improve working capital. we made meaningful progress on our ap ratio in 2020, delivered 300 basis points of improve and ended the year at 80.2%. this in addition to a $76 million tailwind associated with the cares act resulted in a significant improvement in our cash conversion cycle.
our strong cash flow generation allowed us to continue our share repurchase activity in q4. for the year, we repurchased more than $458 million of advance stock. and including our quarterly cash dividend, we returned $515 million to shareholders. our team remains disciplined throughout 2020 to ensure adequate liquidity, protect the p&l during the pandemic and strengthen our balance sheet, which resulted in meaningful improvement in our cash position, resulting in $835 million in cash on hand at year end. further demonstrating our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and commitment to return cash to shareholders in a balanced approach utilizing both share repurchases and dividends, our board recently approved a continued payment of our quarterly cash dividend.
turning to 2021. while uncertainty remains in the current environment, we believe that we can continue to carry the momentum we have seen in the back half of 2020 forward. as the economy continues to recover and with our planned new store openings, we expect to deliver increased net sales and additional margin expansion. importantly, we expect miles driven to continue improving throughout 2021, which should enable year-over-year growth in our pro business.
we're encouraged by trends through the first four weeks of 2021. with strength across our diy omnichannel and pro business, we delivered double-digit comparable sales growth to start the year. we recognized the importance of transparency. and based on what we know today, this morning we introduced our 2021 outlook. despite continued uncertainty, we're pleased to provide our 2021 guidance. based on the assumptions we outlined in our earnings release, our 2021 guidance includes net sales in the range of $10.1 billion to $10.3 billion. comparable store sales growth of 1% to 3%. adjusted operating income margin rate of 8.7% to 8.9%, which includes margin expansion of 60 to 80 basis points. that's compared to the 2020 adjusted operating income margin excluding the $20.1 million benefit from the 53rd week. income tax rate of 24% to 26%. capital expenditures of $275 million to $325 million. and a minimum of $600 million of free cash flow.
finally, as tom mentioned, following several years of closing underperforming stores and focusing on the improvement of operations across our footprint, we're excited to being actively growing our store base and expanding existing and new geographies. for the first time in four years, we're guiding to new store openings of 50 to 100 locations. i once again would like to thank the tremendous efforts of our team members in meeting the challenges of covid-19, while still executing our strategic plan. we look forward to sharing more on those plans in the investor presentation we'll publish in april.

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question here comes from the line of christopher horvers from j.p. morgan. please go ahead. your line is now open.
christopher horvers -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everybody. so, a couple of questions here on the top line. overall, in 1q, did pro outperformed diy? and can you talk about how those two channels look on a quarter-to-date basis, i.e., is sort of diy still positive? and then more broadly, on a quarterly basis, how are you thinking about cadence of comps for the balance of the year?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, chris. so, first of all, on the first quarter, diy outperformed pro. and as we outlined in the prepared remarks, it was really early in the quarter continuation of what we've seen all of last year, strong performance from diy [technical issues]. and then obviously as we got toward the end of the quarter that started to change. and this is the beginning to lap the unusual events of last year. clearly, april and may was the low point for professional sales last year when the pandemic hit and work remote orders were put in place, and you really saw a difficult environment for the installer community. and i'm really proud of what we did at that point. i mean, we stayed with it. we supported our pro installers. we didn't have anybody furloughed or anything like that. people are out on the street, helping them out. and that's really helped us through late in the year last year and into this year. and so now as we start to lap those results, pro is significantly outperforming diy, and we expect that to continue for the balance of this year. so, we're very excited about that, obviously, given the 60% of our business is pro.
and then in terms of the cadence, we're obviously early on in the year. we know there was a huge surge on diy in 2020. we talked about that throughout the year last year. there are some trends that some of which could be stickier than we initially thought when we planned the year. people have time on their hands. there was the stimulus impact last year. there was a shift from big box. how is it all going to unfold for the balance of the year is difficult to say. but clearly, we are off to a good start in q2, and we'll keep monitoring it as the year goes on.
christopher horvers -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then as a follow-up, jeff, can you talk about what the unfavorable inventory costs are? and do you expect that to continue? and more broadly, what are you seeing in the pricing environment from your peers? are cost being passed through at this point, or is there pressure on having to hold back? thank you.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. first on the inventory related, that's really the capitalized supply chain costs. and we had a really interesting phenomenon this quarter that we typically don't have in previous quarters where our inventory was down substantially over $60 million in the first quarter. and when we do that, we recognize the capitalized supply chain costs that are associated with that sitting on the balance sheet. if you contrast that to last year or even 2019, it's generally an inventory build. we're building inventory in the first quarter as we prepare for the spring selling season. in 2020, inventory was up over $90 million. and if you want to go back to 2019, that's up over $70 million. now, the good news, chris, is that translates into very favorable free cash flow, which you saw in terms of the good operating cash over 300 -- almost $330 million in operating cash, $259 million of free cash flow. so, realizing that it is very favorable for our cash balance.
in terms of pricing, we took a number of pricing actions during the end of last year, beginning of this year. we're seeing it flow through. we haven't seen any resistance there from a pricing standpoint, so we feel really good about that. we know there some inflationary factors that are coming, and we're planning to address those. but for the quarter, our pricing actions took hold and we were really pleased with the results.
christopher horvers -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks, guys. best of luck.

your next question comes from the line of michael lasser from ubs. please go ahead. your line is now open.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
good morning. thanks a lot for taking my question. on the capitalized inventory cost, have you been able to clean up some of your inventory? so, this is going to be less of a factor moving forward and could actually put the bias [phonetic] to the upside for some of your long-term gross margin expectation?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. over time we will see improvement. i wouldn't expect it this year. i think we're going to continue to see this over the course of the year. it's an area that's going to be a little bit fluid, which -- part of the reason we didn't change guidance associated with free cash flow is our inventory levels are down significantly compared to the end of last year. so we want to make sure we have the in-stock availabilities, the most important thing in this industry, making sure we've got the right part at the right place at the right time. and -- so we're looking at our in-stocks across the organization, making sure that this inventory is forward deployed. so, there is really going to be some puts and takes throughout the year. but over time, michael, to your point, we do think those costs will come down as we take overall cost out of the supply chain.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
okay. my follow-up question is, do you expect that we're going to see greater spread of your outperformance versus the industry in the back half of the year, given your lean toward the difm segment and the northeast, which has underperformed? and if difm outperform for you in the back half of the year, how is that going to impact your gross margin, given the relative margin differential of those two segments? thanks so much.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. good morning, michael. i'll comment first on your previous question. i think the one thing i would add on the inventory is we're going to see a bit of an uneven recovery across the country. we're seeing it now. geographically, we're seeing it differently -- played out differently by category. we're seeing it played out differently. so, we're obviously making some bets on inventory to make sure that we're able to delight the customer when they need us.
in terms of the performance in the back half, yes, i mean, we are a professional organization, with 60% of our business in there. we definitely would see us continuing to benefit from that trend in the back half of the year overall. geographically, absolutely, we called out in our remarks that the northeast was leading the country quarter-to-date, we haven't seen that in over a year. so those are two big factors that help us out. and, obviously, we're excited about both of those trends. we've got multiple banners on the professional side that are all cranking right now. our installers are covered up. we've got cars waiting out there to be repaired. people are getting back on the road. miles driven are recovering. so, all of those things are very positive. and we fully contemplated the impact on gross margin. we, obviously, recognized that the pro margins are lower than that of diy, and that's fully contemplated in the guide. so, we'll continue to focus on expanding our margins with the initiatives we outlined in april.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
okay. thank you so much, and good luck.
operator
your next question comes from the line of simeon gutman from morgan stanley. please go ahead. your line is now open.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, everyone. good morning. my first question is on the guidance raise. can you talk about what you flowed through? it seems like there is the first quarter upside, maybe some incremental on the second quarter. and then did anything change with regard to the back half of the year?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. there's really four things that we were contemplating when we were taking another look at the guide. obviously, it's a very fluid situation, given that this is the second time we've raised our guidance in the last 45 days. but the first is really what tom mentioned, is really getting a better understanding of that shift from diy to pro. that's number one. the second and third is exactly what you just mentioned, simeon, which is the clarity we have on q1 in terms of the beat, beat coming in at 9% versus 8.5% to 8.7%, that's modeled in. and then the upside that we're seeing early on in q2, we modeled some of that.
and then the last one that i would throw in there is our assessment around inflation. we're seeing inflation in a number of different categories. and so while that would benefit the top line in the form of higher comps, we wouldn't see that flow through as much as we generally we and the industry price to maintain margin rate. so those are the four things that we contemplated that were quite, frankly, different 45 days ago, and why we thought it was prudent to update guidance now.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then different topic, maybe for tom. this is going back to margin opportunity over the next few years, and it seems like a lot of these initiatives or these transformations are starting to take hold. my question is the dependence on sales to drive margin is something we've talked about in the past. do you feel better -- i don't think you'd be satisfied if sales aren't growing and i think that's the ultimate essence of transforming the business. but can you talk about how dependent your margin goals are on sales? is there some portion of margin that you think this business can achieve without seeing consistent sales growth? and again, i'm not saying that's the goal, but curious if you can separate the two.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, the four territories that we talked about, simeon, really the one that is most sales dependent is obviously sales and profit per store. there is a leverage component to that in our outlook. i mean, we talked about 240 basis points to 440 basis points of margin expansion, and the range of revenue growth that was contemplated was 3% on the low end and 6% on the high end, if you remember. so obviously, the one that swings the most is that particular one. now, there are pure cost out initiatives in there without question, return, shrink, defectives. we've got ways of improving profit per store without sales, but that is the one that has a dependency there.
supply chain, the vast majority of the supply chain initiatives are not sales dependent. these are just pure productivity opportunities. you're familiar with the cross-banner and warehouse management system implementation, but also the two new ones that reuben outlined in the april presentation, neither of those are sales dependent. those are just improving our current efficiency and how we get product from distribution centers to the stores and how we move product in market.
category management is a pure rate play. there is really no sales dependency on category management. and then, obviously, the sg&a moves -- the erp implementation and new ways of working, those are all -- none of those are sales dependent. so, the majority of the initiatives we have are not sales dependent. obviously, the more sales we have, the more we get not just leverage on those that are contemplated in the initial low end of the guide, the 220 basis points, but we get leverage on other fixed costs, which takes us up to the 440 basis points. hope that helps?
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of kate mcshane from goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is now open.
kate mcshane -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. thanks for taking my question. i was curious about the news with regards to the pacific northwest. i wonder if you could remind us of your exposure to the region before the new stores and what the opportunity is for expansion there? and then in the same vein, in terms of geography, i know you're in the process with the pep boys stores converting them and they're opening in 2022, but is there a timeframe in 2022 when they'll all be open?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, kate. first of all, we have limited exposure on the west coast, is the short answer. and this is a huge opportunity for us. essentially, we've been working at strengthening our core value proposition here for several years now as you know. and the investments we've made in that value proposition are now yielding comp sales performance at the kind of levels that we aspire to from the beginning. we've had three straight years of comp sales growth and we would say we've earned the right to expand and [technical issues] proposition elsewhere.
you think about bringing the work we've done on availability, making sure that our industry leading assortment of parts is available to people in portland, just like it is in boston. bringing diehard to the west coast is a huge opportunity for us. our team was on the ground the week we announced the pep boys leasing arrangements, and the first thing people talked about in the stores when we went out there was diehard. they were very excited to hear that they would be selling diehard batteries. all the digital investments that we've made in our online platform, whether that's the b2b website that bob cushing leads with advance pro, the b2c website that jason leads, and our app, we bring that to these markets. we're able to supplement our pro customers who are out there today, our large professional customers that we sell to nationally, but cannot sell to in those geographies, because we don't have the presence to do so. so, we're able to integrate the digital and physical asset piece. so, we're very excited about the announcement with baxter. they are a terrific organization. they've got tremendous track record. and they're very excited about converting to the carquest banner here soon.
and then in terms of southern california, as we -- as you heard, we have 109 locations. we're going to start converting those soon. and we expect to complete that in 2022. so that's really a quick rundown of what we're doing out there. and i got to tell you, our team is so excited about being able to open new stores after a couple of years where we were closing them, and clearly, that's something that brings a new energy to the organization overall.

your next question comes from the line of greg melich from evercore isi. please go ahead. your line is now open.
greg melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. thanks. i only had, i guess, two follow-ups. one was on the two-year stack trend of 15%, how -- could you break that down to diy and pro? i assume that on a two-year, diy is still outperforming pro, and do you think that's going to flip in the second quarter?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
first of all, yes, diy is still outperforming pro on a two-year. the expectation is that that will start to moderate, obviously, greg, as we go through it. i mean, the peak of the diy surge, if you will, was kind of right now, right through the end of july. and through the end of the year, it didn't stay at these levels that we're about to see year-over-year, june and july, just to be clear. the full year number through the syndicated data that we can see is 6.6%. so, there is quite a variation in the categories within diy. those categories that rely on miles driven, they didn't do that well even inside of diy. i mean, better than historical obviously, but nothing compared to batteries, where intermittent driving causes failure. so, we expect pro to outperform. i think, as we get toward q3 and q4, you'll see those two-year stack start to come closer together. but, in general, the diy business tends to be a little bit more volatile as you know.
greg melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
sure. but the gap is still like a 1,000 basis points on a two-year, would that be fair?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
it's -- we haven't broken it out. it's -- i think it's still a pretty significant two-year gap.
greg melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, great. and then second was on inflation. i know we asked in multiple ways, but i just want to make sure i got it right. the comp guide increase was a lot of inflation, or at least that was a chunk of it versus a few [technical issues]. is -- how should we think about that as a holistic number? i think when we had the china tariffs few years back, it got up to around 3%, then maybe it was 1% last year. we -- are we back at sort of a 3% number, or is still more in between 1% and 3%?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, when we put out our original guidance in february, we had contemplated a inflation range of, call it, 1% to 2%. and as we're seeing some of the inflation coming in, whether it's the product cost, freight or labor, we're modeling an additional 1% to 2%. so you can take the 3% as the midpoint, and that sort of the way we're thinking about it right now.
greg melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
and that's for calendar '22 run rate going forward...
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah.
greg melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
i mean, calendar '21?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
for '21, yeah.
greg melich -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, great. thanks a lot, and good luck, guys.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

your next question comes from the line of bret jordan from jefferies. please go ahead. your line is now open.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
a question, i guess, on supply chain, it does sound like we've got some, i guess, disruption around availability whether it's shipping or materials or labor. how are you seeing in-stocks? and when you think about the cadence of supply chain disruption, are we on the sort of an improving trend as far as availability of inventory or are we still sort of challenged there?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. for sure, bret, we have seen some slippage on in-stocks unfortunately. the peak of the -- let's say, more global impact of disruption was probably two months ago. so, we're not necessarily seeing what we saw two months ago, but we're still seeing some suppliers, and it's not necessarily that they're not trying to get us the product. they just can't -- they can't load a container or something like that in their location. they can't get people. you're familiar with the shortage of labor. so it's things like that that are causing the disruption. we're gradually picking it back up. i think we're very thankful our suppliers have really done everything they can to keep us in stock. we feel like we're well positioned competitively. we don't think this is a competitive disadvantage at all. if anything, we've got an advantage relative to some of our peers in the -- some of the key competitors in the professional side of the business. but it's definitely improving. and we're continuing to work closely with our suppliers to close any gaps.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. great. and then one question. can't leave without mentioning price investment. i guess when you think about the cadence or the performance of the pro business, are you seeing any outperformance versus a national accounts versus the independents? and do you see any level -- change in level of competition from peers relative to those pro accounts?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
we are seeing a huge surge in pro, in general, ok. so there is strength across all of the professional sales channels. and some of the strategic accounts last year, i would say, took a little bit more drastic actions at this point in time than some of the independents, and that's contributing to the lap being a little bit lighter, i guess, on that side of the house. so, we are seeing a surge there. but we work really closely with our strategic, bret, as you know, they are very important to us. we continue to see them growing in importance, and we make sure we're taking care of them, and we're going to continue to do that. but i do think as we look to the balance of the year, some of those strategic accounts that took some pretty significant actions last year could outperform.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. great. thank you.

zachary fadem -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, good morning. i just wanted to clarify some of the moving parts on the outlook. it looks like the higher end of the 4% comps on the prior outlook is now the low end. but if you look at the ebit margin on the 4% comp, down from 9.1% to 9%. i'm hoping you can walk through the change in flows through assumption here in a little bit more detail in terms of whether this is more the pro mix and inflation factors you mentioned, or is there any offsetting sg&a component as well?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, it's exactly what you just said. it's really given us some better color on the shift from diy to professional, which, as you know, carries an overall lower margin. and in addition to that, it really is a better understanding of what we were just talking about, which is the inflation. and we believe we know through past experience that we've been able to maintain rate, but we're not going to improve rate through pricing. so, we feel that those two items while it gives you a good top line, it doesn't necessarily translate to the bottom line. we just have better insight into that. in addition to that, we are cognizant of the potential for consumers to shift into more value categories. so, that was a factor we considered as well. now, if those things go the other way, we're not going to be near the low end or meet closer to the high end, but those are the types of things that we consider when we took another look at the guidance.
zachary fadem -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. so just to make sure i understand, you're sizing all of those factors as about 10 basis points, correct?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. yes.
zachary fadem -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. perfect. and then in terms of the restructuring costs, can you talk a little bit more about what drove the step up here in q1, and what you're now embedding going forward for the year?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. the q1 was simply a function of the voluntary retirement program that we talked about during our investor day, that -- actually, our non-gaap or below the line number would have been lower had it not been for that. and then, we expect it to be consistent with last year going forward.
zachary fadem -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. appreciate the time.

your next question comes from the line of brian nagel from oppenheimer. please go ahead. your line is now open.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
hi, good morning.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
i've got a couple of questions. i'll kind of also merging them together, and then -- first, i know we've talked about inflation already, but clearly, inflation has become more of a factor in your business, in your sector broadly. as you look at the data, as you understand your consumer, is there a point at which the consumer sort of say pushes back and the ability of advance to pass these costs along is no longer a significant or no longer, i guess, relevant?
and then the second question i have, with regard to the updated outlook here, and clearly, it's extraordinarily fluid, a lot of factors, but as you think about this, what could be the bigger surprise factor to the upside or downside? toward end of the year in the guide and the result were different than what you expected, where would that variance you think likely come from?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. first of all, in terms of what point could inflation or pricing actions start to impact consumption, i think, is your question, brian, right?
brian nagel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
that's correct.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, we really measure that by customer journey, if you will. if you look at a battery failure, as an example, my car won't start as compared to my breaks are squeaking as compared to i would like to accessorize my car or something like that. there's obviously different elements there of whether or not, somebody is going to defer anything. the reality is on failure related items, it's unlikely that it's going to have a big impact. it is certainly hasn't had a big impact historically. and as long as we're competitive, we'll continue to see growth there. there may be some things that end up getting deferred based on the job type, but in general, this industry has been incredibly resilient at being able to pass on pricing, and i think that's what you're going to continue to see.
second question was on the outlook. i think, the short answer is we've obviously contemplated some level of pricing in the outlook. we've also contemplated how much of that's going to flow through all of the variables there. if the pricing flows through at what we've -- we've guided, we'll obviously be right there in the guide. if it's better than that, we'll be better. that's really the answer. it's -- that's probably the biggest variable that's out there, all the rest of the stuff is fully within our control. but to your point on the consumer receptiveness to pricing, we'll see.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
got it. i appreciate. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of daniel imbro from stephens inc. please go ahead. your line is now open.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yeah. good morning, guys. thanks for taking my question. tom, i want to start on the gross margin line. you mentioned continued success graduating loyalty tiers, moving customers up. can you talk about the gross margin implication from that graduation? will it be a headwind due to higher kind of earned customer rewards as we move through the year? and is that potentially another headwind as we move through the year and think about the gross margin trajectory?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, first of all, our speed perks platform, which is our loyalty program, is extremely important for us. we think we've got tremendous runway. we're still transacting in the mid-30%s range. and best-in-class would say that number could be dramatically higher than that. there are some retailers that are north of 80%. so, it's a platform that we're going to use to personalize our offer, and use first-party data to get much more relevant with how we engage our customers. obviously, we do have discounts in there, but we managed that holistically. we managed that across the broader portfolio. and as people migrate up to these higher levels, that's fully contemplated in what discounts we use and how we offer value to those customers.
so, we won't see any kind of degradation on gross margin as we migrate people up to these higher tiers. what we will see is higher share of wallet, which is what the aspiration is, so that we can move from like in the case of vips, you're significantly under-penetrated in -- with your most loyal customers. so, you want to increase that share of wallet pretty significantly. and that first-party data that we get from them enables us to get much more relevant. we know their vehicle, we know their weather patterns in their geography, we know their driving patterns, that allows us to personalize.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
helpful. and then you mentioned also marketing being a focus for your own brands and the growth we've seen there. obviously, it's been higher given the diehard rollout. that should presumably moderate from here given diehard getting more known? i guess, one, is that a correct assumption on marketing expense? and then secondly, as industry demand does slow from these higher levels, do you think increased marketing will be needed or increased promotions will be needed to keep those sales rates up? or how do you think the industry responds from a marketing or promotion expense -- promotional outlook as comps slow? thanks.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, let me distinguish between those two, because i see them very differently. promotions or pricing is very easy to replicate, right. somebody drops their price, somebody else drop their price. i mean it's -- we measure our competitive price index literally every day. so, we're looking at what's going on inside of our industry and we have algorithms that help us determine how we're going to price with category and with geography and those kinds of things.
marketing is an investment. i mean, marketing is an investment in driving margin expansion. when we invest behind a diehard marketing campaign as we did last fall and in the first quarter, the intention there is to build loyalty, to build equity in the diehard brand, to build awareness of the fact that diehard is available at advance auto parts. and when we do that what we find is we actually are able to reduce our promotional discounting and build the strength of that brand because it's trusted by the customer. so, they're very different. and one of them is relatively easy to replicate, the other one is more difficult to replicate. and that's -- we will invest in marketing when we get a return that expands margins. that's the focus of our marketing dollars.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
that's helpful. best of luck, tom.

your next question comes from the line of david bellinger from wolfe research. please go ahead. your line is now open.
david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. great. thanks for taking the question. so, you and your larger competitors have all gained a significant amount of market share over the past, say, 18 months. so my question is what would really change that? is there anything you're currently monitoring within the marketplace? or is it simply just the new dynamic we're in and the payoff from all the investment spending over the past few years? maybe just talk about the sustainability of these elevated share gains as well?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think it's a pretty unique time, david. i mean, obviously, we talked about this in our april presentation that this is a very fragmented market, particularly on the professional side. and right or wrong, last year was a highly disruptive time for, well, everything, but certainly our industry. and at the time, if you think back to the second quarter, a lot of companies took some pretty drastic actions with their workforce and how they approach the pandemic, and we stayed with it. we stayed with it. we had people on the street, as i mentioned earlier. we had our training programs. our people put on a mask every single day, and went out there and served our customers. and being an enduring time for the world, i mean, i think those pro installers have remembered that. and so i do think that it's conceivable that the larger players who behaved in that manner could see share gains, outsized share performance for a period of time as a result of that. and when the larger players are a fairly small slice of the overall pie, and we have scale, we have parts availability, we've got great brands, we think that we can continue to show outsized performance relative to the industry for a period of time.
david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. it's a fair point. and i just wanted to follow up, so you talked a lot about private label, can you size the potential for your owned brands and maybe as a percentage of sales of what that could go to over time? and how do you balance that opportunity with your core consumer and pro, who place a lot of value on branded oem parts? just help us bridge that gap.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, two things. first of all, let me start with the fact that now our national brand suppliers are extremely important for us. and they play a key role in our assortment and our availability. we have the largest number of stock parts in market of anyone in the industry. terrific relationships with our national brand partners, terrific relationships with the oe suppliers that we have out there. so that gives us a competitive advantage. and we are going to continue to offer those brands where it makes sense for our business. this is about choice, not necessarily about, an either or, it's bit of an and.
so, that said, where we have a category where we can bring the carquest trademark into that category, offer it to our customers with very, very high quality, and i want to really emphasize that. our carquest parts are oe quality. it's got a tremendous reputation. the carquest brand has been around for a very long time. the professional installers love the carquest brand and our merchant team goes out and works very closely with our suppliers to make sure when we put the carquest name on that box, it's going to be oe quality. so we offer that. if the customer chooses on the lookup that they want carquest, they choose carquest, great. if they choose the national brand, they choose the national brand.
now having said that, as we brought strength to some of these categories with carquest, we are seeing our customers choose carquest, which -- back to your initial question, we are roughly -- we think we're about 10 points under penetrated versus our potential. and while we won't get there in the next three years, 2023 is obviously the strategic plan timeline we outlined in april, it's a pretty significant number in the 200 basis points of margin expansion we expect from category management. so, that's fully contemplated. and as we rollout all the skus, we'll be in great shape to capture that margin opportunity.
david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you, tom. much appreciated.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of seth basham from wedbush securities. please go ahead. your line is now open.
seth basham -- wedbush securities -- analyst
thanks a lot, and good morning. tom, if you could remind us what you see as the biggest contributors to margins improving on underlying basis this year and which ones you have the most confidence in, that would be great.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, i think we've said previously that gross margin is going to be the bigger contributor on a full year basis, very confidence in the category management initiatives. we'll leverage supply chain. there is obviously some things with supply chain this year, we are seeing some wage inflation on supply chain that we didn't plan if you go back to last fall. but we still believe we've got an opportunity to leverage supply chain based on the initiatives that we have there.
as you go into sg&a, i mean we're going to execute the initiatives we have, seth, so we've already done the restructure. and i think the restructure -- just to be clear, it wasn't just the cost play. we've been able to really organize our corporate team around the highest value priorities. we streamlined and simplified the work. we've given more responsibility to the top people in this company. and yes, we say what we outlined in the april meeting about $30 million, which will realize over the next 12 months. so, that's a aaa bond, we'll get that. there are some offsets though inside of sg&a this year as you know that we're -- that will minimize that benefit, i guess, that we're getting out of sg&a. but that's a quick run through. more from gross margin, not as much from sg&a.
seth basham -- wedbush securities -- analyst
got it. thanks. so, it seems like there is a high degree of visibility for margin improvement this year and really over the next couple of years, of course, depending on the sales outlook. is that an appropriate assessment?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yes, absolutely.
seth basham -- wedbush securities -- analyst
thank you.

and there are no further questions. i will turn the call back over to tom greco for closing comments.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. and as you've heard, we're incredibly proud of how the aap team continues to execute against our long-term priorities while serving the customer every day with care and speed. we're very confident in the strategic plan we outlined in april, and importantly, in the team we have here at aap to deliver growth above the market, to capitalize on the unique margin expansion opportunity and to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders, which over the next few years is going to enable us to achieve top quartile total shareholder returns.
before we let you to go, having just celebrated memorial day this week, i'd like to take a moment and recognize and honor all the brave men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice defending our country. on behalf of the entire advance family, i'd like to express our sincere gratitude for their service and all they've done defending our freedom.
i hope that you all continue to be healthy and safe, and we look forward to speaking with you again in august.

welcome to the advance auto parts first quarter 2021 conference call.
before we begin, elisabeth eisleben, senior vice president, communications and investor relations will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be discussed on this call. please go ahead.
elisabeth eisleben -- senior vice president, communications and investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our q1 2020 results that we highlighted in our earnings release this morning.
i'm joined by tom greco, our president and chief executive officer; and jeff shepherd, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. following their prepared remarks, we'll turn our attention to answering your questions.

now, let me turn the call over to tom greco.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, elisabeth, and good morning.
first, i'd like to thank our independent partners and team members all over the world for their passion and commitment to serve our customers throughout the pandemic. we also hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. the health and safety of our team members and customers has been a top priority over the past year.
as you saw earlier this morning, our final q1 financial performance exceeded the estimated results we provided on april 20th. with strength across all channels, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 24.7%, and margin expansion of 478 basis points versus the prior year. on a two-year stack, our comp sales growth was 15.4%. adjusted diluted eps of $3.34 represented an all-time quarterly high for aap, and improved more than 230% compared to q1 2020. free cash flow of $259 million was up significantly versus the prior year, and we returned over $203 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and our quarterly cash dividend. in addition, we recently announced an updated capital allocation framework targeting top quartile total shareholder return, highlighted by operating income growth, share repurchases and an increase in our dividend. this further reinforces our confidence in future cash generation and our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.
as outlined in april, we are building an ownership culture, as well as a differentiated operating model at advance. over the past few years, we've made substantial investments in our brands, our digital and physical assets, and our team. these investments, along with external factors, enabled us to post a strong start to 2021. clearly, the federal stimulus package, along with our first real winter weather in three years, was a benefit to our industry.
from a category perspective, net sales growth was led by batteries, appearance chemicals and wipers. geographically, all eight regions posted over 20% growth. importantly, over the past year, the northeast, our largest region, had been below our overall reported growth rate and well below that of our top-performing regions. in q1, the gap narrowed, and in recent weeks, the northeast has been leading our growth. this was in line with our expectations as mobility is increasing in large urban markets in the northeast, which were disproportionately impacted by covid-19 last year.
both diy omnichannel and professional performed well, delivering double-digit comp sales growth in the quarter. we saw strong increases versus year ago with a double-digit increase in transactions and high single-digit increases in dollars per transaction in both channels. in terms of cadence, diy led the way early in q1. as the country began to reopen later in the quarter, professional came on strong, resulting in pro growth of over 20% in q1, with continued momentum into q2. the changes in channel performance highlights the importance of flexibility in our operating model, as we adapt to rapid shifts in consumer behavior relative to 2020.
throughout aap, our merchant, supply chain and store operations teams have been extremely agile in adjusting to this evolving environment to ensure we take care of our customers. within the pro sales channel, our overarching focus remains to get the right part in the right place at the right time. this enables us to compete on availability, customer service and speed of fulfillment, which are the primary drivers of choice for pro-verizers [phonetic]. to achieve these goals, we continued to strengthen our value proposition through improved availability as well as our advance pro catalog featuring tools like motologic and delivery estimates [phonetic].
as vaccinations rollout across the country, mobility is increasing across all income strata. as discussed in april, this is very good for aap, as our diverse set of assets within pro is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this trend. specifically, worldpac led our professional growth in the quarter. with the customer base that serves higher end installers and more premium vehicles, worldpac gained momentum throughout q1. this is because, middle to high income motorists are becoming increasingly mobile, and in some cases, they are now returning to a daily commute. saying it simply, they're driving more than they did a year ago. secondly, we're seeing benefits from the own brand product offering expansion with the integration of autopart international.
further, we believe our independent carquest stores are also well positioned. they're leveraging our enterprise assortment and have excellent relationships with customers. these relationships have been strengthened over the past year, given the support we provided to both independents and our pro customers during a difficult time. we continue to grow our independent store base through a combination of greenfield locations and the conversion of existing independent location. today, we're extremely excited to announce that we're adding 29 new independent locations to the pacific northwest to the carquest family, the single largest convergence in our history. baxter auto parts announced that they will bring over 80 years of automotive aftermarket experience and strong customer relationships to the carquest banner. this is a testament to the strength of the carquest independent program, including product availability, differentiated brands, technology platforms and robust marketing plan.
we also grew our technet program across all pro channels. technet enables independent service shops to create their own national network. we now have over 13,000 north american members, and we'll continue to leverage technet to differentiate our pro offering and build loyalty.
in summary, we expect that as our pro installers recover, our industry-leading assortment, customized pro solutions, and dedicated pro banners will enable us to drive market share gain in the growing segment throughout the balance of the year.
meanwhile, our diy omnichannel business led our growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. stepping back and as a reminder, there was a significant increase in diy penetration across the industry beginning in q2 2020. according to syndicated data, an estimated 4 million new diy buyers were added. spend per buyer for 2020 grew close to 9%, led by online spend per buyer. diy growth was led by project, recreation and more discretionary categories as people worked on their vehicles or even learned how to work on their vehicles. these trends generally continued through q1, and the industry is now beginning to lap the significant increase from prior year in q2.
from an advance standpoint, we grew share of wallet and overall market share in q1, led by diehard batteries. diehard continues to have strong momentum and our advertising is clearly resonating with customers. we plan to continue to invest behind this powerful brand in 2021 to further build awareness and association with advance.
our loyalty program remains focused on attracting, retaining and graduating speed perks members. our loyalty program enables us to provide personalized offers and increase share of wallet as we leverage our customer data platform. in q1, this helped drive growth in our vip members by approximately 14% and our elite members by 30%.
consistent with broader retail, during q1, we began to see a shift back to store sales from e-commerce, given the outsized growth of the online business during the onset of the pandemic in 2020. our investments in digital and e-commerce have been another differentiator for our diy business. we continue to strengthen our online experience on desktop, mobile and with our app, which recently crossed nearly 1.3 million downloads. the integration of our digital and physical assets is communicated through our advance same day suite of services. this enables diyers to find the right part from our industry-leading assortment, order it online, and either pick it up in one of our stores within 30 minutes or have it delivered in three hours or less.
finally, we're very excited about our footprint expansion and new store opening plans for the year. we're targeting between 100 to 115 new stores in 2021. this includes the pep boys leases we're executing in california. the opening of the california locations will ramp up during the back half of the year and finish in 2022.
now, i'd like to transition to the unique opportunity we have to significantly expand our margins. as we outlined in our strategic update, there are four broad initiatives: leveraging category management, streamlining our supply chain, improving sales and profit per store, and reducing corporate sg&a.
our largest merchant expansion initiative is leveraging category management to drive gross margin improvement. this involves three components: material cost optimization, own brand expansion, and strategic pricing. material cost optimization and strategic sourcing has been an ongoing effort for us and will continue to be a focus. given the current inflationary environment, we are leveraging these capabilities to push back on cost increases, to keep our price to the customer low. we'll continue to work collaboratively with our supplier partners on managing input costs.
own brand expansion as a percent of our mix is an important contributor to margin rate improvement. however, growing our diehard and carquest brand is not just about margin, it's also about differentiation. our merchant team is building our capabilities and sourcing to develop high quality products, leveraging our strong supplier relationships. two recent examples include our diehard robust enhanced flooded battery and our carquest hub assembly. once equipped with a differentiated product, our marketing team is building the awareness and the reputation of our own brand as evidenced by our diehardisback advertising campaign.
finally, we supplement innovative quality parts and breakthrough marketing with an improved [technical issues] and extensive team member training. this includes enhanced part, product and brand training to ensure our store team members are well positioned to provide our customers with trusted advice and an excellent in-store experience.
so, we're not only on track with margin expansion behind own brands, we're also leveraging these brands to enhance differentiation and improve store traffic. our extensive research around customer journey highlights the role that brands play in customer purchase decisions. when a customers car won't start, we want them to think of diehard first, such as this becomes a reason that they come to advance. this is why collaborating with our supplier partners is so important to ensure high quality for our own brands. we are confident as we continue to invest in product quality, building our brands, and training our team members to drive own brands as a percent of mix, we will further deliver growth across aap.
the final component of our category management initiatives is strategic pricing. by investing in new tools, we're now able to competitively price on a market-by-market basis using detailed analytics to improve rate. we're also realizing success in reducing discounts online through a rapid test and learn approach, which is driving significant margin expansion in key categories.
in total, our category management initiatives are currently on track to deliver up to 200 basis points of margin expansion through 2023. as we look beyond 2023, we plan to continue building out customer data and personalization platforms to further enhance the customer experience and expand margins. same with gross margin, we once again leveraged supply chain in q1 versus both 2020 and 2019. despite the current environment, we remain focused on executing our primary margin expansion initiatives while working to mitigate the impact of global supply chain challenges. we expect to complete our warehouse management system implementation in 2022 with the majority of our largest buildings converted this year. in conjunction with wms, we're also rolling out our labor management system, which allows us to implement common standard operating procedures across our dc network. this will also enable us to incentivize hourly team members based on their performance.
in terms of cross-banner replenishment, or cbr, we've converted over 70% of stores to date and expect to complete the remaining stores we originally planned by the end of q3. cbr significantly reduces our miles driven, which is even more important today given rising fuel and labor costs. more importantly, cbr will complete the integration of the advance and carquest supply chains and enables us to service our approximately 4,800 corporate advance stores and 1,300 independent carquest stores from a single supply chain. we also continue to integrate the dedicated professional supply chain within worldpac and autopart international. in the quarter, we converted another five ai stores to the worldpac system and are on track to complete this integration by the end of q1 2022.
in april, we discussed two additional supply chain initiatives building on what will soon be a more streamlined supply chain network. this includes tiering our supply chain and transforming in-market delivery and customer fulfillment. our tiered supply chain pools the slowest moving skus into four strategically located regional dcs. this will allow us to make room for faster moving skus and ultimately improve the availability of our higher turnover products.
our second new initiative is transforming in-market delivery and customer fulfillment to improve service and productivity. the new delivery management system was selected for multiple modes of transportation to move and deliver parts at lower costs. both of these initiatives are in their early stages, and we are targeting completion of these in 2023 and 2024, respectively.
in terms of sg&a improvements, our store operations team is executing initiatives to increase sales and profit per store. we've now increased sales per store for three straight years, and we're on track to get to our target of $1.8 million average sales per store by 2023. in q1, with strong top-line growth and disciplined execution, we leveraged store payroll versus both 2019 and 2020. we've also made improvements in scheduling and task management to drive efficiency, which helps with our customer experience as it enables us to schedule our most tenured and knowledgeable team members when we need them most. we continued to invest in our store team members in terms of training, technology and in compensation, including our unique fuel the frontline stock ownership program. we believe these investments have enabled us to attract the very best parts people in the business and are enabling continued improvement in primary execution metrics like net promoter score, units per transaction and ultimately sales and profit per store.
finally, we took steps to reduce corporate and other sg&a costs in the quarter. this includes three broad territories: integration, safety, and new ways of working. in terms of integration, our finance erp is near completion and we continue to build proficiency in our global capability center at hyderabad, india. i'd like to take this opportunity to recognize our india team, who stood up an entirely new operation literally in the middle of a global pandemic last year. we've been working hard to support them as covid-19 infection rates have risen in india over the past few weeks. the gcc team including it, finance and hr team members today has certainly enabled us to reduce costs, both in terms of capex and opex. in addition, the it team brings new skills in the area of software engineering, data analytics and artificial intelligence. these critical capabilities will help enable the successful implementation of our many tech initiatives.
secondly, our safety performance continues as field leaders across advance hold their teams accountable as we build a safety culture. we delivered a 9% reduction in our total recordable injury rate compared to the previous year, and reduced our lost-time injury rate 2%. by focusing on people, behavior and continuous improvement, we're reducing claims and overall cost.
third, we recently completed a thorough review on the ways we work in our corporate offices and incorporated key learnings from working remotely for over a year. the objective was to ensure our corporate team is focused on our highest value priorities, while eliminating less productive work. from this work, we announced a restructure of our corporate functions and the reduction of our corporate office footprint. this will result in savings of approximately $30 million in sg&a, which will be realized over the next 12 months. we also believe the streamline approach will be more effective to supporting our field and supply chain teams.
while we're pleased with our q1 performance, we're confident that there is so much more opportunity ahead. to fully realize our potential, we plan to continue to invest in our brands, the customer experience, our team members and market expansion to drive top-line growth above market. our entire team also remains focused on the execution of our margin expansion initiatives. we're energized and focused on building on the momentum we saw in q1 to execute our long-term strategy in the months to come.
now, let me pass it over to jeff, who will go into more details on our financial results.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, tom, and good morning. and thanks to everyone joining us today, especially our team members, who continue to work tirelessly, which has contributed to the results that we're reporting today.
in q1, our net sales increased 23.4% to $3.3 billion. adjusted gross profit margin expanded 91 basis points to 44.8% as a result of improvement throughout gross margin, including supply chain, net pricing, channel mix and material cost optimization. these improvements were slightly offset by unfavorable inventory-related costs, product mix and headwinds associated with shrink and defectives.
our q1 adjusted sg&a expense was $1.2 billion. on a rate basis, this represented 35.8% of net sales, which improved 387 basis points compared to one year ago. the improvement was driven by sales leverage in both payroll and rent, as well as lower claim-related expenses from the company's emphasis on safety.
we discussed our labor management system previously, but we really saw the benefit this quarter as we staffed our store based on customer needs, utilizing nights, weekends and an improved mix of full and part-time schedules. in addition, our ongoing focus on team member safety will always remain one of our highest priorities. the savings were partially offset by an increase in field bonus costs related to our improved performance.
in addition, as tom outlined earlier, we invested in marketing during q1, primarily associated with diehard. this lap marketing cuts the previous year, which were made at the onset of the pandemic. we also saw an increase in third party and service contracts related to our transformational plans, primarily within it.
related to the increased covid-19 cases we saw late in 2020 and early 2021, we incurred approximately $16 million in covid-19 cost during the quarter, which is flat to the prior year. while the future impact of covid-19 remains unknown, we expect these costs to subside throughout the year, assuming infection rates continue to decline.
our adjusted operating income increased from $113 million last year to $299 million. on a rate basis, our adjusted oi margin expanded by 478 basis points to 9%.
finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.34, up from $1.00 a year ago.
our free cash flow for the quarter was $259 million, an increase of $330 million compared to last year. the improvement was primarily driven by year-over-year operating income growth, as well as improvements we achieved from working capital initiatives, including higher utilization of our supply chain financing facilities that we began to see during the pandemic last year.
our ap ratio improved by nearly 1,000 basis points to 84%, the highest we've achieved since the gpi acquisition. a portion of the improvement is attributable to the actions we took during the pandemic, and the continued partnerships we have with our suppliers.
in the quarter, we spent $71 million in capital expenditures versus $83 million in the prior year quarter. we expect to be within our guidance for capital expenditures, as we continue to invest in our transformation initiatives.
during q1, we returned more than $200 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares and our quarterly cash dividend. we expect to be within our 2021 share repurchase guidance of $300 million to $500 million. additionally, as you saw during our investor presentation in april, our board approved our quarterly shareholder dividend of $1.00, payable on july 2nd.
as outlined in our press release this morning, we've seen continued momentum in the first four weeks of q2 with our two-year comparable store sales growth rate in line with the two-year stack we reported in q1. miles driven are beginning to grow for the first time in over a year, and historically, this has been overall positive for our industry. in addition, our professional business is accelerating, and we expect pro to outperform diy for the balance of the year. for these reasons, we're raising our comp sales guidance to up 4% to 6%.
we're also cognizant of several macroeconomic factors. this includes inflationary costs in commodities, transportation and wages, along with currency headwinds. as a reminder, our industry has historically been very rational and successful in passing on inflationary costs in the form of price, and that is our intention this year as well. also our pro business carries a lower margin rate than diy, which may partially offset the gains we expect to see in sales. as a result of our top-line strength and current cost assumptions, we're updating our adjusted oi margin range to be between 9% and 9.2%. our guide for comp sales is now up 3 full points, and our adjusted oi margin rate is now up 30 basis points compared to our initial guidance provided in february.
we remain committed to delivering against the strategy we laid out in april and are confident in our ability to execute our long-term strategic plans to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return.
now, let's open the call for your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of michael lasser of ubs. your line is open.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
good morning. thanks a lot for taking my question. tom, you're still -- performance in 2q trail behind some in the industry as well as some indicators of how the industry performs. so, what would you attribute that to and is this a sign that it's just going to be harder to realize the top line expectation that you have outlined as part of your long-term plan?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
hey. good morning, michael. on the contrary, we're very pleased with our sales performance in the quarter. this is one of those unusual quarters, where the timing of the quarter makes a very big difference. if you think about our quarter that started on april the 25th, we didn't have the first 24 days of april, that three-week period, we can see our growth that was over 50% in those weeks and they get replaced by a couple of weeks in july, our quarter ended on july the 17th.
so, it's really around the timing piece. as far as we're concerned, it's -- we've normalize the calendar for the months of april through june, we're performing very well in relative terms. so, in general, this is a very fragmented industry as well. there's lots of room for everyone to grow. we have just 7% of the total market. we are also pleased that we were able to grow margins, gross margins in the quarter on top of the sales growth. so, again, when we normalize our quarter relative to our peers, we feel very good about our sales performance.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
understood. my follow-up question is on your operating expenses, sg&a versus 2019 in the quarter was up around 14%, following an 11% increase in the first quarter. how much of this has been due to wages inflating more than you expected? and what's the reasonable expectation for us to assume wages are going to continue to increase in the next couple of quarters? and then how much is this going be offset by other potential sources of savings or even the gross margin expansion that seem sustainable as you generated in the second quarter?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah. well, specific to sg&a, when you compare it to 2019, you got to remember we do have the covid-related costs in '21 that we didn't experience in 2019. and i think that just about evens it out, in fact it might actually be a little bit better on a relative basis when you take out those $4 million.
in terms of inflation, we certainly experienced inflation throughout the p&l and the wage inflation was higher than our expectations. certainly, the product costs are well within our expectations, they are a little over 2%. but just kind of stepping back, if we continue to execute our margin expansion initiatives, especially in gross margins may of what you saw this quarter, we think that's going to continue into the back half of the year.
and keep in mind, a lot of our sg&a initiatives that we laid out in april either don't start in '21 at all or just begin in the back half of '21. so, for example, that $30 million of restructuring, we're not going to start seeing that until the back half. so, that will help us somewhat, but sg&a is going to be challenged throughout the balance of the year, but we're confident we can continue with our gross margins and hopefully continue to show positive operating margins.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
thank you and good luck.
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of simeon gutman of morgan stanley. your line is open.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey. thanks. good morning, everyone. my first question is on gross margin. this quarter, it looked like there was a pretty strong inflection on that line item. can you talk about if it's reflective of the collective initiatives that you're working on? and then is there any part of it that may not be repeatable?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, simeon. the short answer is, yes, it's directly attributable to our category management initiatives. it's the combination of our strategic sourcing, our strategic pricing. and as tom mentioned, we rolled out our own brands. and so, if you take those and put them together, that not only offset the inflation, which as i just mentioned was a little over 2% that we saw in product cost, it drove all of our gross margin improvement in the quarter.
and we absolutely believe that these are sustainable in the back half of the year. now, we did see favorability with some of those inventory-related items, namely capitalized supply chain costs, but those were essentially offset by the supply chain headwinds and channel mix. so, overall, we're very pleased with how our initiatives drove gross margin improvement in q2 and we expect that to continue.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then maybe, jeff, i'm going to stick with supply chain costs because i know you just mentioned it now and i think it was in the press release. because these costs are getting capitalized and we know what -- container rates and freight rates are moving up, have we seen the peak level of these costs reflected or we have to wait as your inventory turns, means we're going to see a little bit incremental pressure from these items down the road?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
over time, down the road, you would see these come back through. remember, we've got $4 billion of inventory sitting on our balance sheet. so i wouldn't expect a wave to come back in any of the next few quarters and it really varies by the velocity of the various skus. so, it does get on to your balance sheet, it does come back off overtime. but overall we're not anticipating anything, at least not in the back half of the year.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and just related to the same -- related to my first and the second question, this inflection in terms of magnitude of gross margin combined with maybe some higher supply chain costs. is there any rule of thumb where the business should be doing 30 basis points, 50 basis points, 70 basis points of margin or is that you're not going to draw a line in the sand, that specifically?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. we're not going to draw lines in the sand that specifically. we're really pleased with the initiatives that we have in place. they're absolutely going to continue and we're going to try our best to manage the inflation as we go through the balance of the year.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thanks. appreciate it. take care.
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, simeon.

your next question comes from the line of christopher horvers of j.p. morgan. your line is open.
christopher horvers -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
thanks, guys, and good morning. so, my first question is on the commentary around quarter-to-date, the diy compares really start to ease off going forward. if our math is right, you were running sort of a low-double digit through the end of august last year and then it eased down to sort of mid-single-digit plus in the latter part of the quarter. is that fair and does that imply that you're running sort of, like a low-single-digit one year positive at this point?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
good morning chris. you're in the ballpark. what we said was we're in line with the two-year stack in the second quarter, which as we reported this morning was over 13%. so our third quarter was 10%. so you're in that ballpark. and i think your cadence is right as well. i mean, july and august were very strong last year and started to gradually moderate through the fall.
christopher horvers -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
understood, makes sense. and then as a follow-up, just helicoptering up, you know you did a -- in the first quarter, you had a 9% operating margin. in the second quarter, you got 11.4% operating margin. what's the new sustainable level? or maybe asked differently, what's not sustainable in the 11.4%? i understand some quarter is seasonally light, so less sort of leveraged on the fixed cost side, but what sort of the build point that we're going from as we think about the second quarter and forward?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. a couple of things, chris. we're pleased with the -- not only the one year, but the two-year improvement in the second quarter on margin expansion of over 200 bps. the big thing that's starting to kick in for us and is sustainable is the category management initiatives. i mean, we've been working on those for a couple of years. we've said all along, it's going to take time.
we've had several quarters, five quarters in a row of growth now. the last couple of years we've only had, the one difficult quarter in early 2020 and that's helped us on the sourcing side and vendor incentives piece. the rollout of our own brands, which as you know, given the turns in our category has taken time. but that is really starting to benefit our p&l. there is a significant difference in the margin rate between the carquest premium own brand products and some of the alternatives that we have there.
and as you know, we implemented that pricing tool in the middle of last year, and that also has then enabled us to be a lot smarter in how we price, whether that's regionally or by channel or by account, all of those things. so, clearly, the category management initiatives are going to be sustainable for us. the supply chain initiatives, we're going to continue to execute against, they're very much on track. what we're dealing with on the unknown side is just the ongoing inflationary environment.
and in the second quarter, we saw that coming; we dealt with it. we feel confident. this is an industry that's been able to deal with unplanned inflation very successfully over many years. so, that's the approach that we're going to take. but the gross margin initiatives, we feel very strong -- very good about and we believe are sustainable and we're going to continue to execute them.
christopher horvers -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
so, i guess, said another way, ex sort of seasonality and overall sales levels, there was nothing unusual in the 11.4%?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. we called out the inventory-related costs that were basically fully offset, as jeff just said, by the channel mix and the supply chain headwinds. but other than that, it was equal, jeff?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
the only thing i would add to that chris is, in the back half, we're going to continue to invest in marketing as long as it makes sense. we're seeing a really good return on our advertising spend. it was relatively flat in q2, just so you know, but in the back half, we got some plans to invest further into marketing. so, we're going to see some of that in the back half.
christopher horvers -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
got it. thanks very much.
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of elizabeth suzuki of bank of america. your line is open.
jason haas -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking our question. this is jason haas on for liz suzuki. so, i wanted to focus in on the diy business. i'm curious what you could say about the health of that customer? we know they've been plush with cash with stimulus and high saving rates for a while. so, it sounds like you're starting to see a moderation in that business. i'm curious to what extent you think that folks shifting over to the do-it-for-me channel or do you think maybe there is just some slowdown in their spending after the stimulus dollars start to run out?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
well, we've actually been pretty pleased with the performance in diy. we fully anticipated the shift back to difm at some point this year, given what happened last year, again in the second quarter of 2020 people were locked in their homes, they had time on their hands. they were doing things that they wouldn't normally do, including diy automotive.
so, as we get back into more of a normalized environment here where people are commuting, they're going out to baseball games and traveling on airplanes and all the things that they do, they lose that time and then they're going to obviously get their car repaired and maintained by a professional. it's more likely that they would do that.
and also, in the second quarter last year, many of the professional garages were closed for a period of time, so they couldn't even get them repaired at a garage. so it's really held up more than we would have expected, and we're very pleased by the performance in the quarter. we can see that we held on to customers that joined us last year, that came on to our -- to the advance team, if you will, last year. we maintained those customers and the diy business has held up. so it hasn't -- we haven't given back a whole lot of the gains from last year.
jason haas -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, that's great to hear. and then, on your inventory position, i know you mentioned and it's been widely reported, some supply chain challenges. so, i'm just curious how that looks from here on out if you are getting a sense that things are just starting to improve from here? and then just the state of your inventory and how you feel for the remaining quarters of the year.
and then if it's related at all -- i did want to follow up on the free cash flow guidance. just curious what the drivers, if that's inventory-related? i don't know if the delayed store openings has an impact? just any color on that would be helpful as well. thanks.
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
okay. well, i'll take the supply chain question and then i'll flip the cash flow over to jeff. i think, in general, we would say our store and stocks are not where we'd like them to be. at the same time, we're very well positioned competitively. i've been out in the market a lot, i can see what's going on in the difm network and in diy. i feel very good about our competitive position.
i think everyone is experiencing some level of difficulties there. i'm very proud of our merchant inventory and supply chain teams, they've leveraged long-term relationships that we have with our partners to keep the product moving. so, we're going to continue to work with them to build our inventory back and make sure that we're at the level of service that we want to be for our stores. but i feel very good competitively. jeff?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, sure. on the free cash flow, really there's three things that are going to impact us in the back half that we didn't see as much in the first half. so, first of all, we do think we're going to still generate meaningful operating cash in the back half, but that's going to be largely offset by three things.
first is our capital expenditures. we still have a very robust plan in the back half to invest back in the business, investing in our margin expansion objectives. and so, the capex spend will be elevated as compared to the second half. as you saw, we held our guidance there at $300 million to $350 million for the year.
second and related to the first question, we are going to be making investments in inventory that will likely increase our inventory in the back half to support what tom just said, both the in-stocks as well as our new store openings. so, that will put some pressure on our working capital.
and then the last thing is, we should have a couple of expenditures that we didn't see in the first half. we have to repay half of the cares act. so, if you recall, we didn't have to make the cash payment on the employer payroll tax last year. we have to pay back half of that this year in the fourth quarter. and then, we do have an additional rent payment due to the timing of our fiscal year end. so, those are really the drivers for the lower free cash flows compared to the first half.
jason haas -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of steven zaccone of citigroup. your line is open.
steven zaccone -- citi research -- analyst
great. good morning, everyone. thanks for taking my question. i guess, i wanted to start on the outlook for parts inflation. if you could elaborate a little bit more on how you're thinking about the full year? i think the prior expectation was for 2% to 4% benefit to the full year comps, so just talk about that. and then i guess more broadly on the pricing environment, have you really seen any issues with passing cost on to the pro customer or the diy consumer?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah. so, i'll take the first part. i think you mentioned the parts inflation. as i said, in the quarter, we saw product costs at a little over 2%. when we started the year, we were estimating inflation at 1% to 2%. we now think it's going to be 2% to 4%. we do know there is more inflation coming, we're planning for that. so that 2% to 4% range we feel like it's going to be still in that range.
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. and on the pricing piece, we've been able to leverage our tools much better this year. we're being a lot more strategic in how we pass on pricing. we leverage all of the work we do on the customer decision journey, whether that's in diy or in difm. and with that in mind, we've been able to pass it on very successfully. and it's kind of a tradition within our industry, we feel confident we'll be able to continue to do that.
steven zaccone -- citi research -- analyst
great. then just the second question on the broader like macro backdrop and some of the industry drivers, how do you see demand playing out over the balance of the year? i guess, in particular, we've seen the strength in used car sales, do you think that's a tailwind that can continue here in the back half of the year?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
we definitely do. i mean, that's a very important number to see that used car growth and we do believe that's going to continue to contribute to an aging fleet, which in turn means more part sales. so, that's a strength. and the traditional drivers of demand, all of them are relatively positive.
we're seeing a recovery in miles driven, the car parks are growing, the fleet is aging, so all of those contribute to incremental part sales. so, we do believe the industry continues to grow. and as you saw from our april investor presentation, as you get into '22, '23, we think that continues in the 4% range.
steven zaccone -- citi research -- analyst
great, thanks very much guys.

your next question comes from the line of kate mcshane of goldman sachs. your line is open.
kate mcshane -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to go back to the wage inflation piece. just curious, why maybe it was higher than expected in q2? and i wondered if you could talk a little bit about turnover currently at the dcs versus stores and where your average hourly wage is currently?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
well, first of all, we definitely have planned some level of wage inflation for the year, kate. it is a little bit high -- i mean, you're very familiar with the labor situation nationally [phonetic], which was really challenged in the second quarter. so we're surgical with how we invested in wages. we look at them market-by-market and we look at it on an ongoing basis. we want to make sure we've got the very best people that we can get into our stores to work with our customers. and that's been a multi-year effort.
we've been investing in our front line team members for several years. we got a very unique program called fuel the frontline, which provides stock to our frontline team members, no one else in the industry has that. we've invested over $60 million there. and as we look at our store team, we want to keep that turnover number down as low as possible. so, there are markets where we made investments in the quarter in the stores.
supply chain is a very challenging situation. we are seeing inflation there as we called out more than we expected. the turnover, i think, has peaked and started to come down, is what i would tell you there. obviously, as some of the benefits, the unemployment benefits, etc. start to come off, we are seeing more applicants and able to source the people that we need. so, i think the difficult environment is going to continue, but it's going to be less challenging, i think, than it was in the second quarter.

bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning guys.
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
good morning, bret.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
on the category initiatives, i guess, do you think that they are having any impact on your in-stocks as you put more of those supply chain on your own place as opposed to third party distributors, suppliers?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
no. i think, in general, we're transitioning certain categories. but it's a -- in general, it's a challenging environment for our suppliers, getting people to work, getting containers, obviously we've got sourced products from china, there is a lot of variables in there, bret. so, i think it's really a broader issue.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then i guess on the pep boys topic, you talked about some of those store conversions. could you give us any color as how -- any early feedback on how those stores are performing if you've converted? and i guess on those that you're having a problem with, may they never convert, is it something that you're just not getting approval on the zoning for and they may get left out or it's just going to be slower?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
first of all, no, we will get them all converted, what we said was, by the end of the first quarter of '22. we obviously want to get this right as quickly as we can. we've run into some challenges with permitting and construction and things like that in california that are quite unique to that market. but i got to tell you, we're so excited about this opportunity, bret. i've been out there a couple of times. i've been through the stores, meeting the team members.
these are experienced team members, they know the la market. they know the california market. we're going to bring them all of our initiatives. we're going to bring them diehard batteries, carquest premium products, all of our professional customer base. we're very excited about this opportunity and you're going to hear more about it this fall. i mean, we are going to be starting opening soon.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. then one quick housekeeping question. i guess, on the accounts payable to inventory now in the 80s, years ago we talked about this maybe being a target. do you think that number goes higher or are there just structural headwinds like worldpac that would prevent your accounts payable north of a 100%?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, we've said in the past that we think we can get our ap ratio into the low 90s. for the balance of the year, we think it will moderate to some extent versus what you're seeing in q2. and that's largely driven by the inventory investments that i had mentioned earlier.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of daniel imbro of stephens. your line is open.
daniel imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yeah, good morning, everybody. thanks for taking our questions. i want to start on the expense side. i think in recent quarters jeff and tom you've mentioned taking up your advertising dollars. i think you've noted that's probably skewed toward more driving diy sales and diy mix. with diy sales slowing and becoming a smaller percentage going forward, can you maybe talk about how you're planning those advertising dollars and frankly how you're measuring roi just given the channel shifts going on in the business?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, good morning, daniel. we measure it based on the ability to drive the p&l and margin expansion, incremental sales dollars are in the equation, obviously, but we've been very, very successful at refining our marketing spend. diehard has been a home run. we've launched diehard last year, we gradually reduced our discounts online on batteries. our gross margin improvement in batteries is significant.
part of our gross margin benefit in the quarter was related to batteries, where on a year-to-date basis we're still gaining unit share and growing gross margin. so, when those marketing dollars which show up in sg&a are spent against -- on initiatives such as diehard, we look at the total picture, not just the sg&a investment, obviously, to the extent we can drive the entire p&l, we do that and that's how we look at it.
daniel imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then to -- just on the diy customer. first, you talked about moving customers up your loyalty tiers, what are the reward redemptions looking like at each level and is there a different gross margin impact? is there a positive benefit for moving up tier with customers? and then the last diy question is just, with gas prices much higher maybe year-over-year and frankly staying here at levels we haven't seen in a while, have you seen any impacts on that lower end diy customer and any pullback in discretionary spending you attribute to that vector?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
well, first of all, on speed perks, we're pleased we're starting to grow share of transactions again. we saw nice increase on that. we're seeing, what we call, graduation. so the increases in our elite members, increases in our vip members. so the short answer is, we want that, right. we want to capture a higher share of wallet with our diy customers. and when we do that, we make more gross profit dollars. the discounts are not -- are obviously factored into that, but you're getting a higher share of wallet in total, you are very happy with that outcome.
we haven't seen anything yet in terms of diy customers trading down. we're very cognizant of that, though, daniel, to your question. and in some cases, where -- as we roll out carquest premium own brand, we are seeing that naturally and that's actually a good thing for us because it drives gross margin. however, in general, i don't think we can say we've seen a broad trend to trade down yet, but we're cognizant of it, given the environment, and given the stimulus coming off and all of those things.
daniel imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of michael montani of evercore isi. your line is open.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. i just wanted to ask for some incremental color, if i could, tom, in terms of transaction counts. can you just give us a sense for how that played out on diy, difm and then that 5.8% comp, how much was traffic versus ticket there?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
sure. yeah, pro was strong across the board, strong ticket growth, strong average ticket. diy was down in terms of transactions lapping huge growth last year. so, in terms of our overall performance, we're pleased with both in terms of our expectations and what we -- how we thought the quarter was going to play out. average ticket was strong in diy as well, by the way. so, bit of a tale of two cities and -- but not different than we expected.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
and just the follow-up was, if we look at the back half of last year, it's kind of 100 bps, 150 bps higher ebit margin in aggregate versus the back half of '19. and just thinking about this year's back half, we're talking about kind of double-digit trends in terms of two-year sales productivity list. so, just wondering if there is any structural impediment that would kind of prevent the retention of much or all of that kind of benefit that you all had last year?
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
well, i mean, our back half guide represents a combination of factors. i mean, we've looked at the environment, it's obviously a pretty dynamic environment right now, there's a lot of unknowns in the back half, so we have reflected that in the guide. but based on the tailwinds we had in the second quarter and all of those headwinds that we see, we did increase the guide for the third time on all the key financial metrics.
and we're pleased that through the first four weeks on a two-year stack, our sales performances is in line with q2 of roughly 13%. so, all of that's positive, michael. so, we're going to continue to execute our plan. we want to grow faster than the market. we want to expand our margins. we're going to return the excess cash back to our investors and continue to do what we believe we're capable of doing over the next couple of years. and we're cognizant of the dynamic nature of the environment.

now, let me turn the call over to tom greco.
tom greco -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, elisabeth, and good morning. we hope you're all healthy and safe amid the ongoing pandemic and recent surge of the delta variant. i'd like to start by thanking the entire advance and carquest independent family for your hard work to serve our customers throughout the quarter. it's because of you that we're reporting the positive growth in sales, profit and earnings per share we're reviewing today.
in q2, we continued to deliver strong financial performance on both the one and two year stack, as we began lapping more difficult comparisons. in the quarter, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 5.8% and adjusted operating income margin of 11.4%, an increase of 11 basis points versus 2020.
as a reminder, we lapped a highly unusual quarter from 2020 where we significantly reduced hours of operation and professional delivery expenses reflective of the channel shift from pro to diy. as we anticipated, the professional business accelerated in q2 2021, and between our ongoing strategic initiatives and additional actions, we expanded margins. our actions offset known headwinds within sg&a and an extremely competitive environment for talent.
on a two-year stack, our comp sales improved 13.3% and margins expanded 227 basis points compared to q2 2019. adjusted diluted eps of $3.40 increased 15.3% compared to q2 2020 and 56.7% compared to 2019. year-to-date, free cash flow more than doubled, which led to a higher than anticipated return of cash to shareholders in the first half of the year, returning $661.4 [phonetic] million through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.
our sales growth and margin expansion were driven by a combination of industry-related factors as well as internal operational improvements. on the industry side, the macroeconomic backdrop remained positive in the quarter as consumers benefited from the impact of government stimulus.
meanwhile, long-term industry drivers of demand continued to improve. this includes a gradual recovery in miles driven along with an increase in used car sales, which contributes to an aging fleet. while we delivered positive comp sales in all three periods of q2 our year-over-year growth slowed late in the quarter as we lapped some of our highest growth weeks of 2020. our category growth was led by strength in brakes, motor oil and filters, with continued momentum in key hard part professional categories.
regionally, the west led our growth benefiting from an unusually hot summer, followed by the southwest, northeast and florida. to summarize channel performance, we saw double-digit growth in our professional business and a slight decline in our diy omnichannel business. to understand the shift in our channel mix, it's important to look back at 2020 to provide context.
beginning in q2, we saw abrupt shifts in consumer behavior across our industry due to the pandemic, resulting from the implementation of stay-at-home orders. this led to more consumers repairing their own vehicles, which drove diy growth. in addition, our diy online business surged as many consumers chose to shop from home and leverage digital services.
finally, as we discussed last year, our research indicated that large box retailers temporarily deprioritized long tail items, such as auto parts, in response to the pandemic. these and other factors resulted in robust sales growth and market share gains for our diy business in 2020.
contrary to historical trends, the confluence of these factors also led to a slight decline in our professional business in q2 2020. as we began to lap this highly unusual time, we leveraged our extensive research on customer decision journeys. this enabled us move quickly as customer shifted how they repaired and maintained their vehicles.
our sales growth and margin expansion in q2 demonstrates the flexibility of our diversified asset base as we adapted to a very different environment in 2021. specific to our professional business, we began to see improving demand late in q1 2021, which continued into q2, resulting in double-digit comp sales growth. this is directly related to the factors just discussed, along with improved mobility trends as more people returned to work and miles driven increased versus the previous year.
strategic investments are strengthening our professional customer value proposition. it starts with improved availability and getting parts closer to the customer as we leverage our dynamic assortment machine learning platform. within our advance pro catalog, we saw improved key performance indicators across the board including, more online traffic, increased assortment and conversion rates and ultimately growth in transaction counts and average ticket.
we also continued to invest in our technical training programs to help installers better serve their customers. our technet program is also performing well as we continue to expand our north american technet members, providing them with a broad range of services. each of these pro-focused initiatives have been a differentiator for advance, enabling us to increase first call status with both national strategic accounts and local independent shops.
finally, we're pleased that through the first half of the year, we added 28 net new independent carquest stores. we also announced the planned conversion of an additional 29 locations in the west as baxter auto parts joins the carquest family. we're excited to combine our differentiated pro customer value proposition with an extremely strong family business, highlighted by baxter's excellent relationships with their customers in this growing market. in summary, all of our professional banners performed at or above our expectations in q2, including our canadian business, despite stringent lockdowns.
moving to diy omnichannel, our business performed in line with expectations, considering our strong double-digit increases in 2020. while q2 diy comp sales were down slightly, diy omnichannel was still the larger contributor to our two-year growth. diy growth versus a year ago gradually moderated throughout the quarter as some consumers returned to professional garages.
within diy omnichannel, we saw a shift in consumer behavior back to in-store purchases, consistent with broader retail. we've also been working to optimize and reduce inefficient online discounts. these factors along with highly effective advertising contributed to an increase in our diy in-store mix and a significant increase in gross margins versus prior year.
we remain focused on improving the diy experience to increase share of wallet through our speed perks loyalty platform. we made several upgrades to our mobile app to make it easier for speed perks members to see their status and access rewards. we continue to see positive graduation rates among our existing speed perks members. in q2, our vip membership grew by 8% and our elite members representing the highest tier of customer spend, increased 21%.
shifting to operating income, we expanded margin in the quarter on top of significant margin expansion in q2 2020. this was led by our category management initiatives, which drove strong gross margin expansion in the quarter. first, our work on strategic sourcing remains a key focus as consistent sales growth over several quarters resulted in an increase in supplier incentives.
secondly, we've talked about growing own brands as a percent of our total sales. this has been a thoughtful and gradual conversion and we began to see the benefits of several quarters of hard work in q2. this was highlighted by our first major category conversion with steering and suspension, where we saw extremely strong unit growth for our high margin carquest premium products. in addition, the cq product is highly regarded by our professional installers. with consistent high level of quality standards, they are now delivering lower defect rates and improved customer satisfaction.
we also recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of the diehard battery launch. following strong year one share gains in diy omnichannel, we've now extended diehard distribution into the professional sales channel, where we're off to a terrific start. further expansion of the diehard and carquest brands is planned for other relevant categories.
in terms of strategic pricing, we significantly improved our capabilities, leveraging our new enterprise pricing platform. this platform enabled us to respond quickly as inflation escalated beyond our initial expectations for the year.
moving to supply chain, while we're continuing to execute our initiatives, we faced several unplanned, offsetting headwinds in q2. like most retailers, we experienced disruption within the global supply chain, wage inflation in our distribution centers and an overall shortage of workers to process the continued high level of demand. in addition, our suppliers experienced labor challenges and raw material shortages.
despite a challenging external environment, we continue to execute our internal supply chain initiatives. this includes the implementation of our new warehouse management system or wms, which we're on track to complete in 2022. in the dcs that we've converted, we're delivering improvements in fill rates, on-hand accuracy, and productivity.
the implementation of wms is a critical component of our new labor management system or lms. once completed, lms will standardize operating procedures and enable performance-based compensation. we also continue to execute our cross banner replenishment or cbr initiative, transitioning stores to the most freight logical servicing dc.
in q2, we converted nearly 150 additional stores and remain on track with the completion of the originally planned stores by the end of q3 2021. in addition to cbr, we're on track with the integration of worldpac and autopart international, which is expected to be completed early next year.
shifting to sg&a, we lapped several cost reduction actions in q2 2020, which we knew we would not replicate in 2021. we discussed these actions on our q2 call last year, primarily a reduction in delivery costs as a result of a substantial channel mix shift along with the reduction in store labor costs at the beginning of the pandemic. jeff will discuss these in more detail in a few minutes.
in terms of our initiatives, we continue to make progress on sales and profit per store. our team delivered sales per store improvement and we remain on track to reach our goal of $1.8 million average sales per store within our timeline. our profit per store is also growing faster than sales per store, enabling four wall margin expansion.
in addition to the positive impacts of operational improvements we've implemented to drive sales and profit per store, we've also done a lot of work pruning underperforming stores and we're back to store growth. in the first half of the year, we opened six worldpac branches, 12 advance and carquest stores and added 28 net new carquest independents, as discussed earlier.
we also announced the planned conversion of 109 pep boys locations in california. we're very excited about our california expansion with the opening of our first group of stores scheduled this fall. the resurgence of the delta variant has resulted in some construction related delays in our store opening schedule. we expect to complete the successful conversion of all stores to the advance banner by the end of the first quarter 2022.
finally, we are focused on reducing our corporate and other sg&a costs, including a continued focus on safety. our total recordable injury rate decreased 19% compared to q2 2020 and 36% compared to q2 2019. we're also finishing up our finance erp consolidation, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year. separately, we are in the early stages of integrating our merchandising systems to a single platform. both of these large scale technology platforms are expected to drive sg&a savings over time.
the last component of our sg&a cost reduction was a review of our corporate structure. in terms of the restructuring of our corporate functions announced earlier this year, savings were limited in q2 due to the timing of the actions. we expect sg&a savings associated with the restructure beginning in q3.
in summary, we're very pleased with our team's dedication to caring for our customers and delivering strong financial performance in q2. we're optimistic as the industry-related drivers of demand continue to indicate a favorable long-term outlook for the automotive aftermarket. we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy to grow above the market, expand margins and return significant excess cash back to shareholders.
now let me pass it to jeff to discuss more details on our financial results.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, tom, and good morning. i want to echo tom's thanks to our team members who continued to prioritize the health and safety of our customers and their fellow team members, while helping to deliver solid results for the quarter.
in q2, our net sales increased 5.9% to $2.6 billion. adjusted gross profit margin expanded 239 basis points to 46.4%, primarily as a result of the ongoing execution of our category management initiatives, including strategic sourcing, strategic pricing and own brand expansion.
we also experienced favorable inventory-related costs versus the prior year. these benefits were partially offset by inflationary costs in supply chain and unfavorable channel mix. in the quarter, same sku inflation was approximately 2% and we expect this will increase through the balance of the year. we're working with our supplier partners to mitigate costs where possible. year-to-date, gross margin improved 156 basis points compared to the first half of 2020.
as anticipated, q2 adjusted sg&a expenses increased year-over-year and were up $109 million versus 2020. this deleveraged 228 basis points and was a result of three primary factors. first, our incentive compensation was much higher than the prior year, primarily in our professional business as we lapped a very challenging quarter in 2020 when pro sales were negative. second, we experienced wage inflations beyond our expectations in stores.
we remain focused on attracting, retaining and developing the very best part people in the business and we'll continue to be competitive. we expect both headwinds to continue in the back half of the year. third, and as expected, we incurred incremental costs associated with professional delivery and normalized hours of operations when compared to q2 2020.
these increases in q2 were partially offset by a decrease in covid-19 related expenses to approximately $4 million compared to $15 million in the prior year. as a result of these factors, our sg&a expenses increased 13.3% to $926.4 million. as a percent of net sales, our sg&a was 35% compared to 32.7% in the prior year quarter. year-to-date, sg&a as a percent of net sales improved 88 basis points compared to the first half of 2020.
while we've seen a decrease in covid-19 related costs year-to-date, the health and safety of our team members and customers will continue to be our top priority. as the current environment remains volatile and the delta variant remains a concern, we may see increased covid-19 expenses in the back half of the year.
our adjusted operating income increased to $302 million compared to $282 million one year ago. on a rate basis, our adjusted oi margin expanded by 11 basis points to 11.4%. finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15.3% to $3.40 compared to $2.95 in q2 of 2020.
our free cash flow for the first half of the year was $646.6 million, an increase of $338.4 million compared to last year. this increase was driven in part by our operating income growth along with continued momentum in our working capital initiatives. our capital spending was $58.7 million for the quarter and $129.6 million year to-date.
we expect our investments to ramp up in the back half of the year. and in line with our guidance, we estimate we will spend between $300 million and $350 million in 2021. due to favorable market conditions along with our improved free cash flow in q2, we returned nearly $458 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 2 million shares at an average price of $197.52 and our recently increased quarterly cash dividend of $1 per share.
we're pleased with our performance during the first half of the year and moving into the first four weeks of q3 on a two-year stack, our comparable store sales are in line with q2. we're continuing to monitor the covid-19 situation as well as other macro factors, which may put pressure on our results, including, inflationary cost in commodities, wages and transportation. based on all these factors, we are increasing our full year 2021 guidance ranges, including net sales in the range of $10.6 billion to $10.8 billion, comparable store sales of 6% to 8% and adjusted operating income margin of 9.2% to 9.4%.
as you heard from tom on our new store openings, we've encountered some delays in the construction process of converting pep boys stores, primarily permitting and obtaining building materials related to the ongoing pandemic. as a result, we're lowering our guidance range and now expect to open 80 to 120 new stores this year.
additionally, given the improvement of our free cash flow and our accelerated share repurchases in the first half of the year, we are also increasing our guidance for free cash flow to a minimum of $700 million and an expected range for share repurchases of $700 million to $900 million. we remain committed to delivering against our long-term strategy as we execute against our plans to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return.
now, let's open the call for your questions. operator?
",2021-Q2,AAP

operator
[operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of michael lasser from ubs. your line is open.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
good morning. thanks a lot for taking my question. the two-year stacks were steady this quarter versus last quarter, but the implied difm comp at advance realized this quarter was lower than its competitors. what would be causing your share to lag in this environment, especially as you leverage these geographies that are going to recover probably faster than other areas?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
hey. good morning, michael. well, first of all, on the geography front, our leading geographies were the west and southwest, which are two of our smaller regions. we're really excited about our performance out there. we're gaining share out there, but they're smaller. we haven't seen the northeast come back at the level we would have liked on a two-year stack basis. so that's kind of the geography point.
i think, just to go back to the framework we shared in april. we're targeting top quartile total shareholder return. and there's three components to that. the first one is comp sales and it's very important. i mean, we've got 7% of the industry sales and we want to grow above the market and comp sales are very important. the second is to significantly expand our margins. and the third is to return a substantial amount of cash back to our shareholders.
we think we've got a unique opportunity as a company. with top quartile, we said we would deliver 20% to 22% total shareholder return over the next couple of years. and we delivered about 22% eps growth in the quarter. so we think that's going to stack up really well. i will say that, we wish our comp sales would have been higher in the quarter. and i think the thing that we called out in the script pertain to a couple of categories that we made a pretty big change in. i think our supply chain and merchant team did a terrific job on the sourcing front in terms of brakes and batteries and filters. we had a very strong quarter on those categories.
in terms of engine management and steering and suspension, we transitioned tens of thousands of skus in the quarter to carquest own brand. and given the current global supply chain environment, it was just challenging. they've got -- our in-stocks were just not where we wanted them to be overall and, in the end, i think in the quarter, the category changes we made ended up giving us some short-term pain in the quarter, but it's definitely for long-term gain. this is a huge move for us.
we're in much better shape now than we were this summer and our customers love this product. it's a great product, it's oe quality, it's selling extremely well. our in-stock rates are improving. and obviously, we love the margin rate. so, we didn't like the in-stock this summer on those categories, but the move is highly consistent with our plan to drive total shareholder return. and we believe that it will be a big margin driver for us next year into 2022.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
understood. my follow-up question, have those issues already been addressed such that they're having less of an impact on the business? and more significantly, what's the path to the 2023 operating margin target? should the margin expansion be pretty consistent in 2022 and 2023 or are you expecting more like a hockey stick inflection in 2023, given some of the moving dynamics that are going on?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll take the first one. i would say, we're in much better shape on those categories. i don't think we're where we want to be at this point. but we're in much better shape and it's improving every week. i'll let jeff talk to the cadence of our margin expansion going forward.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. in terms of overall margin expansion over the next couple of years, first of all, we'll provide guidance for '22 here in february. but overall, the way we're thinking about it is relatively consistent growth from our margin expansion initiatives. now, some are faster than others but, in the aggregate, we expect contributions relatively evenly over '22 and '23.
michael lasser -- ubs -- analyst
thank you so much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of bobby griffin from raymond james. your line is open.
mitch ingles -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, everyone. this is mitch ingles filling in for bobby. congrats on another nice quarter. so, your gross margin rate ex-lifo impact has improved roughly 250 basis points over the past two quarters, which is impressive given the current retail environment. how should we think about your gross margin performance in 4q and how that correlates to your fy '21 either [phonetic] rate outlook of 9.4% to 9.5%?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. i'll start with the second part first. what we've said really going into the back half is, our margin expansion overall was going to be led by gross margin, largely in line with those category management initiatives that we just talked about. so that's really going to be the contributing factor. sg&a, we've said at this point, is either going to be flat or a slight headwind. so we really think the growth that we're going to see this year is all up in gross margin. fourth quarter, largely a lot of the same. we think we have the pricing power to sustain. we're going to continue with our strategic sourcing. and as tom just mentioned, with the challenges behind us, we're going to continue to see benefits from the own brand expansion.
mitch ingles -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. thanks, jeff. and then, as a follow-up, inventory levels are likely not optimal given all the product strains [phonetic] across retail. and how much of this is actually pressuring sales? and what i'm getting at is, are customers simply substituting out-of-stock product with in-stock product or is this actually hurting the conversion rate? so any insight here would be helpful. thank you.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll take that one, bobby. i mean, first of all, as i mentioned, on the big categories, brakes and batteries, we've been in good shape the whole time. in fact, i would say, we've been advantaged competitively on those categories. and for sure, we're seeing that, as we start this quarter, steering and suspension, engine management and big, big difm categories. we're really pleased that that's coming back in.
and in some cases, certainly in the summer where we were making a transition and we didn't have something that we would have lost that sale. i don't know that we were able to pick up everything that we would have liked in the summer. but as that comes back in, we're starting to see those categories bounce back nicely. and obviously, there are certain occasions where you've got an application that you've got an alternative for, but there are others where you just don't. so, the moral of the story is, i think we're in much better shape now than we were in the third quarter and we're seeing that in our early performance.
mitch ingles -- raymond james -- analyst
great to hear. thanks for the color.
operator
your next question comes from the line of christopher horvers from jpmorgan. your line is open.
christian carlino -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. it's christian on for chris. on the long-term margin outlook, you had spoken to 280 to 290 basis points of inflation in your 2023 margin target. how are you thinking about both the magnitude of that as well as the mix of sg&a and gross margin impact?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. certainly, as we look at it in the short-term, we'll be exceeding that in terms of the inflation that we're seeing across the p&l. so that's the combination of input costs, product costs, transportation, wages, fuel, what have you. so, if we were to go back now and look at it, i think we would be adding more to that. but we also have opportunities in the form of really the category management. and in particular, we've been extremely pleased with our ability to pass this on in the form of price. so our strategic pricing has been proven to be able to offset that so far.
christian carlino -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. and then, in terms of the monthly cadence, could you speak to how diy and do-it-for-me trended through the quarter? and any comments on whether increasing inflation drove an acceleration in trends through the quarter?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, the short answer is, difm is continuing to recover as we expected, but we are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the diy business, which has pretty consistently performed above our expectations throughout the year. and the pro, once again, wasn't a surprise. we felt it was going to leave the way as people return to offices and school and started to travel again for both personal and business. these kind of consumer dynamics that were created by the pandemic created an increased need for people having their vehicle. it's been a positive on miles driven and our industry overall.
but in terms of diy, we've seen some interesting and also positive trends. you've got consumers picking up hobbies like they're detailing their cars. you've got people keeping their cars longer because they can't find a new one, they're buying recreational vehicles to visit parts of the country they've never seen before. and even in urban markets, you've got some people that have bought cars because they're no longer comfortable with mass transit. so it's difficult to say how sticky some of these trends are going to be, but we're seeing robust demand across both diy and difm. and we're excited by that. it's a very good time for the industry.
christian carlino -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. thank you for that and best of luck.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
our next question comes from the line of simeon gutman from morgan stanley. your line is open.
jacquelyn sussman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. this is jackie sussman on for simeon. we were wondering, we saw that operating income grew 7% to 8% in quarter three on a 3% comp. and if you continue to comp around this level, can ebit dollar growth be even stronger? i guess, the reason we're asking is to hit that high end of the 10.5% to 12.5% margin guidance by '23. does ebit need to grow quicker? thanks so much.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, first of all, just looking into the last quarter here, we've incorporated with the continued top line strength that we saw for the first four weeks, also balancing that with the ongoing inflationary headwinds and then up to another $10 million of start-up costs in the fourth quarter related to our west coast expansion. so, we maintain the first four weeks, we believe there would be upside to the full year results for 2021. i would keep in mind though that our fourth quarter is historically the most volatile. so we're being cautious there. over the longer-term, again, i would take you back to the april investor event. we're laser-focused on our margin expansion initiatives. i mean, we're very confident that as we continue to execute those, it will provide us the margin rates that we're looking for that will get us well into that 10.5% to 12.5%.
jacquelyn sussman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks so much. and just a quick follow-up. how should we think about supply chain costs in the context of achieving that 10.5% to 12.5% ebit margin target? does it kind of preclude from hitting the high end? thanks so much.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, we're continuing to execute our plans on supply chain. each of the big initiatives we have are going to play a role in taking unnecessary costs out of our supply chain. as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we are seeing inflation in basically wages in distribution centers, traffic and freight that are above what we expected. but that's not going to stop us from executing our plan. we're going to continue to execute all the initiatives. supply chain is a big part of taking costs out of our system and we're going to execute those plans over the next couple of years.
jacquelyn sussman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks so much. congrats on a great quarter.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks.

your next question comes from the line of zach fadem from wells fargo. your line is open.
zach fadem -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey. good morning. tom, can we start with your commentary about diy turning positive in the quarter. but first of all, did this include every period in the quarter as well as the quarter as a whole? and then, in terms of broader diy demand, is it fair to say that diy has improved on a two-year basis or is that trend decelerating?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, first of all, given the cadence as we talked about in our prepared remarks, zach, was pretty consistent through the quarter. we did see some acceleration toward the end of the quarter. in terms of diy overall, as i mentioned a minute ago, i mean, really, really pleased with the resiliency of it. it's really fun in there. a lot of the initiatives that we put in place over the last couple of years, including the launch of diehard, our battery business continues to perform well. it's a big category within diy. our speed perks loyalty program is gaining momentum. our percent of transactions increased in the quarter. and i think our field team is really executing well on the diy initiatives. so, i'm not going to comment on the two-year stack specifically, but it's been very resilient and we're very pleased with how it's going and we're going to continue to drive diy. it's an important part of our equation.
zach fadem -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. and then, on the impact of accelerating inflation, can you talk about any changes you're seeing to consumer behavior, volume or trade down as well as the competitive pricing landscape? and in your mind, is there a level of inflation out there where it gets to be too much and the consumer starts to push back?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, obviously, particularly in diy, where you do have an economically challenged customer, we're very cautious about that, top exactly to your point. the thing that i feel good about is, as we've made some transition into own brand products, we're able to offer products at a lower price point than we give people some options, right, to potentially purchase something that was more expensive from a national branded standpoint.
so, i mentioned the change with steering and suspension and engine management, we've got a terrific product that's at a lower price point. so that gives the customer some options that honestly we didn't have before. and we have the advantage of that being a much higher margin than the alternatives. so, i am concerned about it. we're going to watch it very closely. you want to make sure that when we're driving these initiatives that we're wary of what's the implication going to be on the price point. i mean, there's a comp catch, right. when the customer trades down, you've got a lower price per unit on some of these own brand products, but it gives the customer an alternative and it gives you an incremental transaction that you might not have otherwise been able to achieve.

your next question comes from the line of bret jordan from jefferies. your line is open.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
you're a 3.6% same-sku inflation sort of at sort of low end of the peer range, which is kind of running toward the 5s. i mean, how do you see the cadence of the inflation? are you still sort of picking up price as your supply chain costs are passed through? could you talk about where you see inflation maybe being into the fourth quarter and first half of '20 through '22?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. we definitely think the inflation is going to continue and it's going to be higher going into the fourth quarter. we are still seeing those cost increases coming through, so we absolutely anticipate that it will be higher. it will be higher than the 3.6% that we called out in the third quarter. for the year, we're still very comfortable with the range that we put out there of 2% to 4%. we're working through '22. we haven't given our guidance yet. we'll do that in february, but we certainly don't think that this turns off when the calendar turns to 2022. so, certainly in the first half, it's going to continue to be a challenge, but we're going to continue to work through that and we think we still have pricing capabilities to offset that.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. great. and on the chassis topic, it did sound like that was kind of tough in the quarter. it sounds like it's resolved itself. but do you have any ability to quantify maybe what the impact in chassis out-of-stock was on your comp?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, we're not going to break that out, bret. what i can tell you is, there's two elements there. there's the price per unit trade down, right, which was meaningful in the quarter. once again, the absolute dollars and the profit margin per unit, the profit margin rate per unit is very attractive, but the net sales per unit is just lower. and then, on the in-stock front, we made -- it's literally tens of thousands of skus, as we mentioned. so we made the change. we debated this as we exited last year and into this year. we knew it was going to be a big change. we're in the middle of the pandemic. the supply chain was a question mark a little bit, but the reality is we wanted to get this behind us. it's an important margin driver for our future margin expansion plans. it's a big tsr driver for us. and we're pleased that we're able to put the -- make that change in the time frame that we did.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
i guess, on that in-stock topic, if you think about your fill rates today versus where they were through the quarter, could you talk about the cadence of fill rates and maybe where we are versus target right now?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's definitely moved up significantly. since the middle of the summer, it's been steadily improving. every week, it gets better. i mean, obviously we've commissioned new suppliers to come in and make the carquest product. and again, i'm going to reiterate, this is a terrific product. our customers and our field team love the product. so, in terms of customer receptiveness, it's been extremely high. the return rates are much lower. so when we get it in across the board, we're in very, very good shape. so, there was a significant improvement though to your question, from, say, august, which is probably when it was the most challenged into now, which, as evidenced by our quarter-to-date sales, we feel pretty good about where we are now with a little bit of room to go to get it to where we want it to be.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. that statement applies to all inventory or just the chassis category august to present?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
it's really -- think about chassis and also engine management, that's the other big one.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
all right. but if you look at -- you just said inventory in general, would you say it is improving your total in-stocks?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. our inventory is strong in categories like brakes, batteries, filters, as i mentioned. i think relatively speaking, we track this versus peers all the time. and we feel very good about those categories. it was really the categories where we made this huge transition that were most challenged.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of seth basham from wedbush. your line is open.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
thanks a lot. and good morning. my question is around the implied operating [technical issues] for the fourth quarter. it implies a bit more of a step down than is typical this time of the year from the third quarter to the fourth quarter at least on a pre-pandemic basis. are there any things you can point to that are driving a more material step down in operating margin sequentially?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
overall, we're just trying to be very cautious in terms of how we approach the fourth quarter. as i said earlier, it's historically volatile. we do know we're going to have start-up costs in the fourth quarter similar to what we saw in the third quarter, which is not something you would have seen last year. and we think that could be up to $10 million. so that would certainly be something that we have contemplated as part of that fourth quarter. but as we said, we got off to a great start. and certainly if we were to maintain that -- maintain the first four weeks, we believe there would certainly be upside. so, right now, we're just being very cautious given the volatility of the fourth quarter.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
got it. thank you. and my follow-up question is around capitalized supply chain costs has been an important driver of gross margins in the recent quarters. i don't think you called it out this quarter. can you give us some insight into what's happening with that metric and how to think about it over the next couple of quarters?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
sure. for the quarter, it was actually fairly small. it was a slight tailwind, but really nothing significant to call out. we expect that's going to continue into the fourth quarter. we'll give more insights to '22 in february. but i would expect something similar in the fourth quarter that we saw in the third quarter. the real driver of gross profit are the category management items that we pointed out strategic pricing, strategic sourcing and the introduction of the owned brands. and these are all things that we have a lot of control over, we feel really good about it.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
great to hear. thanks a lot and good luck.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, seth.

your next question comes from the line of michael montani from evercore isi. your line is open.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking the question. just wanted to ask on the fourth quarter guidance, i was getting to around a 4%, 4.5% comp kind of being implied, which suggests maybe like a 1% to 3% comp for the rest of the quarter. just wanted to see if there's anything in particular we should be mindful of or if it speaks more to kind of the volatility that you all have been mentioning?
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, it really speaks to the volatility. like i said, we want to be cautious going into the fourth quarter. it's our lowest revenue quarter of the year. so when we've got a fixed cost in sg&a, like we have, having that lower top line revenue makes it a little bit harder to flow it through and we just want to be cautious. we've seen volatility in the past. and while we're off to a great start, we would want to make sure that we're being cautious as we finish out the year.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. thanks. and then, for the follow-up, if i could, on the third quarter comp, can you give some extra color in terms of what happened with transaction counts, if possible, for diy and difm? was the 3.1% comp basically all the 3.6% inflation or was there also some impact there as well?
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, our transactions were down in the quarter primarily due to diy, which is the majority of our total transactions, michael. if you remember, last year we had very robust transaction growth in diy. on the pro side, our sales per account up double-digits. and if i look at our transactions with the largest segment of accounts, it was up significantly on both a one and two-year basis. the big strategic accounts, our technet customers, we're really pleased to be growing our share of wallet with our biggest accounts because that really drives more loyalty. it means we're selling more of the whole job to the customer. there's obviously a lot of variables that go into the transaction growth, changing vehicle technology, shipping channel dynamics. we love to get the whole job in one transaction for our pro customers, which is always the goal. so, we're very focused on growing both transactions and dollars per transaction, but that's kind of what happened in the quarter.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. good luck.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, michael.

and we have reached our allotted time for questions. mr. tom greco, i turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks for joining us today. we're very excited to finish up the year strong. the industry fundamentals are healthy and we're continuing to execute against our long-term strategic plans. and we also have a lot to be grateful for. i'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank all of our nation's military heroes for their service, including the thousands of advance team members who currently or have previously served. advance is proud to honor these men and women through their incredible events as one our service team network posted last week as we continue to celebrate our veterans through our continued partnership with organizations that help support service members, including building homes for heroes.
with that, take care, stay healthy and safe. and i wish you and your families a happy thanksgiving holiday. we're grateful for your ongoing support and we look forward to sharing our 2021 results and 2022 guidance in february. thank you.

now, let me turn the call over to tom greco.
tom greco -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, elisabeth. and good morning to all of you joining us today. as always, we hope that you and your families are healthy and safe.
i'd like to start by thanking the advance team and carquest independents for their hard work and perseverance through these challenging times. their continued dedication to provide outstanding service to our customers allowed us to deliver another quarter of top line sales growth, adjusted margin expansion and a double-digit increase in earnings per share.
we've been investing in both our team and our business over multiple years to transform and better leverage advance's assets. in q3, this helped enable us to comp the comp on top of our strongest quarterly comparable store sales growth of 2020. specifically, we delivered comp store sales growth of 3.1%, while sustaining an identical two-year stack of 13.3% compared with q2. as expected, this was led by the continued recovery of our professional business and a gradual improvement in key urban markets.
by putting diy consumers and pro customers at the center of every decision we make, we've been able to respond quickly to evolving needs. in q3, this was highlighted by an overall channel shift back to professional and a return to stores for diyers. within professional, we're seeing increasing strength in certain geographies, which, like the rest of the country last year as the ongoing return to office of professional workers in large urban markets, catches up with the rest of the country.
our diversified digital and physical asset base has enabled us to respond rapidly to these changing channel dynamics in the current environment. in addition, we also delivered significant improvements in our adjusted gross margin rate of 246 basis points, led by our category management initiatives.
our adjusted sg&a costs as a percentage of net sales were 209 basis points higher as we lapped a unique quarter in q3 2020. as we've discussed over the past year, our sg&a costs were much lower than normal in q2 and q3 of 2020. this was due to an unusually high diy sales mix and actions we took last year during the initial stages of the pandemic, which were not repeated. overall, we delivered adjusted operating income margin expansion of 37 basis points to 10.4% versus q3 2020.
adjusted diluted eps of $3.21 increased 21.6% compared with q3 2020 and 31% compared with the same period of 2019. our year-to-date adjusted earnings per share are up approximately 50% compared with 2020. year-to-date, our balance sheet remains strong with a 19% increase in free cash flow to $734 million, while returning a record $953 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividend.
consistent with the front half of the year, there were several industry-related factors, coupled with operational improvements, contributing to our sales growth and margin expansion in q3. as discussed in our april investor presentation, the three primary external drivers of industry demand are still improving versus prior year and the outlook remains positive.
the car park continues to grow slightly. the fleet is aging and perhaps most importantly vehicle miles driven continue to improve versus both 2020 and 2019. more broadly, the chip shortage continues to impact availability of new vehicles and is contributing to a surge in used car sales. this benefits our industry as consumers are repairing and maintaining their vehicles longer.
as we all know, over the last 18 months, the pandemic changed consumer behavior across our industry, which led to a surge in diy omnichannel growth in 2020, while the professional business declined. however, as the economy continues to reopen, with miles driven steadily increasing, our professional business is now consistently exceeding pre-pandemic levels as discussed last quarter.
regional performance was led by the southwest and west. category growth was led by brakes, motor oil and filters as miles driven reliant categories improved versus the softer 2020. we also saw continued strength in diehard batteries, which led the way on a two-year stack basis. each of these categories performed well as a result of the diligent planning between our merchant and supply chain teams, enabling a strong competitive position despite global supply chain disruptions.
at the same time, we experienced challenges in q3 as we strategically transitioned tens of thousands of undercar and engine management skus to own brand. importantly, these in-stock positions are now significantly improved and we're confident these initiatives will help drive future margin expansion.
overall, comp sales were positive in all three periods of q3, led by professional. diy omnichannel delivered slightly positive comp growth in q3, while lapping high double-digit growth than the prior year. within professional, we navigated a very challenging global supply chain environment to allow us to say yes to our customers. the investments we've made in our supply chain, inventory positioning and in our dynamic assortment tool help put us in a favorable position competitively. we've implemented the dynamic assortment tool in all company-owned us stores as well as over 800 independent locations.
our myadvance portal and embedded advance pro catalog continues to be a differentiator for us, while driving online traffic. our online sales to professional customers continues to grow as we strengthen the speed and functionality of advance pro. we remain committed to providing our industry-leading assortment of parts for all professional customers. this will help enable us to grow first call status and increase share of wallet in a very fragmented market.
in addition, we expanded diehard to our professional customers. following a recent independent consumer survey, diehard stake disclaims as america's most trusted auto battery. during q3, we announced a multi-year agreement with our national customer bridgestone to sell diehard batteries in more than 2,200 tire and vehicle service centers across the united states. with this systemwide rollout during q3, we replaced their previous battery provider, making us the exclusive battery supplier across all bridgestone locations.
in terms of our independent business, we added 16 net new independent carquest stores in the quarter, bringing our total to 44 net new this year. we continue to grow our independent business through differentiated offerings for our carquest partners, including our new carquest by advance banner program, which we announced earlier this month. as we continue to build and strengthen the advance brand and our diy business, carquest by advance adds diy relevance for our carquest-branded independent partners, while providing incremental traffic and margin opportunities. we've recently enrolled this new initiative out to our independent partners and look forward to further expansion over time for both new and existing carquest independents.
transitioning to diy omnichannel, comparable store sales were slightly positive in q3. as you'll recall, our diy omnichannel business reported strong double-digit comp sales growth in q3 2020. we continue to enhance our offerings and execute our long-term strategy to differentiate our diy business and increased market share. in q3, we continue to leverage our speed perks loyalty program as vip membership grew by 13% and our number of elite members, representing the highest tier of customer spend, increased 21%.
last year, the launch of our advance same day suite of services helped enable a huge surge in e-commerce growth. this year, as diyers return to our stores, in-store sales growth led our diy sales growth. part of this was expected due to a planned reduction in inefficient online discounts, which significantly increased gross margins.
turning to margin expansion. we again increased our adjusted operating income margin in the quarter. like q2, this was driven by category management actions within gross margin, where our key initiatives played a role. first, we are realizing benefits from our new strategic pricing tools and capabilities. like other companies, we're experiencing higher-than-expected inflation. however, our team has been able to respond rapidly in this dynamic environment as industry pricing remains rational. behind strategic sourcing, vendor income was positive versus the previous year with continued strong sales growth.
finally, double-digit revenue growth in own brand outpaced our overall growth in the quarter as we expanded the carquest brand into new category. carquest products have a lower price per unit than comparable branded products, which reduced comp and net sales growth in the quarter as expected. at the same time, the margin rate for own brands is much higher and contributed to the q3 adjusted gross margin expansion.
shifting to supply chain. we continue to make progress on our productivity initiatives. in q3, the benefits from these initiatives were more than offset by widely documented disruptions and inflationary pressure within the global supply chain. as a result, we did not leverage supply chain in the quarter. we completed the rollout of cross-banner replenishment, or cbr, for the originally planned group of stores in the quarter. the completion of this milestone is driving cost savings through a reduction in stem miles from our dcs to stores. over the course of our implementation, our team identified additional stores that will be added over time.
secondly, we're continuing the implementation of our new warehouse management system, or wms. this is helping to deliver further improvements in fill rate, on-hand accuracy and productivity. we successfully transitioned to our new wms in approximately 36% of our distribution center network as measured by unit volume. as previously communicated, we follow wms with a new labor management system, or lms, which drive standardization and productivity. we are on track to complete the wms and lms implementations by the end of 2023 as discussed in april.
further, our consolidation efforts to integrate worldpac and autopart international, known as ai, are also on track to be completed by early next year. this is enabling accelerated growth, gross margin expansion and sg&a savings. gross margin expansion here comes behind the expanded distribution of ai's high margin owned brand products, such as shocks and struts, to the larger worldpac customer base.
finally, as we expand our store footprint, we're also enhancing our supply chain capabilities on the west coast with the addition of a much larger and more modern dc in san bernardino. this facility will serve as the consolidation point for supplier shipments for the western us and enable rapid e-commerce delivery. in addition, we began to work to consolidate our dc network in the greater toronto area. two separate distribution centers, one carquest and one worldpac will be transitioned into a single brand-new facility that will allow us to better serve growing demand in the ontario market.
turning to sg&a. we continue to execute our initiatives, both sales and profit per store along with the reduction of corporate sg&a. as previewed on our q2 call, we also faced both planned and unplanned inflationary cost pressure versus the prior year in q3. sg&a headwinds include higher than planned store labor cost per hour, higher incentive compensation and increased delivery costs associated with the recovery of our professional business. jeff will discuss these and other sg&a details in a few minutes. we remain on track with our sales and profit per store initiative, including our average sales per store objective of $1.8 million per store by 2023.
in terms of new locations year-to-date, we've opened 19 stores, six new worldpac branches and converted 44 net new locations to the carquest independent family. this puts our net new locations at 69, including stores, branches and independents during the first three quarters. separately, we're actively working to convert the 109 locations in california we announced in april.
however, we're experiencing construction-related delays, primarily due to a much slower-than-normal permitting process. this is attributable to more stringent guidelines associated with covid-19, which were exacerbated by the surge of the delta variant. we now expect the majority of the store openings planned for 2021 to shift into 2022. as a result, we're incurring start-up costs within sg&a for the balance of the year, while realizing less than planned revenue and income. the good news is, we remain confident that once converted, these stores will be accretive to our growth trajectory.
the final area of margin expansion is reducing our corporate and other sg&a costs. we began to realize some of the cost benefits related to the restructuring of our corporate functions announced earlier this year, in addition to savings from our continued focus on team member safety.
in q3, we saw a 22% reduction in our total recordable injury rate compared with the prior year. our lost time injury rate improved 14% compared with the same period in 2020. our focus on team member safety is only one component of our esg agenda at advance.
our vision advancing a world in motion is demonstrated by the objective we outlined last april to deliver top quartile total shareholder return in the 2021 through 2023 timeframe. while delivering this goal, we're also focused on esg. as part of this commitment, we launched our first materiality assessment earlier this year to help prioritize esg initiatives. during q3, we completed this assessment and are working to finalize the findings. the results will be incorporated in our 2021 corporate sustainability report, which we expect to publish in mid-2022.
before turning the call over to jeff, i want to recognize all team members and generous customers for their contribution to our recent american heart association campaign. this year, we introduced a new technology solution in stores that allows customers to round up at the point of sale. this made it even easier for customers to participate and helped us achieve a record-setting campaign of $1.7 million. the mission of this organization is important to all of us across the advance family. and i want to personally thank everyone for helping making this our most successful campaign to-date.
with that, i'll turn it over to jeff for more details on our financial performance.
jeff shepherd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, tom. and good morning. i would like to start by thanking our team members who prioritize the health and safety of our customers and fellow team members while continuing to deliver exceptional results through an uncertain and challenging times.
in q3, our net sales increased 3.1% to $2.6 billion. adjusted gross profit margin improved 246 basis points to 46.2%, primarily the result of our ongoing category management initiatives, including strategic pricing, strategic sourcing, own brand expansion and favorable product mix. consistent with last quarter, these were partially offset by inflationary product and supply chain costs as well as an unfavorable channel mix.
in the quarter, same sku inflation was approximately 3.6%, which was part of [phonetic] our plan entering the year and was by far the largest headwind we had to overcome within gross profit. we're working with all our supplier partners to mitigate costs where possible.
year-to-date, adjusted gross margin improved 184 basis points compared with the same period of 2020. as expected, our q3 sg&a expenses increased due to several factors we discussed earlier in the year. as a percent of net sales, our adjusted sg&a deleveraged by 209 basis points, driven primarily by labor costs, which included a meaningful cost per hour increase as well as higher incentive compensation compared to the prior year.
in addition, we incurred higher delivery expenses related to serving our professional customers and approximately $10 million in start-up costs related to the conversion of our california locations in q3. year-to-date, sg&a as a percent of net sales was relatively flat compared to the same period of 2020, increasing 9 basis points year-over-year.
while we've reduced our covid-19-related costs by $13 million year-to-date, the health and safety of our team members and customers continues to be our top priority. our adjusted operating income increased to $274 million in q3 compared to $256 million one year ago. on a rate basis, our adjusted oi margin expanded by 37 basis points to 10.4%. finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21.6% to $3.21 compared to $2.64 in q3 of 2020. compared with 2019, adjusted diluted eps was up 31% in the quarter.
our free cash flow for the first nine months of the year was $734 million, an increase of 19% versus last year. this increase was primarily driven by improvements in our operating income as well as our continued focus on working capital metrics, including our accounts payable ratio, which expanded 351 basis points versus q3 2020. year-to-date through q3, our capital investments were $191 million.
we continue to focus on maintaining sufficient liquidity, while returning excess cash to shareholders. in q3, we returned approximately $228 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares at an average price of $205.65. year-to-date, we've returned approximately $792 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of nearly 4.2 million shares at an average price of $189.43. since restarting our share repurchase program in q3 of 2018, we returned over $2 billion in share repurchases at an average share price of approximately $164. additionally, we paid a cash dividend of $1 per share in the quarter totaling $63 million.
as we mentioned in our press release yesterday, our board once again approved a quarterly cash dividend of $1 per share. we remain confident in our ability to generate meaningful cash from our business and expect to return excess cash to our shareholders in a balanced approach between dividends and buybacks.
as you saw in the yesterday's 8-k filing with the sec, we recently closed the refinancing of our new five-year revolving credit facility. the prior facility was set to mature in january 2023. and the bank markets have returned to pre-pandemic levels, we took the opportunity to secure our liquidity for another five years. this included improved pricing and terms while also increasing the overall facility size to $1.2 billion. we have strong relationships with our banks. and this commitment allows us to secure future financial flexibility. more details of this facility can be found in our 8-k filings.
turning to our updated full year outlook. we are increasing 2021 sales and profit guidance to reflect the positive results year-to-date and our expectations for the balance of the year. through the first four weeks of q4, we're continuing to see sales strength in our two-year stack, remaining in line with what we delivered in the last two quarters. this guidance incorporates continued top-line strength, ongoing inflationary headwinds and up to an additional $10 million in start-up costs in q4 related to our west coast expansion.
as discussed, the construction environment in california remains challenging, resulting in a reduction of our guidance from new store openings and capital expenditures. as a result, we're updating our full year 2021 guidance to net sales of $10.9 billion to $10.95 billion, comparable store sales of 9.5% to 10%, adjusted operating income margin rate of 9.4% to 9.5%, a minimum of 30 new stores this year, a minimum of $275 million in capex and a minimum of $725 million in free cash flow.
in summary, we're very excited about our current momentum. we remain focused on the execution of the long-term strategy, while delivering top quartile total shareholder return over the 2021 to 2023 time frame.
now, let's open the call for your questions. operator?
