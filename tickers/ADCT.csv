it is now my pleasure to pass the call over to our ceo, chris martin. chris? 
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, amanda, and thank you all for joining us this morning. we made tremendous progress over the last year at adc therapeutics. we reported several meaningful data readouts across our programs at key medical meetings such as eha and ash. advanced our promising development pipeline of potent and targeted antibody drug conjugates for patients.
we built out our commercial team and infrastructure and finance the company to ensure we can execute on our goals and objectives. during the fourth quarter, we saw much of this hard work come together when we received fda acceptance of our bla submission for our deep product candidate lonca. the treatment of relapsed or refractory dlbcl. as we approach our may 21 pdufa date and the planned commercial launch, we are ensuring that we are well-prepared across our commercial, medical affairs, cmc and support functions.
i'll share more about our launch preparations in a moment. for our second lead program cami, we completed enrollment in our pivotal trial, bringing us one step closer to potentially addressing an unmet need in heavily pretreated hodgkin lymphoma patients. we look forward to reporting updated interim data from the trial in the first half of this year. jay will go into more detail on the cami program shortly.
we also had a very productive research pipeline at adc therapeutics, and we are continuing to invest in our research portfolio. to support this effort, we are moving our london-based research team to a new state-of-the-art antibody drug conjugate research center at the translation & innovation hub, or i-hub, of imperial college in central london. research center will enable further innovation, including the advancement of our adc platform and pipeline of 7 preclinical and research stage programs. as we continue to build out our global footprint, we announced in december the formation and launch of a new joint venture, overland adct biopharma, to develop and commercialize four of adct's product candidates for hematologic and solid tumors in greater china and singapore.
i would now like to give you a more in-depth update for lonca and our launch preparations. in november, the fda accepted our bla filing for lonca and granted priority review with a pdufa target date of may 21, 2021. as we have previously discussed, this submission is based on data from our pivotal phase 2 trial lotis 2, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of lonca in patients with relapsed or refractory dlbcl, following 2 or more lines of prior systemic therapy. the data demonstrates significant single-agent activity and durability as well as manageable toxicities across a broad population of relapsed or refractory dlbcl patients, including patients with difficult-to-treat disease.
we are finalizing our preparations for lonca's launch subject to approval. we have deployed a highly experienced and focused oncology field medical affairs team, who has been very successfully engaging with thought leaders, academic medical centers and community leaders across the country. we're very encouraged with the access to leading dlbcl clinicians and the valuable insights we have gained through these interactions. our sales force is fully onboard and making the final preparations for anticipated launch.
we have recruited a national sales force of seasoned oncology professionals with deep hematological experience, strong local networks and the experience to effectively communicate the lonca value proposition. our launch plans include customer engagement ranging from purely virtual to hybrid to face-to-face interactions. and our teams are ready and well positioned to engage all of our customers with an individual approach respecting local and institutional guidelines as well as the customer preference. we have developed multichannel communications to ensure that all key audiences, physicians, nurses, office managers, payers and patients receive the necessary information and support to ensure the open access and safe administration of lonca.
our account directors and msls have begun appropriate discussions with payers and other key stakeholders regarding the unmet medical needs in patients with dlbcl. as our cross-functional teams have met with access stakeholders, our msls have been able to address questions about the differentiated profile of lonca. the 10,500 third-line plus dlbcl patients estimated in the u.s. and eu create a market size of $1 billion.
and we believe that lonca's differentiated profile creates an opportunity for it to become the standard of care in third line. we are also on track from a cmc perspective. all of our contract manufacturers are highly experienced. for example, avid, lonza and bsp, and all have been previously inspected by regulatory agencies.
we're also implementing our third-party supply logistics in the u.s. to ensure our launch readiness. in addition to our launch preparations, we have also made important progress toward realizing the full potential of lonca through our life cycle development efforts. we are fully developing lonca to move into earlier lines of treatment and new indications in the future.
i will now hand the call over to our chief medical officer, jay feingold, who will discuss this as well as cami and our earlier-stage programs in greater detail. jay?
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
thank you, chris and good morning. i am pleased to present an update today on both the clinical and preclinical programs. starting with our lead program, lonca. as chris mentioned, we see great opportunity to expand the addressable patient population.
updated data from our lotis 2 single arm open-label and 145 patient phase 2 clinical trial was presented at the recent ash meeting in december. these data continue to demonstrate market significant and durable antitumor activity. based on the robust single-agent activity, we are currently advancing multiple clinical trials evaluating lonca in combinations with earlier lines of therapy in dlbcl and in additional histologies. first among these studies is our ongoing pivotal phase 2 lotis 3 trial and lonca combined with ibrutinib for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma, which is intended to support the submission of a supplemental bla.
interim data for this trial were presented at ash and showed encouraging efficacy and manageable toxicity and overall response rate of 62.9% across all patients and 67% in non-gcb dlbcl patients. enrollment for the pivotal phase 2 portion of the trial is ongoing with 26 out of 66 non-gcb patients enrolled as of february 12. we expect to report additional data from the phase 1 portion of this trial in the first half of this year. we also initiated our phase iii lotis 5 clinical trial of lonca in combination with rituximab.
this confirmatory trial is designed to fulfill our post-marketing requirement to the fda for a full approval, if accelerated approval is received through relapsed or refractory dlbcl. those describe is also intended to support a supplemental bla for lonca as a second-line therapy to relapsed or refractory dlbcl patients, who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. the trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of lonca in combination with rituximab versus standard immunochemotherapy and the primary endpoint is progression-free survival. in order to ensure that all allegeable patients have access to lonca at the start of 2021, we initiated an expanded access program for patients in the united states with relapsed or refractory dlbcl.
the fda-approved program requires treating physicians in the u.s. to request access to patients who can not be treated by currently available drugs, cell therapy or clinical trials. we intend to initiate several additional market trials this year. first, we plan to commence a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial in follicular lymphoma in the first half.
in addition, we will also evaluate lonca in multiple combinations in b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma. finally, we plan to initiate a dose-finding study of lonca in combination with r-chop in first line dlbcl. all of these trials will accelerate the development of lonca in the earlier lines of therapy across b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma. moving to our second lead program, cami.
we have made progress across both our hl and solid tumor programs. we completed enrollment in our phase 2 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma. interim data from this trial were presented at ash with data as of august 24, 2020, included 51 treated patients who've had a meeting of 7 prior lines of therapy. these data were consistent with the phase 1 trial, demonstrating encouraging single agent standard antitumor activity.
the overall response rate for this patient population was 83% with a complete response rate of 38.3%. no other safety signals were observed and a trend with regard to guillain-barre syndrome remains unchanged, suggesting cami's potential to offer an effective treatment with a management safety profile to address an unmet medical need in heavily pretreated patients. as of january 29, the 117 patients were enrolled in the trial. updated data from this trial expected in the first half of 2021, and we expect these data support an fda bla submission through relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma.
in addition to our hl program, in late 2020, we dosed our first patient with cami in combination with pembrolizumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, in ongoing phase 1b clinical trial in patients with selected advanced solid tumors. the multicenter, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of cami as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. the trial was expanded into a combination arm as a result of encouraging pd and biomarker data presented at the esmo congress in september 2020. enrollment is ongoing.
in our earlier stage pipeline, md anderson continues to enroll a phase 1/2 trial of adct-602, targeting cd22, in relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia. we are also preparing to initiate a phase 1b combination trial with adct-601, targeting axl, in patients with certain solid tumors in the second half of 2021. in addition, we've planned to submit an ind for adct-901, targeting kaag1, for the treatment of advanced solid tours with high unmet local need in the first half of 2021. and finally, we have a robust r&d pipeline with 7 programs in preclinical development.
with that, i will turn the call over to jen to give a financial update.
jen creel -- chief financial officer
thank you, jay and good morning, everyone. as we reported in our press release, we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $439.2 million as compared to approximately $115.6 million as of december 31, 2019. we used approximately $51.7 million in net cash for operating activities in the fourth quarter and $168.7 million in net cash for the full-year 2020. we expect our spend to continue to increase over the next few quarters, funded by our strong balance sheet, as we prepare for the anticipated launch of lonca and continue to invest in our broad pipeline.
r&d expenses were $48.6 million for the fourth quarter and $142 million for the full-year ended december 31, 2020, compared to $30.4 million and $107.5 million for the same quarter and full-year 2019. the increase for the quarter and for the full year was primarily due to the growth of our r&d organization to support the lonca bla submission, medical affairs, prelaunch activities and multiple lonca and cami clinical programs. during the fourth quarter of 2020, we started to present sales and marketing expenses as a separate line item, in anticipation of the commercial launch of lonca. sales and marketing expenses were $9.4 million for the quarter and $22.1 million for the full year ended december 31, 2020.
the company did not incur a material amount of sales and marketing expenses during the quarter and full year ended december 31, 2019. and those 2019 expenses were classified as general and administrative. the increase in sales and marketing-related to the build-out of the company's commercial organization and investments in preparation for the anticipated launch of lonca in mid-2021. g&a expenses were $20.1 million for the quarter and $55.1 million for the full year ended december 31, 2020, compared to $5.3 million and $14.2 million for the same quarter and year-end 2019.
the increase was primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense and the cost of being a public company. our net loss was $55.9 million for the fourth quarter and $246.3 million for the full year ended december 31, 2020, compared to $35.3 million and $116.5 million for the same quarter and full-year 2019. net loss was impacted by share-based compensation expense of $15.4 million for the fourth quarter and $42.9 million for the full-year 2020. we also recognized a gain of $24.5 million during the quarter and full year ended december 31, 2020, related to our contribution of intellectual property to the overland adct biopharma joint venture.
the net loss for the full year ended december 31, 2020, also includes a noncash charge of $45.4 million related to the changes in fair value of derivatives associated with the convertible loans under the convertible credit facility with deerfield. the year-to-date increase in fair value was driven by the increase in the company's share price since its initial public offering in may 2020. our diluted net loss per share was $0.73 in the fourth quarter and $3.77 for the full-year 2020 compared to $0.69 and $2.36 in the fourth quarter and full-year 2019. finally, our adjusted net loss excludes certain items, including the deerfield convertible loan, share-based compensation and the gain related to the contribution of ip to the overland adct biopharma joint venture.
adjusted net loss was $63 million for the fourth quarter and $176.1 million for the full-year 2020 compared to $34.5 million and $115.4 million in the same quarter and full-year 2019. the adjusted diluted net loss per share was $0.82 for the quarter and $2.69 for the year ending december 31, 2020, compared to $0.68 and $2.34 for the same quarter and full-year 2019. with that, i will turn the call back to chris for closing remarks. chris?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, jen. as i said earlier in the call, this year has been a remarkable one for adct, and we are eager to maintain this momentum going forward. as we are working to ensure that we are well prepared for the successful launch of lonca, if approved, we are also excited about advancing the other programs in our pipeline. to expand lonca to earlier lines of therapy, in the first half of 2021, we expect to begin a pivotal phase 2 trial in follicular lymphoma.
and the first-line dose-finding study with r-chop. we will also report updated data from the phase 1 trial of lonca in combination with ibrutinib in relapsed or refractory dlbcl as well as complete involvement in the pivotal phase 2 expansion portion of this study. later in the year, we expect to report data from the safety leading of the phase iii lotis 5 confirmatory trial in combination with rituximab. moving to cami, we await interim results from the pivotal phase 2 trial in hl in the first half of the year and continued enrollment for the phase 1b clinical trial of cami in combination with pembro for the treatment of select advanced solid tumors.
in our earlier-stage clinical programs, we will continue patient enrollment in the ongoing phase 1 study of adct-602, targeting cd22, in acute lymphocytic leukemia, and we plan to start a phase 1b combination study of adct-601, targeting axl, in multiple solid tumors in the second half of this year. lastly, we continue to advance our preclinical assets and anticipate an r&d submission for adct-901, targeting kaag1, in the first half of 2021. i look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. and we'll now open the call for questions.

[operator instructions]. our first question comes from tazeen ahmad with bank of america. you may proceed with your question.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hello. good morning. thank you for taking my question. chris, just wanted to get your thoughts on how interactions with fda are going as you approach your first pdufa? there have been instances recently of some surprise feedback from ca, especially across multiple therapeutic areas.
and so with that in mind, i think investors are going to be keenly interested in hearing about how your discussions are going? and if you think you are on track to an uneventful, hopefully pdufa, in the middle of the year? and then secondly, can you just remind us of how big is an initial commercial team you will launch with lonca? how much of your commercial endeavors will initially be virtual? and how we should think about the early ramp expectations? thank you.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
good morning, tazeen. thank you for those questions. i'll ask jay to answer the first question because he's daily interacting with it. and perhaps, jennifer can then jump in on the commercial side.
jay?
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
sure. with regard to the fda, we've been very actively engaged with them. the process is moving along nicely. there have been absolutely no issues to date.
we have no reason to anticipate any problems with either site business to manufacturing facilities or to clinical sites. everything is going on very well.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, jay. for your visits, are the visits virtual to the sites? or are they in-person?
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
look, sort of a combination, and i'll leave it at that.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer -- analyst
tazeen, this is jennifer. thanks for your questions around the commercialization of lonca. i think i have mentioned before that we have built an entire commercial organization and infrastructure to enable launch on our own, and we're very excited about that opportunity to bring lonca to patients. we have a customer-facing team that's over 70 highly skilled individuals deepen with oncology, hematology experience that spans market access, medical affairs and sales and we've sized our organization to cover more than 90% of the dlbcl opportunity.
in terms of our deployment or how we're going to deploy? we've trained all of these teams already to launch lonca in a hybrid environment, which is going to include, as chris mentioned in his earlier remarks, purely virtual engagement through hybrid and then opportunistic face-to-face meetings and the teams are actually already been operating in this hybrid approach. and we think that we're going to monitor it carefully as we go through the launch, and it's fairly dynamic, and it's variable across the country, but we're going to be very opportunistic in managing and monitoring the end market performance very carefully. in terms of the launch update, we're confident and prepared that we believe lonca represents a meaningful treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory dlbcl. as i've alluded to, we've got a sophisticated plan to maximize that uptake, and we expect the launch to be very successful and well received by customers and patients and payers.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. maybe just one quick follow-up. in your discussions with physicians, have they been talking about patients during covid, reducing their business and seeing physicians with less frequency? we have heard that some other oncology companies, as difficult as that might seem, people are skipping important appointments. and so just wanted to get a sense if you're hearing that?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer -- analyst
yes. i really think it depends on the specific tumor types that you're talking about. i think in the relapsed/refractory dlbcl setting, because of the aggressive nature of the disease, we have not heard that type of patient behavior, if you will, from physicians directly, but i do -- i am aware that other companies have made mention that covid, because of patient visits, has interrupted their business to some extent. but we do not expect that, particularly as the country is opening up a little bit more.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matthew harrison of morgan stanley. you may proceed with your question.
matthew harrison -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i guess just one follow-up to the commentary you made about the site visits. has there been -- i guess, specifically, has there been a manufacturing inspection? or is there one scheduled? and just if you could comment on that? and then i guess two other questions.
first, on -- i believe, in your prepared remarks, i heard you make a comment about a frontline study with r-chop. could you just talk about what sort of -- i guess what sort of signal you would look for an early study to make an investment there? because, obviously, a pivotal study there would be quite long and quite expensive. and then secondarily, i guess, could you comment on the cd25 solid-tumor combination study. and i guess the real question here is, how are you -- or what are you going to look for in that initial study to figure out if you're getting incremental activity versus the pd-1? thanks.
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
ok. so matt, if i forget any of those questions just remind me.
matthew harrison -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok.
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
with regard to the first question, we've not provided much detail with regard to fda interactions. but i think it's fair to say that as far as you know, all of the fda's investigation notice of our manufacturing is complete. so can we leave it at that for the moment?
matthew harrison -- morgan stanley -- analyst
sure. sure. thank you.
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
in terms of lonca plus r-chop, it's a really great question. the first thing i could point out is can you give lonca in addition to r-chop? and so it's a dose-finding study, and depending on what sort of signal we see, then we have to identify which population of frontline patients who want to go to, is it the broad population or a specific subpopulation. but first, we need to see -- first and foremost, can we get the two together. as you know, i'm not a fan of eliminating the parts of r-chop, but rather adding to it would be my preference, if it's possible.
and then can you remind me what the third question was? i'm sorry.
matthew harrison -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. so the third question was basically cami plus pd-1 and that phase 1 study that you're starting, how are you going to -- what are you going to look at in terms of either clinical data or biomarkers to figure out if you're getting incremental activity over pd-1 in those solid-tumor patients?
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
yeah. that's a great question. thanks. so where is pd-1 is approved, obviously, we have to see some incremental improvement in response above what pd-1 is going to do itself.
so in tumor types where it's approved, that's what you'd expect to see. when it's not approved, it had been studied in many different tumors where it's not approved, but there's data, right? so again, we would have to be able to show against literature where it's available, while we're hearing anything in terms of responsiveness. the other place we have to look, of course, is that durability of response, which is always, of course, extremely important in clinical benefit beyond just responding. so i think those are the things we're really looking for.
we are doing a variety of biomarker studies as part of the study, and we'll have more to say on that in the future.
matthew harrison -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from konstantinos aprilakis with stifel. you may proceed with your question.
konstantinos aprilakis -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for taking my question. i've got a few on lotis 3 and then one on the competitive landscape. so first, on the pivotal phase two portion of lotis 3, you're guiding to enrollment completion in the first half of this year, that seems to be ahead of schedule since you only initiated dosing in july of last year.
can you comment on the pace of enrollment for that trial and perhaps what is driving its liquidity? and should we expect initial data from this trial by year-end? and then i'll wait for the follow-up for the next question.
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
thanks for not stretching my memory. so in terms of the first question, the enrollment, let's say, has been studied. i can't -- i don't recall predicting that enrollment would take longer than the first half. but i remain optimistic we can still complete enrollment this year.
this study is going to require some follow-up of the response data. so i don't think at this point i can advise on when we might see data from that trial -- from the phase 2 part of that trial.
konstantinos aprilakis -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. got it. and then on the competitive landscape, just earlier this week, your competitor in the dlbcl space posted -- provided revenue guidance for 2021 fell short of consensus. what learnings have you been able to glean from monjuvi's recent entry into the dlbcl market, both with respect to impact from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic in positioning with community oncologists versus academic centers?
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
i'll leave that to jennifer.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer -- analyst
yes, thanks. konstantinos, thanks for the question. yeah, i mean in terms of the learnings that we've had as we've been monitoring the landscape, i mean, it's a really exciting time to be in relapse/refractory dlbcl. and over the last say 18 to 24 months, there have been a couple of new options for patients, which is exciting and really good news for patients.
and i think it also underlies the continuing unmet medical need. in relapsed/refractory dlbcl. i think that with lonca, we have a unique opportunity because we have a differentiated profile. as we put our profile even against the competitors in front of treating physicians, both academic and community, the profile is resonating with them as a real-world example of the patients that they're treating every day.
and so we are very excited about the opportunity, hopefully, in this very near future to bring lonca to physicians and patients. we are confident in our plans, and we are just looking for fda approval so that we are -- we are ready for launch right now, but we'll have to wait for fda approval.
konstantinos aprilakis -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
all right. thanks, guys. looking forward to it.

good morning, and welcome to the adc therapeutics first-quarter results 2021 financial call. my name is cheryl, and i will be your operator for today's call. [operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to amanda hamilton, you may begin.
amanda hamilton -- manager, investor relations
thank you, operator. this morning, we issued a press release announcing our first-quarter 2021 financial results and business update. this release is available on the adct website at ir.adctherapeutics.com under the press releases section. on today's call, chris martin, chief executive officer; jennifer herron, our chief commercial officer; jay feingold, chief medical officer; and jenn creel, chief financial officer, will discuss recent business highlights and review our first-quarter 2021 financial results before opening the call for questions.

it is now my pleasure to pass the call over to our ceo, chris martin. chris? 
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. the first few months of this year have been transformational and exciting. as you know, we were extremely pleased to receive accelerated fda approval for zynlonta on friday, april 23rd, a month before the pdufa date. based on the broad patient population studied in the phase ii clinical trial, the label includes patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, dlbcl arising from low-grade lymphoma and high-grade b-cell lymphoma, with the latter being an important point of differentiation.
we launched immediately after receiving accelerated approval, making a seamless transition to a fully integrated commercial organization. we were pleased to learn yesterday, less than two weeks since fda approval, that zynlonta was added to the nccn treatment guidelines with a level 2a recommendation. the nccn treatment guidelines are reflective of the broad indication in the fda approval to include not only dlbcl nos but also dlbcl arising from low-grade lymphoma, such as follicular and marginal zone lymphoma and also high-grade b-cell lymphoma. this rapid addition supports the zynlonta differentiated profile and highlights the high unmet medical need in this patient population.
continuing to advance our research programs remains a priority for the company. beyond the first indication for zynlonta, we are exploring different combinations and earlier lines of therapy in dlbcl and follicular lymphoma. we're also advancing clinical studies in hodgkin lymphoma and solid tumors for our second program, cami, as well as our earlier-stage pipeline. jay will discuss the pipeline in more detail shortly.
but first, i would like to turn the call over to jennifer, our chief commercial officer, to provide some highlights on the first few days of the zynlonta launch. jennifer?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
thank you, chris, and hello, everyone. i'm very excited to provide an update on the early days of the zynlonta launch. even with fda approval coming a month before the pdufa date, the commercial and medical teams were ready for launch and have already hit the ground running. on the same day we received approval, we also received our first customer inquiry about product availability.
this underscores the critical need for new treatment options for patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. over the weekend following approval, we launched our digital platform, which includes our healthcare professional website, our brand site, our medical information website, as well as our patient assistance website. we also leveraged social media outlets and direct email to ensure that all of our customers are aware of the great news about zynlonta. on monday, april 26, the first business day after fda approval, our patient call center, which provides coverage guidance, financial support and co-pay assistance and one-on-one nursing support, was live with trained nurses and reimbursement specialists.
we also completed our sales training for our hematology therapeutic specialists or htses the very same day. tuesday, the second business day following approval, the htses were in the field promoting zynlonta and our amcp dossier was available for our payer customers. importantly, our msl team has been addressing customer requests to ensure the safe and efficient administration of zynlonta. finally, zynlonta was commercially available, and our first order was shipped within days of approval.
driving the launch is a world-class team of seasoned hematology/oncology professionals across medical, marketing, market access and sales. the customer-facing teams are reporting a very positive reception to the news of the fda approval of zynlonta with members of the sales team hearing from their customers over the very first weekend. in the days since fda approval, we have had major institutions express interest in ordering zynlonta, which is very encouraging in these early days of launch. and with the recent addition of zynlonta to the nccn treatment guidelines, we are in a position to accelerate our access initiatives to make sure that every patient that can benefit from zynlonta has the opportunity to do so.
in summary, the commercial and medical teams are off to a running start, and our exceptional team of top industry talent is genuinely excited to bring a truly differentiated product and hope to patients with relapsed and refractory dlbcl. now i'll turn the call over to jay to provide an update on our pipeline. jay?
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
thank you, jennifer. i am pleased to share that our clinical and preclinical teams are energized by our first approval and eager to keep the momentum going. zynlonta was granted accelerated approval on the priority review based on the lotis-2 trial, a single-arm, multicenter, open-label phase ii trial that enrolled a total of 145 patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma following at least two lines of prior systemic therapy. the trial included a broad spectrum of heavily pretreated patients with very difficult-to-treat disease, including patients with high-grade b-cell lymphoma, a key point of differentiation for our label.
the trial also enrolled patients who did not respond to first-line therapy, patients refractory to all prior lines of therapy and patients who had prior stem cell transplant and car-t therapy. zynlonta offers a truly differentiated treatment option with this broad population of relapsed/refractory dlbcl patients. as chris mentioned, we are exploring the opportunity to expand the addressable patient population for zynlonta into earlier lines of treatment and in additional histologies. first is our ongoing pivotal phase ii lotis-3 trial of zynlonta in combination with ibrutinib for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large b-cell or mantle cell lymphoma, which is intended to support the submission of a supplemental bla.
interim data from the phase i portion of this trial showed encouraging efficacy and manageable toxicity with an overall response rate of 63% across all patients and 67% in non-gcb dlbcl patients. we expect to report additional data from the phase i portion of this trial in the second quarter and to complete phase ii enrollment in the second half of this year. next, we have our ongoing confirmatory phase iii lotis-5 clinical trial of zynlonta in combination with rituximab. lotis-5 is also intended to support a supplemental bla filing for zynlonta as a second-line therapy for relapsed or refractory diffuse large b-cell patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplant.
we expect to complete the safety lead-in portion of this trial in the second half of the year. we also intend to initiate several additional zynlonta trials this year. first, we plan to start a pivotal phase ii clinical trial in follicular lymphoma in the coming weeks in the second half of 2021. we also plan to initiate the trial of zynlonta in multiple combinations in b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma and dose-finding study of zynlonta in combination with r-chop in first-line dlbcl.
all of these trials will explore the expansion of zynlonta in early lines of therapy across b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma. moving to our second program, cami, we have made progress across both our hodgkin lymphoma and solid tumor programs. we completed enrollment in our phase ii pivotal trial in patients with relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma. updated interim results from this trial are expected in the second quarter, and we expect this trial to support an fda bla submission for relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma.
in addition to our hodgkin lymphoma program, we have an ongoing phase ib dose escalation trial of cami in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. we are encouraged by the preclinical data and pharmacokinetic and biomarker data from the phase i monotherapy part of this trial that support further development in solid tumors, and we look forward to sharing more data in the future. as i just highlighted in our cami program, our adc technology is also being explored for the treatment of solid tumors. after validation of our platform with the approval of zynlonta, we are even more excited to explore the potential of adcs in various solid tumors.
in addition to cami, adct-901, targeting kaag1, is a novel, first-in-class asset for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors with high unmet medical needs. this includes platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. we expect to file an ind in the second quarter and enter the clinic shortly thereafter. next, adct-601, targeting axl, is another promising asset as axl is overexpressed in many solid tumors such as lung, breast, prostate, pancreas, glioma and esophageal.
we now expect to initiate a phase ib combination study in multiple solid tumors in the first half of 2022. in addition, our last clinical-stage program, adct-602, targeting cd22, continues to enroll patients in a phase i/ii trial for relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia at md anderson. and finally, we also have a robust r&d pipeline with six additional programs in preclinical development. with that, i will turn the call over to jenn to give a financial update.
jenn creel -- chief financial officer
thank you, jay, and good morning, everyone. as we reported in our press release, we ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $383 million as compared to approximately $439 million as of december 31st, 2020. we will also be drawing down another 50 million disbursement from our deerfield facility in the near future, which was contingent upon zynlonta approval. we used approximately 55 million in net cash for operating activities in the first quarter.
we expect our spend to continue to increase slightly as we are now in full launch mode and also initiating multiple new clinical trials. with our commercial organization fully hired in q1, our spend should level off later this year. r&d expenses were 39 million for the first quarter compared to 35 million for the same quarter of 2020. the increase was primarily due to the growth of our r&d organization to support the zynlonta bla submission, medical affairs prelaunch activities and multiple ongoing clinical programs.
sales and marketing expenses were 14 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 3 million during the first quarter of 2020. the increase in sales and marketing reflects the build-out of our commercial organization and other investments in preparation for the launch of zynlonta. g&a expenses were 18 million for the quarter compared to 6 million for the same quarter of 2020. the increase was primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense and the cost of being a public company.
our net loss was 52 million for the first quarter compared to a net loss of 43 million for the first quarter of 2020. the net loss reflects a $21 million noncash gain related to the changes in fair value of derivatives associated with the convertible loans under the convertible credit facility with deerfield. net loss also included share-based compensation expense of $14 million for the first quarter of 2021. our diluted net loss per share was $0.67 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of $0.85 in the first quarter of 2020.
finally, our adjusted net loss excludes certain items associated with the deerfield convertible loan and share-based compensation expense. the adjusted net loss was 57 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to an adjusted net loss of 40 million in the same quarter of 2020. the increase in adjusted net loss was primarily driven by the investment in the expanded portfolio and the preparation for the anticipated launch of zynlonta. the adjusted diluted net loss per share was $0.74 for the quarter compared to a loss of $0.78 for the same quarter of 2020.
with that, i will turn the call back to chris for closing remarks. chris?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, jenn, jay and jennifer. this has been a transformational time in the history of adct. we are well positioned to achieve our objectives as we enter the next phase of growth. this slide highlights our anticipated development milestones, which jay reviewed earlier.
we congratulate the team that brought zynlonta to patients, and we are eager to help as many patients as possible to benefit from our next-generation adcs. i look forward to updating you on the progress of our launch and our rich pipeline in the coming quarters. i'm pleased to now open the call to your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from matthew harrison from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
zhen zeng -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, this is zhen on for matthew. thanks for taking our questions congrats on the progress. we have a couple of questions. the first one is, could you maybe comment on the safety profile of zynlonta in general versus other recent dlbcl approvals? and how do you see its position?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jay?
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
yes, sure. thank you for the question. so i think that's a good question. it's difficult to answer, of course, since these are not comparator trials.
so i give you that caveat before we start the conversation. but in view of that, i think that the toxicity profile of lonca that was demonstrated, i should say, zynlonta that was demonstrated has been very manageable. the treatment-related adverse events that led to discontinuation in our trial was about 19%, which is actually less than the reported for other recently approved products. we had a very low rate of febrile neutropenia, about 3%.
we did have some patients who discontinued therapy for effusions, edema. but in general, those adverse events were well managed. there were very few dose delays of more than one to two weeks and there were almost no dose decrease or dose reductions, excuse me, during the trial other than that mandated by the trial design when we went from 150 micrograms per kilogram to 75 micrograms per kilogram. so we believe that the toxicity profile that we put forward is very strong and is very manageable and will not be any barrier to use in the community.
zhen zeng -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. and then maybe what do you see is the potential implications of the nccn guidelines in terms of use potential? could you comment on that?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jennifer, do you want to take that?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes, certainly. thanks, chris, and thanks for the question. in terms of the nccn guidelines, we're very pleased. well, one, first, proud of the team at adc therapeutics for submitting the guideline request on the same day as fda approval on april 23rd.
we're equally happy with the swift update from the nccn treatment guidelines and believe that their timely response is really reflective of the differentiated profile of zynlonta and also the high unmet medical need for these patients. and so we're very happy with how quickly the nccn has worked. we're also very happy that the nccn has recognized the broad population of patients who benefited from zynlonta consistent with our fda indication. so we think that the early inclusion in the nccn treatment guidelines will allow us to accelerate our access initiatives and ensure that patients who may benefit from zynlonta have the opportunity to do so.
and since access is one of our launch imperatives critical to our success, we believe that the differentiated profile of zynlonta, as well as open access will facilitate our launch uptake through the year.
zhen zeng -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thank you. very helpful. congrats again.

thank you. our next question comes from tazeen ahmad from bank of america. your line is now open.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks so much for taking my question. i wanted to focus a little bit on cami. and maybe, jay, can you talk a little bit about what data should we expect to see from the solid tumor study potentially at asco.
at this point, what indications do you think that you would be most hopeful about for cami in solid tumors. and then can you talk to your view about the side effect profile specifically as it relates to gbs?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, tazeen. jay, can you take that?
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
sure. i can answer those questions. so i think at asco we're not providing. it's a trial in progress poster.
so we're not providing specific data. we don't have data yet from the trial that we presented or published anywhere because we're still in dose escalation phase, but the trial is going along pretty well. we've enrolled a number of patients. and so hopefully, we'll have some more information on that in the future, but i haven't given any time line for that yet.
i think your other question was related to cami and the guillain-barre syndrome. was that correct, tazeen?
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
what indications on the solid tumor space do you feel most encouraged about? and then just in general, the profile specifically gbs.
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
sure. sorry, i missed the middle question there. so we're using literature information to determine which solid tumor is the most commonly infiltrated by t-cells. we haven't focused now on specific tumor types yet because we're still in dose escalation, so kind of enrolling across the board.
it wouldn't surprise me if we end up focusing on certain specific tumor types, but i think it's too early to name what those might be. we just don't have enough information yet. in terms of the side effect profile, again, in the solid tumor study, it's really early. we have not reached the maximum tolerated dose.
we haven't seen anything unexpected. what we don't see is neuro autoimmune toxicity. we do not see any gbs or polyradiculopathy at this time. we didn't in the monotherapy dose escalation trial with solid tumors either.
and as you may recall, gbs and polyradiculopathy have only been seen in hodgkin lymphoma patients. and we believe that there's a correlation in that information in that we've treated more than 140 patients now with disease of hodgkin lymphoma with cami and we've never seen a case of gbs or polyradiculopathy. and of course, as you know, we monitor the association, uncommon with occasional cases of gbs related to hodgkin lymphoma so. and in terms of gbs and hodgkin lymphoma, what we're seeing in the phase ii trial and what we've discussed at ash back in december is consistent with what we saw in the phase i trial.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you.

it is now my pleasure to pass the call over to our ceo, chris martin. chris? 
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. the first few months of this year have been transformational and exciting. as you know, we were extremely pleased to receive accelerated fda approval for zynlonta on friday, april 23rd, a month before the pdufa date. based on the broad patient population studied in the phase ii clinical trial, the label includes patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, dlbcl arising from low-grade lymphoma and high-grade b-cell lymphoma, with the latter being an important point of differentiation.
we launched immediately after receiving accelerated approval, making a seamless transition to a fully integrated commercial organization. we were pleased to learn yesterday, less than two weeks since fda approval, that zynlonta was added to the nccn treatment guidelines with a level 2a recommendation. the nccn treatment guidelines are reflective of the broad indication in the fda approval to include not only dlbcl nos but also dlbcl arising from low-grade lymphoma, such as follicular and marginal zone lymphoma and also high-grade b-cell lymphoma. this rapid addition supports the zynlonta differentiated profile and highlights the high unmet medical need in this patient population.
continuing to advance our research programs remains a priority for the company. beyond the first indication for zynlonta, we are exploring different combinations and earlier lines of therapy in dlbcl and follicular lymphoma. we're also advancing clinical studies in hodgkin lymphoma and solid tumors for our second program, cami, as well as our earlier-stage pipeline. jay will discuss the pipeline in more detail shortly.
but first, i would like to turn the call over to jennifer, our chief commercial officer, to provide some highlights on the first few days of the zynlonta launch. jennifer?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
thank you, chris, and hello, everyone. i'm very excited to provide an update on the early days of the zynlonta launch. even with fda approval coming a month before the pdufa date, the commercial and medical teams were ready for launch and have already hit the ground running. on the same day we received approval, we also received our first customer inquiry about product availability.
this underscores the critical need for new treatment options for patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. over the weekend following approval, we launched our digital platform, which includes our healthcare professional website, our brand site, our medical information website, as well as our patient assistance website. we also leveraged social media outlets and direct email to ensure that all of our customers are aware of the great news about zynlonta. on monday, april 26, the first business day after fda approval, our patient call center, which provides coverage guidance, financial support and co-pay assistance and one-on-one nursing support, was live with trained nurses and reimbursement specialists.

what indications on the solid tumor space do you feel most encouraged about? and then just in general, the profile specifically gbs.
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
sure. sorry, i missed the middle question there. so we're using literature information to determine which solid tumor is the most commonly infiltrated by t-cells. we haven't focused now on specific tumor types yet because we're still in dose escalation, so kind of enrolling across the board.
it wouldn't surprise me if we end up focusing on certain specific tumor types, but i think it's too early to name what those might be. we just don't have enough information yet. in terms of the side effect profile, again, in the solid tumor study, it's really early. we have not reached the maximum tolerated dose.
we haven't seen anything unexpected. what we don't see is neuro autoimmune toxicity. we do not see any gbs or polyradiculopathy at this time. we didn't in the monotherapy dose escalation trial with solid tumors either.
and as you may recall, gbs and polyradiculopathy have only been seen in hodgkin lymphoma patients. and we believe that there's a correlation in that information in that we've treated more than 140 patients now with disease of hodgkin lymphoma with cami and we've never seen a case of gbs or polyradiculopathy. and of course, as you know, we monitor the association, uncommon with occasional cases of gbs related to hodgkin lymphoma so. and in terms of gbs and hodgkin lymphoma, what we're seeing in the phase ii trial and what we've discussed at ash back in december is consistent with what we saw in the phase i trial.

it is now my pleasure to pass the call over to our ceo, chris martin. chris? 
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, amanda, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. the second quarter was nothing less than transformative for our company as we received our first accelerated fda approval and brought zynlonta with its broad label and differentiated profile to this area of high unmet medical need. we achieved key objectives across the board, including commercial, clinical development and corporate development goals. let's start with our first commercial product.
in april, we received accelerated fda approval for zynlonta, for our first indication in relapsed refractory dlbcl, and became a fully integrated biopharma company. today it's early in the launch, and we're pleased with our progress and the positive perception from the physician and payer communities. jennifer herron, our chief commercial officer, will share more details about our launch a little later in this call. on the r&d front, we continue to advance our pipeline programs, which we expect to also drive long-term value for the company.
we presented new data at asco and icml on a few of our key programs, including updated duration of response for the pivotal zynlonta phase 2 lotis-2 trial and the phase 1 trial of zynlonta in combination with ibrutinib. we also presented encouraging interim data for the phase 2 trial of our second program, cami, in hodgkin lymphoma. jay will elaborate further on these, and our other programs in a few moments. we are also focused on expanding our geographic footprint, provide zynlonta to as new patients as possible worldwide.
as you know, we formed the joint venture, overland adct biopharma, to develop and commercialize all of our products, including zynlonta, in greater china and singapore. the joint venture has made tremendous progress, including the hire of the ceo, eric ku, who has substantial experience in china. eric and his team are now making rapid progress toward initiating pivotal bridging study. as for europe, we have recently engaged with eu regulators, and based on that feedback, we plan to submit a marketing authorization occupation to the ema in the second half of 2021.
we are evaluating all of our go-to-market options and look forward to updating you on our plans for europe when we have more specific details to share. i would now like to turn the call over to jennifer to provide some insights from the early days of the zynlonta launch. jennifer?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
thank you, chris. good morning, everyone. let me start with our focus to bring zynlonta to any third-line dlbcl patient who may benefit. we have an exceptional team of seasoned industry professionals who have executed very well with this single objective in mind.
to that end, i'm happy to report that the zynlonta launch is off to an encouraging start in its early stages. we are pleased to report zynlonta net sales in the second quarter, of $3.8 million. this represents approximately two months of sales, following approval in late april, and reflects launch-to-date patient demand with no material inventory built. the encouraging early launch performance is the result of the strong execution of our seasoned cross-functional team of oncology professionals across medical, market access, marketing, sales and commercial operations, all working together to educate physicians, nurses and pharmacists on zynlonta's differentiated product profile in third-line dlbcl, which remains an area of high unmet medical need.
providing some additional context on the early launch dynamics, our commercial team has engaged all key accounts with patient starts at a significant number of those accounts. a substantial number of nccn centers have ordered and reordered zynlonta. the differentiated zynlonta product profile, as reflected in our pivotal lotis-2 trial, has been well received by both academic and community-based physicians. zynlonta's consistent efficacy across a broad patient population, including heavily pre-treated patients and patients with difficult-to-treat disease, its manageable safety profile and ease of administration, applies equally well to the real-world patient population in both the academic and community settings, resulting in an approximate 50-50 split in terms of accounts ordering zynlonta.
over the next few quarters, we expect a greater proportion of zynlonta volumes to come from community-based physicians. finally, we have seen significant increases in aided and unaided awareness, reflecting the impact of our hybrid launch approach and comprehensive digital campaign. in terms of access, we are pleased with our progress to date. our payer and medical teams have actively engaged with key payer stakeholders, laying the groundwork for swift access.
nearly all key payer accounts have now been engaged, and we have made strong progress with published medical policies. with inclusion in the nccn guidelines just two weeks after accelerated approval, we are gaining access ahead of plan. we expect to receive our permanent j-code in january 2022, which will help with local community reimbursement. as for operating in the covid environment, we were fully prepared to launch under these exceptional circumstances, and thus far, have executed a strong hybrid launch with the flexibility to engage both virtually or in-person, depending on geography and physician preferences.
we are encouraged to see increases in face-to-face visits, which we expect to continue to improve over the coming months. to summarize the first two months of launch, we are encouraged by the early positive launch momentum we've generated to date. we also recognize that these are early days of the zynlonta launch, and there remains some uncertainty with the pandemic. however, we believe there is a lot of opportunity to continue driving awareness and demand.
our team is motivated, focused and determined to bring zynlonta to any third-line dlbcl patient who may benefit. we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. now, i'll turn the call over to jay to provide an update on our pipeline. jay?
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
thank you, jennifer. beyond the first approved indication for zynlonta, we are exploring opportunities to expand the addressable patient population into earlier lines of treatment and into additional histology. as chris mentioned earlier, updated data from the zynlonta pivotal lotis-2 trial were presented at asco and icml. the overall response rate was 48% and a complete response rate, 25%.
as of the march 1, 2021 cut-off date, the median duration response increased to 13.4 months for all responders, with durable responses even in high-risk subgroups. in addition, the median duration of response for pre-responding patients was not reached. as a reminder, the patient population of this trial included patients who did not respond to first-line therapy or any prior lines of therapy. patients who failed car-t therapy or stem cell transplant, and patients with high-grade b-cell lymphoma, including those with double hit and triple hit genetics.
these results reinforce the efficacy and safety of zynlonta as a monotherapy, a manageable safety profile, and its convenient ease of administration. david recently presented at icml in the lotis-2 trial of zynlonta, in combination with ibrutinib for patients with relapsed or refractory dlbcl, or mantle cell lymphoma. updated phase 1 data showed encouraging efficacy and manageable toxicity, with an overall response rate of 67% and a complete response rate of 38% in non-gcb subtype dlbcl patients. based on interim data from the ongoing phase 2 trial, we've decided to amend the protocol to evaluate the administration of zynlonta with every cycle to potentially further enhance efficacy and durability.
based on this additional data, we could potentially pursue a phase 3 study in second-line dlbcl, expanding the addressable market and the number of patients who could benefit from zynlonta. the phase 2 portion of this trial continues to enroll. our ongoing confirmatory phase 3 lotis-5 clinical trial of zynlonta in combination with rituximab, is intended to support the supplemental bla filing as a second-line therapy for relapsed or refractory dlbcl patients not eligible for stem cell transplant. this trial continues to enroll patients, and we expect to complete the safety leading portion of this trial in the second half of the year.
there are some plans to initiate several additionals in 1, 2 trial in the second half of the year, including an umbrella trial in zynlonta, the multiple combinations in relapsed refractory b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma, and a dose-finding study in zynlonta in combination with r-chop in previously untreated dlbcl patients. these trials will explore the expansion of the market into earlier lines of therapy across b-cell non-hodgkin lymphomas. pivotal phase 2 trial in relapsed refractory for b-cell lymphoma is now open for a moment as well. as chris mentioned, we plan to file an m&a in europe later this year based on the lotis-2 data.
moving to cami. we have made progress in both, our hodgkin lymphoma and solid tumor programs. we completed enrollment of our 117 patient pivotal phase 2 trial in relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma. updated interim results were presented at icml and showed an overall response rate of 66% and a complete response rate of 28% in a heavily pre-treated population with a median of six prior lines of systemic therapy.
median duration response was not reached, and no new safety signals have been identified. we are encouraged by these results which highlight the potential to address an unmet medical need in heavily pre-treated hodgkin lymphoma patients, most of whom have failed stem cell transplant, and all of whom have failed rituximab they don't need and a checkpoint inhibitor. we look forward to providing additional updates as these data continue to mature. we also continue to advance cami with our ongoing phase ib dose escalation trial in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.
data presented at asco show that cami monotherapy has an encouraging safety profile as the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. it's also encouraging to see that treatment with cami showed a significant increase in t effector to treg ratio in a number of patients with t cell infiltration of the tumors, which is thought to be associated with immunovant anti-tumor effects. as our accounting program exemplifies, we are deploying a validated adc platform in the treatment of solid tumors. adct-901, targeting the antigen kaag1, is a novel first-in-class candidate for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors with higher medical needs, including patients with a platinum resistant ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer.
we filed the ind for adct-901 in the second quarter, which the fda cleared, and we expect to initiate the phase 1 study in the second half of this year. another of our promising pipeline candidates, adct-601 is targeting axl, which should overexpress many solitaires, such as lung, breast, prostate, pancreas, glioma and esophageal cancer. we expect to initiate the phase ib combination study in multiple solid tumors in the first half of 2022. in addition, our adct-602 program targeting cd22, continues to enroll patients in a phase 1/2 trial for relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in collaboration with md anderson.
finally, we have a robust r&d pipeline with six pre-clinical development programs, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. with that, i will turn the call over to jenn to give a financial update.
jenn creel -- chief financial officer
thank you, jay and good morning, everyone. as reported in the press release issued earlier today, zynlonta's second-quarter net sales were $3.8 million, reflecting the two months of zynlonta sales. as of june 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $372 million as compared to approximately $383 million as of march 31, 2021. during the quarter, we drew down the last $50 million tranche from our deerfield facility, which was contingent upon zynlonta approval.
we used approximately $58 million in net cash for operating activities in the second quarter of 2021. r&d expenses were $40 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $26 million for the same quarter in 2020. the increase was primarily related to the medical affairs support of the zynlonta launch and the expansion of our zynlonta clinical program and our broad portfolio. selling and marketing expenses were $15 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $4 million for the same quarter of 2020.
the increase in selling and marketing reflects the preparations for the zynlonta launch and the ongoing commercial efforts. g&a expenses were $19 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $15 million for the same quarter of 2020. the increase was primarily due to the cost of being a public company. net loss was $73 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of $127 million for the same quarter of 2020.
net loss included share-based compensation expense of $18 million for the second quarter of 2021. our diluted net loss per share was $0.95 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of $2.01 for the same quarter of 2020. finally, adjusted net loss, a measure that excludes certain items associated with the deerfield convertible loan and share-based compensation expense, was $54 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to an adjusted net loss of $32 million in the same quarter of 2020. the increase in adjusted net loss was primarily driven by the investment in the zynlonta launch and our clinical programs.
the adjusted diluted net loss per share was $0.70 for the quarter compared to a loss of $0.51 for the same quarter of 2020. with that, i will turn the call back to chris for closing remarks. chris?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, jay and jennifer. to conclude, this has been a productive and important first half of 2021. we achieved important milestones, including, of course, the transformative zynlonta approval and launch. our objectives for the remainder of the year are equally ambitious, and we are well positioned to execute on all aspects of the business.
we look forward to updating you on the progress of our launch and our advancing pipeline in the coming quarters. i'm pleased now to open the call to your questions. operator?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of brian chang from cantor fitzgerald. you may begin.
brian chang -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hey, team. congrats on the launching. thanks for taking my question. it's good to see the 50-50 split of academic versus community docs using zynlonta.
but can you talk about how that split coincides with your launch strategy and expectations? and given you have a differentiated data set, double-hit, triple-hits up there compared to other recently approved agents, do you see a more concentrated uptick there? and then i have a follow-up. thanks.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
[inaudible]
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yeah. thanks chris. and brian, thanks for your question. as i mentioned in my remarks, our accounts ordering zynlonta are split 50-50 across academic and community.
and i think that's really reflective of the differentiated product profile, our broad third-line indication, ease of administration, and the fact that we haven't seen any significant payer barriers to date. we do believe that the versatility of zynlonta's differentiated profile has enabled both academic and community physicians to identify patients who may benefit from zynlonta. we do, however, expect a greater proportion of patients to come from the community as an increasing number of medical policies are published, and ultimately with our permanent j-code expected in january of 2022. and in terms of your question on double-hit triple-hit subpopulations, from what we've heard actually in the early weeks of launch, physician and patient real-world experience to date has been consistent with the profile, as described in the pivotal lotis-2 trial in terms of efficacy, safety and dosing across a broad patient population in third-line dlbcl.
so we haven't seen any specific concentration in subgroups. we believe it's being used broadly in alignment with our indication.
brian chang -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok, thank you, jennifer. and then for jenn, one quick one. so in the $3.8 million number for zynlonta, how much of that is rolled over from the eap that you started earlier this year versus organic new patients start? and i know that you don't have inventory built this year. should we expect any inventory build later this year?
jenn creel -- chief financial officer
we did not have any significant material rollover from the eap program. and then -- i'm sorry, can you remind me of your second question? sorry.
brian chang -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
should we expect any inventory build later this year?
jenn creel -- chief financial officer
we're not expecting any material build. the second-quarter sales didn't have any material impact from an inventory build, and we're not expecting that in the future.
brian chang -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
great. thank you, jenn.
jenn creel -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of matthew harrison from morgan stanley. you may begin.
matthew harrison -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. good morning. thanks for taking the question. two for me.
so i guess, first, on launch dynamics. can you maybe just talk about -- i assume these are all demand patients, and you didn't see any sort of bulks of patients waiting for drug, but maybe if you could just confirm that. and then the second question is just around the ibrutinib combo. it sounds like there's a point here at which you're going to enroll more patients and then be able to speak to regulators about potentially a phase 3 program.
maybe you could just talk about when you think you're going to get to that point. thanks.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jennifer, do you want to take part 1? and jay, part two?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yeah, absolutely. yes, i can confirm that we don't believe there is any pent-up demand in q2, largely because of the aggressive nature of the disease. so we do believe that all the $3.8 million in net sales in q2 reflects real-time patient demand, and more importantly, the unmet medical needs for these patients.
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
matthew, with regards to the ibrutinib trial, this is jay. so we have to amend the trial, which always takes time to not only write, but more importantly, to get to the institutionally dbos, the irbs. so that's going to take a bit of time and then we'll reopen for enrollment. and we really want to nail down the appropriate dosing regimen.
and just as importantly, we want to make sure we find out with regard to cell biology. so we will take some time to enroll that study. so i'm not anticipating that we'll have much more to say about that study for -- into 2022. we'll see how it goes then.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question will come from the line of kennen mackay from rbc. you may begin.
kennen mackay -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. maybe initially a question on cami. after the data at icml, can you maybe talk at all around any regulatory interactions you've had around plans for an accelerated approval? and i'd want to also hear any kol feedback you've had on the data as well as managing the incidence of gbs and whether there's -- what the current thinking is around that mechanism and whether there are any sort of any preventative measures or even differences in expected incidents between lymphomas and solid tumors? and then i just have a quick follow-up on zynlonta.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jay.
jay feingold -- chief medical officer
ok. so -- sorry, chris. with regard to regulatory, we have an agreement with fda from the end of phase 1 meeting that we would follow patients for one year after last patient which we mostly responded to cami. we're in that time to follow-up right now while the patients were enrolled in january.
so we anticipate that we'll have data, obviously, in the first half of 2022, but then we have to review the data, write the bla, submit the bla and go from there, probably anticipate a regulatory path in terms of our planning, similar to what we did for zynlonta. but we're not at this point, advising yet, on when we exactly plan to submit that bla. in terms of kol feedback, first, with regard to our response. it's important to understand the patients we're treating in this study.
so during icml, we reported on the first 101 patients enrollment study from the point of view of efficacy, and those patients have failed a median of six prior lines of therapy. all the patients have failed the checkpoint inhibitor. all except one had failed rituximab without that one -- because a mistake on the party investigator and rolling the patient. and over 60% of the patients have failed stem cell transplant as well, but mostly auto, some with all -- without, and some with both.
and despite all that, we had a 66% overall response rate and a 28% complete response rate, and we didn't reach the median duration response. i think it's important to understand all that in the context of the safety issue of gbs. clearly, we believe, our advisors believe, our independent data safety mining board believes, and fda believes that there's enough anti-tumor activity in these very late-stage patients to warrant the continuation of the study. and so, the potential for a positive risk, positive benefit over risk continues.
so that's why the study has continued. in terms of gbs itself, the number of cases of gbs in this study are very similar to what we saw in the phase 1 study. we have never seen the case of gbs or polyradiculopathy in other b-cell lymphoma patients, the t-cell lymphoma patients, the acute leukemia patients or the solid tumor patients that have been treated with cami. so there is some connection between the drugs of hodgkin lymphoma and gbs, which is actually reported in nature, and obviously, some connection between being treated with cami and gbs.
and we are continuing to investigate what that might be and if we can establish any risk features. so far, we haven't been able to do that. so we don't have any plan in place specifically to mitigate. we do, of course, have all such requirements for checking for viruses and other things that are known to be associated with gbs, prior to enrollment on the study receiving cami.
so all that's in place. we'll continue to file closely. it's important also to note that when the patients are treated quickly and aggressively with the onset of symptoms at gbs, they've generally done pretty well and recovered fairly quickly. so definitely a serious issue, gbs, but so far, our investigators, advisors, the dsmb and the fda agree with us that the drug is certainly well worth studying in these hodgkin patients with no alternatives.
kennen mackay -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you. completely agree there. as you mentioned, really unparalleled efficacy in those late-stage patients there in conscious.
maybe just that follow-up on zynlonta. just wondering if you could talk about progress getting zynlonta listed on hospital protocols, especially in some of the largest academic centers. is that at all associated with getting that permanent j-code, or is this sort of a -- just a sort of a step-by-step approach through those large academic hospitals?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jennifer, do you want to take that?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yeah. thanks, chris. kennen, thanks for the question. i think from an access perspective, it all started with the fact that we got our nccn guidelines less than two weeks after approval with a category 2a listing and recommendation.
and that's really helped us accelerate all of our patient access efforts and evidenced in our published medical policies, which we believe will enable faster access for patients, both in the community and the academic centers. we haven't received significant payer pushback, and i think that's reflective of the quality of our data, our documentation such as our amcp dossier, and the strong execution of our market access and medical teams. and we are, in general, very pleased with our access to date through these medical policies. but it is early days, and we anticipate receiving that permanent j-code in the beginning of 2022.
in the meantime, we'll be continuing to support the local community practices through our reimbursement related services, which is called advancing patient support.
operator
and i'm not showing any further questions in the queue. i'd like to turn the call back over to chris for any closing remarks.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
well, thank you very much for joining our call today, everyone, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. so take care and safe day. thank.

amanda hamilton -- investor relations manager
thank you, operator. this morning, we issued a press release announcing our third quarter 2021 financial results and business update. this release is available on the adct website at ir.adctherapeutics.com under the press releases section. on today's call, chris martin, chief executive officer; jennifer herron, chief commercial officer; joe camardo, chief medical officer; and jenn creel, chief financial officer; will discuss recent business highlights and review our third quarter 2021 financial results before opening the call for questions.

chris? 
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, amanda. and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. i'm very pleased to share an update of our progress during the third quarter. we successfully executed on our key objectives: driving the zynlonta launch, advancing the r&d pipeline, and achieving several important corporate development goals.
we are now approximately six months into the zynlonta launch. and we are encouraged by what we have accomplished to date, delivering $13.1 million in net sales in our first quarter of the launch. we have generated good momentum behind the launch driven by the unique product profile, the significant unmet need in third line plus dlbcl, and the strong execution of our highly experienced team of sales and medical professionals. jennifer herron, our chief commercial officer, will share more details on our launch a little later in this call.
buoyed by our first fda approval, we remain committed to expanding our geographic footprint to provide zynlonta to as many patients as possible worldwide with relapsed or refractory dlbcl. and ema validated our marketing authorization application, and we received orphan drug designation in europe. the overland adct joint venture also made tremendous progress with the initiation of the pivotal phase 2 bridging study in china, which is intended to serve as a basis for a regulatory filing in china. in addition to geographic expansion, we are also continuing to evaluate zynlonta in combination with other agents in earlier line opportunities in dlbcl and as a single agent in follicular lymphoma.
on the r&d front, we continue to advance our pipeline programs, which are important for driving long-term value for the company. we initiated the phase 1 study for adct-901 targeting kaag-1 and entered into a collaboration with the nci for the development of adct-701 targeting dlk-1. for cami, we continue to advance the phase 2 trial in relapsed/refractory hodgkin lymphoma and the phase 1b study in solid tumors. joe camardo, our chief medical officer, will elaborate on our key programs in a few moments.
finally, during the quarter, we extended our cash runway by entering into a financing agreement with healthcare royalty partners for up to $325 million with the continued development of the commercialization of zynlonta and cami. i would now like to turn the call over to jennifer to provide some insights on our progress with the zynlonta launch. jennifer?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
thank you, chris. and good morning, everyone. i'm happy to be here today to share an update on the us zynlonta launch. we are pleased to report zynlonta net sales in the third quarter of $13.1 million, representing our first full quarter of zynlonta sales.
this early launch performance has been driven by zynlonta's differentiated product profile; the significant unmet medical need in third line plus dlbcl; and the strong execution of our seasoned cross-functional team of sales, marketing, market access, and medical affairs professionals. in terms of additional insight into our launch dynamics, our commercial team has made good progress initiating new accounts and driving increased volume from existing accounts, including our prioritized key accounts in nccn, nci centers. despite continuing covid-related challenges, our targeted launch efforts have resulted in significant increases in brand awareness, perception, and intent to prescribe. and we are also competing well in terms of share of voice.
the differentiated zynlonta product profile continues to resonate with both academic and community-based physicians. during the third quarter, not surprisingly, academic center support resulted in greater than 50% of q3 total volume, with an equal proportion of ordering accounts coming from academia and the community. recently, we have seen increasing volume from the community, as expected, as payer access and reimbursement turnaround become more reliable. in terms of patient access, we are very pleased with our progress.
our payer and medical teams have achieved broad access for patients with no barriers encountered thus far. and we expect the permanent j code in january of 2022 to accelerate local community reimbursement trial and adoption. anecdotally, we hear that the patient experience in the real world is similar to the lotis-2 trial experience, which supports the broad use of zynlonta across the third line plus dlbcl patient population. while our initial use has been predominantly in the fourth line patient population, zynlonta has also been used in the third-line setting, including patients who may go on to car-t after zynlonta.
recall that in the lotis-2 trial, 16 patients received cd19 directed car-t therapy after treatment with zynlonta with an investigator-assessed orr of 44%. the differentiated product profile, which is a unique combination of robust single-agent efficacy with a median time to response of 41 days, a generally manageable side effect profile, and convenient 30-minute infusion every 21 days, make zynlonta an incredibly competitive agent in the third line plus setting and why we believe that zynlonta has the potential to be the third line plus standard of care. as for the launch outlook for the rest of the year, we will be proactively monitoring the impacts of covid, the opportunities for face-to-face visits, and the variability around patient scheduling with the upcoming holiday season. specifically, regarding operating in the covid environment, the cross-functional team, including marketing, sales, market access, and medical affairs, have been navigating the hybrid launch with the agility to engage both virtually or in-person depending on geographic guidelines and physician preferences.
while institutions and other face-to-face opportunities have not opened up as quickly as we had hoped, our face-to-face engagement has been stable over the last few months at about half of all of our interactions. in summary, we are encouraged by the hcp reception to zynlonta's differentiated product profile resulting in positive launch momentum generated to date, while recognizing the incredibly dynamic environment. we acknowledge the uncertainties associated with the evolution of the pandemic, but believe there remains an opportunity to unlock the full potential of zynlonta as the standard of care in its label indication. and our team is focused on bringing zynlonta to any patient who may benefit from treatment.
we look forward to keeping you updated on our launch progress. now i'll turn the call over to joe to provide an update on our pipeline. joe?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
thank you, jennifer. i am very pleased to be able to talk to you today about how adc therapeutics is working to move zynlonta beyond our first indication with studies in combination with other agents, in earlier lines of treatment, and in different subtypes of non-hodgkin's lymphoma. starting with the lotis-2 trial, we are evaluating zynlonta in combination with ibrutinib for relapsed or refractory diffuse large b-cell or mantle cell lymphoma. we are initiating a phase 2 program with a higher dose and more frequent administration of zynlonta to determine the complete response rate and durability of response as well as the tolerability of this combination for potential use in earlier lines of treatment.
our ongoing confirmatory phase 3 lotis-5 clinical trial of zynlonta in combination with rituximab is intended to support a supplemental bla filing as a second-line therapy for relapsed or refractory dlbcl patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. this trial continues to enroll patients, and we expect to complete enrollment of the safety lead-in of this trial by the end of this year. the phase 2 lotis-6 trial in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma is ongoing. and our published data from the phase 1 study showed that 11 of 14 patients had a response to zynlonta, including nine patients who showed a complete response.
the median duration of response was not reached in that phase 1 trial. in addition to these trials, we aim to initiate several additional zynlonta trials by the end of the year, including a study of zynlonta that evaluates four different combinations in separate arms and a dose-finding study of zynlonta in combination with r-chop in previously untreated dlbcl patients. these trials will explore the expansion of zynlonta into earlier lines of therapy across b-cell non-hodgkin lymphomas. and finally for zynlonta, we are looking forward to discussing new data to be released at the upcoming ash conference.
moving to cami, we continue to advance both our hodgkin lymphoma and solid tumor programs, with enrollment in the phase 2 trial in hodgkin lymphoma completed in february 2021. we plan to have preliminary results in the first half of 2022, after which we will share the next steps for a pathway to regulatory submission. we also continue to advance cami with our ongoing phase 1b dose-escalation trial in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. furthermore, we are supporting our pipeline that leverages our validated adc platform applied to the treatment of solid tumors.
during the third quarter, we dosed the first patient in the phase 1 study of adct-901 targeting kaag-1, a novel first-in-class candidate for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors with high unmet medical need, including platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. another promising pipeline candidate is adct-601, mipasetamab uzoptirine, targeting axl. axl is over-expressed in many solid tumors such as lung, breast, prostate, pancreas, glioma, and esophageal cancers. we expect to initiate the phase 1b combination study in multiple solid tumors in the first half of 2022, and we look forward to sharing more details about this program in the coming months.
as chris mentioned earlier, we entered into a collaboration with the national cancer institute to develop adct-701 targeting dlk-1 in neuroendocrine malignancies with high unmet medical need. this includes adrenocortical carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, neuroblastoma, and small cell lung cancer. and finally, our adct-602 program targeting cd22 continues to enroll patients in a phase 1/2 trial for relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. this is in collaboration with md anderson and city of hope medical centers.
we also have a robust r&d pipeline with seven preclinical development programs. and we look forward to keeping you updated on all of these programs. with that, i will turn the call over to jenn to give a financial update.
jenn creel -- chief financial officer
thank you, joe, and good morning, everyone. as reported in the press release issued earlier today, zynlonta third quarter net sales were $13.1 million, reflecting the first full quarter of zynlonta sales. as of september 30, we had cash and cash equivalents of $530 million as compared to $372 million as of june 30 of this year. during the third quarter, we used roughly $59 million in cash for operating activities.
in august, we entered into a financing agreement with healthcare royalty partners for up to $325 million, including gross proceeds of $225 million received upon closing. r&d expenses were $37 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $32 million for the same quarter in 2020. the increase was primarily related to the medical affairs support of the zynlonta launch and the expansion of the zynlonta clinical program and our broad portfolio. selling and marketing expenses were $17 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $6 million for the same quarter of 2020.
the increase in selling and marketing reflects the expenses for the zynlonta launch and the ongoing commercial efforts. g&a expenses were $17 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $14 million for the same quarter of 2020. the increase was primarily due to increased headcount to support the needs of a commercial-stage public company. net loss was $72 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of $20 million for the same quarter of 2020.
our diluted net loss per share was $0.93 in the third quarter of 2021, compared to a net loss of $0.29 for the same quarter of 2020. finally, adjusted net loss, a measure that excludes certain items associated with the deerfield convertible loan, share-based compensation expense, and effective interest expense associated with the royalty financing agreement with healthcare royalty partners, was $46 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to an adjusted net loss of $41 million in the same quarter 2020. the increase in adjusted net loss was primarily driven by the investment in the zynlonta launch and our clinical programs. the adjusted diluted net loss per share was $0.59 for the quarter, compared to a loss of $0.58 for the same quarter in 2020.
with that, i will turn the call back to chris for closing remarks. chris?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, jenn, joe, and jennifer. to conclude, this has been a productive quarter for adct. we continue to execute on the zynlonta launch and to advance our r&d pipeline. our objectives for the remainder of the year and into 2022 are clear, and we are well-positioned to execute on all aspects of the business.
we look forward to updating you on the progress of our launch and our advancing pipeline in the coming quarters. i'm pleased to now open the call for questions. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from matthew harrison with morgan stanley.
matthew harrison -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. good morning. thanks for taking the questions. i guess two for me, so one on the launch.
i know you've commented on sources of business sort of being 50/50 commercial/academic. i was wondering if you've seen any changes quarter-over-quarter in terms of repeat prescribers, or where you're seeing anything around duration or any other items like that? and then secondly on cami, do you need to meet with the regulators again once you see the data in the first half of '22? or maybe you can just outline exactly what the steps are you going to need to take.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, matthew. so, jennifer, do you want to take the first question? and, joe, the second?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
sure.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. sounds good, chris. thanks. matthew, so in terms of what we're seeing in the evolution quarter over quarter, we continue to see, as i mentioned, a greater percentage of our volume coming from academia.
i will say, over the most recent weeks and months, that we're getting increasing use in the community. and we would expect that to continue. so i think from a repeat order perspective, the volume is still predominantly coming from academia, but we're getting newer and newer accounts coming from the community in the recent weeks. from a duration perspective, six months into launch, i think it's too early to say what we're getting from a duration perspective.
i mean in the third line plus setting, what we're hearing from hcps is they're looking sort of patient by patient, a very individualized approach that really depends on where that patient is in their treatment paradigm. so it's really hard to extrapolate to a general population. i think it's just too early for that right now.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
ok. this is joe. we'll follow a pretty standard procedure here. we're going to finish the study; compile the data; put together a briefing book; request a meeting, and explain what we want to do next, which is the possibilities of submission for accelerated approval as well as a proposal for a confirmatory study.
the fda has, in the last few years, often answered questions and said they don't need a meeting. i have a feeling in this case, we'll have a meeting with them sometime in the latter part of next year. and that's pretty standard.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from tazeen ahmad with bank of america.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning and good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. i have a few, the first maybe a follow-up on matthew's question about use. so for the increased use from community doctors, is it just doctors who've had experience with zynlonta in the community setting are just prescribing it to more patients? or are you getting more of the growth from new users? and then secondly as it relates to cami, for relapsed and refractory hl, can you give us a sense of where you would expect to see gbs observations; and whether any observation in your mind could be rate limiting, based on what doctor feedback has been so far? and then i have a couple of follow-ups.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, tazeen. again, jennifer, do you want to take the first one? and joe, the second?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
yes. ok.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. so, tazeen, thanks for the question. in terms of our youth in the community, i think we're seeing a really healthy mix of new orders and repeat orders. we're adding new accounts every week.
and we're seeing good repeat orders from the existing accounts and the addition of new accounts. so it's not -- in the community, i'm not seeing a concentration of business, if that was your question.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
ok. with regard to the question about cami, the first thing is the -- based on the data that we're seeing now, the balance of benefit/risk is favorable. we've had no increase in the incidence of gbs over the trial. we have some activities in place to make sure that they decide that particular side can be mitigated.
and keep in mind that we're treating patients who have a median of six prior treatments, including patients who failed what i call modern treatment with brentuximab and pembrolizumab, and also patients who have relapsed after stem cell treatments. so this is a very high bar, and we've reached that with the complete response rate in the range of 28%. so we're positive on the benefit/risk. and we are confident that fda will see that as long as we're able to provide all the data, which we plan to do next year.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. but are you expecting to see a significant level of gbs even with the changes that you've made? are those the levels that are expected?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
we have -- we're at -- we have 7% -- seven cases, 6%, sorry. and i expect that's going to be the number. we have a lot of patients now, and i think that's going to be the number of gbs cases. it could be a little lower when we go into clinical practice, it could be a little bit higher, but that is the number that we expect to see.
and as i mentioned, we've been able to mitigate the more serious cases. so we think that given the benefit here, which is a complete response rate in the 28% range, patients who have a median of six prior treatments that have repeatedly failed, this is an addressable side effect. and that's our -- and that we have the data to be able to demonstrate that and explain it to physicians.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
ok. you're welcome.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. lastly, the kaag-1 that you just mentioned moving into the clinic starting a study this year, should we expect to see any data next year? and then as it relates specifically to platinum-resistant ovarian, can you just remind us what the other options are currently for patients? and what level of efficacy are you looking for?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
yes. i have a -- i'm sorry. i can't hear your questions very well. were you asking about kaag --
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
or about kaag --
chris martin -- chief executive officer
yes. sorry. sorry, the question was with kaag-1, do we expect to see any data this year? and for ovarian cancer patients, what alternative therapies are there for this stage of treatment? and what level of activity would we expect to see?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
well, ok. thanks. thanks, chris. i didn't hear the -- i heard everything except which of our products you wanted to hear about.
so with kaag, we're not going to have any data this year to share. i mean we just started phase 1. and it's proceeding at exactly the right pace, which is a careful dose escalation in patients with refractory cancers. generally depending on how the safety proceeds, we can advance according to our regular schedule.
so i'm thinking maybe sometime in the latter quarter of next year, we could have some data on the safety and develop a plan to proceed. the short answer to your ovarian cancer question is there really aren't any alternatives, which is why kaag is an attractive option here. ovarian cancer continues to be a serious and highly refractory illness once it reaches that late stage of relapse. so at this point, are there other novel -- maybe not novel, but there are other products in development, but nothing that is novel as kaag.
and there is this interesting expression of kaag on ovarian tumors, which is why we chose that. but right now, the field of options is pretty limited.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
you're welcome.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
tazeen, about your last question, we haven't seen any gbs in the solid tumor setting with cami.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. ok. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from boris peaker of cowen.
boris peaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. my first question is on zynlonta. can you comment on the data we should we expect to see at ash?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
joe?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
well, i can't be specific about the data you're going to see ash because it's still under embargo. but i will tell you that as commonly done, we will have longer-term follow-up. we will have some subgroup analyses. as you recall, we have these -- we have patients in our zynlonta trial that were not eligible for some of the other trials going on at the same time.
and so we're going to be rereporting it on those kinds of analyses in addition to some longer follow-up. and we do have other products also available now that have been submitted to the ash conference.
boris peaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. and also can you -- what is the timing of the data readouts from lotis-3 and lotis-5? when do you anticipate top-line data?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
yes. i can't really tell you that. we just started the amendment for lotis-3. we're likely to have some data from the completed part of lotis-3 by this time next year.
that's about right. but how the amendment proceeds, we'll determine when we will have some data, but it won't be -- it will not be probably before 2023. just when -- you asked about lotis-5, we're just at the point where we're finishing the lead-in. we'll start to randomize part of this.
we expect that to take 18 to 24 months. and then i'd just remind you, it's an event-driven trial. so predicting when we'll have the events that will determine the difference between zynlonta and rituximab and rituximab gemox depends on the occurrence of progression. so it's hard to make a prediction.
but like i said, i can tell you what the enrollment period is probably going to be 18 to 24 months.
boris peaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you very much for taking my question.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
you're welcome.
operator
our next question comes from brian cheng with cantor fitzgerald.
brian cheng -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hey, team. thanks for taking my call, and congrats on a great quarter. it seems like you're tracking well against the historical sales trajectory for some of the competitive product in dlbcl. do you have a sense of where you stand on market share in third line plus dlbcl? and then i have one more follow-up.
thanks.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jennifer?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. thanks, brian. thanks for the question. yes, we are pleased with this quarter's performance.
in terms of metrics, as i mentioned in my remarks, we've made some significant increases in awareness and familiarity and intent to prescribe. we're also holding our own in terms of share of voice. so we're happy with that. we are monitoring the market quite closely to make sure that we remain competitive and that we can adapt our hybrid launch plan as the local conditions require.
the q4 is looking better in terms of covid, but again that could change on a dime as we get into the winter months. one of the things that we are watching carefully is face-to-face interactions because of the importance of engaging nurses, pharmacists, and physicians about the differentiated product profile of zynlonta. and of course, this is going to be our first q4 in terms of any kind of seasonal effects with patient visits. so we're cautiously optimistic about q4, and we'll be looking forward to updating you as that quarter wraps.
brian cheng -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
great, jennifer. maybe just on your axl-targeted 601 program, can you give us an update on the manufacturing front? and what is your latest thoughts on patient selection and the initial set of indications? and then ahead of the upcoming update from the competitor axl tied to adc in sarcoma at the ctos meeting later this month, how should we think about the potential read-through from their update to your 601 program?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
probably manufacturing side, i just think. as you know, we're using the synaffix site-specific conjugation in the axl program. we did the phase i dose-escalation study, as we normally do, using frozen product. and we're now moving to manufacturing lyophilized product.
so manufacturing is well underway to supply the clinical study for when we will start in the first half of next year. i'll hand it over to joe to address the clinical aspects. joe?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
ok. ok. thanks, chris. you won't be surprised to hear that we're also interested in sarcoma.
there are a lot of reasons why those of us doing work in axl find sarcoma to be an attractive target. but we don't have our protocol finalized yet. we're working on a couple of details with investigators and with the fda to try to determine how we can do better than just selecting a literature-based tumor and try to get some -- the population a little more likely to respond to axl. so i just don't have the final details to share.
but when we have that protocol final, then i'll be able to share some data. that's probably going to happen in the first half of next year. that's the current plan. and the -- with regard to the competitor, i mean i tend to try to learn what we can from our competitors.
but we have a unique pbd toxin, and we think that we have very high potency here. so we think that with the expression levels that we're going to be able to determine in the trial, we'll be able to get entry of the toxin into the malignant cells. that's our proposal now. and i think that it really does depend on the potency of the toxin and our ability to help enhance the chances of finding a highly expressed axl tumor.
so there's a couple of details to be filled in. but we're doing it now, and i'll be able to give you more on this in the first half of next year.
brian cheng -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
great. well, we look forward to that. thanks for taking my question.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from kelly shi with jefferies.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. congrats on a great quarter. so on gross to net for zynlonta, is it staying around the same at 83% as mentioned in q2? or are we going to expect some change? and i have a follow-up on cami.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jennifer?
jenn creel -- chief financial officer
chris, this is jenn. i can jump in here.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
of course, jenn. please do.
jenn creel -- chief financial officer
jenn, jennifer, confusing. thanks, kelly, for the question. so our gross to net details, you can see in our 6-k we filed this morning. but the q3 gross to net, the deductions were right around 14%.
and that's really right in the general range that we'd expect for an infusion drug in this kind of specific patient population. but it's early days, and we do expect this to fluctuate. we really only have a few months of actuals at this point, and we still have some estimates included in our sales reduction. so we'll continue to monitor this as we move forward and let you know if there's any update.
thanks for the question.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
and also for cami, could you share the possible hypotheses regarding the incidence of gbs tox? do you think the prior pd-1 antibody treatment had some association with gbs? we have seen some documented cases for pd-1 treatment to trigger gbs in heavily pretreated patients. and also will you be able to rule out the possibility this will happen to solid tumors, based on what you have learned?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
joe, do you want to take that? or --
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
sure. it's a very good question. and it's we -- first of all, we know that the hodgkin lymphoma patients have a bit more of a predisposition to guillain-barre. so that's one thing that we have to keep in our minds when we consider this.
and we do know that it has to be related to some kind of enhancement of immune system. but right now, it's all speculative for us at this point. we can't find exactly the trigger that activates the immune system specifically to -- against the nervous system. we just don't know that yet.
it's not inconsistent with data from the checkpoint inhibitors that these kinds of immuno-inflammatory side effects can happen. so it's a reasonable hypothesis that the activation of the immune system, that's about as far as we can go. we cannot say anything specific or unique about the cami activity. with regard to the solid tumors, we saw guillain-barre pretty early in the program for hodgkin's lymphoma.
and as i mentioned, hodgkin's lymphoma patents have a predisposition to this. we've done enough patients now in the solid tumor, and we're getting a very high level of confidence that this is not something that will happen with solid tumor patients. and that's just based on comparative observation of when we saw this in hodgkin's lymphoma and how many patients we have in the solid tumors program. and we're continuing to look into this -- look into really what's actually happening with this.
but it's difficult. and a lot of people are trying to help to work on this as well, even with the checkpoint inhibitors. thanks for the question.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you so much for the color. one last question if i may regarding the axl, axl program. so from competitors, some of their programs actually be able to show the correlation between axl expression and tumor response, but some are not able to. i wonder, would you be able to comment on adc therapeutics' biomarker study or maybe clinical design? like what's your expectation on that front?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
yes. i can't really give you any commentary on the clinical design because it's not finalized yet. but as you know once we do finalize this protocol, we'll be listed on clinictrials.gov. so it's not like you'll never hear about it, you certainly will.
but one thing to point out is that for companies that are pursuing axl over-expression as a way to determine response, they're looking at how axl is driving the tumor. we're looking at how axl is a door to get our toxin into the cell. that's a little bit different. now there may be some activity of our antibody to depress the activity of axl, but what we're really looking at is getting a highly potent toxic into the cell.
and so it's not really a very good comparison to look at axl as a specific target driving the malignant cell, as it is to look at axl as a way of getting our toxin into this. they're totally different mechanisms. and you'll see more data in the future.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. thank you.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
you're welcome.

our next question comes from kennen mackay with rbc capital markets.
kennen mackay -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
all right. thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter, very impressive commercial result there. i have three questions on cami. first, i just wanted to clarify, have you requested or had a pre-bla meeting with the fda for cami yet? and then second, another question on the etiology of gbs.
have you identified any factors that are associated with risk of recurrence, whether it's treatment history or any biomarkers? and can that gbs-like effect be replicated in animal models? and then lastly, i just wanted to see how the cami and pembro combo trial in solid tumors was going and when we could expect to see data from that trial. congrats again.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
ok. good questions. good questions. first of all with regards to the fda request, we have not requested a meeting yet.
we agreed with them, when we proceeded with our phase 2 program, that we would wait for the one-year follow-up on data before we compile the data and request a meeting. the 1-year follow-up will be in february of 2022, then we'll compile the data and request a meeting. the reason for that is the duration of response was considered to be an important variable. so we don't want to see the data until we have the one-year follow-up showing good duration of response.
and just a reminder, we still -- in the data we've been showing, we've still not yet reached -- the median duration of response has still not been reached in these patients. so that's a good thing, but we're going to wait till one-year follow-up. the second question, to my knowledge, we can't replicate this phenomenon in animals, because it's like you have to have a hodgkin lymphoma model in animals. and it's really you can't -- maybe with a transplant tumor, i'll just be speculating here.
we can't really replicate this in an animal model. we can replicate some of the immuno-inflammatory activities that happen when you depress the treg cells. but that's a long way from an actual animal model of guillain-barre syndrome. and so far -- it's a great question to ask because we are looking exactly at what you suggest, which is how about -- what about the treatment history? is there a biomarker? is -- and it's -- it hasn't yet yielded a specific answer for us, but we're still looking.
and a reminder, these are very complicated treatment histories, so it's not a big surprise that you can't sort out something. it's not something obvious, but we're continuing to look. so you're right on target with like what kinds of research we have to do, to try to mitigate the side effect, given that there is such a promising response rate in these patients. and the third thing, the cami program is, in solid tumors, is proceeding very well.
that i think reflects the high need for new drugs in the solid tumors that we are studying. but i can't tell you exactly when we're going to finish because we're still doing dose escalation. and as you know, you've got to do that carefully. so we're making sure that we get the right combination of coming with pembro.
and then once we expand, we'll be able to show what we've learned in terms of safety, what dose we've chosen, and what kind of responses we're getting. so it's still a little bit uncertain, but proceeding very well in terms of enrollment. ok? did i lose everybody?
operator
ok. and i'm not showing any further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the call back over to chris.

chris martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, amanda, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. i'm very pleased to share our fourth quarter and full-year results as we executed on our key objectives and closed out a pivotal year for adc therapeutics. i'm also looking forward to sharing our 2022 milestones with you. the zynlonta launch remains a top priority, and we're very encouraged by what we have been able to accomplish so far.
in addition, we have advanced our clinical development portfolio and research pipeline, and we are entering the year with a healthy cash balance. starting with the launch. we delivered $17 million in net sales during the fourth quarter and approximately $34 million for the eight months of sales in 2021. the differentiated product profile of zynlonta continues to serve an unmet need in the third line plus dlbcl market.
and is resonating with physicians, both at major academic centers and in the community as they consider treatment options for their patients. the positive launch dynamics are also a testament to our experienced commercial team, which has been able to navigate the challenges of the evolving covid landscape. jennifer herron, our chief commercial officer, will share more details on our q4 and 2021 performance a little later in this call. next, we remain committed to expanding worldwide access for any relapsed/refractory dlbcl patients who may benefit from zynlonta, and we are working to expand our geographic footprint.
during the fourth quarter, the ema validated our marketing authorization application. and in january, we announced an exclusive license with mitsubishi tanabe for the development and commercialization of zynlonta in japan. the overland adct biopharm joint venture continues to enroll patients in the pivotal phase 2 bridging study in china, which is intended to serve as the basis for regulatory filing. the joint venture is making rapid progress toward bringing zynlonta to patients in china.
we will continue to focus on moving zynlonta into first and second-line dlbcl therapy with promising combinations that may offer a path to registration, including our ongoing confirmatory phase 3 study of zynlonta in combination with rituximab as well as our frontline study in the same combination in unfit or frail patients. we have refined our zynlonta development strategy, prioritizing areas where we can bring the most differentiated benefits to patients and healthcare providers, which would also result in increased value for all stakeholders. joe camardo, our chief medical officer, will elaborate on this in a moment. in addition to zynlonta, we continue to advance the programs in our robust clinical development and research pipeline, which will ensure long-term growth and value creation for the company.
for cami, we have completed the 12-month follow-up of the pivotal phase 2 trial in relapsed/refractory hodgkin's lymphoma, and we have submitted the data to an upcoming meeting. as we highlighted on our solid tumor pipeline webcast in february, we see significant potential for our pipeline of solid tumor programs, which includes three clinical programs in cami, adct-901 targeting kaag1 and adct-601, targeting axl. we also have two preclinical programs with adct-701, targeting dlk1 and adct-212, targeting psma. this exciting pipeline demonstrates the impact of our expanding adc platform and the productivity of our experienced team of industry experts.
joe will tell you more about our solid tumor program shortly. i would now like to turn the call over to jennifer to report on the launch and provide insights on our progress in establishing zynlonta as a third line plus standard of care in dlbcl, jennifer?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
thank you, chris, and good morning, everyone. with our second full quarter into the zynlonta launch, i'm very happy to share an update on our progress. as chris mentioned, we are pleased to report zynlonta net sales of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing quarter-over-quarter growth of 30%, and 2021 total net sales of $34 million for the first eight months of launch. this steady progress has been driven by a seasoned and focused u.s.
commercial and medical organization, supported by all of adc therapeutics. this effort ensures that u.s. healthcare providers appreciate zynlonta's differentiated product profile, its robust single-agent efficacy, tolerability and ease of administration across all patients and its broad flexibility in the third line plus dlbcl market. through 2021, the commercial and medical teams have been successful in driving their respective initiatives resulting in both key account depth and breadth in terms of demand.
we have seen significant increases in zynlonta awareness, familiarity and share of voice with an increasing proportion of zynlonta use in the third-line setting as compared to later lines. as chris mentioned in his initial remarks, the differentiated zynlonta product profile continues to resonate with both academic and community-based physicians. during the fourth quarter, academic centers still represented over 50% of total volume with an equal proportion of ordering accounts coming from academia and the community. in terms of patient access, our payer and medical teams have achieved broad access for patients with no significant barriers encountered so far.
as we examine ordering patterns in q4, we believe there was some modest year-end inventory build in both the community and academic settings, reflective of future prescribing intent in anticipation of early 2022 infusions. in the fourth quarter, covid impacted our launch landscape with some restrictions on face-to-face interactions. we will continue to carefully monitor the changing landscape and be ready to pivot to maximize our efforts just as we have done since our approval last year. with our strong zynlonta launch in 2021, this year, we have the opportunity to establish zynlonta as the third line plus standard of care through increases in account breadth and depth, new commercial initiatives and increased effectiveness as we sharpen even further our multichannel execution.
we continue to ensure patient access through our patient hub, advancing patient support, which importantly helps patients and physicians' offices during the benefit reverification process and with co-pay support. and even as we have seen increasing volume to date coming from the community, we expect community demands to increase even more once we receive our permanent j code, which is expected in april of 2022. in summary, we are encouraged by the end market performance of zynlonta's differentiated product profile, the anecdotal feedback from our customers and patients and the resulting launch trajectory to date. while we recognize there are uncertainties associated with the progression of the pandemic, we believe in our ability to establish zynlonta as a third line plus standard of care.
in addition, we are optimistic about zynlonta's long-term potential as a cornerstone of dlbcl therapy in first and second line. we look forward to keeping you updated on our launch progress. now i'll turn the call over to joe to provide an update on our clinical development portfolio and research pipeline. joe?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
thank you, jennifer. first, i'd like to share some updates for our zynlonta development program, and then i will provide a progress report on the pipeline. we continue to see a great opportunity with zynlonta in combinations in earlier lines of therapy in dlbcl. based on emerging zynlonta data, we have refined our strategy to execute a highly focused program for clinical trials where zynlonta can deliver the most value for patients in first and second line.
first, we are focused on the combination with zynlonta and rituximab. we are encouraged by the results from the safety meeting of the lotis-5 phase 3 confirmatory trial of zynlonta combined with rituximab. this trial includes second and later-line patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. safety running is complete and the randomized portion of the trial is enrolling.
the combination of zynlonta and rituximab is well tolerated. there are no new safety events, and the initial data suggests the combination is additive. another combination in development was lotis-3, the phase 2 trial of zynlonta in combination with ibrutinib in relapsed refractory dlbcl. with the latest results of the lotis-5 safety run-in, we have decided to discontinue lotis-3.
we will focus our efforts on the lotis-5 trial, which is potentially a fast and direct potential path to market in second line. in the frontline setting, a significant area of high unmet medical need is with unfit and frail patients. this patient subgroup is addressed by our lotis-9 trial, a study to evaluate zynlonta in combination with rituximab in the first line. unfit and frail means patients who are either because of age or other concurrent illness cannot be given a full course of the r-chop regimen or even the low dose r-mini-chop due to toxicity.
these patients are often excluded from first-line studies or new combinations and some studies exclude patients over 80 regardless of medical status. these patients represent a meaningful and growing subset of frontline patients for whom new treatments are lacking. so the lotis-9 protocol serves a significant unmet medical need and also leverages the differentiated profile of zynlonta, that is the single agent efficacy and the tolerability and safety. moreover, with the lotis-5 safety run-in showing the tolerability of the zynlonta-rituximab combination, we now have the data needed to initiate the study in the second half of this year.
we will focus our frontline program on lotis-9, and therefore, we will not initiate lotis 8, which was the dose finding trial of zynlonta in combination with r-chop in frontline dlbcl. beyond rituximab, we will also explore other novel combinations in the lotis-7 trial. with regard to the phase 2 lotis-6 trial in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, the comparator idelalisib was withdrawn from the follicular lymphoma market. therefore, we have paused the lotis 6 study while we work with our advisors and the fda on potential next steps.
we will update you in the future on our plans in follicular lymphoma. we remain highly positive about the opportunity to expand the potential of zynlonta in first and second lines and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. moving on to cami in hodgkin lymphoma. we plan to report results for the phase 2 trial at a medical meeting in the first half of 2022.
the one-year follow-up is now complete, and we are in the process of compiling data in advance of our meeting with the fda. we will share our plans for the regulatory submission later this year. as we recently highlighted in our solid tumor and pipeline webcast, our solid tumor portfolio includes three clinical and two preclinical programs. our ongoing cami phase 1b dose escalation trial in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors shows the combination to be safe and tolerable so far.
this has allowed for continued dose escalation of cami to assure the optimal dose for evaluation of antitumor activity. the protocol allows for small dose expansions, if warranted by the scan results if there is stable disease or tumor regression. and we have done so at the 60 micrograms per kilogram dosing level. in parallel, dose escalation continues, and we are now at 80 micrograms per kilogram combined with usual dose of pembrolizumab.
the combination of pembro and cami is highly synergistic in models, and our trials are designed to take advantage of this in cancers that are not highly responsive to pembrolizumab alone. adct-901 targeting kaag1 is a novel first-in-class candidate for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. this includes platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, prostate cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer. in our labs, we have shown that kaag1 is differentially expressed on these cancers.
the dose escalation of the phase 1 study is ongoing. adct-601, mipasetamab-uzoptirine targets axl. this protein is overexpressed in many solid tumors such as lung, breast, prostate, pancreas, glioma, and esophageal cancers and is highly prevalent in sarcoma. we expect to initiate the phase 1b in the first half of this year.
the planned study will include a dose escalation followed by dose expansion in sarcoma patients in combination with gemcitabine and adct-601 monotherapy in patients in whom axl gene amplification is detected. in addition to our clinical programs, we have two advanced preclinical solid tumor programs. adct-701 targets dlk 1. we are developing this in neuroendocrine malignancies in collaboration with the national cancer institute.
our recently announced adct-212 program is our optimized second-generation pbd-based adc. this targets psma, a validated target in metastatic prostate cancer. we are currently completing ind-enabling work for both of these programs. with that, i will turn the call over to jenn to give a financial update.
jenn creel -- chief financial officer
thank you, joe, and good morning, everyone. as we reported in the press release issued earlier today, zynlonta net sales were $17 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $34 million for 8 months in 2021. as of december 31, we had cash and cash equivalents of $467 million, as compared to $530 million as of september 30, 2021. we used approximately $62 million in net cash for operating activities in the fourth quarter and $233 million in net cash for the full year 2021.
r&d expenses were $42 million for the fourth quarter and $158 million for the full year 2021, compared to $49 million and $142 million for the same quarter and full year 2020. r&d expense decreased for the quarter ended december 31, 2021, as compared to the same quarter in 2020, as a result of lower cmc activities following the zynlonta bla submission and subsequent approval. r&d expenses increased for the full year 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 due to investments in zynlonta trials in earlier lines of treatment and advancing our broad portfolio. as a result of these initiatives, employee headcount and share-based compensation expense increased.
selling and marketing expenses were $19 million for the fourth quarter and $65 million for the full year 2021, compared to $9 million and $22 million for the same quarter and full year 2020. the increase in selling and marketing for the quarter and for the full year reflects the expenses for the zynlonta launch and ongoing commercial efforts. g&a expenses were $18 million for the quarter and $71 million for the full year 2021, compared to $20 million and $55 million for the same quarter and full year 2020. g&a expenses decreased for the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation expense that was partially offset by higher costs of being a public company.
g&a expenses for the full year 2021 as compared to full year 2020 increased due to higher costs of being a commercial stage public company. net loss was $34 million for the fourth quarter and $230 million for the full year 2021, compared to a net loss of $56 million and $246 million for the same quarter and full year 2020. our diluted net loss per share was $0.45 in the fourth quarter and $3 for the full year 2021, compared to a net loss of $0.73 for the same quarter and $3.77 for the full year 2020. finally, adjusted net loss, a measure that excludes certain items as described in our press release issued earlier today, was $30 million for the fourth quarter and $186 million for the full year 2021, compared to an adjusted net loss of $63 million and $176 million in the same quarter and full year 2020.
the decrease in adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the same quarter 2020 was primarily due to the recognition of an income tax benefit as a result of recording a deferred tax asset, primarily related to u.s., r&d tax credits. the increase in adjusted net loss for full year 2021 over full year 2020 was primarily driven by the investment in the zynlonta launch and our broad clinical portfolio. the adjusted diluted net loss per share was $0.39 for the fourth quarter and $2.42 for the full year 2021, compared to a loss of $0.82 and $2.69 for the same quarter and full year 2020. with that, i will turn the call back to chris for closing remarks.
chris?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, jenn, joe, and jennifer. to conclude, in the fourth quarter, we made significant progress in all areas of our business, and we are well positioned to execute on our key objectives in the year ahead. this includes driving the zynlonta launch forward, working to develop zynlonta in earlier lines of therapy, continuing to expand our geographic reach and advancing our pipeline of differentiated hematological and solid tumor programs. i'm pleased now to open the call for your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from brian cheng with cantor. you may proceed with your question.
brian cheng -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. first one, jennifer, on the sales number, can you talk about how much of an inventory build is there? and can you talk about how benefit reauthorization is a factor on 1q sales? and i have a couple of follow-ups.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. sure, brian. so in terms of the inventory build, as i mentioned, we did see some modest inventory build toward the end of the year, both in the academic institutions and the communities. the issue is or i should say, it's hard to further characterize that because we don't have access to patient-level data.
but when we took a look at the ordering patterns for some of our key accounts, we did see greater-than-expected orders. so it's not possible at this point to quantify it, but we do believe there was some modest build toward the end of the year. in terms of benefit reverification, we think that oftentimes with part b drugs that sometimes the benefit verification that happens for all patients, government patients can sometimes result in a delay in getting treatment. we're watching it carefully, particularly in the context of covid and some of the healthcare worker shortage but that -- we'll have to report on that when we put down q1.
brian cheng -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. and then on pricing, we noticed that you took a 1.1% increase last month. just curious, any guidance on how we should think about your price increase moving forward? is that the number that we should be projecting for out years? and then i have 1 more follow-up for joe.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
sure. so when you think about new product pricing and price increase recommendations, there are a lot of considerations, as i'm sure you're aware of. we take into account the overall political and policy environment, the competitive context and also the impacts on reimbursement and physician cost recovery. so as we come into the year, we've been considering carefully all of these factors, each of them and altogether and all of the downstream implications.
and as well as the fact we just launched in may of 2021, so it's been less than a year and felt that a modest price increase was most appropriate at this time.
brian cheng -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. and then a quick question for joe. on the discontinuation for lotis-8. i'm just curious, are you still looking into frontline combination potential? and is the decision partly based on the polaris data and from your conversation with doctors, how important is it to have r-chop backbone in the front line?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
brian, the decision is partly related to the landscape, but it's also partly related to the data we have from our lead-in on lotis-5. i hesitate to use the term, but some of our advisors are telling us that the christmas tree approach, adding new drugs to r-chop is probably not what you would consider a modern approach. it could be incremental. and we're looking for a transformative approach to frontline.
we're still looking for a way to try to use the strength of lonca in combination with rituximab to really change the landscape for first line, get rid of many of these old toxic drugs that have been around since i was an intern. and provide new ways to get a long-term remission in patients when they have their first chance at a long-term remission. so it's really a difference between adding something and trying to get a small benefit, which is what i think you've seen with polaris versus trying to have a transformative approach to the first line. i really prefer the later, that's how you make advances in medicine.
and we have a lot of support from our advisors who are doing that. and we actually -- we're able to find a patient population that just about exactly suits what are the strengths of zynlonta, which is the tolerability and the activity. and with the combination data that we now have from our lead in, we're really confident that this could be a big improvement for a group of patients who really don't get quite the kinds of treatments that they deserve.
brian cheng -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
great. thanks, joe.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
you're welcome, brian.
operator
our next question comes from boris peaker with cowen. you may proceed with your question.
boris peaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. i'd just like to continue from the same line of questioning. so in the frail dlbcl patients that you're targeting lotis-9. can you comment on how big this patient population is today to where it's projected to be in the next several years and kind of what the standard of care is for these specific patients?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jennifer, can you take that first part -- sorry. go for it, joe.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
no. no. i was going to answer the last part of it, which there really is not a standard of care. that's one of the things we learned, that the doctors sometimes give nothing, sometimes they give rituximab, sometimes they give a course or two or something and they have to stop.
sorry, but i have to answer that part of it. so we're really in a place where we can have a transformative outcome. sorry, chris, i guess, jennifer, i'd like to defer to jennifer on the others, as you said.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. certainly. so, boris, the frail and unfit opportunity, i've been really impressed with the enthusiasm from our thought leaders about this. and largely because as joe said, there aren't a lot of clinical trials that include this population.
as we've engaged them in really optimizing the program, they've anecdotally reported a range of anywhere between 15% and 30% of the first-line population, which could be considered frail or unfit and not eligible for r-chop or r-mini-chop just based on comorbidities potentially. and recall the first-line population is approximately 60,000 patients in the u.s. and eu5. so at this point, we're engaging with the thought leaders from a commercial perspective, i'm very excited about it.
and mostly for the patients, because this is going to address an area of unmet medical need, where i think zynlonta is uniquely positioned to support our patients.
boris peaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. and my last question is on the zynlonta european strategy. can you comment how you're thinking of approaching that?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
yes. as you know, we're committed to developing lonca into the global markets. and we were very pleased to do the agreement with mitsubishi tanabe in japan. in europe, we're progressing well on the regulatory pathway.
and we're still looking at our alternative options for commercialization in europe. so as those develop, we will keep you updated.
boris peaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
our next question comes from kelly shi with jefferies. you may proceed with your question.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. there has been help through the quarters since zynlonta launch. i wonder if you're able to share some color on the patient profile across the zynlonta spectrum. specifically, what is the split of the patients taking zynlonta in [inaudible] beyond it also? what percentage of patients treated with zynlonta primary refractory and post cd19 car-t? and lastly, any feedback regarding the safety profile from physicians regarding their real-world experience?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jennifer, do you want to take the first part of that and then maybe joe can answer just the safety protocol part?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. certainly. thanks, chris. so we're pleased with now, i guess we're now 10 months into the market with how the real-world profile is consistent with the lotis-2 pivotal data, and we're hearing that through market research through advisory boards through engagements with our customers.
and we are seeing broad use of zynlonta across the entire spectrum of its indication in third-line plus supported by the nccn guidelines. in the early days of the launch and not unexpected, we did see zynlonta use predominantly in the later-line setting. but importantly, since launch now, we have seen a nice evolution in the business with an increasing proportion of third-line patients receiving zynlonta versus later lines. and we believe that's important for the patients because earlier line use will likely translate into even more benefit for our patients.
so, again, we're very excited about the opportunity and how the business is evolving and continue to believe that this is our year for establishing zynlonta as the third line plus standard of care. your question specifically with regard to subsets is very difficult to answer because, as i mentioned earlier, we don't necessarily have patient-level data and the data that we do receive does not rarely has complete demographic. so it's hard for me to say that. i mean what i am thrilled about, though, that based on the lotis-2 data, we do see consistent benefit across the subset and that has held up as we've gotten into the market.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
and with regards to safety profile?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
the safety profile is for me to answer. our surveillance is showing reports consistent with what we already knew. and that's nothing new, nothing unexpected, nothing more severe in general, based on what we know from lotis-2. we don't have quantitative data on how every doctor is treating and using the -- managing the side effect profile.
but in general, when we talk to our advisors or here's the advice we're giving in the label is working, and we're not seeing more dose delays or discontinuations than we anticipated from the lotis-2 profile. so far, what we're seeing in the clinical practice is consistent with what we saw in the clinical trial database.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
next question comes from matthew harrison of morgan stanley. you may proceed with your question.
unknown speaker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
this is steve [inaudible] for matthew harrison. i have a question for lonca. i want to ask about your view on the penetration into the key centers. and what is the opportunity in community centers?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jennifer?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. no. i can take that. so as i reported, our volume to date or at least through 2021, is predominantly driven by the academic institutions, but we've also had some early community uptake.
as we think about the evolution of the business and with our permanent j code, which we now have confirmation, we'll be receiving -- will be effective on april 1. we're excited about the opportunity to move into the community. as you may be aware, in the community, the permanent j code can be a point of pivot for physicians being willing to try a new product because it does provide greater confidence around their timing to reimbursement, which is important for their practices. so in terms of penetration, we've seen an equal number of -- equal proportion, i should say, of accounts on the community and the academic setting ordering zynlonta with a greater volume coming from the academic institutions, but we do believe that, that will evolve as we have that opportunity with a permanent j code.
unknown speaker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from kennen mackay with rbc. you may proceed with your question.
kennen mackay -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi. congrats on the progress. maybe thinking about your zynlonta strategy, can you help us with the size of the newly incident frontline dlbcl market if it's unfit for r-chop? just thinking about the potential market that can be indicated by the lotis-9 trial. i'm curious what percent of newly incident patients that could represent? and then second for dr.
camardo. could you speak a little bit more to the lotis-3 trial and what a to the decision-making to refocus on rituximab combos versus the ibrutinib combo? was there some overlapping toxicity concern or other safety events in that combination with ibrutinib? or was the decision more just related to lack of sufficiently additive efficacy? thanks.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, kennen. jennifer, do you want to take the first part?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. certainly. ken, so qualitatively, we've had a lot of enthusiasm from thought leaders, as i mentioned, because this is an under -- maybe underserved population by current clinical trials. and anecdotally, they have given us a range.
it really depends on the treatment setting, quite frankly, what the percentage of frail and unfit patients that they may have, but it does range somewhere between 15% and 30%. we're going to be doing some more work to really understand the footprint of these patients. but if you think about the first line opportunity is approximately 60,000 patients for the u.s. and eu5, it is a significant commercial opportunity.
and given the fact that it would be an area of high unmet medical need and leveraging the strength of our single agent profile then in combination with rituximab, i'm excited about the opportunity from a commercial perspective for sure.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
and the answer to your question is no. this was not a decision based on observation of overlapping toxicity. rather, it was a decision based on the observation that this combination might provide a modest additional benefit, perhaps in later line treatments using a drug ibrutinib, which does not have an indication for large cell and isn't very widely used versus a transformation for first-line indication using a drug that is widely used. and i mentioned in a population that in our view, is underserved.
and allowing us a chance to have an impact in patients at their first possible chance of cure. and also as a corollary, the lonca-rituximab combination is also helpful as a baseline for us to add some new drugs once we can prove benefit with that combination in the first line. that becomes a way of improving, changing, transforming the first-line treatment, eliminating the old drugs and adding some of the new ones. does that answer your question, i hope?
kennen mackay -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes. definitely. and maybe just going back to your comments around the additive -- i'm sorry, the additive efficacy of rituximab. can you maybe help sort of set some goalposts there, how -- is that truly additive? should we be thinking about the potential front line rituximab efficacy there with some of the maybe response rates we've seen from zynlonta in the third line? or how should we think about that?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
yes. think about it as better than what we're seeing in the -- what we were seeing in the third line, which is actually very good. i mean, our 25% complete response rate in third line is actually very good as a single agent, and that's not just third line, that's fourth line, fifth line. we're adding rituximab and seeing an improvement.
i can't exactly tell you what it is because we -- at this point in time, we have a pretty small sample. but there's also evidence from our labs on this combination. and it's interesting, there's a large body of evidence that shows rituximab, in general, will add to the effectiveness of most of the cytotoxic drugs. so we're sort of building on something that's almost a biologic principle here.
and we're seeing pretty good confirmation in our early lotis-5. but i just -- a number just doesn't at this point. it's a little too early to come out with a number, but we are seeing what looks like it's -- the combination is an improvement over what we're seeing in the third line, as i said, which is pretty good, actually at 25%, very good. so, ok.
kennen mackay -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks a bunch.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
ok.

chris martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, amanda, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. i'm very pleased to share our fourth quarter and full-year results as we executed on our key objectives and closed out a pivotal year for adc therapeutics. i'm also looking forward to sharing our 2022 milestones with you. the zynlonta launch remains a top priority, and we're very encouraged by what we have been able to accomplish so far.
in addition, we have advanced our clinical development portfolio and research pipeline, and we are entering the year with a healthy cash balance. starting with the launch. we delivered $17 million in net sales during the fourth quarter and approximately $34 million for the eight months of sales in 2021. the differentiated product profile of zynlonta continues to serve an unmet need in the third line plus dlbcl market.
and is resonating with physicians, both at major academic centers and in the community as they consider treatment options for their patients. the positive launch dynamics are also a testament to our experienced commercial team, which has been able to navigate the challenges of the evolving covid landscape. jennifer herron, our chief commercial officer, will share more details on our q4 and 2021 performance a little later in this call. next, we remain committed to expanding worldwide access for any relapsed/refractory dlbcl patients who may benefit from zynlonta, and we are working to expand our geographic footprint.
during the fourth quarter, the ema validated our marketing authorization application. and in january, we announced an exclusive license with mitsubishi tanabe for the development and commercialization of zynlonta in japan. the overland adct biopharm joint venture continues to enroll patients in the pivotal phase 2 bridging study in china, which is intended to serve as the basis for regulatory filing. the joint venture is making rapid progress toward bringing zynlonta to patients in china.
we will continue to focus on moving zynlonta into first and second-line dlbcl therapy with promising combinations that may offer a path to registration, including our ongoing confirmatory phase 3 study of zynlonta in combination with rituximab as well as our frontline study in the same combination in unfit or frail patients. we have refined our zynlonta development strategy, prioritizing areas where we can bring the most differentiated benefits to patients and healthcare providers, which would also result in increased value for all stakeholders. joe camardo, our chief medical officer, will elaborate on this in a moment. in addition to zynlonta, we continue to advance the programs in our robust clinical development and research pipeline, which will ensure long-term growth and value creation for the company.
for cami, we have completed the 12-month follow-up of the pivotal phase 2 trial in relapsed/refractory hodgkin's lymphoma, and we have submitted the data to an upcoming meeting. as we highlighted on our solid tumor pipeline webcast in february, we see significant potential for our pipeline of solid tumor programs, which includes three clinical programs in cami, adct-901 targeting kaag1 and adct-601, targeting axl. we also have two preclinical programs with adct-701, targeting dlk1 and adct-212, targeting psma. this exciting pipeline demonstrates the impact of our expanding adc platform and the productivity of our experienced team of industry experts.
joe will tell you more about our solid tumor program shortly. i would now like to turn the call over to jennifer to report on the launch and provide insights on our progress in establishing zynlonta as a third line plus standard of care in dlbcl, jennifer?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
thank you, chris, and good morning, everyone. with our second full quarter into the zynlonta launch, i'm very happy to share an update on our progress. as chris mentioned, we are pleased to report zynlonta net sales of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing quarter-over-quarter growth of 30%, and 2021 total net sales of $34 million for the first eight months of launch. this steady progress has been driven by a seasoned and focused u.s.
commercial and medical organization, supported by all of adc therapeutics. this effort ensures that u.s. healthcare providers appreciate zynlonta's differentiated product profile, its robust single-agent efficacy, tolerability and ease of administration across all patients and its broad flexibility in the third line plus dlbcl market. through 2021, the commercial and medical teams have been successful in driving their respective initiatives resulting in both key account depth and breadth in terms of demand.
we have seen significant increases in zynlonta awareness, familiarity and share of voice with an increasing proportion of zynlonta use in the third-line setting as compared to later lines. as chris mentioned in his initial remarks, the differentiated zynlonta product profile continues to resonate with both academic and community-based physicians. during the fourth quarter, academic centers still represented over 50% of total volume with an equal proportion of ordering accounts coming from academia and the community. in terms of patient access, our payer and medical teams have achieved broad access for patients with no significant barriers encountered so far.
as we examine ordering patterns in q4, we believe there was some modest year-end inventory build in both the community and academic settings, reflective of future prescribing intent in anticipation of early 2022 infusions. in the fourth quarter, covid impacted our launch landscape with some restrictions on face-to-face interactions. we will continue to carefully monitor the changing landscape and be ready to pivot to maximize our efforts just as we have done since our approval last year. with our strong zynlonta launch in 2021, this year, we have the opportunity to establish zynlonta as the third line plus standard of care through increases in account breadth and depth, new commercial initiatives and increased effectiveness as we sharpen even further our multichannel execution.
we continue to ensure patient access through our patient hub, advancing patient support, which importantly helps patients and physicians' offices during the benefit reverification process and with co-pay support. and even as we have seen increasing volume to date coming from the community, we expect community demands to increase even more once we receive our permanent j code, which is expected in april of 2022. in summary, we are encouraged by the end market performance of zynlonta's differentiated product profile, the anecdotal feedback from our customers and patients and the resulting launch trajectory to date. while we recognize there are uncertainties associated with the progression of the pandemic, we believe in our ability to establish zynlonta as a third line plus standard of care.
in addition, we are optimistic about zynlonta's long-term potential as a cornerstone of dlbcl therapy in first and second line. we look forward to keeping you updated on our launch progress. now i'll turn the call over to joe to provide an update on our clinical development portfolio and research pipeline. joe?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
thank you, jennifer. first, i'd like to share some updates for our zynlonta development program, and then i will provide a progress report on the pipeline. we continue to see a great opportunity with zynlonta in combinations in earlier lines of therapy in dlbcl. based on emerging zynlonta data, we have refined our strategy to execute a highly focused program for clinical trials where zynlonta can deliver the most value for patients in first and second line.
first, we are focused on the combination with zynlonta and rituximab. we are encouraged by the results from the safety meeting of the lotis-5 phase 3 confirmatory trial of zynlonta combined with rituximab. this trial includes second and later-line patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. safety running is complete and the randomized portion of the trial is enrolling.
the combination of zynlonta and rituximab is well tolerated. there are no new safety events, and the initial data suggests the combination is additive. another combination in development was lotis-3, the phase 2 trial of zynlonta in combination with ibrutinib in relapsed refractory dlbcl. with the latest results of the lotis-5 safety run-in, we have decided to discontinue lotis-3.
we will focus our efforts on the lotis-5 trial, which is potentially a fast and direct potential path to market in second line. in the frontline setting, a significant area of high unmet medical need is with unfit and frail patients. this patient subgroup is addressed by our lotis-9 trial, a study to evaluate zynlonta in combination with rituximab in the first line. unfit and frail means patients who are either because of age or other concurrent illness cannot be given a full course of the r-chop regimen or even the low dose r-mini-chop due to toxicity.
these patients are often excluded from first-line studies or new combinations and some studies exclude patients over 80 regardless of medical status. these patients represent a meaningful and growing subset of frontline patients for whom new treatments are lacking. so the lotis-9 protocol serves a significant unmet medical need and also leverages the differentiated profile of zynlonta, that is the single agent efficacy and the tolerability and safety. moreover, with the lotis-5 safety run-in showing the tolerability of the zynlonta-rituximab combination, we now have the data needed to initiate the study in the second half of this year.
we will focus our frontline program on lotis-9, and therefore, we will not initiate lotis 8, which was the dose finding trial of zynlonta in combination with r-chop in frontline dlbcl. beyond rituximab, we will also explore other novel combinations in the lotis-7 trial. with regard to the phase 2 lotis-6 trial in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, the comparator idelalisib was withdrawn from the follicular lymphoma market. therefore, we have paused the lotis 6 study while we work with our advisors and the fda on potential next steps.
we will update you in the future on our plans in follicular lymphoma. we remain highly positive about the opportunity to expand the potential of zynlonta in first and second lines and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. moving on to cami in hodgkin lymphoma. we plan to report results for the phase 2 trial at a medical meeting in the first half of 2022.
the one-year follow-up is now complete, and we are in the process of compiling data in advance of our meeting with the fda. we will share our plans for the regulatory submission later this year. as we recently highlighted in our solid tumor and pipeline webcast, our solid tumor portfolio includes three clinical and two preclinical programs. our ongoing cami phase 1b dose escalation trial in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors shows the combination to be safe and tolerable so far.
this has allowed for continued dose escalation of cami to assure the optimal dose for evaluation of antitumor activity. the protocol allows for small dose expansions, if warranted by the scan results if there is stable disease or tumor regression. and we have done so at the 60 micrograms per kilogram dosing level. in parallel, dose escalation continues, and we are now at 80 micrograms per kilogram combined with usual dose of pembrolizumab.
the combination of pembro and cami is highly synergistic in models, and our trials are designed to take advantage of this in cancers that are not highly responsive to pembrolizumab alone. adct-901 targeting kaag1 is a novel first-in-class candidate for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. this includes platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, prostate cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer. in our labs, we have shown that kaag1 is differentially expressed on these cancers.
the dose escalation of the phase 1 study is ongoing. adct-601, mipasetamab-uzoptirine targets axl. this protein is overexpressed in many solid tumors such as lung, breast, prostate, pancreas, glioma, and esophageal cancers and is highly prevalent in sarcoma. we expect to initiate the phase 1b in the first half of this year.
the planned study will include a dose escalation followed by dose expansion in sarcoma patients in combination with gemcitabine and adct-601 monotherapy in patients in whom axl gene amplification is detected. in addition to our clinical programs, we have two advanced preclinical solid tumor programs. adct-701 targets dlk 1. we are developing this in neuroendocrine malignancies in collaboration with the national cancer institute.
our recently announced adct-212 program is our optimized second-generation pbd-based adc. this targets psma, a validated target in metastatic prostate cancer. we are currently completing ind-enabling work for both of these programs. with that, i will turn the call over to jenn to give a financial update.
jenn creel -- chief financial officer
thank you, joe, and good morning, everyone. as we reported in the press release issued earlier today, zynlonta net sales were $17 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $34 million for 8 months in 2021. as of december 31, we had cash and cash equivalents of $467 million, as compared to $530 million as of september 30, 2021. we used approximately $62 million in net cash for operating activities in the fourth quarter and $233 million in net cash for the full year 2021.
r&d expenses were $42 million for the fourth quarter and $158 million for the full year 2021, compared to $49 million and $142 million for the same quarter and full year 2020. r&d expense decreased for the quarter ended december 31, 2021, as compared to the same quarter in 2020, as a result of lower cmc activities following the zynlonta bla submission and subsequent approval. r&d expenses increased for the full year 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 due to investments in zynlonta trials in earlier lines of treatment and advancing our broad portfolio. as a result of these initiatives, employee headcount and share-based compensation expense increased.
selling and marketing expenses were $19 million for the fourth quarter and $65 million for the full year 2021, compared to $9 million and $22 million for the same quarter and full year 2020. the increase in selling and marketing for the quarter and for the full year reflects the expenses for the zynlonta launch and ongoing commercial efforts. g&a expenses were $18 million for the quarter and $71 million for the full year 2021, compared to $20 million and $55 million for the same quarter and full year 2020. g&a expenses decreased for the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation expense that was partially offset by higher costs of being a public company.
g&a expenses for the full year 2021 as compared to full year 2020 increased due to higher costs of being a commercial stage public company. net loss was $34 million for the fourth quarter and $230 million for the full year 2021, compared to a net loss of $56 million and $246 million for the same quarter and full year 2020. our diluted net loss per share was $0.45 in the fourth quarter and $3 for the full year 2021, compared to a net loss of $0.73 for the same quarter and $3.77 for the full year 2020. finally, adjusted net loss, a measure that excludes certain items as described in our press release issued earlier today, was $30 million for the fourth quarter and $186 million for the full year 2021, compared to an adjusted net loss of $63 million and $176 million in the same quarter and full year 2020.
the decrease in adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the same quarter 2020 was primarily due to the recognition of an income tax benefit as a result of recording a deferred tax asset, primarily related to u.s., r&d tax credits. the increase in adjusted net loss for full year 2021 over full year 2020 was primarily driven by the investment in the zynlonta launch and our broad clinical portfolio. the adjusted diluted net loss per share was $0.39 for the fourth quarter and $2.42 for the full year 2021, compared to a loss of $0.82 and $2.69 for the same quarter and full year 2020. with that, i will turn the call back to chris for closing remarks.
chris?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, jenn, joe, and jennifer. to conclude, in the fourth quarter, we made significant progress in all areas of our business, and we are well positioned to execute on our key objectives in the year ahead. this includes driving the zynlonta launch forward, working to develop zynlonta in earlier lines of therapy, continuing to expand our geographic reach and advancing our pipeline of differentiated hematological and solid tumor programs. i'm pleased now to open the call for your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from brian cheng with cantor. you may proceed with your question.
brian cheng -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. first one, jennifer, on the sales number, can you talk about how much of an inventory build is there? and can you talk about how benefit reauthorization is a factor on 1q sales? and i have a couple of follow-ups.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. sure, brian. so in terms of the inventory build, as i mentioned, we did see some modest inventory build toward the end of the year, both in the academic institutions and the communities. the issue is or i should say, it's hard to further characterize that because we don't have access to patient-level data.
but when we took a look at the ordering patterns for some of our key accounts, we did see greater-than-expected orders. so it's not possible at this point to quantify it, but we do believe there was some modest build toward the end of the year. in terms of benefit reverification, we think that oftentimes with part b drugs that sometimes the benefit verification that happens for all patients, government patients can sometimes result in a delay in getting treatment. we're watching it carefully, particularly in the context of covid and some of the healthcare worker shortage but that -- we'll have to report on that when we put down q1.
brian cheng -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. and then on pricing, we noticed that you took a 1.1% increase last month. just curious, any guidance on how we should think about your price increase moving forward? is that the number that we should be projecting for out years? and then i have 1 more follow-up for joe.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
sure. so when you think about new product pricing and price increase recommendations, there are a lot of considerations, as i'm sure you're aware of. we take into account the overall political and policy environment, the competitive context and also the impacts on reimbursement and physician cost recovery. so as we come into the year, we've been considering carefully all of these factors, each of them and altogether and all of the downstream implications.
and as well as the fact we just launched in may of 2021, so it's been less than a year and felt that a modest price increase was most appropriate at this time.
brian cheng -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. and then a quick question for joe. on the discontinuation for lotis-8. i'm just curious, are you still looking into frontline combination potential? and is the decision partly based on the polaris data and from your conversation with doctors, how important is it to have r-chop backbone in the front line?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
brian, the decision is partly related to the landscape, but it's also partly related to the data we have from our lead-in on lotis-5. i hesitate to use the term, but some of our advisors are telling us that the christmas tree approach, adding new drugs to r-chop is probably not what you would consider a modern approach. it could be incremental. and we're looking for a transformative approach to frontline.
we're still looking for a way to try to use the strength of lonca in combination with rituximab to really change the landscape for first line, get rid of many of these old toxic drugs that have been around since i was an intern. and provide new ways to get a long-term remission in patients when they have their first chance at a long-term remission. so it's really a difference between adding something and trying to get a small benefit, which is what i think you've seen with polaris versus trying to have a transformative approach to the first line. i really prefer the later, that's how you make advances in medicine.
and we have a lot of support from our advisors who are doing that. and we actually -- we're able to find a patient population that just about exactly suits what are the strengths of zynlonta, which is the tolerability and the activity. and with the combination data that we now have from our lead in, we're really confident that this could be a big improvement for a group of patients who really don't get quite the kinds of treatments that they deserve.
brian cheng -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
great. thanks, joe.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
you're welcome, brian.
operator
our next question comes from boris peaker with cowen. you may proceed with your question.
boris peaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. i'd just like to continue from the same line of questioning. so in the frail dlbcl patients that you're targeting lotis-9. can you comment on how big this patient population is today to where it's projected to be in the next several years and kind of what the standard of care is for these specific patients?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jennifer, can you take that first part -- sorry. go for it, joe.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
no. no. i was going to answer the last part of it, which there really is not a standard of care. that's one of the things we learned, that the doctors sometimes give nothing, sometimes they give rituximab, sometimes they give a course or two or something and they have to stop.
sorry, but i have to answer that part of it. so we're really in a place where we can have a transformative outcome. sorry, chris, i guess, jennifer, i'd like to defer to jennifer on the others, as you said.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. certainly. so, boris, the frail and unfit opportunity, i've been really impressed with the enthusiasm from our thought leaders about this. and largely because as joe said, there aren't a lot of clinical trials that include this population.
as we've engaged them in really optimizing the program, they've anecdotally reported a range of anywhere between 15% and 30% of the first-line population, which could be considered frail or unfit and not eligible for r-chop or r-mini-chop just based on comorbidities potentially. and recall the first-line population is approximately 60,000 patients in the u.s. and eu5. so at this point, we're engaging with the thought leaders from a commercial perspective, i'm very excited about it.
and mostly for the patients, because this is going to address an area of unmet medical need, where i think zynlonta is uniquely positioned to support our patients.
boris peaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. and my last question is on the zynlonta european strategy. can you comment how you're thinking of approaching that?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
yes. as you know, we're committed to developing lonca into the global markets. and we were very pleased to do the agreement with mitsubishi tanabe in japan. in europe, we're progressing well on the regulatory pathway.
and we're still looking at our alternative options for commercialization in europe. so as those develop, we will keep you updated.
boris peaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
our next question comes from kelly shi with jefferies. you may proceed with your question.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. there has been help through the quarters since zynlonta launch. i wonder if you're able to share some color on the patient profile across the zynlonta spectrum. specifically, what is the split of the patients taking zynlonta in [inaudible] beyond it also? what percentage of patients treated with zynlonta primary refractory and post cd19 car-t? and lastly, any feedback regarding the safety profile from physicians regarding their real-world experience?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jennifer, do you want to take the first part of that and then maybe joe can answer just the safety protocol part?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. certainly. thanks, chris. so we're pleased with now, i guess we're now 10 months into the market with how the real-world profile is consistent with the lotis-2 pivotal data, and we're hearing that through market research through advisory boards through engagements with our customers.
and we are seeing broad use of zynlonta across the entire spectrum of its indication in third-line plus supported by the nccn guidelines. in the early days of the launch and not unexpected, we did see zynlonta use predominantly in the later-line setting. but importantly, since launch now, we have seen a nice evolution in the business with an increasing proportion of third-line patients receiving zynlonta versus later lines. and we believe that's important for the patients because earlier line use will likely translate into even more benefit for our patients.
so, again, we're very excited about the opportunity and how the business is evolving and continue to believe that this is our year for establishing zynlonta as the third line plus standard of care. your question specifically with regard to subsets is very difficult to answer because, as i mentioned earlier, we don't necessarily have patient-level data and the data that we do receive does not rarely has complete demographic. so it's hard for me to say that. i mean what i am thrilled about, though, that based on the lotis-2 data, we do see consistent benefit across the subset and that has held up as we've gotten into the market.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
and with regards to safety profile?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
the safety profile is for me to answer. our surveillance is showing reports consistent with what we already knew. and that's nothing new, nothing unexpected, nothing more severe in general, based on what we know from lotis-2. we don't have quantitative data on how every doctor is treating and using the -- managing the side effect profile.
but in general, when we talk to our advisors or here's the advice we're giving in the label is working, and we're not seeing more dose delays or discontinuations than we anticipated from the lotis-2 profile. so far, what we're seeing in the clinical practice is consistent with what we saw in the clinical trial database.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
next question comes from matthew harrison of morgan stanley. you may proceed with your question.
unknown speaker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
this is steve [inaudible] for matthew harrison. i have a question for lonca. i want to ask about your view on the penetration into the key centers. and what is the opportunity in community centers?
chris martin -- chief executive officer
jennifer?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. no. i can take that. so as i reported, our volume to date or at least through 2021, is predominantly driven by the academic institutions, but we've also had some early community uptake.
as we think about the evolution of the business and with our permanent j code, which we now have confirmation, we'll be receiving -- will be effective on april 1. we're excited about the opportunity to move into the community. as you may be aware, in the community, the permanent j code can be a point of pivot for physicians being willing to try a new product because it does provide greater confidence around their timing to reimbursement, which is important for their practices. so in terms of penetration, we've seen an equal number of -- equal proportion, i should say, of accounts on the community and the academic setting ordering zynlonta with a greater volume coming from the academic institutions, but we do believe that, that will evolve as we have that opportunity with a permanent j code.
unknown speaker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from kennen mackay with rbc. you may proceed with your question.
kennen mackay -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi. congrats on the progress. maybe thinking about your zynlonta strategy, can you help us with the size of the newly incident frontline dlbcl market if it's unfit for r-chop? just thinking about the potential market that can be indicated by the lotis-9 trial. i'm curious what percent of newly incident patients that could represent? and then second for dr.
camardo. could you speak a little bit more to the lotis-3 trial and what a to the decision-making to refocus on rituximab combos versus the ibrutinib combo? was there some overlapping toxicity concern or other safety events in that combination with ibrutinib? or was the decision more just related to lack of sufficiently additive efficacy? thanks.
chris martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, kennen. jennifer, do you want to take the first part?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes. certainly. ken, so qualitatively, we've had a lot of enthusiasm from thought leaders, as i mentioned, because this is an under -- maybe underserved population by current clinical trials. and anecdotally, they have given us a range.
it really depends on the treatment setting, quite frankly, what the percentage of frail and unfit patients that they may have, but it does range somewhere between 15% and 30%. we're going to be doing some more work to really understand the footprint of these patients. but if you think about the first line opportunity is approximately 60,000 patients for the u.s. and eu5, it is a significant commercial opportunity.
and given the fact that it would be an area of high unmet medical need and leveraging the strength of our single agent profile then in combination with rituximab, i'm excited about the opportunity from a commercial perspective for sure.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
and the answer to your question is no. this was not a decision based on observation of overlapping toxicity. rather, it was a decision based on the observation that this combination might provide a modest additional benefit, perhaps in later line treatments using a drug ibrutinib, which does not have an indication for large cell and isn't very widely used versus a transformation for first-line indication using a drug that is widely used. and i mentioned in a population that in our view, is underserved.
and allowing us a chance to have an impact in patients at their first possible chance of cure. and also as a corollary, the lonca-rituximab combination is also helpful as a baseline for us to add some new drugs once we can prove benefit with that combination in the first line. that becomes a way of improving, changing, transforming the first-line treatment, eliminating the old drugs and adding some of the new ones. does that answer your question, i hope?
kennen mackay -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes. definitely. and maybe just going back to your comments around the additive -- i'm sorry, the additive efficacy of rituximab. can you maybe help sort of set some goalposts there, how -- is that truly additive? should we be thinking about the potential front line rituximab efficacy there with some of the maybe response rates we've seen from zynlonta in the third line? or how should we think about that?
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
yes. think about it as better than what we're seeing in the -- what we were seeing in the third line, which is actually very good. i mean, our 25% complete response rate in third line is actually very good as a single agent, and that's not just third line, that's fourth line, fifth line. we're adding rituximab and seeing an improvement.
i can't exactly tell you what it is because we -- at this point in time, we have a pretty small sample. but there's also evidence from our labs on this combination. and it's interesting, there's a large body of evidence that shows rituximab, in general, will add to the effectiveness of most of the cytotoxic drugs. so we're sort of building on something that's almost a biologic principle here.
and we're seeing pretty good confirmation in our early lotis-5. but i just -- a number just doesn't at this point. it's a little too early to come out with a number, but we are seeing what looks like it's -- the combination is an improvement over what we're seeing in the third line, as i said, which is pretty good, actually at 25%, very good. so, ok.
kennen mackay -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks a bunch.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
ok.

chris martin -- former chief executive officer
thank you, amanda. and good morning, everyone. since co-founding adc therapeutics in 2011, i've had the privilege of taking our proprietary adc technology from discovery, to the bench, to the clinic, and then to our first fda approval of zynlonta. it is extremely rewarding to see zynlonta benefiting patients, and addressing an unmet need in the third line plus dlbcl market.
i've seen the company grow from a private start-up to a new york stock exchange-listed company. we now have over 300 employees, a commercial product on the market in zynlonta, ten progressing to a bla submission, and five promising solid tumor programs in development. the approval of zynlonta was a highlight for me, and since then i've been contemplating my next steps. with the company and the pipeline in such a strong position, i'm delighted to hand the ceo role to ameet mallik.
i'm extremely confident that he is the right person to lead the company into its next chapter of growth from here. logistically, i will serve as an advisor to the company the next three months to ensure a seamless transition. and i'm very happy to be serving as a non-executive member of the board of directors, and the chair of the science and technology committee. amit has significant experience in oncology and commercialization and a compelling vision for leading adc therapeutics in its next phase of growth.
ameet spent 16-years at novartis, where he ultimately served as executive vice president, and head of us oncology, a 6 billion division of novartis. prior to that, he held various leadership roles at novartis oncology, including head of global marketing, value, and access, and head of latin america and canada. he also served as global head of biopharmaceuticals and oncology injectables at sandoz, and head of global strategic planning at novartis pharmaceuticals. i mean, i was recently served as ceo of rafael holdings, a biotech company, focused on developing oncology and immune therapies.
adct will benefit greatly from a wide range of operational and strategic experiences, as well as his oncology expertise. i would like to formally welcome ameet to the adct, and invite him to say a few words, ameet.
ameet mallik -- chief executive officer
thank you, chris, for the kind introduction, and the warm welcome. i'm thrilled to join the adc therapeutics team. i've had the pleasure of meeting the board and many members of the executive team, and i'm impressed by the company's unwavering commitment to developing novel cancer treatments for patients. in addition to the people and culture of the company, i was drawn to the industry-leading adc platform and cutting-edge technology.
adct has an impressive portfolio of pipeline assets and a very productive research team. in addition, i am pleased to join a commercial-stage company with a differentiated product zynlonta, and its potential to move into earlier lines of therapy. i'm excited by the opportunity to build on the solid foundation, to take the company to our next phase of growth, and to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. in the coming weeks, i look forward to meeting our employees across sites, understanding the business and portfolio plans at a deeper level, and to engaging with many of you.
i want to thank chris for his partnership in this transition, and i look forward to continue to work with chris in the future. with that, i will hand the call back over to chris for business updates.
chris martin -- former chief executive officer
thank you, ameet. now i'm very pleased to share an update on our progress during the first quarter of 2022. starting with zynlonta launch, we delivered $16.5 million in net sales in q1. we are encouraged by the progress of the launch to date, and our ability to provide a truly differentiated treatment option to dlbcl patients.
sales in the first quarter were unfavorably impacted by our customers' modest inventory build at the end of 2021, and there were fewer new patient starts in dlbcl in q1, which was exacerbated by the omicron surge. however, we are pleased to see increasing product awareness, familiarity, trial, and repeat ordering. with face-to-face opportunities trending upwards through q1, we are confident in our ability to continue to grow zynlonta, as we strive to establish zynlonta as a third-line standard of care for dlbcl. jennifer herron, our chief commercial officer, will share more details on the q1 launch dynamics a bit later in this call.
moving on to our zynlonta development plan, we are exploring the potential of zynlonta in combination with castuximab in first and second-line dlbcl. we have a lotis-5 clinical trial, which is the ongoing confirmatory phase three study in second-line patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. as you will recall, we successfully completed the safety needed for this study, which also showed additive efficacy, and we continue to enroll patients in the randomized portion of this study. in addition, we also plan to initiate lotis-9, our first-line study in unfit or frail patients later this year.
[inaudible] the 12-month patient follow-up in the pivotal phase two trial has been completed. we have submitted that data in an abstract for an upcoming hematology conference, and we are preparing for a pre-bla meeting with the fda. we remain excited about our promising pipeline of solid tumor programs, including three clinical programs. these are cami, targeting cd25, adct-901, targeting kaag-1,and adct-601, targeting axl.
we also have two other solid tumor programs in ind-enabling studies, adct-701, targeting dlk1, and adct-212 targeting psma. dr. joe comodo, chief medical officer, will elaborate on these and other programs shortly. finally, we ended the quarter with a strong cash position of $431 million, which gives us a substantial cash runway to continue investing in the zynlonta launch, lifecycle, and our pipeline.
in addition, we have up to $100 million in potential milestones from our healthcare royalty partners agreement. looking to expand our access to patients globally, we are pleased that the overland adct biopharma joint venture continues to make good progress with the continued enrollment of the pivotal trial. we are making solid progress in our partnership with mitsubishi, tanabe pharmaceutical corp. in japan.
and finally, we continue to advance our regulatory submission in europe. i would now like to turn the call over to jennifer to report on us zynlonta launch. jennifer.
jenn creel -- chief financial officer
thank you, chris, and good morning, everyone. i am pleased to share an update on the progress of this zynlonta launch and report our q1 performance with zynlonta the net sales of $16.5 million. as we mentioned on the q4 earnings call, we did see a modest customer inventory build at the end of the year, which we believe we have worked through during the first quarter. in addition, there was a decrease in dlbcl new patient starts in q1 2022 versus the prior quarter.
the decrease in new patient starts is largely attributable to insurance benefit reverification, as well as covid-related impacts. the omicron surge during the first half of q1 also impacted face-to-face interactions, especially with comprehensive cancer centers, academic institutions, and integrated healthcare systems. regarding zynlonta q1 launched dynamic, we have made significant progress in terms of increasing product awareness, familiarity, trial, and adoption. we have seen increase in lots of patients share in the third line plus setting, with healthcare professionals confirming that their real-world experience with zynlonta is consistent with our latest two pivotal data.
importantly, face-to-face engagements increased throughout the quarter and are above the industry benchmark of 50% of total interactions. since launch, over 75% of accounts that have ordered zynlonta have reordered. reflecting a positive position and patient experience. over 96% of our priority accounts have ordered zynlonta with approximately 90% of priority accounts reordering.
importantly, 94% of nccn centers have ordered zynlonta. in q1, we continue to drive account depth and breadth. we grew our ordering account base 40% versus 2021, with two-thirds of q1 new accounts coming from the community. and we expect continued new community account acquisition with the full execution of our permanent j-code.
with higher volumes of third line plus patients in academic centers, we continue to see about 60% of zynlonta volume through academic accounts. zynlonta differentiated product profile continues to resonate with the [inaudible] community. as you will recall in our pivotal phase two trial, nearly half of all patients receiving zynlonta reached a pr or better. importantly, 25% of patients treated within zynlonta achieved a cr with a median time to cr of six weeks.
this efficacy, in combination with our tolerable side effect profile and convenient administration, continues to be a very competitive and compelling choice for hcps and patients. we are pleased to have received the permanent j-code, j9359, which was effective as of april 1st. since april 1st, we have executed our cross-functional communication plan to our prioritized payors, including revisions of a significant number of major medical policies with our permanent j-code. we have received positive feedback from community practices and importantly, major community oncology networks, representing opportunities for zynlonta growth in the coming quarters.
in summary, despite the q1 headwinds, we are pleased with the launch progress to date, and more importantly, our opportunities for future growth. we remain confident in the continued successful launch of zynlonta, as well as its long-term value as the standard of care in third line plus, and a cornerstone for dlbcl treatment overall. we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. now i'll turn the call over to joe to provide an update on our clinical development portfolio and research pipeline.
joe.
joe camardo -- chief medical officer
thank you, jennifer. i will start with updating you on zynlonta development programs. we continue to direct our efforts to the combination of zynlonta with castuximab in both the second and first-line treatment for dlbcl. this combination offers the opportunity for patients to be treated with a regimen that will be effective, well-tolerated, and straightforward to administer.
this regimen will also address significant unmet needs that persist despite recent advances in other treatments for dlbcl. the phase three [inaudible] in lotus-5 in second-line dlbcl, is proceeding for patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. the safety part of the trial showed good safety and good tolerability, and the data suggest the combination is adequate. based on this, the randomized phase of the 350 patient trial continues to enroll at sites around the world.
later this year, we will initiate lotis-9, a study to evaluate zynlonta in combination with castuximab in first-line dlbcl patients who are unfit or frail. this is a segment of the first -ine dlbcl patient population that is unable to tolerate the full r-chop regimen. our advisors tell us that there is a significant unmet need in these unfit or frail patients. with these patients, there have been no specific advances that take advantage of the new drugs.
partly because these patients are routinely excluded from clinical trials. we have engaged with physicians and oncology networks who see unfit and frail patients on a regular basis, and there is keen interest to find a new regimen that will be an improvement and an innovation for this population. this quarter, we will also initiate our lotis-7 umbrella study. based on strong pre-clinical data, and our interest to develop combinations for zynlonta with new drugs,  this study will allow multiple combination arms.
we will start with the combination of the zynlonta and [inaudible] for a face to load of six trial in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, as a reminder, the comparator ideally served was voluntarily withdrawn from the follicular lymphoma market. the study remains on hold, while we work with our advisors and the fda on potential next steps. overall, we remain very excited about the opportunity to expand the uses in zynlonta in first and second lines with dlbcl patients. we are fully focused on the execution of these trials, and we look forward to keeping you updated on their progress.
turning to cammy in hodgkin lymphoma, the 12-month patient follow-up in the pivotal phase two data has been completed. we have submitted the data in an abstract for an upcoming immunology conference. we are in the process of compiling a briefing book in advance of a pre-bla meeting with the fda, and we will share our plans for the regulatory submission with you later this year. now moving on to our solid tumor portfolio.
first, we have our ongoing cami phase one, the safety and efficacy dose-escalation trial in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. we have completed escalation to 80 micrograms per kg, and are now proceeding to the 100 micrograms per kg dose. while proceeding with escalation, we also started a small dose-expansion cohort at 60 micrograms per kg. this study was designed to allow for expansion and enrollment of a small number of patients at any dose, which activity was observed, so that's what we did.
when we complete the escalation and the optimum dose has been determined, the study will enter a dose-expansion phase. we expect to have data on the safety and tolerability of the combination, as well as signals of efficacy next year. i'm personally very fortunate to be in the position here at adc, to explore the potential of adct-901 targeting kaag-1. it is a truly novel first-in-class candidate for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors.
the dose escalation of the phase one study started at 15 micrograms per kg. we have completed the 30 microgram per kg dose level, and we are now at the flat dose of 4.5 milligrams. we expect to have an initial indication of the safety and tolerability, as well as early signals of anti-tumor activity by 2023. like any dose escalation program, the exact timing is hard to predict.
next,we have adct-601 [inaudible] our product that it's directed to the surface protein called axl. this protein is overexpressed in many solid tumors and it's highly prevalent in sarcoma. we expect to initiate the phase one b in the coming weeks. the study includes a monotherapy arm in patients with whom actual gene amplification is detected and a combination arm with gemcitabine in patients with sarcoma.
in addition to our clinical programs, we have two advanced preclinical solid tumor programs. adct-701 targeting dlk-1, which we are developing for neuroendocrine malignancies in collaboration with the national cancer institute. our adct-212 program is our optimized second generation, pbd-based adc, targeting psma, validated targets in metastatic prostate cancer. we are currently completing inc-enabling work for both of these programs.
as you can see, we continue to make great progress with our development, and preclinical programs, and we have a robust, and active pipeline. with that, i will turn the call over to jen to give a financial update. jen.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
thank you, joe. and good morning, everyone. as we reported in the press release issued earlier today, zynlonta net sales were $16.5 million for the first quarter, 2022. as of march 31st, we had cash and cash equivalents of $431 million, as compared to $467 million as of december 31st, 2021.
this does not include up to $100 million in potential milestones from our healthcare royalty partners' transaction. during the first quarter, we received the $30 million upfront from mitsubishi tanabe for us and launched a japanese license agreement. we used approximately 34 million in net cash for operating activities in the first quarter of 2022. r&d expenses were $49 million to the first quarter 2022, compared to 39 million for the same quarter 2021.
r&d expense increased for the quarter ended march 31, 2022, as compared to the same quarter in 2021. as a result of our investments in zynlonta trials in earlier lines of treatment and advancing our broad portfolio. selling and marketing expenses were $18 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to $14 million for the same quarter 2021. the increase in selling and marketing for the quarter, reflects the expenses for those in zynlonta launch and ongoing commercial efforts, as zynlonta was approved in the second quarter of last year.
g&a expenses were $19 million for the quarter compared to $18 million for the same quarter 2021. g&a expenses increased for the first quarter 2022, as compared to the same quarter in 2021, primarily due to increases in professional fees associated with the japanese license agreement. that loss was $17 million for the first quarter, compared to a net loss of $52 million for the same quarter 2021. our diluted net loss per share was $0.22 in the first quarter, compared to a net loss per share of $0.67 for the same quarter 2021.
adjusted net loss, a measure that excludes certain items, as described in the press release issued earlier today, was $28 million for the first quarter, compared to an adjusted net loss of $57 million in the same quarter 2021. the adjusted diluted net loss per share was $0.36 for the first quarter, compared to an adjusted net loss per share of $0.74 for the same quarter 2021. the decrease in net loss, and adjusted net loss for the first quarter 2022 as compared to the same quarter 2021 was primarily driven by license revenue of $30 million arising from the mitsubishi tanabe agreement. these decreases were partially offset by the increase in r&d and selling and marketing expenses i mentioned earlier.
in addition, net loss decreased for the first quarter of 2022, as a result of income arising from a cumulative catch-up adjustment, associated with the valuation of our deferred obligation with healthcare royalty partners. partially offset by higher interest expense, associated with our deerfield credit facility and deferred obligations, both of which are excluded from our adjusted net loss. with that, i will turn the call back to chris for closing remarks. chris.
chris martin -- former chief executive officer
thank you, ameet, jennifer, joe, and jen. to conclude, in the first quarter, we remain focused on executing on all areas of the business, and we are well-positioned to achieve our key objectives going forward. this includes driving the zynlonta launch, working to develop zynlonta in any lines of therapy, continuing to expand our geographic reach, and advancing our pipeline of differentiated ecological and solid tumor programs. i'm looking forward to working with ameet, and the adct-2.
now the team will be available for questions. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instruction] and our first question comes from the line of matthew harrison with morgan stanley. your line is open. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
hi, i'm steve, as  for matthew. i want to ask for large yield until lunch dynamic. i want to ask about how much impact was for  omicron versus new patient starts. and have you ever seen inflection in new patient starts in the recent months? thank you.
chris martin -- former chief executive officer
thank you. just jennifer, do you want to take that?
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
yes, certainly. so good morning, and thanks for the question. as we've mentioned, the [inaudible] environment, and both, and the third line plus dlbcl market dynamics have been uniquely challenging. but we're pleased with the progress we've made since the launch of zynlonta through q1, which is less than a year on the market.
i did mention in my remarks the q1 headwinds of both the q4 inventory build and burn, as well as omicron-related impacts, and it's hard to really separate out the two. we don't get necessarily patient-level data, but we did watch account activity carefully in q4. i did mention that in q1, we did not see an inventory build, the inventory levels have normalized. so i think that both those impacts of lower patients, lower level of patients presenting for treatment, as well as inventory build are the result of the q1 net sales of $16.5 million.
unknown speaker
i'm sorry. the second part is, have you seen an inflection in your patient starts in recent months.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
so at this time, we're not going to comment on q2. we will be reporting our q2 results in the august timeframe. we are encouraged, though, by the increased face-to-face interactions that we've seen opening up as we progressed through q1. we're very excited about the opportunity to fully launch our j-code, which was effective as of april 1st.
understanding that over time, we'll be able to bring zynlonta to patients in need in the community, as the patient distribution is a little different than in the academic institutions that see a fair number of concentrated saline [inaudible] dlbcl patients. so we're very excited that the zynlonta product profile is holding up in the marketplace as we saw in lotis-2, and confident that we will be able to establish and launch as a third line standard of care.
unknown speaker
got you. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instruction] and our next question comes from the line of kelly shi with jefferies. your line is open. please go ahead.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. my first question is, will they not be able to share information on the breakdown yourselves among the patients who had a prior car-t treatment versus like a no prior car-t treatment? and my second question is, would you expect the patient to prescribed from community centers, having given a patient a baseline regarding the proportion of patients with prior car-t treatment? and if so, should we expect a different the sales ramp up at a community center versus academic centers? thank you.
chris martin -- former chief executive officer
jennifer, do you want  to take that? i don't know. also, joe might want to comment from the medical side afterwards.
jennifer herron -- chief commercial officer
ok. chris, i'll take the first part, and then i'll ask joe for his input as well. so kelly, thanks for your question. we're very excited about the community opportunity.
we do appreciate that on a per physician basis, the concentration of third line plus dlbcl patients is less than we see in the academic centers where we do have concentrated third line plus patients. in terms of your question with regard to prior car-t, we don't necessarily have patient-level data so that we could understand their prior therapies or even their future therapies after they received their launch. we have seen a lot of enthusiasm from thought leaders about the post car-t setting, because it is an emerging area of high unmet medical need. in the community, what we're excited about is the opportunity to offer our differentiated product profile to patients in the community who perhaps are not car-t eligible, or don't want to make the trip to a car-t, center because of our differentiate product profile, which has very robust single-agent efficacy, very respectable response rates, including 25% cr with a very fast time to time cr in just six weeks.
and so for patients that want to stay in the community, we do think the latter is the best agent for them in the third line plus setting. so with the j-code, we're excited about bringing zynlonta into the community for patients who need it.
kelly shi -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you, super helpful.
operator
thank you. [operator instruction] and i would like to turn the conference back over to chris martin for any further remarks.
chris martin -- former chief executive officer
sorry, operator. i thought you might have someone there. well, thank you very much for joining our call today. it's been a real pleasure leading adc therapeutics over the last 11 years.
and in particular, i would like to thank each, and every one of our employees for their real commitment to the company, and their passion for the science and for serving patients. this has really been at the core of the driving force behind the progress of everything we've done, and will continue to be so, i'm sure. i've also enjoyed working with you and getting to know many of you over the years. i'm delighted to be handing over to ameet, to lead adc therapeutics for the next chapter of our growth, and i'm sure you will enjoy working with him.
so thank you all for your continued support. we look forward to keep you updated on our progress. have a nice day, everyone. thank you.
