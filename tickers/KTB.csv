scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
thank you, eric. good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. we at kontoor brands sincerely hope you and your families are safe and healthy and will continue to be well as we all seek to navigate these unprecedented times. we will go through our first quarter results in a bit, but before that i'd like to share perspective on a few key areas. first, i'd like to provide context around the current environment how and where our business has been impacted by the covid-19 crisis next. next, i'll talk to the decisive actions we've taken during the first quarter to support the health and safety of our colleagues around the globe, as well as strengthen our financial flexibility and bolster liquidity. many of these actions are consistent with our strategies since the spin. and have now been either amplified or accelerated to more effectively minimize the impacts associated with the coronavirus pandemic. and finally, i'll highlight why we believe our model is more advantage to not only weather the near-term storms but positions us for success in the rapidly changing economic and consumer landscape, as we move into the new environment, we anticipate following the crisis.
so let me start by providing some thoughts on how the covid-19 crisis has impacted our business. in asia, the most pronounced impact has been in china, where significant demand softening began at the end of january and continued throughout the first quarter of 2020. at the peak of the crisis approximately 90% of our owned and partner stores were closed. currently the china recovery continues to gradually build momentum led by the digital channel and all brick-and-mortar stores have reopened. although, the recovery process remains in the early stages, the sequential weekly improvement in recent brick-and-mortar comps we have seen is encouraging. the china recovery serves as a blueprint with some distinct nuances for our us and european businesses. in europe, significant demand declines began to accelerate in the middle of march as many key markets went under stay-at-home orders and largely remained so today. our distribution network remains operational for digital and hotel orders, but offices and stores in the region are essentially closed. in north america, significant softening and demand began during march; although demand remains soft today many of our largest hotel customers remain operational.
we continue to receive and ship orders from our distribution centers in the us and while early days wholesale orders had accelerated meaningfully over the last few weeks. to date, we have not experienced significant service disruptions with our customers given our global, diversified supply chain network. during the first quarter, we took several additional strategic actions regarding the well-being of our colleagues, which remains our top priority as covid-19 emerged in february and spread globally in march we proactively implemented measures including closing our own retail stores first in china and then around the rest of the world. our internal covid-19 task force has been implemented contingency protocols for working remotely as governmental stay-at-home orders emerged. remote work policies will remain in effect until restrictions are lifted at which time a phased and conditional approach will be implemented. furthermore, across our corporate and regional offices, retail stores manufacturing facilities and distribution centers, deep cleaning and sanitary protocols have been implemented to support the safety of company associates. given covid-19 impact accelerated, we also took personal decisions, including announcement temporary salary reductions for senior management and other key leaders.
unfortunately as the covid-19 crisis intensified, these impacts extended to our global team as we made the very difficult decision to reduce headcount in certain areas. implement temporary furloughs and additional salary reductions, impacting many of our colleagues around the world in our own retail stores, distribution centers and corporate and regional offices. we are grateful for the commitment of our extraordinary people and we look forward to welcoming our furloughed colleagues back. also during the first quarter, we took action to help our communities by producing level one patient and disposable isolation gowns to assist hospitals that are dealing with the influx of patients as a result of covid-19. the gowns are being produced at our plants with fabric donated by several suppliers and being donated to north carolina based hospitals. we are proud to support the effort of many across the country in fighting covid-19. we continue to look for ways we can help our communities and the people most affected by this crisis. we've also proactively taken significant financial measures to both ensure near-term financial flexibility and strengthen liquidity, but also position us for future success.
and this future doesn't assume a return to pre-coronavirus normalcy, but one in which we assume a prolonged covid-19 operating environments for the balance of 2020 including our expectation of higher promotional levels and accelerated retailer door closures. while this crisis has undoubtedly impacted countless lives and disrupted businesses all over the world including ours. we also believe we have an opportunity to help lead our industry in shaping the new future and we are well prepared to do just that. so let me provide an overview of the financial actions we've taken to support our liquidity and greater financial flexibility. we renegotiated our credit facility including amending covenants for the future periods and drawing down $475 million on our revolvers in the first quarter prior to the amendment in conjunction with our amended credit facility, we have temporarily suspended payment of a dividend. a topic, i will spend more time on in a moment. we've taken reductions across variable and discretionary expenses, as well as select capital expenditures. let me be clear here though, we continue to invest behind long term, high roi areas including defending and enhancing our core business and driving new business development opportunities. further evolution of our accretive digital and international businesses, as well as the implementation of our new global erp.
rustin will provide greater detail in most of these actions a bit later. but i wanted to address one of these topics upfront and that is the dividend. in conjunction with our recently amended credit facility, we have temporarily suspended the dividend. key is the word temporarily. the decision to amend the credit facility and suspend the dividend was not taken lightly as we understand how foundational the dividend is to our long-term story. the payment of a dividend has been and will be an essential element of the contour investment thesis in total shareholder return model. and our management team and the company's board of directors are committed to reestablishing a dividend as soon as appropriate. in fact, based on the terms of our new credit agreement, the current board will have an opportunity to reevaluate the dividend as early as the fourth quarter of 2020. we and we think most in the investment community share this view; believe that cash is king in the current unprecedented environment. so while we recognize the temporary dividend suspension steps away from our long-term investment thesis, the decision to amend our credit facility and drive enhanced financial flexible is the right one.
particularly as we made the difficult decision to furlough many of our colleagues. you've seen us take meaningful transformational actions since our spin almost one year ago. from the structuring to cost savings to quality of sales additions. all designed to create the foundation for long-term success. we believe these strategic actions and decisive amplified measures were taken in response to covid-19, not only helped navigate the near-term challenges but set us up for success over the long term. which leads me to offer a reminder of why we believe the kontoor model is advantages both during and coming out of this crisis? first, our portfolio consists of two of the largest, most iconic global denim brands that offer consumers an outstanding value proposition. second, we maintained a long track record of delivering strong financial performance and cash flows during challenged economic cycles. third, we are partnered with the best in class winning retailers. fourth, the restructuring and quality of sales initiatives, we've implemented have driven operational improvement and distribution enhancement. fifth, the story growth to dvc with a focus on owned.com and digital wholesale and international afford accretive diversification.
and finally our supply chain, owned manufacturing currently supports the position of strength and flexibility. let me dimensionalize each of these competitive advantages a bit further, as always it starts with the brands. we're fortuned to own two of the most iconic global brands within apparel, wrangler and lee. these brands have 200 plus years of collective authenticity between them, from the great depression to the world war, to cog inflation, these brands have lived through challenging global crises before. and while this is current novel coronavirus pandemic is unprecedented, we believe these brands histories. authenticity in connection to consumers bolstered more recently by investments in demand creation and innovation, position our brands to endure. we believe now is the time to connect with our consumer like never before. and that several initiatives during the first quarter we were doing just that. i'll share just two examples. first, we recently launched a new digital wrangler campaign called long lived cowboys that we're really proud of and we speak to the perseverance of our organization through this difficult time. and equally it's important, reaches our consumers in a highly authentic way.
we encourage you to check up the campaign on many of the large social media platforms including instagram, facebook and twitter. and given most of the country's stay home orders, we created the can't stop country music series hosted every night at five pm on our wrangler network and wrangler brand facebook pages. and on the artist facebook pages as well with participation from country stars cody johnson and jon pardi. we were able to reach our consumers in a highly unique way, one that provides a bit of an entertaining break on the challenges associated with the crisis. over four million viewers have already tuned into this really personal differentiated entertainment experience. we will not go quiet with our consumer even during these times when it is important to stay apart and we will continue to invest in the highest return areas that elevate our brand's authenticity in connection to our customers and consumers. and just as our brands have maintained a long history to a wider variety of economic cycles so too has our operating model. just looking back over the last decade or so alone, we've seen a great recession, the carbon bubble, key retailer bankruptcies, door closures and destocking events. we are certainly not immune to these macro-economic shocks but our fundamentals are resilient, most notably our ability to generate consistent and strong cash flow.
rustin will take you through more details later but let me say this, we have stress tested our model. and we believe we are taking the appropriate actions in support of strengthening our liquidity, driving enhanced financial flexibility and bolstering cash generation through this uncertain environment. and perhaps equally as important as the strength of our model is the strength of the retail customers with whom we partnered. we had and we'll continue to win with winning retailers including our largest retail partners, wal-mart, amazon, target and kohl's. these incredible partners are positioned as stable long-term winners and a respective channel of distribution. as demonstrated since the spin, we have aggressively invested in defending this core and well positioned to continue our highly productive collaboration with these incredible wholesalers into the future. and there's a true point that these investments are paying off, we were excited to announce today that we have significant program wins and distribution gains beginning in the second half of 2020. as you know, over the last year we've been implementing enhanced new business development strategies that are generating material new successes.
let me share two examples, first, as i've mentioned in the past, the lee brand is under distributed in the us. this fall we have won distribution programs with key north american partners including a sizable program that launches over 2000 doors during the third quarter. second, our wrangler atg platform continues to build on its early success in the us leveraging its value oriented high-performance innovation to scale across regions. in the second half of 2020, we will be launching the program in more than 400 doors with a key european retailer. we are extremely excited to share the second half wins but rest assured we are just in the beginning stages and we expect to share more in upcoming earnings calls. in addition to program wins, i also want to touch on the evolution of our digital business. with our digital wholesale business increasing 15% globally during the first quarter. and 41% within the us, we have solid proof point that our investments in these channels are highly productive.
we have been and we'll continue to aggressively invest behind our digital business. and while still it's early days, the transformation of our owned digital eco-system is well under way. we're excited to announce that recent addition of our new vp of global digital who brings over 20 years of progressively increasing experience with building branded digital platforms. with new leadership we will take a step change in developing our best in class omnichannel experience for our consumers. we also recently went live with our new digital platform in europe, and we'll soon go live in the us as well. as you all know, the implementation of our new global erp system and infrastructure will be a key enabler of our digital evolution. and finally, with respect to our model, let me speak to our supply chain, currently a distinct competitive advantage, particularly when faced with demand and supply shocks like apparel industry is experiencing now. owned manufacturing allows us to tightly manage the inventory and positions us to most effectively react as conditions normalize. critical in supporting wholesale partners, need to service consumers when market conditions improve both vertically innovative manufacturing located in the western hemisphere allows us to scale production with shorter lead times as demand stabilizes.
so how does this all come together? our advantage model, coupled with decisive actions we've taken during the first quarter to support the welfare of our global team and strengthen our financial flexibility, highlight our adaptability as an organization. and position us for future success. no doubt uncertain times remain, but we are confident in the strategies and actions we've taken since the spin. and now amplified during the first quarter that should enable kontoor to emerge from this crisis, well positioned to best serve the future needs of our stakeholders.
with that i'll turn it over to rustin.
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, scott, and good morning, everyone. we have a lot to cover this morning, so let me outline the balance of the call. first, i will walk through how our actions to address our financial resilience unfolded as the impacts of covid-19 accelerated across our business. specifically, we will cover our employee, liquidity and financing actions and implications as we know these are top of mind issues. next, we will review our first quarter results, where possible we will highlight direct impacts from covid-19. finally, although we will not be providing guidance at this time given the uncertain operating environment, we will provide thoughts on shaping the balance of the year. as outlined before our priority was to support the health and safety of our associates around the world. and we begin our response as covid-19 began to emerge with these actions, scott reviewed earlier. after addressing employees, we quickly turned to liquidity and financing. in march, we announced that we had drawn down $475 million from our revolving credit facility. we took this action as a precautionary measure, to increase financial flexibility, strengthen our near-term cash position and provide additional funding for working capital.
with near-term liquidity secured, we begin immediate no regret actions to execute temporary operating and capital expense reductions and adjust near-term production to better align supply and demand. next, given the uncertain nature of the environment, under various demand scenarios for 2020 we modeled an incredibly important to note, we projected adequate liquidity to provide operating flexibility. the strong cash generation aspects of our operating model, which we have discussed many times since the spin, are of paramount importance in challenging times. our two iconic brands, with over 200 years of history, have weathered many storms, and we believe the compelling value of our trusted brands continue to offer are critical in an uncertain environment. based upon the scenarios, we also evaluated the covenant under our credit facility. under a prolonged covid-19 scenario in 2020, including accelerated door closures in a heightened promotional environment, we did forecast the potential for future period leverage ratio covenant challenges within our original credit facility.
accordingly, well in advance of any potential issues, we began efforts to proactively amend our facility and announce the successful completion of these actions this morning. key elements of the amendment include, one, covenant release in future periods with a focus on our net leverage ratio. two, minimum liquidity requirements to the end of the second quarter of 2021, or earlier if certain criteria are met. and three, suspension of dividend payments for the second and third quarters of 2020 with restricted payments, including dividends, permitted after the third quarter if certain criteria are met. an 8-k was filed this morning with additional details on the amendment. as scott mentioned, in conjunction with our amended credit facility, our board of directors has temporarily suspended the payment of a dividend. in addition to the flexibility of the amendment affords, we believe it was the appropriate action. scott walked through some of the operating and capital expenditure reductions, but i want to assure you that we continue to challenge all operating expenses, from travel to non-business critical meetings, to samples and prototypes to outside services.
as part of this process we have engaged and encouraged our associates around the world to rethink our traditional norms of doing business and share their thoughts on how we can streamline and improve operations. let me share a couple of examples where we have leveraged technology and reimagined key business activities. first, in china we held our first virtual meeting through wechat with our dealers that included online product assets, marketing highlights and 24x7 supports. next, globally we shifted all sales meeting to a virtual format, where new products, marketing campaigns and best practices are shared. and finally, in the us, we've conducted virtual design workshops, and prototype sessions, enabled by collaboration software. in addition to rethinking how we work in this new reality, we are also continuing, as we have done since the spin-off, to explore additional cost saving and streamlining opportunities. this week, we are announcing the consolidation of our vf outlet headquarters, from reading, pennsylvania, to our corporate headquarters in greensborough, north carolina. this difficult decision was not taken lightly, and we want to thank our reading associates for their dedication and commitment.
we anticipate the actions will be completed by the end of 2020, and over the next few months, we will further define our future structure, operations and transition plans. although, we remain focused on streamlining our operations, we are committed to continued investment behind key strategic initiatives including, but not limited to, our global erp implementation and the digital enhancements scott mentioned earlier. finally, i'd like to address our supply chain, as i know inventory is a topic of interest. our supply chain remains a competitive advantage, particularly with respect to inventory management. as we minimize demand and supply and balances in this dynamic landscape, our vertically integrated manufacturing, which represents just over one third of our production, allows us to reduce production in light of decreased volume requirements, avoid the creation of excess inventory, minimize cash flow impacts, while providing the agility to meet demand and support new program wins as governmental restrictions permit. we are also actively working with our supply partners around the globe to minimize inventory and service delays.
while select countries continue to have operating restrictions in place, our diversified supply chain network of internally manufactured and source product reduces risk. today, we have not experienced material interruptions with our customers in our supply chain. now let's get to our first quarter review. unless otherwise stated, results will be on an adjusted basis. given the unprecedented times, our revenue review will be modified to provide additional detail that we believe is important to give context as to how performance evolved during the quarter. although it is not possible to clearly delineate the covid-19 impact and we are not attempting to do so by sharing further breakdown within the quarter. we believe it is meaningful perspective in light of the environment and will therefore take this unusual step for this review. global revenue decreased 20% on a reported basis in the first quarter, compared with adjusted revenues for the same quarter in 2019. headwinds from foreign currency represented one point of the decline. as expected driven by restructuring and quality of sales initiatives, february year-to-date global revenue declined mid-single digits compared to prior year with approximately one third of the decline from china, where the impact of covid-19 was most pronounced.
in march, as pandemic efforts accelerated on a global basis, revenue declined in the high 30% range compared to the prior year. on our last call, we also talked about our ongoing quality of sales actions that began in 2019 as well as planned decline in select dilutive lines of business. the quality of sales actions to improve our long-term operating performance that began in 2019 was the right thing to do then and they are clearly proving the right moves in this environment. these initiatives included business model changes and actions taken to exit and underperforming country and other global points of distribution including select channels in india. coupled with planned declines in diluted business such as reduced sales of certain lower margin lines and lower distress sales, these actions pressured first quarter revenue in the mid single digit range outside of the covid impact consistent with our expectations. on a regional basis for the quarter, us revenues were down 14%. through february revenue declined in the low single digit range as anticipated given quality of sales actions. march revenue declined in the high 20% range. these declines were partially offset by growth in digital with us digital wholesale increasing 41%. in our dotcom digital increasing 7%.
today most of our largest online and brick-and-mortar retail partners are open are placing orders and are receiving shipments albeit at lower volumes. despite lower sales volumes, we estimate that approximately 70% of our north american customers based upon 2019 sales volume remain open with at least reduced hours. the us represented 75% of our revenue in the quarter. outside of the us, international revenues declined 32% in constant currency. breaking down performance versus prior year by month january international revenue increased in the mid single digit range. as effects from covid-19 were more fully realized in china, february international revenue declined in the 30% range. finally, as the effects from the pandemic continued in china and we're more fully realized in europe and other international markets, march revenue decline in the high 50% range. as scott mentioned, our china recovery has continued to make progress in april. digital continues to lead the way with positive growth in both march and april. and all wholesale partner and owned stores have reopened and are experiencing week-on-week improving comp performance.
beyond covid-19 impact, the first quarter international decline was affected by planned exits and the business model changes, quality of sales actions and foreign currency, which combined pressured international revenue by high single digits. turning briefly to our channels, our reported revenue in our us wholesale channel which represented a 66% of our revenue was down 13%. the decline was primarily driven by covid-19 impacts. as mentioned, us digital wholesale remains a bright spot increasing 41%. this performance is a reflection of long standing partnerships with leading digital wholesale platforms and the investment, we've made into this important area. our branded direct to consumer channel which represented 10% of our revenues, declined 17%, due in large part the owned brick-and-mortar door closures. our owned digital business increased 1% driven by 7% growth in the us. while the impacts of covid-19 have been far reaching. we continue to see positive results from our investments in our digital platform. the implementation of our global erp system will be a significant enabler in developing our digital ecosystem. given the accretive under-indexed nature of this channel, we will continue to restore investments to grow in this area. finally, let's turn to our brands.
global revenue of our wrangler brand declined 17%, including one point of headwind from foreign currency. wrangler us revenue declined 14% in the period. the impacts from covid-19 planned lower distressed sales. and the planned exit or reductions of select non-core programs were the primary drivers of the us decline. these declines were partially offset by growth in digital both owned and wholesale. wrangler international revenue was down 27% reported during the quarter driven by covid-19 impacts. the actions taken in india and business model changes in europe. lee brand global revenue declined 24% include a point of headwind from foreign currency. lee us revenue decreased 9% driven by the previously mentioned covid-19 impacts and the transformational factors. we remain encouraged by the underlying progress of the lee us business, including the previously mentioned new program wins. through february, our lee us business was up high-single digits. lee international revenue was down 38% with a point from fx.
nearly half the decline was driven by china as much of the country was placed on locked down for the majority of february and march. now on to gross margin, total adjusted gross margin decreased 320 basis points to 38%. the decline was primarily driven by the following factors. first inventory provisions, based upon higher levels of excess and distressed goods and lower anticipated recovery rates, represented a 340 basis point headwind in the quarter. next, lower international revenue lead by china also adversely impacted geographic mix by 210 basis points. finally, the cost of downtime in our plans as we reduced production to align supply and demand and tightly manage inventory, represented a 40 basis point headwind in the quarter. these declines, more than offset the underlying structurally accretive mix shifts and proactive measures we have discussed as an important part of our business model and tsr drivers. during the first quarter, the favorable impacts of restricting and quality of sales initiatives, pricing and product cost improvements as well as improving channel mix, positively impacted gross margin by 270 basis points. adjust sg&a as a percent of sales increased 310 basis points to 33.6%.
the year-over-year increase was driven primarily by increased allowances for credit losses due to covid-19 and fixed cost deleverage due to revenue declines. these increases were partially offset by tight expense control and restructuring benefits. we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 in the first quarter. now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. we ended the quarter with $479 million in cash and cash equivalents, which was a $373 million increase from year-end. as mentioned, we drew $475 million on a revolver during the period which drove the increase. excluding the revolver cash decreased $102 million in the period driven by working capital, global erp and it infrastructure investments and our dividend payment on march 20th. approximately half of the decrease was due to working capital. so i want to provide a little additional context here. our business has historically experienced seasonality and our working capital needs. specifically, we tend to have higher ar balances in our first and third quarter of the year due in part to elevated international shipments as product for new seasons are introduced. further inventory in the us tends to peak during the third quarter as we prepare for holiday shipments and moderates in the fourth quarter as shipments occur.
thus the first and third quarter tend to be the largest uses of working capital while the fourth quarter tends to be the largest source of working capital. in the first quarter of 2020, our working capital use was $49 million compared to a use of $71 million in the first quarter of 2019. finally, i will close with some shaping for the balance of the year. as we previously announced and as a result of the uncertainty and significant business impacts caused by covid-19, we withdrawn our 2020 guidance provided on our fourth quarter call in march and will not be providing an updated outlook at this time. while we're not providing formal guidance additional perspective and assumptions are as follows. we believe we are continuing to take the necessary proactive steps to accommodate a prolonged covid-19 environment. we anticipate negative impacts on revenue, operating income and eps will be most pronounced in the second quarter of 2020. as we think about the second half of 2020, we are not guiding the impact covid-19 will have on our results.
however, we do anticipate and would highlight that outside of covid-19 underlying revenue and gross margins in the second half are expected to benefit from new programs and distribution gains, moderating top-line headwinds as actions taken in 2019 in our anniversary and increasing realization of a accretive restructuring, cost savings and quality of sales actions taken in 2019. finally due to predictions of a prolonged economic downturn, we have performed stress testing for a variety of financial demand scenarios during 2020. and believe the actions taken are expected to support liquidity requirements and provide operating flexibility. although it has only been a little over 60 days since our last earnings, we had much to cover on today's call and appreciate the opportunity to walk through the many actions we have taken. in closing, i just want to reinforce how confident we are that these are the right steps at this time to position kontoor for continued success in the new environment.
this concludes our prepared remarks and i will now turn call back to our operator. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question today is coming from bob drbul for guggenheim securities. your line is now.
bob drbul -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. hope you guys are well. got two questions for you guys, i guess the first one just on the dividend, can you maybe just elaborate a bit more in terms of the discussion around resuming the dividend sort of in the q4, what does have to happen, can you just talk us through that maybe a little bit more? and i think the second question is, on some of the new programs that you do expect, similar question but, you know, the visibility and the confidence in some of those new programs, if you might just walk through that a little bit more in depth? i think those would be helpful for us. thanks very much.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
sure, bob, i'll take those, and rustin will add in some colour as we go along. but i think it's important to know, in the dividend, that this was temporary, it's part of our covenant amendment and it's still absolutely foundational to learn investment thesis in our tsr model, so that hasn't changed at all going forward. and i think everybody's in the same situation, that cash is really important right now in the business, but as we've said, we're committed to the appropriate time, reinstating that dividend, and we can do it as early as q4. and, obviously, i think the thing that most want to see in this industry, and the world, in the separate discontinued improvement, and for the world to migrate into a better place, and just to move forward past what we're all going through right now.
but i do think there's one other component that's critically important to the whole dividend discussion, and that as that we take our culture real serious here, at kontoor brands, and unfortunately, and i made mention of it in my comments, had to furlough some folks, and we don't take that lightly at all, and do some pay reductions and do some really tough things to make sure that our business is sound and moves forward in a really constructive way. and we didn't feel as though it was right to go ahead and pay a dividend as we were taking some of those actions. rustin, anything to add to that?
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
no. i think the only thing i would say, bob, is we did file an 8-k this morning with the amendment around the credit facility, and to scott's point, the board will have an opportunity to reevaluate that dividend as early as the fourth quarter of 2020, based upon performance and certain criteria. and you certainly can review that in the 8-k, or we can discuss it at a later detail around that release. thanks. and to your second question. you know, bob, i think one of the things that, as the ceo, that i'm most proud of, is how the team has managed through this process, but also, if i just step back in time and think about when we transitioned our business and spun off just a year ago, the date is coming up here real quickly, in a couple of weeks. we were a maintenance business for the company that owned us and at that point in time we had to start a lot of things from fresh, from the start, from scratch, i guess, and one of those things was putting together a comprehensive strategy for our business going forward. we thought really long and hard about how this world is going to change and what's going to happen, and obviously we never thought that something like this was going to happen. but when we sat back and thought a lot about our strategy here recently, and when we thought about what we did as a team, in developing that strategy, how it's played into a benefit for us through this period of time, we feel very fortunate. and i'd like to talk about a couple of those things because i think they're really important. one of the things that we talked a lot about was winning with openers, and if you think about going through this period that we've gone through, we've gone ahead a lot of time with the investment community, talking about the quality of sales initiatives, how we really cleaned up our sales throughout the globe. that looks like a really smart move right now, because we've lined ourselves, as i mentioned in my script, with walmart, amazon, target, holes, and i could name several others, but the highest quality retailers in the world, and we feel really good about that position right now. in addition to that we talked a lot at time about category expansion, and one of the categories that we expanded in was outdoor with our all-terrain gear. and, you know, like i did mention earlier, that we just landed a significant new account in europe because this is going to be a global expansion for us. now, it's taken off really nicely, as we've talked about before, in north america, now it's going to expand globally. and we've gone ahead and done that and had a nice little program here for the second half of the year. but one of the things i talked a lot about earlier was new business development, and new business development is so important for us because, again, we were a maintenance business, spent a lot of time in that, i think everybody knows that, just because you talk about new business development on day one, it takes a long time to develop that with the customer, great product, you know, gain trust and do all the things that you need to do, build relationships. one of the reasons that we needed to do that was because lee was under penetrated here in the united states, under distributed. so, fortunately for us we've done a lot of work, and i want to go ahead and send a shout out to the team that's done all that work, both the lee team and also the new business development team, works on behalf of all the kontoor brands, they've done an outstanding job. and in the second half of this year we do have a couple of programs coming in, but one really big program coming in that we're pretty proud of. so again a lot of work on there and i would tell you that one of the reasons why that's worked really well and you heard mention of this from rustin. and i think this is really important for everybody to think about long term. we pulled lee and greensboro this past year and now we have a collective team working together. lee developing strengths. they learn from wrangler. wrangler developing strengths that they learn from lee collaborating together working as a team. it's really -- in a competition too, a healthy competition for a company which we love and then rustin mentioned earlier about us now bringing in our direct-to-consumer tee. so all of our four facing businesses now will be headquartered together which we think is critically important. and i'll tell you two other things that really are really important because this is playing out for us a little bit with lee and china too is the emphasis that we've had in our strategy on digital a long time ago and how that has through this situation obviously been critically important. we talked a lot about and we had questions from people about why aren't you building more stores. well, we've focused on building out our digital and we think that has been a really accretive part of our strategy. and i'll leave you with this, at this point in time we have two really great brands, but those brands also offer a great value. and i mentioned a little bit in my script about how our business is pretty strong right now. we started to see strengthening in our business. the end of april and here it's really picked up in the beginning of may. and that has to do with our strategy. strategy, we put in place; strategy we're implementing. now listen our strategy is going to evolve over time and we're going to continue to do things that we need to do to go ahead and grow this business going forward, but right now we're pleased with where we are, we're going through a really difficult time with the rest of the world, but we like how we are aligned our strategy and our people and we're really pleased with how the second half of shape. so thanks for the questions bob. and i hope you and your family are doing well.

our next question today is coming from erinn murphy from piper sandler. your line is now live.
erinn murphy -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning. and hope you are all healthy and safe. a couple questions for me as well maybe just following up scott on the last thing you were saying. i'm curious if you could speak to kind of what fell through specifically looked like exiting the quarter here in north america and then in april, if you can comment on kind of quarter today just given you guys are in a unique position that's you've had channels are actually open.
and then the second question probably more for rustin on inventory. can you just talk about which quarter you expect inventory to peak in? and then maybe a little bit more up near inventory management action. how you're thinking about outlets? can you liquidate us inventory and china? just curious on some of the actions you're thinking of taking going forward. thanks.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
sure. so, erinn let me start with china, a very important market for us. we've seen nice progression. i would call it moderate progression every week which to me is the most important thing. i don't think any of us thought that this thing was going to go back to normal in 30, 60, 90 day period of time, but what's happened is and what we're monitoring and what we're pleased is that we've seen week-to-week progression in the business. so at some point in time we'll get back to normal and then we'll get back to growth, but for us not taking a step back has been really critical seeing the consumer come back; seeing our digital business come back and the consumer reengaging with our brand having all of our stores open. our partner stores are really critical and important to our strategy over there.
so pleased with what's happening from a recovery in china, but again i'm more pleased with the fact that it's been steady and in not something that's been spiking or anything like that. so pleased with that. i'll take you through a little bit of how i've been thinking about and how we've been talking about the quarters, as we go here things got really difficult for a lot of folks here at the end of march. last two weeks and we weren't different than anybody, but we were very fortunate in that some of our retailers world and we weren't a priority for them at that point in time but what's happened over time is people have started to come back to apparel and people have started to think about what's next and people have been holding off on some purchases.
and we've seen a nice progression through the month of april and then toward the end of april we saw some increased orders and just started to see it pick up and we're pleasantly so prized about the strength. and i attribute that again to the help of our partners, winning with winners and may have started off like i mentioned in my script very well and we're pleased with how it's coming along and feel really good about how we're positioned going forward. now what i would say and this is really important is one become country is starting to open up so we've got a lot of states opening up this weekend; a lot of states that have already opened up and many more coming in the very near future. so it's going to be really important to see how others do because not only a significant part of our business is with current retailers that are already open but we do have a significant part of our business with people that are starting to reopen.
so it'll be really important to watch and we want to make sure we do all the right things for our associates and for all of our customers and continue this progression moving forward, but what's really important is we're continuing to invest in the brand, we're investing in our digital space. we're investing in both wrangler and lee. we're continuing to invest in the erp which can is going to help position us going forward. it helps us with our platform from a digital standpoint. so got a lot of good things going on in the business right now. got a lot of good things that we've talked about in the second half. i think one of the things that i'm most proud of what this team is, hey; we went through a tough time. we've got some experience on this team if you come visit us and a lot of you folks know us. so a lot of us have been in this industry for a long time. and we've been through some bad times before.
and i think the one thing is we all know we're going to come out of these bad times. that's just how it works. it's pretty tough when you're in it, but for those of us who have been through it before we can see the potential on the other side. we stuck to our strategy and it's paying off right now. so pleased, rustin?
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. thanks, erinn. good morning. i'll take the second half of your inventory question here. let me step back in my prepared remarks i did mention a little bit about the seasonality we've seen in our working capital trends. so historically q1 has kind of been a quarter where we build inventories. so certainly the fourth quarter is holiday ships. we end the year and in pretty good inventory positions and we typically build in the first quarter. so our inventory in the first quarter of 2020 did increase about $30 million that was up about 7% from where we ended the year. but just for a little bit of perspective as we look back to 2019, the first quarter we went up about $45 million or about 10%/ so we've been very focused on inventory management and as you'll recall from the last call, we highlighted that that was going to be a big focus of working capital improvement for us in 2020.
in terms of trends you ask a little bit about trends and what you should see. we do project inventory increasing in q2 and really peaking in q3 and that is very consistent with what we've historically seen in the business. i would also note that we will peak in q2 as we have some of the new programs that scott mentioned earlier, as well as holiday sales as we build inventory for that. you also talked a little bit about liquidation and how we're thinking about that. so let me give you a little bit of color on that. fortunately in our business, we have a lot of core product and we have a quite a bit of product that carries over season to season. we don't have a lot of fashion goods that are at risk. we do have seasonal. i'll tell you that we're in conversations with retailers that at this point are open to sort of pack and hold on seasonal.
and we're working on some of those commitments. so in some cases we may hold inventory while we do expect higher levels of markdowns as reflected in some of the inventory provisions we took in the first quarter, really think right sizing our production and flexing supply chain to reduce the inventories and advantage as we indicated in our prepared remarks. last thing, i'll kind of mention on the liquidation side. we do have an 80 store fleet approximately in the us, in vf outlets, lee wrangler outlets, lee wrangler parent centers to move excess goods at higher recovery rates. so we are laser focused on managing inventory and we'll continue to be so over the next few quarters. hopefully that provides a context.

our next question today is coming from alexandra walvis from goldman sachs. your line is now live.
alexandra walvis -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning and thanks so much for taking the question here. thank you also for all the color on the call so far. i wanted to ask a question about digital sales. so a very strong growth rate through the quarter. could you comment on the cadence of digital sales through the quarter? i'm most interested in whether it's accelerated as some of your partner stores closing and i think your own stores and then any comment within that digital sale for us of which wholesale digital part of the performing particularly well and thinking distinction between math, the promisego.com and any other wholesale dotcom.
and then my second question is on the gross margin and the puts and takes of that going forward. should we expect that 200 basis point tailwind to continue through the year and on the other hand how big could be impacted in inventory divisions downtime and manufacturing facilities be going forward. thank you so much.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
so, alex, i'll start this is scott and then rustin will share the answer with me. so we think of it as our owned, our partner in our wholesale. and we're really pleased with how our businesses transpire there. obviously, it's been a core tenet of our strategy. and it's been a piece of business during this time, the consumer has migrated too.
we do think that, that migration is going to continue and it's going to pick up a little bit as things go forward. and we've done some things to go ahead and make sure that we're going to be there for the consumer. we recently just put a new platform in europe. and in the next month, we'll be putting a new platform in north america. so we're really excited about that because it's going to make the experience all that much better in our owned piece.
our partner business is really good. and then our wholesale digital and our consumer business are exceptionally strong too, but we've invested a lot of time and energy in that. we saw that a long time ago. and we've been very, very direct about the fact that we spent more time the in digital space and more money in the digital space than we have been building physical stores.
we just think that's where we're-the consumer's going to long-term play out, it's actually turned out to be a really good decision. and then i think the last thing for me before i turn it over to rustin is, is we literally thought long and hard but we need to have great leadership there too. so, we recently hired new global leader for our digital piece, someone with a tremendous amount of experience that's coming in and making very nice change immediately. and how we think about it and we love to bring in new talent that can help us all think differently and it can be a game changer for us going forward. so we're very, very pleased with that. and with that i'll turn it over to rustin.
operator
thank you. we've reached end of our question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the call back over to management for further closing comments.

scott baxter -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, eric. good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. we will go through our second quarter results in a bit. but before that, i'd like to share my thoughts on a few key areas. first, i'd like to provide context around the current environment and how we continue to navigate through the covid-19 pandemic. next, i'll talk to how the strategy is implemented, at the spin are driving the decisive actions we've taken and are supporting improvements across our business, despite the impacts of covid. the investments we are making in key growth enablers, quality of sales, digital transformation, international expansion with a focus on china, new business development, innovation and sustainability and high-roi demand creation are helping to strengthen our core and support enhanced growth in the future.
and finally, i'll share insights as to why we believe our model is well positioned to win in the marketplace even as we expect an uncertain operating environment to continue. but before i begin, i want to thank our employees around the world for their extraordinary efforts. i'm extremely proud of the resilience and perseverance they have demonstrated through this challenging time. our priority remains the health and safety of our colleagues. while most of all our retail stores are now open across the globe, we continue to employ social distancing and work remote protocols where appropriate across our offices, facilities in distribution centers. so let me start by providing some thoughts on how the covid pandemic has impacted our business. as we expected, the impacts from covid weighed on our second quarter results as stay-at-home orders and retail door closures across the world pressured consumer demand. we said on our first quarter call that we were seeing signs of improvement, principally in china and the u.s., in late april and early may.
we were encouraged to see these trends accelerate as we moved through the second quarter with easing of restrictions and door openings supportive of improving traffic and sell-through. in asia, at the peak of the crisis, approximately 90% of our owned and partner stores were closed. currently, the china recovery continues to gradually build momentum led by the digital channel, and all brick-and-mortar stores are open. we are encouraged by the momentum we have seen broadly in china, especially in our digital business, increasing 24% in the quarter. in europe, significant demand declines weighed most heavily on this region during the second quarter. our distribution network remains operational for digital and wholesale orders. and while stores in the region have started to reopen, traffic remains inconsistent. in north america, early signs of improving consumer demand began in late april and early may and strengthened as the second quarter progressed, with a combination of additional retailer door openings and improving traffic as pos significantly outpaced shipments during the quarter.
while no one at kontoor is satisfied with our second quarter results, given the unprecedented environment, i am extremely pleased with our level of execution on the strategies we put in place 15 months ago at the spin. these actions were further amplified during the second quarter, and we anticipate will lead to sequential improvement through the second half of 2020. over the last 1.5 years, we've talked about how investing and nurturing these two iconic brands would take time and how sequencing matters. investments in people, culture, processes in globalizing our organization, the benefits will manifest over time. but as you've seen over the last few quarters, despite the challenging landscape, these strategic investments are beginning to drive green shoots of operational improvement as we seek to evolve our model. when you consider, we began on the starting line as a new company, i could not be more proud of the organization and the progress we have made.
and while i am really encouraged by these early successes, i am even more excited about what the future holds for kontoor as we are just in the beginning stages of this journey. so let me discuss where we are focusing our efforts to accelerate fundamental performance and unlock value creation for all stakeholders. we've talked about horizon one or the first 12 to 18 months post spin. being a period of optimization as we set the foundation for long-term success. we told you our focus would be on quality of sales, enhancing gross margin and using our strong cash flow generation to aggressively delever our balance sheet, all through our tsr lens. despite one of the most difficult consumer environment in history, we've made tremendous progress on many of these strategic efforts. rustin will provide more insight with respect to margins and capital allocation, but i'd like to share my thoughts with respect to the top line, including solid proof points of how our strategies are paying off as well as how we expect to accelerate more profitable and sustainable revenue growth in the future.
as a reminder, our focus has been centered on four key growth areas. first, strengthening our core buy; winning with winning retailers and optimizing distribution; investing in quality of sales, innovation, sustainability and demand creation; and leveraging our world-class integrated supply chain. second, distorting growth to d2c in becoming a digital-first consumer-led organization. third, expanding internationally with a laser focus on china. and fourth, broadening categories beyond denim, capturing meaningful opportunities across outdoor and t-shirts. so let me start with the core. while the covid pandemic has had significant impacts on both the wrangler and lee u.s. wholesale businesses, we were encouraged by how each experienced strengthening sell-through as the second quarter progressed. additionally, beyond the impacts of covid, we also experienced a timing shift that had a negative impact on q2 wrangler revenue but will benefit the third quarter.
our continued optimization within the wholesale channel is a major distinction from many of our competitors, with three of our four largest retail partners, walmart, target and amazon, remaining open throughout the pandemic, while kohl's reopened doors during quarter. we have made tremendous strides in our quality of sales efforts domestically. and our exposure to challenged retailers and channels is very limited. given our assumption that the u.s. will experience a prolonged covid operating environment, we are really well positioned with these key best-in-class retailers. and how do we expect to not only strengthen this core position but, growing? by continuing to invest in key enablers, such as innovation, sustainability and demand creation. from an innovation perspective. during the second quarter, we continued to scale technology platforms like never before with body optics and mvp for lee and atg and rooted for wrangler, we are scaling innovation both vertically, up and down the pricing spectrum; and horizontally, across various product categories, to more effectively capture consumer mind and wallet share.
and i want to take a moment to highlight our work on sustainability. similar to our innovation pipeline, kontoor's efforts around sustainability is a key pillar to becoming a consumer-led organization, and we intend to be more active from a sustainability perspective going forward. our indigood and rooted collections already provide solid proof points, and we will be accelerating investments across key wastewater dying processes, materials, energy and climate initiatives to further scale our sustainability platform in the years to come. as we are excited to announce today that we will be publishing kontoor's sustainability goals report during the third quarter, and we look forward to sharing more detail with you at that time. beyond innovation and sustainability, we are also investing in demand creation efforts to strengthen our core.
we will be consumer-led organization and staying engaged with our consumer during the covid pandemic has been critical as we focus our efforts on high-roi marketing areas. during the second quarter, our teams did an amazing job of creating tone-right campaigns that connected with our consumer in empathetic yet powerful ways. for wrangler, we continued our successful long-lived cowboys campaign and can't stop music country series, driving enhanced consumer connection during the coded crisis. we also introduced new collaborations with musical artists such as diplo, partnering for the release of his highly anticipated country album; and an honor of what we have done, bob marley's and in honor of what would have been bob marley 75th birthday, we recently announced a partnership with the marley family to launch a limited edition collection with heavy reggae influences and revival of his favorite wrangler styles.
these are just a few of the initiatives that are allowing the wrangler brand to reach a younger and more diverse consumers. the demand creation investments in digital and social are fueling the strong growth we saw in u.s. wrangler.com during the quarter and enhanced our core positioning with key retailers. these initiatives also support new distribution opportunities, including our wrangler by fred siegel collaboration that we will be launching at nordstroms this fall, both in-store and on digital platforms. and with lee, we drove incremental demand creation spend in the second quarter in support of our upcoming launch in over 2,000 doors with walmart this fall. in china, we leverage live-streaming events with two premier online influencers in the region, via and austin. with our event with via, we sold 4,000 women shorts in 25 seconds. and with our event with austin, we sold 8,000 pairs of jeans in 30 minutes.
we remain excited about the direction the brand is headed in the second half of 2020 and beyond. and last, with respect to strengthening our core, we continue to leverage our own manufacturing here in the western hemisphere to service our large customers with scale and speed, further driving competitive separation within the market. our advanced manufacturing capabilities allowed us to aggressively align production with demand. and with inventory levels down 20% in the quarter, we are well positioned for the second half of 2020, and even more importantly, for 2021. we believe this has been and will continue to be a distinct advantage relative to much of our competition in the marketplace. beyond strengthening our core we continue to embark on the company's digital transformation. with new leadership now in place, we are enhancing our total digital ecosystem from owned dot-com to digital wholesale to retailer dot-com.
and while still in the early stages, the second quarter provides solid evidence that our investments are paying off. during the second quarter, u.s. owned dot-com grew 48%, with wrangler.com increasing 62% and lee.com increasing 22%; while digital wholesale grew 36%. we also went live with our u.s. and european digital platforms during the quarter. consumer behavior was already rapidly migrating to digital, and we believe this adoption has only accelerated during the covid pandemic as new users become increasingly comfortable with buying online. and our categories, in particular, are ideally suited to this new environment. this is creating massive new opportunities to evolve our digital capabilities from interactive live-stream platforms to growing social channels. in developing this new digital ecosystem, the consumer must be at the center of everything we do. benefits will accelerate over time, but we will leverage our growing data analytics capabilities and unlock value from our new global erp infrastructure to ensure kontoor is a consumer-led, digital-first organization.
while we are under-indexed with digital currently, we are aggressively investing in support of this accretive growth opportunity, and we intend to leverage improved systems, processes and capabilities to drive significantly greater digital penetration over time. from a geographic perspective. we continue to augment our core u.s. business by accelerating international growth with a sharp focus on china. as i stated earlier, the recovery in the china region continues to gradually stabilize. while china declined in the second quarter, it sequentially improved from the first quarter and by month in q2. but beyond the near-term quarterly results, our distorted investments in china are creating significant opportunities for both of our brands. we are confident that we will extend our leadership position with the lee brand, utilizing key regional influence that we discussed earlier in new collaborations, such as our recent partnership with coca-cola, to drive further brand heat in the region.
we have more than 25 years in the market, but the lee brand is just getting started with deeper penetration of existing markets and significant runway in extending its reach to tier three and four cities. and we will leverage this tremendous experience in the region to launch the wrangler brand in china. while we chose to delay the launch in light of covid, we are ready to go. and we will be executing a soft launch this fall in a more robust full launch planned for spring 2021 to most effectively optimize the consumer environment. we expect the business will take time to scale, but the long-term white space opportunity remains tremendous. last but certainly not least, our ability to extend these brands into additional categories beyond core denim is enormous. we see two primary areas of focus: outdoor and t-shirts. within outdoor, our wrangler all-terrain gear line, or atg, and has had incredible early success, a natural extension for the wrangler brand. atg affords the customer high-quality performance product at an exceptional value.
the nearly $30 billion global outdoor market is poised to accelerate in the post-covid world and we intend to leverage this brand-right opportunity. during the first half of 2020, atg experienced up to triple-digit year-over-year growth with our key retail partners, a great proof point for the early traction the line has garnered. and with key new international distribution set for the second half of 2020, including presence in over 400 dressmen's stores in the fall and opportunities in the outdoor specialty and sporting good channels, the future is bright for atg and kontoor's evolving outdoor platform. with respect to t-shirts. as we've previously discussed, the addressable market for kontoor is significant, and we intend to increase investments to capture share. for the first time, we recently hired a category leader to focus on this important opportunity. we are adding design and marketing talent in defining our go-to-market strategies, from logo to lifestyle to license, t's afford us the ideal organic extension for our brands.
expect to hear more on this opportunity in the coming quarters. so how do these strategies come together in support of our rapidly evolving model? investments in new business development, innovation, sustainability and demand creation act as enablers to not only strengthen our core positioning, but accelerate growth across category, channels and geographies. and while we continue to expect a prolonged covid operating environment, these strategic decisions, looked at through our tsr lens, will position us for more sustainable and profitable growth. combined with our underlying structural margin expansion and robust cash flow generation that fuels optimizing our capital structure, we, as a leadership team, remain as excited as ever about the incredible opportunities ahead.
with that, i turn it over to rustin.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, scott, and good morning, everyone. i will discuss our second quarter results in a moment, but i'd like to begin by addressing a few key topics i know are on your minds. specifically, i will provide an update on q2 trends and the current operating environment; our balance sheet, strong cash flow and debt repayment; and finally, how our key strategic initiatives are driving improved fundamentals, even given the challenging landscape. on our q1 earnings call, we shared that we had begun to see early signs in late april and early may of strengthening wholesale order patterns and digital trends. as we move through the second quarter, we saw sequential monthly improvement in our global business. our strategies of winning with winners and accelerating digital as levers to differentiate performance were evident in the quarter, led by the 48% growth in u.s. owned dot-com. next, we were able to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter by driving improved working capital performance.
cash generation is the cornerstone of our operating model and capital allocation strategy for kontoor. accordingly, as the primary lever to influence cash generation, inventory has been and remains a critical component of our working capital focus. post spin, we began a journey utilizing a tsr-driven approach to drive improvement by focusing on quality of sales initiatives, business model changes and exiting select nonstrategic lines of business and points of distribution. in the back half of 2019, our net inventory decreased $80 million or 15%. in 2020, our plans focused on continuing to drive incremental inventory improvement. as liquidity became paramount for all companies with the acceleration of covid, our vertically integrated manufacturing allowed us to rightsize production in light of decreased demand, avoid creation of excess inventory and minimize cash flow impacts. accordingly, our first half 2020 inventory levels decreased $25 million or an additional 5% and are exiting the second quarter at the lowest levels since 2015.
so in light of our progress to date and volatile operating environment, how are we thinking about inventory and service in the back half of 2020? we want to be thoughtful and prudent regarding inventory by ensuring close alignment with our trade partners on expected demand. our owned manufacturing provides a distinct competitive advantage. as conditions warrant and government restrictions and capacity permit, we are able to respond to changing demand to scale production and minimize service issues for our partners. while we are actively managing to optimize the supply/demand balance and are pleased with our performance to date, we believe there are additional opportunities to reduce inventory levels, all while supporting the marketplace and new program wins. and as a result of these inventory and other working capital actions, i am pleased to say we made an additional discretionary payment of $75 million on the revolver in the quarter due to our strengthening cash generation and liquidity. this payment was in addition to paying down $175 million on our revolver in may in connection with the closing of our amended credit facility.
as we have also discussed, our model is differentiated, among other things, by its durable and consistent cash flow generation. this consistency was clearly demonstrated in the second quarter as we drove positive free cash flow, positive operating cash flow and improved liquidity despite the challenging macro headwinds. and finally, i will spend a few moments discussing the progress we have made transforming our business for future profitable growth, amplifying cost saves and supporting our global erp initiative and other key growth platforms such as digital. let me share a few examples. as we discussed last quarter, we have both engaged associates around the world to rethink business processes while also challenging all operating expenses, from travel to outside services. these proactive measures drove a significant reduction in sg&a expense in the quarter, something i will touch on momentarily.
furthermore, we are continuously evaluating areas of the business to better align with our tsr-driven approach, including the vfo platform, for example. with the move of the headquarters we previously announced, we will seek to optimize the business near-term through select rationalization and reformatting of underperforming doors. we also continue to invest in our global information technology initiatives. during the quarter, we launched our new e-com platform in both europe and the u.s., which were key contributors to the strong digital growth scott discussed earlier. in addition, we are pleased to report that the first phase of our new erp platform and infrastructure recently went live in asia, marking our first region to be implemented. we are excited for the unlocks these investments will afford and are eager to share additional gains and efficiency improvements in 2021 and beyond. finally, during the quarter, we moved all of our european distribution to a 3pl, consistent with our plans since the spin under our transition service agreements.
we continue to make progress against our key strategic pillars, which are providing solid proof points that we are executing against the right priorities as evidenced by our second quarter results. so let's get to our second quarter review. global revenue decreased 42% on a reported and constant currency basis in the second quarter compared with adjusted revenues for the same quarter in 2019. revenue declines during the quarter were primarily the result of widespread impacts of covid, retail and owned door closures and stay-at-home orders as well as a timing shift of shipments from the second to the third quarter within the wrangler business, which i will touch on in a bit. on our last few calls, we have talked about our ongoing quality of sales actions that began in 2019 as well as planned declines in select dilutive lines of business. while this continues to negatively impact near-term revenue, these actions will continue to drive transformational change to improve operational performance and position us for long-term profitable growth.
on a regional basis for the quarter, u.s. revenues were down 40% compared with adjusted revenues for the same quarter in 2019. declines were primarily the result of covid impacts, partially offset by digital wholesale increasing 36%. the u.s. represented 83% of our revenue in the quarter. outside of the u.s., international revenues declined 47% in constant currency compared with adjusted revenues for the same quarter in 2019. beyond covid impacts, the second quarter international decline was affected by planned exits and business model changes, quality of sales actions and foreign currency, which combined, pressured international revenue by mid-single digits. turning to our channels. our reported revenue in our u.s. wholesale channel, which represented 72% of our revenue, was down 30% compared with adjusted revenues for the same quarter in 2019. declines were driven primarily by the impacts of covid. our non-u.s. wholesale channel, which represented 13% of our revenue, decreased 52% compared with adjusted revenues for the same quarter in 2019.
our branded direct-to-consumer channel, which represented 12% of our revenues, declined 31% due in large part to owned brick-and-mortar door closures. our owned digital business increased 36%, driven by 48% growth in the u.s. and 24% growth in china. we are encouraged by the positive results from our recent investments in our digital platform. given the accretive under-indexed nature of this channel, we will continue to distort investments to grow in this area. finally, let's turn to our brands. global revenue of our wrangler brand declined 30% on a reported and constant currency basis compared with adjusted revenues for the same quarter in 2019. wrangler u.s. revenue declined 27% in the period. impacts from covid, including retail and owned store closures, drove the majority of the decline. an approximate $33 million shift in timing of all load-ins from q2 to q3 2020 also adversely impacted the quarter. these declines were mitigated in part by strong growth in both owned and wholesale digital. wrangler international revenue was down 54% compared with adjusted revenue in the same period last year, driven by covid impacts, the actions taken in india and business model changes in europe.
lee brand global revenue declined 57% compared with adjusted revenues for the same quarter in 2019. lee u.s. revenue decreased 66% in the period. covid related impacts drove the majority of the decline. beyond covid, we remain encouraged by the underlying progress of the lee u.s. business, including the upcoming significant new program win set for the second half. lee international revenue was down 45% on a reported basis compared with adjusted revenues in the second quarter of 2019. over 1/3 of the decline was driven by the emea region as many countries were under lockdown during much of the quarter. now on to gross margin. total adjusted gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 38.4%. the decline was primarily driven by the following factors. first, the cost of downtime in our plan as we reduced production to align supply and demand, taken with inventory reserves, netted to a 450 basis point headwind in the quarter. next, lower international revenue also adversely impacted geographic mix by 60 basis points. these declines were mitigated by the underlying benefit of accretive mix shifts and proactive measures we have discussed as an important part of our business model and tsr drivers.
during the second quarter, the favorable impact of channel mix, quality of sales initiatives, pricing and product cost improvements positively impacted gross margin by 350 basis points. adjusted sg&a decreased $38 million on a year-over-year basis to $129 million or 36.8% of revenue. fixed cost deleverage due to revenue declines and credit losses due to covid were partially offset by tight expense controls mentioned previously and restructuring benefits. we delivered an adjusted loss per share of $0.22 in the second quarter. now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. as we've discussed since the spin, the compelling, durable and consistent free cash flow strength is foundational to our operating model. despite an operating loss driven by covid impacts, and continued investment in our strategic erp and it infrastructure, cash from operations and free cash flow were both positive in the quarter. working capital improvements were driven by inventory, which declined $56 million or 11% from q1 and $105 million or 20% versus the prior year.
we finished q1 with $479 million in cash and debt of just under $1.4 billion. at the closing of the amended credit facility in may, we repaid $175 million of our revolving credit facility balances to comply with the available cash limitation. in june, we made an additional discretionary repayment of $75 million on our revolver due to our positive cash flows and improved liquidity position. at the end of q2, we finished with $256 million in cash and debt of just over $1.1 billion. there are no material debt repayments required over the next 12 months. our overall liquidity improved in the quarter. and our leverage ratio, per the credit facility calculation for the quarter, was 3.5 times compared to our original limit of four times and the amended limit of 5.5 times. and now on to our outlook. as we previously announced and as a result of the uncertainty and significant business impacts caused by covid, we went through our 2020 guidance provided on our fourth quarter call in march, and we have not provided an updated outlook at this time.
while we're not providing formal guidance, additional perspective and assumptions related to our second half are as follows. first, we continue to take the necessary proactive steps to accommodate a prolonged covid operating environment. second, revenue in the second half of 2020 should experience sequential year-over-year improvement and is expected to benefit from new programs and distribution gains as well as the timing shift of shipments. third, we anticipate structural gross margin gains from restructuring and quality of sales actions to continue in the second half of 2020 in spite a more difficult year-over-year comparisons on realized gains during the similar period in 2019. and finally, inventory remains a critical component of our working capital focus, and we expect levels to continue to improve in the second half of the year. inventory is expected to be well positioned to support new program wins and demand in the marketplace.
in closing, i want to reinforce our confidence in the proactive actions we have taken to improve our long-term operating performance that began in 2019. despite the challenges of the current operating environment, we generated positive free cash flow, further delevered the balance sheet, managed down inventory, all while investing behind key strategic initiatives. these strategies are clearly proving the right actions in this current environment and will best position kontoor for continued success.
this concludes our prepared remarks, and i will now turn the call back to our operator. operator?

[operator instructions] the first question comes from the line of erinn murphy with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
erinn murphy -- piper sandler -- analyst
great, thanks. good morning and thank you for taking my question. i guess my first question is for scott. and maybe rustin, you can weigh in. you talked about strengthening trends throughout the quarter with pos now outpacing shipments. are you in a position that you're chasing this demand now?
and then just curious, maybe for rustin, how is this fitting into your commentary when you referenced the sequential year-on-year improvement in the back half? and then i have a follow-up.
scott baxter -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so erinn, this is scott. thanks for joining today. and i'll start. we did see really nice improvement, as we mentioned, both rustin and i, in the second quarter. so we were pleased with that. one of the things that we've talked a lot about, and you've heard me talk about it is that we're under distributed here in the united states, specifically from a brand standpoint, both brands. and these big wins that we've had that we shared last time, and we actually added a little bit more color, over 2,000 doors with lee, both male and female, which is the key component, both men's and women's denim and men's and women's casuals, for the fall.
and then in addition to that, we have some additional programs next year in spring of 2021 with those two programs. and then the dressmans program with atg, really bringing atg to europe in a pretty big way. we think with that and also, the fact that we've really done a nice job as far as our strategy about winning with the winners and who we do business with. and then we talked a lot about at the beginning how we've cleaned up this quality of sales initiative. you couple those things together, and we feel like there's going to be sequential improvement going into the second half of the year. rustin, anything to add to that?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. i think the only other thing i would add is sort of the timing shift, erinn, that certainly is material. you saw that it was $33 million in the quarter. that is in the wrangler u.s. business, so just a little bit of context and perspective there. wrangler u.s. in the quarter was down 27%. so had those timing shifts occurred as originally or has historically taken place, the wrangler business would have been down about 16% in the u.s. so a pretty material impact. and obviously, that will move to the third quarter. and you may recall, erinn, we talked about that on our fourth quarter call as a timing shift that we were expecting moving from q2 to q3. and so that's what we were referencing.
erinn murphy -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. you kind of answered part of my second question. so maybe if i could just ask, on the u.s. landscape broadly in the second half, can you just speak a little bit more about what you're seeing in the channel and how you're seeing promotions? like from our perspective, it does seem like there's very lean inventory in the mass channel for some of your brands and even some of your peers. so just curious on your expectations broadly for the landscape.
scott baxter -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so erinn, i'll go ahead and start. this is scott. we feel pretty good about the second half, like we said, from a sequential improvement standpoint. our inventories are in tremendous shape. we're really clean, specifically in the mass channel also. so we feel really good about that. we're probably going to chase a little bit in back-to-school, and we actually think that's a good place to be. but i'll tell you why we think that's a really good place to be is, and we've talked about this a lot. it's a real strategic advantage that really got to flex its muscle during this time.
and that's owning our own distribution, about 1/3 of our own manufacturing facilities. we're going to be able to really go ahead and manage that here the rest of the year owning those and relative to what the supply and demand is. so we feel like we're in a real enviable position, having that right here in the north american market. rustin?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i would just say from our inventory position, erinn, you talked a little bit about that. i would say that this journey really started at the time of the spin. and we really started focusing on quality of sales and the business model changes and really exiting some of the nonstrategic lines of the business all through a tsr lens. and so in the back half of last year, we drove an $80 million improvement or about 15%. as we came into this year, inventory remained a really important focus for us. and in the first half of the year, we drove about a $25 million improvement or an additional 5%. just for perspective, in 2019, our first half inventory actually increased $50 million.
so we are certainly focused on inventory, aligning the supply and demand signals that we're getting from our retail partners, as scott mentioned, and making sure that we can service the market. and so we feel good about where we're positioned from an inventory perspective and our ability to service those new program wins and the marketplace demand in the back half.

the next question comes from the line of bob drbul with guggenheim. please proceed with your question.
bob drbul -- guggenheim -- analyst
hi guys, good morning, guys.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
scott baxter -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
bob drbul -- guggenheim -- analyst
a couple of questions, actually. i think the first one, can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of where you are? like you mentioned the erp implementation, but just sort of what are the milestones and sort of where you are and what we should be looking for?
and the second question is, you talked about minimal exposure to the challenged retailers. can you just talk a little bit about like doors that you were selling last year, just sort of that are closed, how many doors like that are closed? and sort of do you see any risk in the doors that you're continuing on the challenged retail side?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. thanks, bob. i'll go ahead and start on the erp implementation. certainly, it was it's been a big series of activities for us over the past 100 days or so as it relates to the implementation. certainly, as you know, we began the erp project about the time of the spin. and there's been significant work ongoing on that. obviously, as we moved into 2020 with the advent of covid and working remotely. some additional challenges, certainly, as we prepared for the second quarter activity. but couldn't be more proud of the team and how they've worked together heavily relying upon collaboration tools during the quarter. we did have some significant milestones that were out there from an erp perspective.
so scott talked a little bit about in his prepared remarks going live on both a new e-com platform for emea and the u.s. in the second quarter. we also shifted over our production or our distribution, i should say, in europe to a 3pl. and then just recently went live with our first region on the new erp and infrastructure platform in asia. and so in terms of the time line, you talked a little bit about that. we still have are making great progress, and we still have the u.s. and europe in front of us. and but that's the last region, asia is the last region we have planned for this year. so hopefully, it gives you a little bit of color more color on the erp side. scott, you want to weigh in on the exposure to challenged retailers?
scott baxter -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so bob, when we think about it, we really think about going back to our horizon one and our strategy and how we thought about how we wanted to set this business up for success. and we took a hard look at the marketplace globally and said, ""where do we want to align and who do we want to align with?"" and we chose some certain folks to make big investments with, and they are really paying off now. so one of the things that we've talked a lot about is that our four largest customers represent about 50% of our business. so if you think about walmart, target, amazon and kohl's, we feel really good about how we think about that from a win with winners and are positioned really well going forward. and then if you think about department stores, and we've talked about this. we just always had very limited distribution there. and now we have even more limited distribution there, unlike our competition.
so for us, that puts us in a really good position as far as going forward. and i think the other thing is, from the very beginning, we've talked a lot about the fact that we were going to amplify our digital. and we have spent an incredible amount of time and energy and investment on doing that, and it's starting to show. both rustin and i talked a lot about how that's kind of started to really pay its benefits back to the organization. but we think there's a long way to go. and we've hired a new leader that's doing a terrific job, and we've made investments in that business. so the combination of those things, we think, puts us in a really good spot and as far as going forward.
bob drbul -- guggenheim -- analyst
great, scott, thanks guys.

thanks bob.

the next question comes from the line of alexandra walvis with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
alexandra walvis -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks so much for taking the question i've got two questions. the first question is, i wonder if you could share any thoughts on the structural changes that could result from the covid pandemic as it relates to your business and to the broader market. i'm particularly interested in how the wholesale model evolves how wholesale partners will approach holding inventory and taking receipts in the future and how you're positioned for that. and then i've got a follow-up question.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. thanks, alex. it's rustin. i'll start with the first piece about some of the structural changes that we're seeing a little bit internally, and then ask scott to weigh in about a little bit more on the wholesale market dynamics that we're seeing. but certainly, i think as we think about structural changes with covid, we've talked a little bit about it's we've taken a step back and really examined all of our expenditures in the business and how we work together. so last quarter, we talked a little bit more, just even about doing kind of virtual design work, and certainly, virtual sales meetings. so we're seeing some changes from a structural side that we're certainly looking at. we did take a number of temporary actions, furloughs and salary reductions, to manage through this year.
but certainly, we're looking at how we would spend those dollars moving forward. scott mentioned quite a bit about the focus on digital, and many of the investments in the strategies we really had in place at the time of the spin, certainly, we're trying to distort and amplify now. we're early in that journey, but it is we are taking fresh looks as a result of covid about how much we're spending and where we're spending our dollars to make sure that we're prudent there. so scott, maybe you want to weigh in on the market side?
scott baxter -- president and chief executive officer
yes. from a strategic standpoint, alex, i think this is one of the areas where we have really benefited. and we had a vantage point from the very beginning, taking a business that was kind of disparate all over the world, doing their own separate things, making their own product, having their own offices and all that. and we brought it all together. and we're in the process right now, and it's happening very quickly of globalizing this company and doing that in many different ways. so whether it's rustin speaking about the erp or tom and chris on how they're bringing the global product teams together across the world.
but that structurally is really important to us going forward. and then as you complement that with how we think about digital and how we're thinking about a headquarter office where we brought lee here and we've got the team together, and we've talked a lot about that. and i can't say enough about how much that's benefited us as an organization. so structurally, we were way down that path. and only now, we just continue to accelerate. so for us, it's actually been a real push and a good one.
alexandra walvis -- goldman sachs -- analyst
awesome. and then my second question is on cash generation. so i wonder if you could share any color on where you're forecasting cash generation for the year. you exceeded expectations in this quarter and used that to make a incremental discretionary debt paydowns. can you talk about how where you're forecasting for the year and how you're thinking about paying the pace of debt paydown?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. thanks, alex. it's rustin. i'll take that. so as we've talked many times since the spin, cash generation is of paramount importance to our investment thesis, and just really, frankly, our operating model. so we've maintained focus upon cash generation since the spin. and as i talked a little bit earlier about some of the inventory trends that we saw late last year, with the $80 million improvement in the back half, continuing to accelerate that, certainly in light of covid and liquidity as we moved into q2.
so as we think about the back half of the year, certainly, i'm not going to guide specifically on cash generation, but we did call out that we do have line of sight to continued inventory improvement that is out there in the back half. so we do see additional improvement. we're pleased with the progress we've made so far, but that is the single-largest lever from a working capital perspective we can pull in terms of cash generation. so it continues to be a focal point for us, and we see additional opportunities to continue to improve in the back half.
alexandra walvis -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks you so much for all the color.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

the next question comes from the line of sam poser with susquehanna. please proceed with your question.
sam poser -- susquehanna -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. i hope everybody's well, and i've got a handful. let's start with i'm just going to ask them and then we can deal with them. the dividend. what is the status of your plans for the dividend? and i'll follow-up on that if i need to. what are is there are you expecting the sales to be positive in the third quarter, given the wrangler, that shift of the $33 million, plus the walmart lee order? and can you give us some idea of the size of that walmart order?
and as the same thing too on the gross margin, given that things are starting to get cleaned up. so like, sort of on a non like on a comp basis without those new businesses, i assume you're expecting some improvement in the trends. and then you add those new businesses in, where does that leave you? i know you don't want to give specific guidance, but these are two large orders, i would guess.
scott baxter -- president and chief executive officer
okay. well, sam, why don't i go ahead and start with the dividend? and then rustin will go ahead and take it from there for the next 2.so as we've stated in the release, we want to reinstate the dividend as soon as appropriate. obviously, we here as a team, it's been part of our investment thesis. we absolutely understand how important it is. just to remind everybody, we suspended for the second and third quarter of 2020. and we can make payments as long as certain criteria is met after the third quarter. and we know how important it is to the story, and i hope everybody here knows how important it is to our board and to all of our shareholders.
so we take it very serious. there are a lot of things that go into that decision as we work with our board to go ahead and reinstate. we're going to go ahead and comment on that in the next quarter, of course, and bring everybody up to speed. we're not going to go into any specifics at this time. but again, we know absolutely how important it is. we will go ahead and comment on the next quarter on it and bring everybody up to speed. rustin, do you want to go ahead and talk about the sales?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sam, i'll go ahead and take your next two questions. obviously, as we stated, we're not going to guide on the back half. but we did talk on the revenue side about seeing sequential improvement in the second half. and that's certainly, the timing shift of the $33 million that we talked about and the new distribution gains, specifically the walmart program with lee, which we won't dimensionalize. but you do know it's over 2,000 doors. just to give you a little bit of perspective will help, and that's where we're seeing some of that sequential improvement. but that i will stress, sam, that we continue to assume a prolonged operating environment.
and we stated that last quarter. we continue to believe it's prudent to assume a level of uncertainty from a macro perspective. so that's how we're envisioning the sales in the back half, again, sequential improvement. from a gross margin perspective, we talked a little bit about tougher comps certainly in the back half of 2019, as we started to see some of that improvement from our quality of sales initiatives and the restructuring, we started to inflect a little bit in the back half of 2019. so we will be up against tougher comps. channel mix will shift a little bit as well. certainly not a lot of distressed goods necessarily being sold in the front half that there will be a little bit more distress. and again, that timing shift from q2 to q3.
so we do anticipate we'll likely have some continued downtime in inventory reserves, but we anticipate those will moderate, sam, as we go into the back half. and so that's a little bit more sort of context again on the gross margin. but we won't guide specifically on the margin piece.
sam poser -- susquehanna -- analyst

the next question comes from the line of adrienne yih with barclays. please proceed with your question.
adrienne yih -- barclays -- analyst
yes, good morning, scott, i wanted to talk about two of the strategic initiatives. i guess, your own brand digital, so can you give us the penetration that it is pre covid in the u.s. versus the in china? and then what has covid done in terms of those targets? either on a next year basis or on a three year long-range plan basis, how has that accelerated that? and then on category expansion, a little bit more on all-terrain gear. the notion of moving from jeanswear, inclusive of outdoor and then teeth, how much bigger is the total addressable market?
you gave a number in your prepared remarks, but who's buying it? is it a new customer to the business? to wrangler? and so just wondering how much bigger that footprint looks like. then for rustin, i think you said you're not talking about margins, but i'm going to ask again anyway. given your inventory discipline and its additional sales in the third quarter, should we expect a positive gross margin inflection from the third quarter?
scott baxter -- president and chief executive officer
okay. adrienne, i will start with digital. so you know it's a primary focus for us. we didn't put a lot of energy and effort into this oldco. and so we've kind of started from new about almost two years ago in that it wasn't a priority for the business and it wasn't a priority for oldco from an investment standpoint. so what we've done is we've gone ahead and got the leadership situation right, hired an external talent, an extreme talent, we're really happy. and that person has been bringing on their team. and then we've been sequentially making investments into that business as we grow it. so you've seen that we've had some really nice success this past quarter, obviously, with wrangler u.s. being up 62%.
what we're really doing is turning that into an opportunity vehicle for us from the standpoint of how do we connect with our consumers in a really positive way. it used to be, for us, it was just simply a vehicle of making a transaction. and that obviously wasn't a positive thing for us going forward. so you can see how we've transitioned. we've also built new platforms that have gone online here just recently around the globe, both in europe and the u.s. for both lee and wrangler. so we're real pleased with how that's gone. and then i think the other key piece is how we tie in our data and analytics capabilities relative to the work that we're doing with our erp. so our digital team is tied to the hip with our erp it team, and they've worked really hard to make sure that we're putting in the right systems so that when we turn this on here, it will be a very powerful machine for us going forward. and we're going to continue to make investments in that business as we move forward.
from the standpoint of atg, it is a natural extension. if you think about how you think about wrangler. wrangler's always had a very big outdoor presence: fishing, hunting, hiking, camping. so it was a natural for us from a consumer standpoint. our consumers have been asking us to go ahead and migrate this way. i think the thing that's really important for us is you take our wrangler product. it's terrific product. it's valued. it's built really well. it's got great name brand recognition behind it. and it's sold and really right and appropriate channels. so there's really big upside. you've heard me talk in my prepared remarks about the fact that we've had really nice success here over the last quarter with some of the comps that we've seen. and now we're gaining new distribution. and i think that going forward, the marketplace is, one, it's a very big market, is going to want to see some more types of products like this, in addition to the fact that we want to see it with a company that brings value and brings name brand recognition.
and we bring both of that to it. so we're really pleased. at debt sorry. no, we've got one more there with just got one more for adrienne.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. adrienne. i'll go ahead and comment quickly on your gross margin inflection question in q3. obviously, as i said, i can't i'm not going to guide on q3 specifically and whether that inflects positive or not. we do anticipate some of the structural benefits from the quality of sales, restructuring, product costs that we've been driving to continue. but we anticipate some of the downtime and inventory reserves will moderate as well. and as i mentioned, we have a little bit tougher comp in the back half of 2019 that we're comparing to. so hope that helps provide a little bit of additional color.
adrienne yih -- barclays -- analyst

the next question comes from the line of jay sole with ubs. please proceed with your question.
jay sole -- ubs -- analyst
great, thank you so much. you've given some great color on gross margin and quality of sale initiatives already. i just want to follow-up a little bit. if you could sort of explain maybe where you are in the journey on getting the quality of sales to where you want it to be. and if you can sort of offer any examples specifically, like what kind of actions you've taken to improve the company's quality of sales.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, jay, it's rustin. i'll go ahead and take that. so as we think about quality of sales, it really is a journey. and so the word you use there, i think, is really appropriate. as we think about it, it continues on. we do everything here at kontoor through a tsr lens. and so certainly, as we came out of the spin, we really looked at our operations across the world, and started to look at unprofitable markets or channels. so we exited some countries, one in europe. certainly, we've exited unprofitable points of distribution.
and just making sure that, as scott said in his prepared remarks, that we're optimizing the foundation for continued growth. so we've taken a lot of steps since the spin and quality of sales. and it will continue. we're always going to be looking at sku-rationalization items like that. and certainly, all of this is in the context of a tsr lens, which will help us drive up our aurs and our gross margins over time and really create that positive structural mix shift moving forward.
jay sole -- ubs -- analyst
got it. and then rustin, if you could just talk a little bit about liquidity. given the pandemic situation is still quite fluid, can you just talk about what the company's liquidity position is at this point and the kind of flexibility that you have looking ahead?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. yes, jay. if we take a step back, we kind of ended the first quarter. we had about $479 million in cash. debt was about $1.4 billion. as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we did pay down $175 million on that revolver on closing of that amended credit facility in may. again, the strong cash generation, we paid down an additional discretionary $75 million on the revolver in june. so we ended the second quarter with $256 million in cash, about $1.1 billion in debt.
as we think about liquidity, we have about 200 a $25 million or so i'm sorry. yes. $225 million or so on the revolver that's available for us as well as the $256 million in cash. so hopefully, that gives you a little bit better sense on the liquidity side. and i will emphasize that despite all the macroeconomic challenges in the quarter, we did improve our liquidity during the second quarter. so that's a big milestone for us as an organization.
jay sole -- ubs -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.

scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
thank you, eric. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. from all of us at kontoor, i sincerely hope you and your families remain safe and healthy. we are pleased to share our third quarter results with you today, results that came in ahead of our expectations, driven by broad-based improving performance across the wrangler and lee brands, channels and geographies. rustin will take you through greater detail on the financials in a bit, but before that, i'd like to share my thoughts on a few key areas. first, our strategies are working, despite the impacts of covid, as evidenced by the acceleration we are seeing across our business. i'll share some select proof points from the third quarter. next, i'm excited to announce the reinstatement of a dividend during the fourth quarter.
i'll provide some perspective on how our improving fundamentals, coupled with strong cash generation, have given our board of directors confident in making this decision. and finally, i'll offer context as to why the kontoor model is well positioned for success going forward with investments driving digital transformation, category extensions and geographic expansion that will yield more sustainable and profitable growth over time. but first, as always, our results are a direct reflection of our great employees. i want to thank our colleagues around the globe for their incredible efforts, superior execution and continued dedication to excellence. no doubt, these are challenging and uncertain times, and we remain unwavering in our support of the health and safety of our colleagues. i know our team, no matter the environment, will continue to rise to the occasion. turning to our third quarter results.
we are pleased to share that we saw strong fundamental improvement across almost all areas of our business, with revenue, margins and cash flows all coming in ahead of our expectations. rustin will take you through the margins and cash flow later in the call, but let me start by providing color on how our strategic initiatives drove improving top line performance in the quarter. overall, revenues sequentially improved in q3, down 9% compared with down 42% in the second quarter. importantly, the u.s. business saw accelerating trends during the quarter with both the wrangler and lee brands delivering positive growth in q3. in the u.s., we increased 10%, while wrangler was up 2%. and we are taking share broadly. according to npd, both lee and wrangler brands saw accelerating u.s. share trends during q3, ending the quarter with solid increases across both men's and women's denim. both europe and china saw sequential gains during q3, consistent with the gradual improvement highlighted last quarter. china will continue to be a focus for our strategic investments, given the significant white space opportunity the region presents, including the launch of wrangler, which remains on track for a soft opening this fall and broader launch in the spring of '21. these broad-based improvements are a function of the strategic initiatives we've been executing since the spin. let me touch on a few of these areas now. first, we continue to work to optimize our distribution strategy.
this began with the spin with the necessary investment in quality of sales initiatives to enhance our wholesale business through the exit of select underperforming channels, markets and points of distribution. this quality of sales efforts create the optimal foundation in support of more sustained, healthier top line growth in the future. another component of our wholesale distribution strategy has been an increased focus on partnering with best-in-class retailers. many of these partners were deemed essential and remained open during the pandemic, including walmart, amazon and target as well as select western specialty customers. and we believe these retailers are well positioned to continue their strong performance even assuming an uncertain environment. the second area of strategic focus, accelerating digital, is a primary catalyst of our evolving distribution strategy. and while this is a global endeavor, our investments in our u.s. digital platforms continue to yield solid returns with our digital wholesale and own dot-com in the region, up 68% and 43%, respectively. and while we remain in the early stages of transforming our own branded sites, the third quarter showed continued momentum for both brands, with global lee.com, up 27% and wrangler.com, up 38%. we will continue to distort investments in developing our digital ecosystem as the consumer will be at the center of everything we do.
we will leverage our evolving data analytics capabilities and unlock value from our new global erp infrastructure to ensure kontoor is a consumer-led, digital-first organization. these investments should drive not only sustained top line growth but more profitable growth as our mix improves in this accretive channel over time. our third strategic focus lies within enhancing and scaling our innovation platforms. as we've discussed in the past, the investments we are making in innovation span both product and advanced manufacturing capabilities. our investments in design and processes, enhanced fit and fabrications, lighter and more durable materials all support an evolving innovation pipeline that will be appropriately segmented across a variety of distribution channels with a greater emphasis on value and premium specialty. and across channels, we know that innovation can support elevated pricing as we've seen in the recent wrangler by fred segal collection at nordstrom, the emerging wrangler atg line in outdoor specialty and the launch of our lee mvp and legendary programs with kohl's. in one area of innovation where advanced technologies drive both product and manufacturing is sustainability. last quarter, we said we needed to be louder with our great efforts behind sustainability and esg. and this quarter, we are doing just that, publishing our inaugural sustainability report as an independent publicly traded company. this report provides great insights into our accomplishments and progress over the last 18 months but more importantly, sets foundational goals for our organization as we aspire to be a leader on sustainability and esg within the apparel industry.
these progressive goals connected to the three pillars of our platform, people, product and planet, include saving 10 billion liters of water by 2025. we were a first mover in this area with our development of the indigood wireless home dyeing process, and we will look to scale this in the coming years to further reduce water use in the production process. power 100% of our owned and operated facilities with renewable energy by 2025. source 100% sustainable raw materials for cotton by 2025 and synthetics by 2030. and finally, we will only work with factories that support worker well-being or community development programs. kontoor's approach to sustainable business activities is founded on our commitment to be a purposeful business. within that context, we've affirmed our commitment to doing business responsibly and sustainably, balancing financial success while striving to meet the needs of the communities we serve and the planet we share. we look forward to sharing progress toward achieving our sustainability and esg goals in the quarters to come. and the final strategic area of focus i will discuss today is new business development. despite the challenging environment, we have been on the offense, aggressively investing behind business development, supported by enhanced demand creation initiatives. first, let me provide an update on our lee master band program that launched in over 2,000 doors with walmart in september. although we are still in early days, we are encouraged by the reads we are seeing in the marketplace. the initial assortments are now largely set, and in-store point-of-sale is well under way and will be finalized over the next few weeks, which should help further catalyze sell-through. importantly, we're using this initial launch as a solid foundation of which to build.
as a reminder, the initial sell-in of the lee program included men's and women's bottoms, primarily denim and select casual product. the offering will scale over time to include additional categories and beneficial to our retail partners and consumers. the collection represents a compelling value at elevated prices. we are really excited about the incremental sku and category opportunities as well as the potential for door expansion over time. and to support these new programs, we are taking the opportunity to invest in our brands by accelerating demand creation investment in the back half of the year. during the third quarter, this included ongoing domestic collaborations with influential brands like alife and the recently announced partnership with appharvest, a leading agricultural sustainability organization. internationally, we also introduced collaborations with local artists for a pop-up in selfridges in london, which highlight our sustainability platform for a world that works. and in china, we launched a brand equity campaign titled stand tall, utilizing influencer eddie peng. turning to the wrangler brand. new business development with wrangler outdoor, including atg, continues to be a highlight in our growing portfolio.
year-to-date, wrangler outdoor has added more than 300 new doors of distribution within the u.s., primarily in outdoor specialty, demonstrating our continued wholesale diversification strategy. and internationally, the launch with dressmann that we highlighted last quarter is just kicking off. we are pleased to announce today that based on its early success, the atg line will be launching the women's collection in cubus, a european women's fashion concept with over 300 doors. what makes this especially exciting is that this will be solely women's atg product, highlighting the breadth of quality across genders, channels and geographies and demonstrates how well the wrangler outdoor platform is being received in the marketplace. and similar to lee, wrangler is also taking the opportunity to accelerate demand creation investments in the back half of the year. during the quarter, we continued to scale our successful wear with abandon campaign, ramped our social media end, expanded our production and photography in-house capabilities and partnered with a new digital advertising agency. looking ahead to q4, our strong marketing initiatives will continue. ahead of the december 2020 wrangler national rodeo finals in arlington, texas.
we recently opened our full-price pop-up store in the heart of the fort worth stockyards, an outdoor retail environment rich in western heritage and cowboy culture. the 1,500 square foot format includes an assortment of modern, outdoor and western collections with laser customization technology on site. we will also introduce wrangler collaborations with rick and morty on the adult swim channel, and we just launched our wrangler by fred segal collection at nordstrom, all continuing the brand's enhanced approach to reach younger, more diverse consumers. so let me reiterate. despite the pandemic, we have been aggressive in our approach to amplify many of the strategies that were implemented at the spin, allowing us to capitalize on marketplace disruption. we continue to drive new business development at a pace not seen in years. our brands are healthy and well positioned, and we look forward to building on this momentum. next, i want to turn to a key topic they know is on many of your minds, and that is the decision to reinstate a dividend. as you've seen in our release this morning, our board of directors reinstated and declared quarterly cash dividend payable in december of this year. let me be clear, this is a decision our board made with confidence. as you all know, at the outset of the covid pandemic, our focus quickly and prudently shifted to support liquidity and financial flexibility, including the amendment of our credit facility with the temporary suspension of a dividend for at least two quarters and the opportunity to reevaluate during the fourth quarter.
after thoughtful deliberation, our board has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. rustin will take you through greater detail on the rationale for the level at which the dividend was reinstated, but i'll share a few high-level thoughts. first, the dividend is a foundational element of our post-spin investment theses, our total shareholder return model and capital allocation priorities. next, given our performance, the board is reinstating an attractive, sustainable dividend that demonstrates confidence in the cash-generating aspects of our operating model while providing prudent financial resilience and flexibility in a dynamic operating environment. and finally, we anticipate our improving fundamentals will drive an increasing percentage of our evolving tsr model. while our priorities remain focused on paying down debt and paying a superior dividend, optionality will begin to emerge as we optimize our capital structure. you will hear more on this evolving capital allocation strategy in the coming quarters and at our investor day currently planned for this upcoming spring. let me close with this. i am confident that kontoor is well positioned for future success even in the face of an uncertain operating landscape.
despite one of the most challenging consumer environments in history, we have been on offense, investing in several strategic areas that should drive competitive separation in the marketplace. the powerful combination of these strategic, proactive actions that drive fundamental improvement, coupled with our uniquely superior cash flow, positions us for more sustainable and profitable growth in the future. we are confident that the investments we are now making across digital transformation, geographic expansion, scaling innovation, demand creation and new business development will come together to yield superior returns for all of kontoor stakeholders over time.
with that, i turn it over to rustin.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, scott, and good morning, everyone. as scott mentioned, driven by our strong execution, our third quarter performance came in above our internal expectations and clearly demonstrates that the proactive strategies we implemented since the spin are gaining traction. we drove continued sequential improvement in our brand performance, enhanced profitability and generated significant cash, allowing for aggressive debt paydown while improving our overall liquidity position. scott walked you through many of the strategic actions we are taking to further these gains. so let me outline what i will cover for the balance of the call. first, i will discuss how we are enhancing profitability while continuing to invest in strategic initiatives. next, i will walk through the progress we made in delevering the balance sheet, putting ourselves in the best net liquidity position since the spin and enabling us to reinstate a dividend. and finally, i will close with a review of our third quarter results and provide additional perspective on our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year.
so let's get started. at the spin, we kicked off a 2-phase program that would yield $50 million in total savings. phase one of our cost savings program included optimizing our global distribution network, exiting unprofitable and noncore channels and relocating the lee headquarters. these projects began at the spin and are complete, yielding $25 million in savings over the back half of 2019 and throughout 2020. as covid began, we reexamined all of our spending and accelerated select strategic actions, including the move of the vf outlet headquarters to north carolina. and the strategic review of our u.s. store network is well under way and will involve additional door rationalization and reformatting of select stores. phase two of our cost savings program was predicated on our erp implementation, and we remain on track to realize anticipated savings beginning in 2021. despite the pandemic, progress on the strategic erp investment continues with our first regional implementation successfully completed during our third quarter and the remaining regional implementations planned in 2021. we remain on track to deliver the balance of the projected savings. these actions came together with gross and operating margin improvement in the third quarter. as you saw in the release this morning, we drove healthy improvements in our overall profitability, with adjusted gross margin increasing 240 basis points versus the prior year.
gross margin is a key focal point for the organization and remains an important driver of our overall tsr approach. i am pleased to say that gains were broad-based, with increases in both wrangler and lee and in all geographic regions. let's review the components in more detail. first, the aggressive actions we took to manage inventory early in the pandemic helped us to adjust to new demand signals and avoid the creation of excess inventory. in fact, we were able to steadily improve our inventory health during q3 and position supply to meet fourth quarter demand. these actions are driving a healthier mix of full price selling. quality of sales actions and further supply chain initiatives also supported gross margin recapture. second, we continue to see the benefits from structurally accretive mix shifts we have discussed as an important part of our evolving operating model, including accelerating growth of our digital businesses. we have talked about these measures supporting an improving gross margin trajectory, and they are doing just that.
i will touch on our forward expectations later in the call, but we see these benefits continuing in the fourth quarter and beyond. as we have discussed since the spin, our owned manufacturing provides a distinct competitive advantage to adjust production as conditions warrant while minimizing service disruptions for our partners. the pandemic has resulted in a highly dynamic environment, and we continue to actively manage the supply/demand balance. given the abrupt onset of the pandemic, early in the quarter, we did experience select supply chain disruptions driven by lockdowns in certain countries. we worked to enhance our supply position, which has improved throughout the quarter. and we believe our current inventory levels are appropriate to respond to the marketplace while supporting anticipated demand and new program wins. third, you have heard us discuss taking a prudent approach to managing cost while supporting growth platforms. earlier in the year, we engaged the global organization to rethink processes, leverage technology and challenge discretionary expenses. we also made the difficult decision to make temporary salary and merit-based adjustments that impacted many of our colleagues.
while i am very pleased to say we were able to restore these salary adjustments during the third quarter, we also drove meaningful cost improvements in part from phase one of the cost-saving program previously discussed, with sg&a leveraging 230 basis points. these proactive measures are leading to tangible cost structure improvements that will allow us to reinvest back into the business. we look forward to sharing more details in the quarters ahead. despite an incredibly challenging environment, our adjusted operating profit increased 23% to $103 million, while our adjusted operating margin increased 460 basis points to 17.6% of sales. while we continue to invest in our key long-term strategies, accelerate demand creation and support our global growth initiatives, our third quarter results are solid proof points that the actions we are taking are positioning us for continued sustainable long-term growth. now to the progress we made during the third quarter to further solidify our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position. as we've discussed since the spin, strong and consistent cash generation is foundational to our operating model.
this was clearly evident during the quarter as we drove an acceleration in operating cash flow. looking at the first nine months of the year, despite the challenges from the pandemic and ongoing investments in our it infrastructure, we generated $130 million in cash from operations. importantly, this strong cash generation has led to an acceleration in debt paydown while bolstering our net liquidity position. since amending our credit facility in may, we have made $175 million in discretionary debt repayments and project at least another $100 million before year-end. at the end of the third quarter, our net debt was $752 million, a low watermark since the spin. additionally, we ended the quarter with $653 million in cash and available borrowings under our credit facility, marking our best liquidity position since the spin as well. so stepping back, through three quarters of 2020 and despite headwinds from the pandemic and the highly dynamic marketplace, we have meaningfully improved our capital position and see additional opportunity to further improvement in the fourth quarter. i will touch on this again later in the call, but i encourage you to refer to the liquidity table we included in the release this morning for additional detail. finally, as scott mentioned, our robust cash generation has led to the reinstatement of a quarterly dividend at $0.40 per share.
let me provide additional perspective. first, we continue to operate in a very uncertain environment and believe it is prudent to maintain financial resiliency and flexibility with the reinstatement of a dividend. accordingly, reinstating a dividend per share of $0.40 or approximately 70% of pre-covid levels allows the dividend to remain a key element in creating a strong and sustainable tsr that rewards shareholders, enables for continuing debt paydown and allows continued investment in the organic growth of the business. second, the board's level of reinstatement reflects confidence in the business, and we anticipate increases over time as performance and the operating environment warrant. the timing and amount of any increase will depend on the board's continual evaluation of the multiple factors listed in our dividend policy as described in our filings, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, the terms of our outstanding indebtedness and other considerations our board deems relevant.
and finally, these actions reflect our performance-driven tsr framework and importantly, optionality as we position kontoor for improving fundamentals to drive an increasing percentage of our tsr, all while supporting shareholder-friendly actions. now let's get to our third quarter review. global revenue decreased 9% in the third quarter compared with the same quarter in 2019. revenue declines during the quarter were primarily the result of impact from covid, offset by double-digit increases in digital, new business development wins and the timing shift of wrangler u.s. shipments from the second to third quarter as we discussed on our last earnings call. on a regional basis for the quarter, u.s. revenues were flat compared to the same quarter in 2019. impacts attributable to covid were offset by growth in digital, new business development wins and the aforementioned timing shift. the u.s. represented 78% of our revenue in the quarter. outside of the u.s., international revenues declined 31% in constant currency compared with the same quarter in 2019. despite the decline, both europe and china improved sequentially driven by digital wholesale and improving e-commerce demand. we anticipate continued sequential improvement during q4 in both regions. turning to our channels.
our revenue in our u.s. wholesale channel, which represented 67% of our revenue, increased 3% compared with the same quarter in 2019. increases were driven by improving trends with key wholesale partners, the benefits of new business development wins and the previously mentioned timing shift. our non-u.s. wholesale channel, which represented 18% of our revenue, decreased 34% compared with the same quarter in 2019 driven by impacts from covid. we experienced sequential improvement in q3 and anticipate continued progress during q4. our branded direct-to-consumer channel, which represented 11% of our revenues, increased 2% driven by strong gains in both wrangler and lee.com. our owned digital business increased 32% driven by 43% growth in the u.s. and 19% growth in china. finally, let's turn to our brands. global revenue of our wrangler brand declined 6% compared with the same quarter in 2019. wrangler u.s. revenue increased 2% in the period. strength in digital wholesale and growth in our western business led to the increase as well as the previously discussed timing shift. additionally, we drove accelerating growth in our owned dot-com business, which increased 44% in the quarter. wrangler international revenue was down 40% compared with the same period last year. covid-related impacts continued to weigh on performance. however, we did see sequential improvement in key markets and ongoing strength with our key digital wholesale partners. lee brand global revenue declined 8% compared with the same quarter in 2019. lee u.s. revenue increased 10% in the period driven by new business development wins as well as continued strength in digital wholesale and 40% growth in owned dot-com. lee international revenue was down 26% compared with the third quarter 2019.
while ongoing headwinds from covid, particularly in europe, continue to weigh on the region, we saw sequential improvement from the second quarter combined with the strength in our owned e-commerce business. now on to gross margin. as previously mentioned, total adjusted gross margin increased 240 basis points to 43.3%. the increase was primarily driven by the benefits of product cost as well as channel and product mix in the quarter. these increases were slightly offset by downtime in owned manufacturing. i will discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter momentarily, but we anticipate these drivers to largely continue through the balance of the year. adjusted sg&a decreased $28 million on a year-over-year basis to $150 million. as a percentage of revenue, sg&a decreased 230 basis points to 25.6%. tight expense controls and benefits from restructuring actions more than offset fixed cost headwinds due to lower revenues as a result of covid. adjusted earnings per share were $1.33 in the third quarter compared with $0.95 in the prior year.
now turning to our balance sheet. third quarter inventories decreased $113 million versus the prior year to $432 million or down 21%. the year-over-year decline reflects tight inventory controls and our strong culture for working capital management. compared to the second quarter, inventories were essentially flat. we are pleased with our performance in managing inventory in this environment and believe we are well positioned to support anticipated fourth quarter and holiday demand while continuing to improve inventory levels. we finished the third quarter with $285 million in cash and debt of approximately $1 billion. as previously discussed, due to our strong performance in the third quarter and improving liquidity position, we made an additional discretionary repayment totaling $100 million on our revolver in the third quarter. strong cash generation should support continued aggressive debt paydown during the fourth quarter of 2020. and now on to our outlook.
while the impacts from covid as well as macroeconomic factors remain uncertain, we are providing full year 2020 adjusted eps guidance and offer the following perspective as you think about the balance of the year. revenue in the fourth quarter should experience sequential improvement from the third quarter, with revenue anticipated to be flat-to-down modestly. fourth quarter adjusted gross margin is expected to be above 2019 levels of 40.9%, reflecting continued benefits from ongoing restructuring and quality of sales initiatives as well as higher anticipated growth in more accretive channels such as digital and improving mix within international. fourth quarter adjusted sg&a is expected to increase year-over-year driven by strategic decisions to amplify investments in demand creation and d2c in support of both the fourth quarter and long term revenue. full year 2020 adjusted eps is anticipated to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share. and finally, strong cash generation should support continued aggressive debt paydown, expected to be at least $100 million during the fourth quarter. in closing, i want to reiterate the confidence we have in the business and the strategies we are executing against to drive greater shareholder value.
while there is still much to do and despite the challenges of the current environment, we are pleased with the progress we have made executing our long-term priorities, improving profitability and fortifying our capital position. we look forward to sharing our progress in the coming quarters and at our investor day currently planned in spring of 2021.
this concludes our prepared remarks, and i will now turn the call back to our operator. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from erinn murphy with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
erinn elisabeth murphy -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
great. thanks. good afternoon. so i guess my question is on the lee rollout into walmart. i'd love to hear if you could talk a bit more about how the business looked once it launched in august and into september. and then if you -- i don't know if you could quantify how much was sell-in and what you're seeing today in sell-through. but then i think you also left the door open to talk about new categories into spring of next year and potentially even new doors. can you just help us frame up how you're thinking about that rollout? and then i have another follow-up.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
sure. erinn, this is scott. from the lee rollout perspective, we're actually really pleased. obviously, we're winning with winners, and we're pleased with our partnership, a big expansion of our partnership with walmart. but i think the thing that we're most pleased with is the fact that we rolled it out, it's been accepted by the consumer extremely well. our female business has done exceptionally well. so we're really pleased with that. i think one of the things that we've talked a lot about as a team and talked with our partner about is the accelerated pricing, too. so we're at a really good price point that we haven't been at in our collections before. so we feel really good about the fact that even at that price point, there's been really strong take out. i think from an expansion standpoint, we wanted to get the program, that's a really big program, so we had to get it up and running. so we chose denim and casuals to start, but the program does call for expansion as we move into next year with seasonals and shorts. so we think it's got a really nice future ahead of it. and we're really pleased to date with the rollout. one of the things that i would mention, and i want to talk about this because we've had this question is, are we seeing any cannibalization relative to our wrangler line? and i think the thing that i'm most pleased with that we're hearing from the team and our partner is that we're not really seeing any cannibalization right now. and that speaks volumes to me about the consumer that's coming in and the consumer that's taking out our product there. so really pleased with where we are to date on that program. thanks, erinn.
erinn elisabeth murphy -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
yes, that's encouraging. and then just a follow-up on the dividend. obviously, very good to see it reinstated this morning. it is at a lower dollar amount. so can you just share kind of how you're balancing that with debt paydown? i don't know if you can speak specifically of what you're expecting to pay down in the fourth quarter. you said it would be aggressive. and then just remind us, where do you need to be from a net debt to an ebitda perspective before you rethink about m&a? thank you.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
sure. let me go ahead and start, and then i'll flip it over to rustin, and he'll answer some of the rest of the question. but we obviously amended our credit facility. so we had a 2-quarter abatement that we had to have. and i think the thing that i'm most encouraged about is that the employees of this company, i have so much confidence in this team, and our board of directors have so much confidence in this team that the minute we were able to reinstate, we did. but the reason that we did it were for strong fundamentals. so we have improving performance, improving fundamentals, really strong cash generation, which rustin will talk a little bit about. but i would tell you, the single most important thing is taking a look at the future, thinking about our strategy, thinking about the talent that is joining this organization globally and where we're going to take this company. we're just at the beginning of a very early journey, and a lot of good things are going to happen in the future. a lot of the things are happening now. but we have great confidence in the people. we have great confidence in the strategy. we have really good confidence in the operating model, so it gave us really strong confidence to go ahead and reinstate that quickly. rustin, maybe you can go through some of the details?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. great. good afternoon, erinn. just building on scott's point, i think it really starts with confidence. and obviously, we wanted to reinstate at a healthy, attractive, sustainable dividend level. so the board of directors certainly considered a number of factors in determining that level, including obviously the prior dividend level, sort of peer and s&p benchmarks, future earnings estimates and the current macro environment. and i think we're not targeting a specific payout ratio at this time, but we believe the dividend being reinstated at that $0.40 a quarter really balances kind of that board of directors' confidence that scott spoke about, acknowledges the current dynamic operating environment and puts us into a position that given increased performance and a stabilization of the operating environment, we can increase that dividend over time. obviously, the timing and the amount of any increase will really depend upon the board's evaluation on a number of factors certainly, including our financial condition, our earnings, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness, etcetera. so we're not going to get into the timing of that, but we see that opportunity for expansion over time. you mentioned a little bit about how we're thinking about balancing aggressive debt paydown. certainly, very proud of the fact that over the past two quarters, we've made discretionary debt repayments of $175 million. i think that speaks to the strength of our operating environment, our operating model, particularly in this environment. and as we indicated in the script and on the release this morning, we anticipate an additional debt repayment of at least $100 million in the fourth quarter. you also asked a little bit about reaching our optimal capital structure. at the time of the spin, we said that we were targeting a gross leverage ratio less than 3 times, erinn. certainly, we're getting after the debt paydown. our capital allocation priorities for horizon one here remain the same, that aggressive debt paydown and certainly paying that superior dividend that was just reinstated with confidence this morning. so we'll continue to evaluate that as we work our way through 2021 but really focused on the fundamentals of the business and paying down the debt.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
and erinn, one last thing. thank you, rustin. one last thing is we'll spend some time on this in our upcoming investor day in the spring, which we're really looking forward to everyone joining. i think it's going to be a great day where we can really share with you what we're thinking and how we're thinking about this business long term. so thank you, erinn.
erinn elisabeth murphy -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from alexandra walvis with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
alexandra e. walvis -- goldman sachs group -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks so much for taking our question. my first question, you noted your intention to amplify investments in demand creation and digital in the fourth quarter. can you elaborate a little bit more on that? what investments are you making? and are those a pull-forward on previous investment plans? or are there new opportunities that you're taking advantage of?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
so, how are you alex? it's scott. i'll go ahead and start, and rustin and i will take that together. so we have a lot going on in the fourth quarter. but i would tell you, a lot of that just is future build, too. so i don't like to think of things as a short-term perspective. i'd like to think of how we're going to build these brands over a very long period of time. and we've done some really nice things from a new business development standpoint, as you know, with dressmann and walmart and cubus and more in the hopper to come in the future. and we've got to go ahead and support those programs going forward. so we're going to go ahead and do that. we're supporting these really cool collabs that we're doing with the likes of fred segal and alife around the globe, which we're really excited about. and one of the things that we talked a lot about at the very beginning, and you probably remember this all too well, alex, is we talked about these two brands haven't been invested in, in a long time. and we talked a lot about the fact that we love these brands. they're great brands, incredible history and that with a little bit of investment, with a little bit of strategy, with a lot of marketing, we can really make something special out of these. and i think the team -- we owe a debt of gratitude to our incredible team and our marketing teams and our global teams on how we're bringing these brands back to life in a really significant way. so as i think about the opportunity that we have to invest back in these brands, i think about the casualization that's happening around the globe and how that plays right into our strategy. i think about our all terrain gear, our outdoor line that's expanding and growing rapidly, and we talked a little bit about the new business development today. and i think about the investments, the really smart investments we're making in digital and how they're paying off and how we're starting to build a really capable digital team. and you can see that really starting to come together and our erp system that will be coming on board next year and how those two things will come together in a really, really elegant way. so building these brands, investing back into these brands, getting them to an optimal level so that we can feel comfortable within the marketplace that we're spending the right amount of money against these brands. i would say the really important thing is that we do it the right way. we get a nice return for these, and we grow as the business grows. rustin?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. thanks, scott, and good afternoon alex. just a couple of points to build and maybe further dimensionalize scott's comments. we spend, scott and i do, a significant amount of time talking about, obviously, this dynamic operating environment that we find ourselves in. and we really believe that strong trusted brands that offer consumers compelling value that is really enabled by an agile supply chain will win in this environment. and scott talked a little bit about our belief on our brands. we believe we have two of the most iconic brands in the world with over 200 years of trusted history among consumers. we have a diversified, world-class supply chain. we're sourcing or operating from over 275 factories in 20 countries that has enabled us to continue to supply the market and really believe we offer a quality product at compelling value in all of the channels of distribution that we have. and so the decision to sort of distort demand creation and d2c investment during this fourth quarter is important, as scott said, to support a lot of the strategic initiatives that we've launched but really to set us up for long-term growth on the top line and acceleration, not just through holiday, but in 2021 and beyond.
alexandra e. walvis -- goldman sachs group -- analyst
great. that's clear. and then my second question was on inventory, down over 20% in the quarter. can you share expectations for how you expect that to grow going forward? and any comments on the health of inventory, both on your balance sheet and in the channel would be super interesting, too.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
yes. thanks, alex. i'll start and then flip it over to rustin for some detail. but we feel like we're in a really good position. i would tell you, in my time here, 10 years with this business, we've never come out of the fall and the seasonal period as clean as we have. so really have a lot of confidence in that. we feel really good about that. and then the way that we're going ahead and matching our supply and demand model going forward, and i think one of the things that's a great advantage right now is our world-class manufacturing capabilities. i think that just has really played really well in the environment that we're in right now. so we feel like we're in a really good place. and i think one of the things that's really, really important here is you have to create product that people want to buy. and our teams and our product teams are doing a great job of designing and making products that people want to be seen in. so i just -- i can't thank them enough. our board can't thank them enough and can't be as -- i'm just super proud of what we've done here in a short period of time and what our teams have done. rustin?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think scott did a great job, alex, of dimensionalizing that for you. i'll just give you a little bit around the figures. so we were down 21% in the quarter. that was about $113 million year-over-year, down to $432 million. that was relatively flat with where we ended q2. so just to sort of highlight and reiterate maybe what we talked about on the last call, as of q2, we were down about $105 million in inventory year-on-year. and really $80 million of that came in the back half of last year as we were working down inventory with the balance, $25 million, coming in the second quarter. so again, inventory is flat q2 to q3, feel like we're in a great position as scott talked about and just really happy with the quality of the inventory that we have on hand. so thanks, alex.
alexandra e. walvis -- goldman sachs group -- analyst
thank you. wish you all the best.

thank you. our next question comes from robert drbul with guggenheim securities, llc. please proceed with your question.
robert scott drbul -- guggenheim securities, -- analyst
hi guys, good afternoon. just a couple of questions from me. i think first for scott. can you talk a little bit about the denim category maybe across channels in terms of what you're seeing in sort of the trends throughout the different price points, et cetera, and maybe even globally? and then the second question for rustin. can you talk -- i think you talked about gross margin being sustainable into the fourth quarter. can you just talk about the -- into '21, and where you see gross margins over the next two years from where we are today? thanks.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
yes. bob, i'll take the first one, and then rustin will take the gross margin. really love the category that we're in. we love this business. i think the category is just absolutely terrific right now. there's a casualization that's happening globally, and we're sitting right in the sweet spot of it. and i think that one of the things that's been exceptional for our business and our strategy is, if you -- you know this business, and you've been around it for a while, bob, we have actually played in a narrow range from a category standpoint for a long time. and now that we've ventured out in our own as a publicly traded company, one of the things that we talked about was playing in a higher range and making sure that we were taking care of all consumers. so for us, whether it's our business in asia or some of the business that we've built here in the united states recently with nordstrom's and some other folks, playing in those higher channels and the new walmart lee business at a higher price point, it really gives us a distinct advantage to play in multiple channels and to be a bigger player in the category itself. so from a casualization standpoint, from a global standpoint and from just how we're building and thinking about our segmentation, i am really pleased where we are.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
great. and bob, i'll take the second part here on your gross margin question. obviously, really pleased with our gross margin in the third quarter, up 240 basis points, strongest margin we've seen since the spin. and as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we really see those drivers around product cost improvements, channel mix and product mix largely continuing in the fourth quarter, again expect that to finish above prior year levels. as we start to think about 2021, you've heard us, bob, talk quite a bit since the spin about how sequencing matters. and the first thing that we really did coming out of the spin was get after margin expansion and certainly got after the cost save program and the quality of sales initiatives to really recapture some of the margin that have been lost in this business pre-spin. so that gross margin expansion remains a critical focal point for the organization because it really enables us to invest into our brands while enhancing the operating margin. and i'm not going to provide specific guidance on the '21 gross margin today. but i will tell you that gross margin expansion will remain a critical strategic imperative for us as we move forward. it really is the oxygen we breathe into the p&l that allows us to make a lot of the strategic investments that scott's talked about while improving the operating margin. so thanks for the question, bob.
robert scott drbul -- guggenheim securities, -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from adrienne yih with barclays. please proceed with your question.
adrienne eugenia yih -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
great. thank you very much. good afternoon. scott and rustin, i think this quarter really reminds us of what a strong business you run. you're obviously a low to mid-teen margin business after the spin, and that's one of the better ones in the space. so i guess when i look at the 17.6%, this is my question. we haven't seen anybody in the midst of covid expand margins, let alone expand them by 460 basis points. and so it seems like this is a step-function change that horizon one has moved to horizon 2, certainly next quarter when you start to see that sales growth. and so i guess i'm asking for some longer-term guidance, and maybe that's going to come on the lrp on the analyst day. but this business seems very different, much more profitable. and i'm wondering if there's a one time nature to 3q. or you don't want to put the cart before the horse, and maybe there's some happy medium as you are on that path to horizon 2? thank you very much.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. adrienne, it's rustin. i'll go ahead and take that. so certainly proud of our q3 results here. i'd be remiss if i didn't begin with stating that we're obviously in a very dynamic operating environment. and really pleased -- so with the sequential top line growth in the third quarter, we see that continuing into the fourth. obviously, the gross margin expansion, driven in part by sort of the distorted growth in digital, is a welcome sign for us. i talked a little bit in some of the prepared remarks that the sg&a, we did take some actions in the middle of the quarter to reinstate some of the actions we had taken at the height of the pandemic in terms of temporary salary reductions, et cetera. so you'll have kind of the impact of that moving forward now that we're back to sort of normal operating levels. but i think you asked the question about the 17.6% and sort of how we think about it moving forward. certainly, a high watermark at the 17.6%. and we talked quite a bit about wanting to distort demand creation and d2c investments. and again, that's to solidify that fourth quarter top line, but really talking about starting to inflect in 2021 and beyond. so as we think about sort of capital allocation, horizon 1, horizon 2, we're really focused on what we can control, and that is improving the fundamentals of the business. so again, two priorities here in horizon 1, that aggressive debt pay down that will continue here in the fourth quarter, reestablishing sort of a superior dividend, obviously, an important element and then just really being able to organically reinvest into our brands and our business. we feel like we put ourselves in a healthy financial situation with the best net debt and liquidity position we're in since the spin here at this quarter. and our priorities will continue over the near term. so certainly, next year, as we get into the investor day that is currently planned in the spring, we'll talk a little bit more about how we see that capital allocation evolving as we move into horizon 2. but we really like the fact that we should see increased optionality to drive further tsr-bolstering actions in the future as we continue to improve the fundamentals. and that's really where the focal point is in this dynamic environment we're operating in.
adrienne eugenia yih -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
great. and then, scott, if i may. would you comment -- give us some more details on china, what you've been seeing there, the improvement and then the wrangler launch? thanks very much.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
sure, adrienne. we've been seeing nice fundamental improvement in china that we've been talking about here now for a couple of quarters. so we'd like to think that, that's going to continue with the consumer there. they are getting back to what we would call closer to normal. the wrangler launch is happening in a soft way, receiving the market right now as we speak. and then when the operating environment is at what we would call normalization in the spring, which we hope it will be, i have no reason to believe that it won't, we'll do a full launch. and then that way, we can do collaborations and programs and marketing things that we can do with people and have groups together and just be more inclusive and have a better launch timing relative to what we want to do with the brand. so small and seeding now and then the full program this spring. thanks, adrienne.
adrienne eugenia yih -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
geat. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from sam poser with susquehanna. please proceed with your question.
samuel marc poser -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
thanks for taking my question, gentleman. this is sort of an all-over-the-place question. but it sounds to me like through covid and the launch at walmart with lee, it sounds to me like your brands are getting better defined. and despite the fact that sales in total have been tough this year, has this pandemic sort of allowed you to slow things down and better define your businesses for arguably more robust growth going forward than it might have been otherwise?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
yes, sam. this is scott. i'll take that. it's allowed us to go ahead and segment our brands. so if you think about what we've done with both the lee and the wrangler brand, globally, we've really segmented them. i think one of the benefits of the spin-off and one of the things that we talked about was the fact that the brands have stayed in a lane. and now these brands, we've talked a lot about the history of these brands, these brands have permission to go to other places as our competitors have. and what we're seeing is with some marketing, some really good product and bring them to other channels, the consumers love these brands. so that's what gives us really good optimism about the future of our model, sam.
samuel marc poser -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
and just to clarify the question, i want to say to you that you might have tried to grow maybe a little bit more aggressively had there not been the crisis. and because of the crisis, you were arguably able to be more methodical about it to make the brand even stronger than they may have been without the crisis. that's what i'm getting at. i understand your answer, but a slightly different question.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
no, completely understand. we certainly have taken advantage of the dislocation in the marketplace. and one of the things that we've tried to do is treat these brands in a really good way, in a real strategic way on how we look at them going forward. i think one of the things, sam, that's really important about your question and about our business is we are taking a very long-term view of bringing these brands back to the forefront. so agree with what you're saying.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. and i would also add, sam, scott's talked for several quarters now just about the criticality of new business development for us and really gaining those wins. and we've also talked about how it's going to take time. and if you think back to the beginning of the year, pre-covid, we talked about an acceleration in the back half. and really, it was some of these wins, whether it's at dressmann's, at lee at walmart, at cubus that scott's talked about now, really getting after sort of placing these brands in a segmented way as scott talked about in new points of distribution.
operator
thank you. our final question comes from jim duffy with stifel. please proceed with your question.
peter clement mcgoldrick -- stifel, nicolaus -- analyst
hi. this is actually peter mcgoldrick on for jim. it seems like you're really seeing the ball on revenue, which is stabilizing. gross margins are working for you, which could sustain into future years. recently, this is a low-teens operating margin business on an even lower gross margin. can this return to low teens plus operating margin in the near term, net the dtc investments and reversal of salary reductions? i know there's some seasonality that we're looking at very near term, but we're guiding mid-teens in for the second half. and then just as a follow-up, i was curious on demand creation. how should we think about that? is that a pull-forward, given the strength in the third quarter? or is there an emergent opportunity that might not have existed previously?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. it's rustin. i'll go ahead and take those. as we think about sort of the p&l, i'll go back to the comment i made coming out of the spin. we really focused on cost savings and quality of sales because it really all starts with gross margin enhancement, and that was important for us. we sequenced that at the start of the spin. and we really think about that as creating oxygen for the p&l. so as that gross margin expands, it's going to allow us the ability to invest back into the brands as you're certainly seeing here in the fourth quarter via demand creation and d2c while also improving the operating margins. so we see an opportunity to do both over time with that gross margin expansion, and that's why it's such a focal point for us as an organization. as we think about the fourth quarter demand creation, i'll go back to my comments a little bit ago, where particularly in this environment, you really need strong trusted brands. and certainly, we feel good about our distribution and winning with the winning retailers. and to scott's point earlier, we really want to support some of these new business development wins. and it's really an opportunity for us to do that, not just in holiday and in support of the fourth quarter. but again, moving forward, we're under-indexed as scott talked about in demand creation a little bit earlier in the call and really see an opportunity to continue to expand that over time and certainly get behind the brands to drive a stronger top line growth as well. so thanks for the questions.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
so folks, i wanted to -- yes, folks, i wanted to quickly say thank you for your flexibility today. we apologize for the inconvenience we caused everyone, but really appreciate you jumping back on the call, having that flexibility and being patient with us. also wanted to thank you for the support of our company. it's much appreciated, and wish all of you a happy and healthy rest of the year and holiday season. and again, we look forward to spending some quality time with you next year in our investor day, and we'll talk to you some time in between. but thanks, again, everyone, and appreciate the flexibility today. have a great day.

operator
greetings. welcome to kontoor brands fourth quarter earnings call.
[operator instructions]
please note this conference is being recorded. at this time, i'll turn the conference over to eric tracy, senior director of investor relations. ms. tracy, you may begin.
eric tracy -- senior director, investor relations
thank you, operator, and welcome to kontoor brands fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. these statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to materially differ. these uncertainties are detailed in documents filed with the sec. we urge you to read our risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures contained in those reports.
amounts referred to on today's call will often be on an adjusted dollar basis, which we clearly define in the news release that was issued earlier this morning. adjusted amounts exclude the impact of restructuring and separation costs, business model changes, non-cash impairment charges related to our rock & republic trademark and other adjustments. reconciliations of gaap measures to adjusted amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in today's news release, which is available on our website at kontoorbrands.com. these tables identify and quantify excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors. unless otherwise noted, amounts referred to on this call will be in constant currency, which exclude the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. constant currency amounts are intended to help investors better understand the underlying operational performance of our business, excluding the impacts of shifts in currency exchange rates over the period. additionally, as a reminder, our fiscal 2020 included the benefit of a 53rd week, which fell in the fourth quarter.
joining me today on today's call are kontoor brands' president and chief executive officer, scott baxter; and chief financial officer, rustin welton. in addition, on today's call, we will also be joined by tom waldron, global brand president of wrangler; and chris waldeck, global brand president of lee. following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. we anticipate the call will last about an hour.
with that, i turn it over to ceo, scott baxter.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
thanks, eric, and thank you all for joining us today. on behalf of kontoor, i hope you and your families continue to be healthy and safe. as eric mentioned, our global brand presidents, tom waldron and chris waldeck will be joining us for this year-end review. we believe these year-end calls provide a great opportunity to have them share insights from the past year, as well as go-forward strategies for each of their respective brands. you'll hear more from each of them in a bit. we are pleased to share our fourth quarter and full year results with you today, results that came in ahead of our expectations, driven by broad based improving performance across the business.
let me start by thanking our colleagues around the world, as the strong fourth quarter results and momentum we are seeing into 2021 are a direct reflection of our teams tremendous efforts over the last year. the resiliency, agility and focus on execution during these unprecedented times has been truly inspirational. like most companies, during 2020, we experienced challenges never seen before as the impacts of covid-19 were far reached. however, we were nimble, and we quickly focused on supporting the safety and well-being of our associates. we're also strengthening our financial and liquidity positions. and as important, we've been flexible in evolving our strategies and in fact, amplified many of these proactive initiatives to not only help navigate the near-term environment, but also set the foundation for long-term success.
recall, at the time of the spin, we defined horizon 1 as the first 12 to 24 months as our own independent company. during this time, our focus has centered on stabilizing and optimizing our model through restructuring and quality of sales initiatives to bolster margins, while driving tsr-accretive actions from our significant cash generation. welton will take you through more detail on these measures later. but these efforts have helped derisk our model and where the exact right thing to do in setting the stage for healthier, sustainable long-term growth. even with the challenges from the pandemic, the strategies we've implemented and the investments we've been making have allowed us to end 2020 with great momentum. these strategies are clear. first, enhance and accelerate the core through share gains and expanding the marketplace within us wholesale. second, transform our d2c in digital ecosystem in driving channel expansion. third, expand geographically with a focus on china. and fourth, broaden our reach into new categories in usage occasions, emphasizing outdoor, t-shirts and workwear.
despite the pandemic, in support of realizing these strategic growth opportunities, we've been laser-focused on ramping investments behind key enablers. these include amplifying demand creation and marketing spend, elevating innovation platforms, including becoming an industry leader in sustainability, driving further competitive separation with our best-in-class supply chain, unlocking efficiency and productivity gains through the implementation of our global erp and digital infrastructure, yielding enhanced consumer insights in building data analytics capabilities and finally, identifying and cultivating world-class talent to create a high performance purpose-led culture. these are the investments and strategic priorities that will fuel our transition to horizon 2 catalyzing fundamental growth, greater cash flow optionality and the evolution of our tsr model over time. we will provide much greater detail on this next phase at our upcoming virtual investor day in may, but we're really excited to share what lies ahead with all kontoor stakeholders.
turning to our fourth quarter results, we saw strong fundamental improvement across all areas of the business with revenue, margins and cash flows coming in above expectations. overall, revenue sequentially improved in q4, increasing 1% on a reported basis compared with down 43% and 9% in the second and third quarters, respectively. importantly, we saw growth across both of our global brands and in the us, europe and china. the us business saw continued strength in the quarter led by wrangler in our digital business as well as the continued development of the lee brand in both premium and value channels. our digital transformation continues to be a bright spot, with an evolving platform that is driving elevated consumer engagement, traffic and aurs. we saw a really nice growth across the us own.com business, which was up 50% in q4. as well as the us digital wholesale that increased 75% in the quarter. as we think about the us landscape, i want to be clear. we are winning in the marketplace, taking share and adding incremental business as well. during 2020, according to npd, we added over 200 basis points of share with our core denim and casuals business. and importantly, these share gains are healthy with a balance of additional units and increasing aurs. our strategies are paying off with quality of sales, new innovation and design initiatives, helping support the mixing up of price across the business.
turning to select international markets, our europe and china businesses continued sequential improvement during q4 as expected, both inflecting positive in the quarter, with europe increasing 7% and china up 11% on a reported basis. given the increasing lock downs in the region, we do expect volatility in europe will continue, but new business development wins, particularly with our wrangler atg line as well as our recently announced lee licensing collaboration with h&m are examples that we remain on offense, positioning kontoor for long-term success in the region when conditions normalize. and certainly, china will continue to be a focus for our strategic investments, given the significant white space opportunity the region represents. at the risk of chris's thunder, we are already seeing great returns on our investments in the lee brand in the region, as our leadership position in denim was extended during 2020. and with respect to wrangler, we've been extremely pleased with our soft launch of the brand into the marketplace during q4. while we are in early days, we are really encouraged by the early reads and our broader launch in the region remains on track for the spring.
i'll let rustin take you through greater detail in a bit, but i'd be remiss if i didn't highlight kontoor's solid financial position. we announced today the proactive early termination of the covenant relief period in our amended credit facility, a testament to our improving fundamentals and robust cash generation. our board of directors also declared quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share in q4, a first quarter in which we could reinstate under the amended credit facility. and despite the pandemic, we've been aggressively de-levering our balance sheet over the past several quarters. and that continued in q4 as we paid down an incremental $125 million in debt, taking our net leverage ratio to under 3 times to end 2020. our improving fundamentals, coupled with increasing cash flow optionality, affords a powerful combination as we position the kontoor model to transition into horizon 2.
before i turn it over to tom and chris, let me close with this. we win together, and i couldn't be prouder of our teams' efforts to manage through this highly dynamic environment. we ended the year strong and while macro conditions remain uncertain, i'm confident that we are executing on our strategic playbook, investing in key growth enablers such as demand creation and setting the stage for an exciting next phase of the journey. that should continue to unlock great value for all kontoor stakeholders.
tom?
tom waldron -- executive vice president, global brand president-wrangler
thanks, scott, and good day, everyone. as scott mentioned, while the past year has brought significant challenges with impacts from the pandemic, the wrangler brand is better positioned now than it's ever been, greatly benefiting from focused investments in people, product and processes. and as proud as i am of our teams' incredible efforts in 2020, i'm even more excited about the great momentum the wrangler brand has going into 2021 and beyond.
so i'd like to take you first through some highlights of the year and the quarter and then i'll provide some insights on a few key areas, where prioritized investments have and should continue to yield more sustained profitable growth for the brand. wrangler saw accelerating trends throughout the year, with global revenues inflecting positive increasing 7% in the fourth quarter. we experienced balanced strength across the globe with both us and european businesses increasing 8% on a reported basis in the quarter.
in the us, our wholesale business has increasingly benefited from our optimized distribution strategy. our partnerships with best-in-class retailers, such as walmart, amazon and target have strengthened during the pandemic, as we saw increased share gains in our core denim business throughout the year, including substantial market share outperformance during the fourth quarter as measured by npd. these share gains are highly correlated to the strategic investments we are making across design, innovation and demand creation.
we are also seeing the increased roi in our western and work businesses, both of which sequentially improved throughout the year and in q4, particularly strong. given that western business is truly the most authentic expression and ethos of the wrangler brand, this performance is really great to see. and we augmented this improving us core and elevated wholesale distribution including nordstrom and free people. these premium price points of distribution coupled with focused demand creation spend such as our pop-up store in fort worth during the wrangler national finals rodeo championship in december provided a nice halo that cascades back to the core.
further elevating our distribution strategy, wrangler.com continued its evolution during the past year, as our us own.com increased 57% during the fourth quarter, driven by strong traffic and increasing aob. and more exciting, our digital business is expected to accelerate growth in the future as investments in both front-end commerce and back-end infrastructure are helping transform our digital ecosystem from transactional to a more consumer-led seamless experience. investments in digital demand creation across our own.com and social media platforms as well as successful collaborations with stranger things and rick and morty have allowed the wrangler brand to reach new younger consumers like never before. and while still in the early stages, digital will increasingly become our pinnacle expression, a brand-enhancing vehicle that is also margin accretive.
in europe, we had a successful launch of our outdoor wrangler atg line in dressmann, which combined with the debut of retailer cubist this spring, extend distribution of the collection to more than 700 doors across the region. sell-throughs of atg, now a men's and women's line has been really solid, exceeding our expectations. our outdoor business within the us was up 73% on a reported basis during the quarter.
let me unpack atg and more broadly our focus on outdoor a bit more. this category is a great representation of how investments and innovation that play to a growing macro consumer trend fuel incremental growth across categories and extended distribution into new channels. we know the category is accelerating as more people want to be outdoors, and we are leaning into this trend in building high performance product at a great value. this serves to not only diversify and augment our core denim business, but affords the opportunities to open new channel distribution, particularly in the outdoor specialty and sporting goods. we look forward to giving more specifics on the outdoor strategy at our upcoming investor day, but wrangler outdoor has tremendous growth opportunities ahead.
and last, but not certainly least, let me discuss our launch of wrangler brand in china. as you know, given the pandemic, we chose to begin to see product into the market last year with a soft launch on tmall. and while early, the findings are extremely encouraging. across all kbi metrics, the rollout is exceeding our expectations. we are on track to more broadly launch in the region this spring, supported by enhanced marketing initiatives and live streaming events with high value influencers. as we stated previously, we will be measured in our approach to scaling in the china market, but needless to say, the team couldn't be more excited to build on early momentum and similar to outdoor, i'm eager to share even more details on our longer-term strategy at our investor day.
i want to reiterate our confidence in wrangler's position as we begin 2021 and importantly, thank the entire global team for their collaborative efforts over the last year. combined with the increasing strategic investment that we have been making since the spin, we are confident that the actions we are taking will fuel future accelerated growth for the wrangler brand, growth that will be more sustainable and profitable over the long term.
with that, i turn it over to chris to take you through lee.

thank you, tom. let me also convey my appreciation to all of you for joining us today. similar to tom, i'm thrilled with what the lee brand accomplished in 2020, and i'm even more excited as we turn the page into 2021. these achievements over the last year were significant and my sincere thanks to the team for not just weathering the storm, but the great execution on our strategies, including brand elevating initiatives, material new business development wins and perhaps most important, delivering substantial profitability gains for the business.
first, i will walk you through some of the key takeaways from 2020 in the fourth quarter and then i will hit on the many exciting opportunities that lie ahead for lee. as most of you know, since the spin, one of our points of focus has been repositioning lee for healthy long-term growth. and the covid pandemic has only validated our strategy. given lee's historic exposure to more challenged points of distribution within the us and select international markets, one of the biggest investments we've made has been within our quality of sales initiatives. during last year, we accelerated this quality of sales measures, which impacted near term topline, but will support sustained tsr-accretive growth. this is a game-changing cultural shift relative to how the lee business was historically run.
a great proof point, this was the brand's seventh consecutive quarter of adjusted gross margin expansion in our largest market. while we have prioritized profitability and brand health, let me be clear we have remained on offense, investments in innovation and design, demand creation and new business development are delivering significant opportunities across categories, channels and geographies. overall, revenue increased 1% on a reported basis in the fourth quarter. revenue in the us was relatively flat on a reported basis with a focus on quality of sales, while we achieved sequential improvement in our china and europe business, which increased 11% and 5%, respectively, during the quarter on a reported basis. diving further into the us business, one more temporary non-strategic headwinds impacted the quarter. we are really encouraged by the gains within structural areas of the business. according to npd, during the fourth quarter, the lee brand realized strong share gains across both men's and women's categories in the us.
let me now turn to new program wins. consistent with our tsr lens, we continue to develop new distribution opportunities with a focus on select, premium and value channels. as you know, we launched the lee master brand with walmart in q3, and i'm excited to share that its in-store point of sale became fully set. we saw a strong correlation with sell-through and these trends have only accelerated as we start the new year, a testament to how our investments in demand creation are paying off. this is just the beginning as we look to expand the program into new categories and doors over time.
additionally, we added premium points of distribution, such as the anthropologie nordstrom and free people. when we invest in design, innovation and demand creation, the lee brand has increasing permission to play in these elevated channels. to further highlight new business development wins during the fourth quarter, we announced a significant new licensing collaboration with h&m, with focus on iconic legendary looks bolstered by the brand's sustainability platform for a world that works. this partnership brings to lee brand to over 1,000 doors across 61 countries, reaching a new and younger consumer.
additional powerful collaborations with [indecipherable], appharvest and alife provide perspective that we are clearly investing in elevated demand creation platforms that will continue to transform the lee brand. we are only scratching the surface on our long-term opportunity. rest assured, our pipeline is robust. and we're going to share more detail at the investor day in a few months. another important element of lee's evolution is our increasing efforts on transforming our digital platforms. globally, on a reported basis, our lee.com business increased 28% in the fourth quarter, while digital wholesale increased 32%. we will continue to distort investments in digital capabilities to drive further brand elevation and our closer connection with our consumer.
finally, let me touch on our business in china. as i mentioned, we saw solid growth in the region during the quarter. but more importantly, as scott discussed, we believe the lee brand extended its overall leading denim share position in the quarter, outpacing the overall market and our next closest competitor. and the momentum continues as we start the year. china will remain a focus for strategic investment with a spotlight on highly successful partnerships with key influencers such as eddie peng and our stand tall campaign. this campaign generated 340 million views on our social media platforms during the quarter. our investment in these demand creation efforts are expected to support further share increases in existing channels and measured expansion into tier 4 and 5 cities and further diversification of our digital platforms. there will be more to come on the building blocks of our growth plans for this region at the upcoming investor day.
let me summarize by thanking my colleagues throughout the lee team for the amazing work done over the past year. in the face of incredibly difficult macro conditions, we didn't just persevere. we were able to deliver outstanding profitability improvements and market share gains, all while keeping our foot on the gas pedal driving new incremental growth aligned with our tsr-accretive principles. the future is bright for the lee brand, and we really look forward to sharing this transformation with all ktb stakeholders.
rustin?
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, chris, and good day, everyone.
hopefully, we've come through loud and clear with the teams' remarks so far, but let me reiterate despite a highly dynamic environment, solid execution of strategic initiatives is yielding improving fundamentals as evidenced by our fourth quarter results. we've consistently stated the sequencing of our story matters with the focus in the first few years post spin on the optimization of the model. and even with the global pandemic, i'm proud to say we have done just that. i am confident we are entering 2021 as a stronger, more profitable company.
for the balance of the call, i will touch on a few key areas. first, i will discuss how the actions we've taken over the last 12 months have fundamentally improved our operating model and positions kontoor for success going forward. next, i will speak to how enhanced profitability supports investments to catalyze an accelerating topline. and finally, i will close with highlights of our fourth quarter results and outlook for fiscal 2021.
as we've discussed since the spin, a core focus during horizon 1 is making the strategic investments and business model changes that will set the foundation for longer-term sustainable tsr-accretive growth. this included quality of sales initiatives, global erp and digital investments, efficiency and cost savings efforts and deleveraging the balance sheet. together, these actions have driven meaningful improvement in our underlying fundamentals.
let's discuss a few of these items in more detail, starting with our it investments. progress on the strategic erp implementation continues as planned. following our successful go-live in asia during the third quarter, we remain on track for the remaining regional implementations in 2021. as you would expect, there will be some timing shifts on quarterly cadence associated with the rollout across the us region in early q2. we continue to see meaningful efficiency opportunities that will drive tangible improvements to our cost structure and reduce non-strategic spin, providing fuel for investments in areas like demand creation, digital and international. we also amplified actions in the fourth quarter to optimize our distribution, including strategic initiatives within our us outlet and india businesses. recall over the past three quarters, we discussed the strategic evaluation of our vf outlet operations in the united states. we have now completed this work and taken appropriate action.
before detailing the actions, let's level set where we were. entering 2020, we operated approximately 80 doors in our us retail fleet, of which over 80% were branded vf outlet. rightly under half of the sales in these stores were dilutive, non-kontoor branded goods with the balance primarily being distressed lee and wrangler products. following our strategic review, we opted to close 38 vf outlet doors and convert approximately 15 doors to our lee wrangler formats. over 75% of the door closures were lease expirations that were not renewed, and we will continue to evaluate and optimize the fleet as leases expire. importantly, these actions will first provide an improved consumer experience with greater in-store presentation for lee and wrangler products. second, support overall profitability, including accretion to our operating margin in the first year. third, right size the fleet and establish a healthier foundation for our evolving d2c strategy, something you will hear more about at our upcoming investor day. and finally, this allows us to brand all stores lee and wrangler.
and in india, we began rationalizing select points of distribution prior to covid and took action recently to proactively revise our approach to better position our brands in the changing marketplace. accordingly, we are entering a partnership to convert the business to a licensing model. this will provide a number of distinct benefits for our brands in the region, including an enhanced consumer experience aided by greater investment in our brands, omni-channel capabilities for the first time in the market across both digital and brick and mortar stores and a more sustainable and profitable business model with accretion to our operating margin expected in the first year. the impact of these strategic actions are included in our full year outlook that i will cover shortly. and at this time, we do not foresee any additional business model changes in any of our major commercial markets.
another critical area of focus has been our steadfast commitment to delevering the balance sheet and improving our overall capital position. this remains an essential element as we transition from horizon 1 to horizon 2 in 2021, unlocking greater optionality. based on another quarter of strong cash generation, we made a $125 million in discretionary debt repayments in q4, while improving our overall net debt position to $665 million. and debt reduction remains a focus in 2021. in fact, we have repaid an additional $75 million thus far in the first quarter. as scott discussed, based on our improving fundamentals, we announced the early termination of the covenant release period in the amended credit facility. this action will help reduce interest expense in 2021 and has been contemplated in our outlook i will provide shortly.
next, let me touch on the progress we have made improving overall profitability. adjusted gross margin increased 230 basis points during the fourth quarter. the increase continues to be supported by the structural drivers we discussed last quarter, and it is really important to note that we are in the early innings of these gross margin improvements, as structural enhancements remain ahead. the combination of quality of sales actions, supply chain initiatives, mix shifts to both digital and international and leveraging our own manufacturing base will result in sustainably higher gross margins over time. this allows us to pivot from horizon 1 to horizon 2 this year on offense, providing increased yield to invest behind the key enablers that will create a virtuous cycle of growth. as our outlook implies, you can expect to see us amplify our demand creation, enhance innovation and further distort investments into accretive channels such as digital and china all leading to a more sustained top line algorithm. we will discuss in more detail during our upcoming investor day.
now let's get to our fourth quarter review. i encourage you to refer to this morning's release for additional detail as i will focus my comments on key highlights. global revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and was flat in constant currency compared to the same quarter in 2019. revenue gains during the quarter were primarily the result of strength in us wholesale, digital wholesale and own.com partially offset by impacts from covid as well as the previously mentioned vf outlet actions.
on a regional basis for the quarter, us revenues increased 1% compared to the same quarter in 2019. international revenues increased 4% on a reported basis, driven by continued sequential improvement in china and europe, partially offset by ongoing impacts from covid and the business model change in india. on a constant currency basis, international revenues were flat.
turning to our brands, global revenue of our wrangler brand increased 7% on a reported and constant currency basis compared to the same quarter in 2019. wrangler us revenue increased 8%, led by strength in our digital wholesale, atg, western and workwear businesses. additionally, our us own.com business increased 57% and us digital wholesale increased 87%. wrangler international revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and 1% in constant currency. covid-related impacts, particularly in europe, weighed on performance. however, this was more than offset by new program wins, including the launch of atg at dressmann and stream in digital wholesale.
lee brand global revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and was flat in constant currency. lee us revenue was flat, driven by new business development wins, as well as continued strength in digital wholesale and 36% growth in own.com. these increases were primarily offset by covid-related headwinds. lee international revenue increased 3% on a reported basis, driven by china growth of 11%. on a constant currency basis, lee international revenue was flat. ongoing headwinds from covid particularly in europe continue to weigh on results. and finally from a channel perspective, we saw broad-based improving performance during the quarter. on a reported basis, us wholesale increased 4%, european wholesale grew 15% and global own.com increased 37% compared to the same quarter in 2019.
now on to gross margin. as i mentioned earlier, adjusted gross margin increased 230 basis points to 43.2%. we see ongoing gross margin tailwinds continuing in 2021, which i will touch on momentarily. adjusted sg&a increased $5 million on a year-over-year basis to $187 million. as we indicated last quarter, we distorted spending in demand creation, which was up 16% compared to the prior year. growth in sg&a was also driven by investments in the business in support of our digital initiatives. adjusted earnings per share was $1.23 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.97 in the prior year.
now turning to our balance sheet. fourth quarter inventories decreased $117 million versus the prior year to $341 million or down 26%. the year-over-year decline reflects tight inventory controls, as well as the vf outlet actions mentioned earlier. we finished the fourth quarter with $248 million in cash and net debt of $665 million, our best net debt and liquidity position since the spin.
and now on to our outlook. as you know, prior to covid, our practice was to provide guidance on an annual basis, and we are moving back to that approach for our fiscal 2021 outlook. however, given macroeconomic uncertainty associated with the pandemic, i will share some perspective on quarterly cadence. similar to our q4 review, i refer to our release this morning for more detail, and i will focus my comments on key items.
first, revenue is expected to increase in the low-double digit range over 2020 levels, including a mid-single digit impact from the strategic actions with vf outlet in india discussed earlier. adjusted gross margin is expected to increase 150 to 200 basis points, driven by the previously discussed structural benefits to the model. adjusted eps is expected to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.60, including the accretive impacts of actions taken with the vf outlet in india businesses.
as it relates to quarterly color, i'll share a few additional points. as you know, during q4, we amplified demand creation that enhanced holiday 2020 and continues to yield consumer demand benefits in the early 2021. this top line strength combined with anticipated significant margin improvement compared to the first quarter of 2020 is driving strong first quarter momentum. as i mentioned previously, our us erp go live is planned for early in the second quarter. and as you would expect, we anticipate some order pattern timing shifts around the transition, somewhat tempering q2 revenue growth rates and corresponding profitability, while aiding the first and third quarters.
finally, from an eps perspective, we expect second half earnings on a dollar basis to be modestly above the first half of the year due to covid recovery and the natural seasonality of the business. and lastly, i would like to remind everyone of our investor day scheduled for monday, may 24, which will be held virtually. we look forward to sharing more on many of the topics we discussed today, as well as our go-forward strategies for driving greater shareholder value.
this concludes our prepared remarks, and i will now turn the call back to our operator. operator?

and our first question is from the line of adrienne yih with barclays. please proceed with your question.
adrienne yih -- barclays -- analyst
yes. good morning. and let me congratulate you. we have made it to horizon 2 or growing sales. so congratulations. i know it's a hard list. so rustin, my first question is going to be for you. the prepared remarks were great and the detail we've been hearing disruption on kind of port congestion, etc. and i know that your dcs are primarily on the east coast. so i'm just wondering if you can talk to us about the inventory being down 26%, you seem very comfortable with that. obviously, i'm assuming that most of the stuff is coming to the year on east cost. so if you talk to us a little bit about that? tom, if you can talk to us about the wrangler launch in china, specifically the brand positioning, the brand awareness and then kind of the digital aspect of that. and then finally for chris, if you can talk to us also about the investments in lee product design and development and what that has borne out in 2020? thank you so much. scott, i'm giving you a rest today.
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks adrienne, it's rustin. good morning. appreciate the questions. i will answer your questions around port congestion and inventory and then turn it over to tom about the wrangler launch in china. certainly as we think about port congestions, we're not immune to the challenges that are taking place in the operating environment, whether that port congestions, higher freight rates or labor shortages and rest assured, we are aggressively working to minimize those impacts, including intentional port diversification. as you're well aware, adrienne, certainly select ports primarily on the west coast with la and long beach are more impacted than other ports. and as you talked a little bit about, we really believe our diversified supply chain of forward benefits for us as we manage through this time with approximately a third of our production in this hemisphere and two-thirds of our source production coming from 225 facilities and over 20 countries around the world, we can be a little more creative, i'll say, in navigating some of the challenges. our outlook has considered kind of prolonged headwinds through the better part of 2021 based on some of these measures, but we're continuing to work our way through that. as it relates to inventory, you talked a little bit about being down 26% in the fourth quarter. this has been a focal point for us since the spin. second quarter of this year, we were 20%, the third quarter we were down 21%, we were down 26% in the fourth quarter, but that also takes into consideration the model changes that we made at vfo. so if you exclude the vf outlet stores and really the discontinuation of the third party goods, were down more like 20%, which is really in line with prior quarters. we continue to manage this, we feel good about the quality of the inventory heading into 2021. yes, it's clean and we really believe the levels are appropriate given the uncertainty, but also support the momentum we're seeing in 2021. we continue to work closer than ever with our customers to align those supply and demand signals to maximize the insights and certainly, leveraging our diversified supply chain that i talked about earlier to minimize those port and logistic disruptions. so that's a little bit around inventory. and with that, i'll turn it over to tom to talk about wrangler in china.
tom waldron -- executive vice president, global brand president-wrangler
yes. hi adrienne, really excited about the soft launch in china. it went very well exceeded all our kpi expectations. we will have a more robust full launch on track for this spring, when the consumer environment will be healthier. we will be measured, test and learn with this initiative. but what i'm really excited about is the team on the ground, they've been driving the china brand for well over 20 years. they understand how to emotionally connect with the chinese consumer and certainly they couldn't be more excited about the wrangler brand going after. you talk about the brand positioning, it's younger, it's male, female fashion oriented. so really excited about this initiative.
chris waldeck -- executive vice president, global brand president-lee
and adrienne, it's chris. thank you for the question. you're right, it's really all about product and delivering that consumer world-class product, and we have made significant investments on the lee side and the wrangler side around product design, innovation. and when we look at this, we talked internally about style crafted with purpose. and we think about that is that elevated styling, leveraging innovation so we can deliver the consumer exceptional fit, comfort, quality, but again at that style portion that they truly need. so we're excited about the investments we've made, we're seeing that come through in our sell-through right now. it's at walmart, if it's our partnership with h&m and the share that we're gaining over in china. so we're excited about these investments, more to come with that is we get into it though. thank you for the question.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of bob drbul with guggenheim securities.
bob drbul -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
good morning. a couple of questions, the first one is, can you elaborate a little bit more just on the wrangler strength and the lee deceleration in the us, really sort of how you think that's playing out and sort of where we are going in next few quarters with both of those brands specifically here in the us? and then the second question is, rustin, if you could spend maybe as you look at the year, the gross margin expectations are pretty healthy. i was just wondering if you might be able to just walk us through a little bit more quarterly expectations throughout the year that would be helpful. thanks.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
hey bob, how are you. it's scott. i'll go ahead and start and then tom and chris will help me out, but we're really pleased with the arc of the wrangler and lee brands. as you know, for many years under invested in, but i think what you're seeing now in the marketplace is just the investment in the brand and the consumer response. one of the most significant pieces of that is that we're building in designing really good properties. so our consumer is loving what we're doing. and now you're seeing us go ahead and get to a better position financially, which we've talked a lot about. we talked a lot about capital allocation. we talked a lot about investing back in these brands at the appropriate levels because they've been under-invested in. and what we're seeing is we're seeing an acceptance in the broad global marketplace relative to the brands around categories, channels, geographies in both brands are able to go up and down the value scale. so we really like what we're seeing and i think one of the things that i think you can measure, which is really important and i think tom and chris both have a comment is that we're fielding a lot of incoming calls about people that want to do collaborations with our brands and with our people because they're seeing in the marketplace the strength of these two brands globally. tom? chris?
tom waldron -- executive vice president, global brand president-wrangler
yes. thanks, super excited about the momentum wrangler is hitting on all cylinders right now. it's a combination of really great product, fueled by design and innovation and then really great storytelling. we mentioned rick and morty, we mentioned stranger things, making sure that we're connecting with younger consumers and that's just pulling through from a consumer demand standpoint. and as scott mentioned, we're able to invest behind the brand like we never had before. so really excited about wrangler trajectory. i'll hand of to chris.
chris waldeck -- executive vice president, global brand president-lee
hey bob, it's chris. horizon 1 for lee was really all about focusing on a cultural shift and i talked about that in my remarks. and we really brought that to life and focused on tsr-accretive growth for the lee brand. and we've set ourselves up nicely for that. we're starting to see that come through seven consecutive quarters of sequential margin expansion in our biggest market. so we feel good about how we're positioned. and as scott said, our investment behind design and innovation are starting to really come through for us. so we're excited about what the future holds and look forward to talk to you more during our investor day.
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and bob, it's rustin. good morning, thanks for joining. let me provide a little more kind of shaping around the quarters, i know that's certainly top of mind as you're looking to build your model for the year. although i won't provide specific quarterly guidance, given the macroeconomic uncertainty, let me just give a little bit of additional color as you're thinking about it. so as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we really see strong top line momentum coming into the first quarter, supported by that amplified demand creation investments we made during q4. actually, we would anticipate q2 growth rates to accelerate sequentially. certainly, the q2 of 2019 was most impacted by covid as you're well aware, and we would expect those q2 growth rate, again, actually ahead of the q1 growth rates. we would, however, just remind you, bob, as you're thinking about this q2 as typically our lowest volume quarter and with the us erp planned in the second quarter, that certainly will have some implications as well as we talked about. so we really view kind of the top line growth rates as a bit more balanced both on a one-year and two-year stack basis, and so that is kind of how we're thinking about the top line. as we think about gross margin, certainly, we're pleased with the progress we've seen over the last two quarters, gross margins have topped 43% both in q3 and q4, up 230 and 240 basis points. so we're pleased with the progress we've seen, again, confidence in talking about that expansion of 150 to 200 basis points off of that 41.2% we delivered on an adjusted basis in 2020. so as you think a little bit about the cadence of profitability, bob, in earnings, again, i would expect strong momentum into q1. and as you would expect, the erp go live is going to cause some timing shifts, helping q1 even more, as well as q3, while tampering q2 a bit more again on our lowest volume quarter. so as we said to in the prepared remarks, given the typical seasonality and some of these timing shifts, we would expect the eps on a dollar basis to be modestly higher in the second half of the year. so hopefully that provides a little more color, bob, as you're thinking about constructing the models. thanks for the question.

our next question is from the line of erinn murphy with piper sandler. please proceed with your questions.
erinn murphy -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thanks, good morning. i guess our first question is just on the lee and h&m partnership. i was curious if you could speak to if the shelf space gains you're capturing right now is that temporary, is it more permanent? and then just bigger picture, scott, for you, as you think about being a leader in sustainability. can you talk about how you're prioritizing some of your consumer-facing efforts, whether it's the recycled denim partnership with h&m waterless dyeing, sustainability sourced cotton etc. just curious on that.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
why don't i go ahead and start, and i'll handle the sustainability piece. thanks for the questions, erinn, let me turn it over to chris. we're really proud of our efforts in sustainability. we published year two of our company so early on in our history, our first ever sustainability report early on. so i'd encourage everyone to go out on our website and take a look at that. i think it's a really, really good piece. but we are focused on three pillars and that's people, product and planet. and those are the key pillars that we're going to focus on going forward, and we're going to be, we have stated and we're very serious about that being a leader in sustainability going forward. so i can give you a couple of examples from a product standpoint or a planet standpoint. we've got to goal by the year of 2025 to save 10 billion liters of water and also a goal by 2025 to have all of our operating facilities using renewable energy. but we take all components in all pieces of the value chain within sustainability very serious. so look for more from us, you mentioned our prom dining process, a very important part of our water savings initiatives, but we'll be much more going forward. thanks for the question. chris?
chris waldeck -- executive vice president, global brand president-lee
yes. hey erinn, it's chris. what's interesting about the h&m partnership and you talked about sustainability was really all based around sustainability and lee's platform for world that works. and your question about is this a one-time thing with h&m, this is a collaboration. so by definition, it is one time from that standpoint. what i will say is that we really had a great partnership with h&m, and we're really encouraged by that. our teams are albeit had to do everything virtually because of covid really got along well. so i think there is a high likelihood that will be the additional partnerships between kontoor brands if it's lee, and/or wrangler, but then also with other vertical retailers as we think about the different opportunities out there.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of sam poser with susquehanna. please proceed with your question.
sam poser -- susquehanna -- analyst
very interesting, but thank you. just a quick one on the impact of india, where that comes from and did any of that impact the fourth quarter or is that going to flow through? i mean i would assume that it's going to impact lee more -- well, india is going to impact lee, but can you give us sort of -- can you spell it out and flow it for us a little bit?
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. sam, it's rustin. good morning. i'll go ahead and take that. appreciate the question. certainly as we think about the india market, we do have both brands there it is wrangler and lee. and as we talked about sort of on our outlook for 2021, we said a low-double digit top line growth for kontoor, including a mid-single digit impact from both the vfo actions that we took this morning as well as india, sam. so while i won't get into sort of the specific impacts of each of those. i will sort of emphasize for you that we do expect both to be accretive for us from a margin perspective in that first year and importantly, we're really confident these are the right things to do from a brand perspective. it is really aligned to our tsr-focused approach. so hopefully that helps understand things in terms of the q4 impact, as we talked about, will be transitioning to that new model in the first quarter. so certainly there were some q4 impact associated with those actions in advance of moving from a direct to a license model.
sam poser -- susquehanna -- analyst
right. so let me reask the question. with an absolute revenue dollars, can you give us -- or as a percent of that 5%, how much is coming out of the vf outlets and how much of it's coming out of india? can you give us some idea? i understand the profitability situation. i'm just trying to be able to run the model to be able to just to break it out properly or how much of the revenue are you eliminating from vf outlet with the store closures? i assume those stores that you're closing are great stores to begin with.
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. what i would say, sam, again, we won't break it out, but it is collectively a mid-single digit impact from both vfo and india. the vfo piece certainly has two components to it. it's not only the 38 door closures that we talked about in the quarter, but it's also the discontinuation of the third-party goods that are sold through that chain. and again, those were a little less than half of the overall sales in the chain. so that's a little bit more color on the breakout.
operator
our next question is from the line of jay sole with ubs. please proceed with your question.
jay sole -- ubs -- analyst
great, thank you so much. i have three questions. one is on share gains, the other is on digital and third is on capital allocation. maybe first, it sounds like both brands saw nice share gains in us wholesale. can you just speak to what's driving this and who you're taking share from whether it's other brands or private label? and then secondly on digital. the digital growth in 4q seemed really strong. can you walk through the digital wholesale piece versus the company's own.com? and what inning are we in with respect to development of the company's own.com channel? and then lastly, it was another quarter significant debt pay down. i think you're now below 3 times leverage. i'm sure you will provide more detail at the investor day, but was curious about how you are thinking about the capital allocation strategy at this point? thank you.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
all right. so jay, we'll go ahead and kind of have that is four questions, and we're going to go ahead and give our views up a little bit. but let's go ahead and start with the share gains, and you're absolutely right. we are gaining share, both from a national branded and also private label. and we're driving that through our first quality goods. i think tom and chris both mentioned it. we are designing and building and this is a credit to our team, better product across the globe and also here in north america too and we're gaining share across the wholesale channels. and we really like where we stand right now with our core partnerships and the people that we do business with. so we're really excited about the future in all of our categories. from a digital standpoint, we've talked a lot about the investment that we've made there. but there's a couple of things that i think are really important here from a digital standpoint. we've been investing behind that, we've been investing in the platforms. you saw the gain that we had both on the own.com, we replatformed wrangler.com and lee.com. but i think the thing that's not talked about enough in these types of calls is the fact that you could have a really good platform which we do with higher than incredible team, but we are now starting to put really exceptional product on the sites and we're seeing that take out accelerate that is the critical components. so we put the whole team together, great team, great site, great product, really helping us go forward. so really pleased with that. in addition to that, our digital wholesale business is strong and getting stronger. again, it goes back to our partnerships that we have with the winning retailers goes back to great product. so really pleased with that, looking forward to the future there. i will tell you this, if you want to talk about what inning it is, i would tell you it's very, very early stages. and the reason i say that is that we came out of the gate from a spend standpoint really at ground zero. no investment in our platform, very few people that were asked to do a lot too much actually until we got a team built around them, a lot of things have happened from an investment standpoint globally in our dot-coms and our own.com and those are just now starting to pay off, and i think that we're really starting to learn what the consumer wants there and what advertising in a significant way digitally and it's hitting specifically from a consumer standpoint. before i hit capital allocation. i'll just ask if anybody has a comment from tom or chris or rustin on digital?
chris waldeck -- executive vice president, global brand president-lee
i think the only thing. jay, this is chris. the only thing i'd add and there is, this is also happening outside of the us. it's happening for us in china, and we're really seeing acceleration around our digital platforms in china and leveraging those key influencers, i talked about 340 million views on our social media platforms in the quarter, that's driving us to new consumers, younger consumers and it's helping us capture share.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & board member
so let me go ahead. i'm going to start on capital allocation. then i'll flip it over to rustin for any comments, but as we talked before multiple times about the fact that we really liked our position coming into horizon 2 relative to we can go ahead, we can increase our dividend, we can pay down additional debt, we can invest more in these brands and we're seeing the response out in the marketplace when we do invest in these brands and we can also embark on m&a activity, if we choose. so having the ability to have all those options and decide what's best for our stakeholders over time, puts us in an enviable position. and we look forward to talking about these things in our upcoming investor day. rustin, anything to add?
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. i would just highlight, jay, that we have been on an aggressive debt paydown piece. we paid $300 million in discretionary payments the last three quarters. i talked a little bit about $75 million paid in the first quarter as well. so that will continue to be a focal point for us as we're sort of exiting out of horizon 1 and transitioning into horizon 2, as scott talked a little bit about. the net leverage ratio is less than 3 times, growth is a little north of that still. so again, will continue to be a focal point for us, but really like the optionality as we head into horizon 2 that scott talked about.
operator
thank you. at this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. and i will turn the call back to scott baxter to make closing remarks.

scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
thanks, eric, and thank you, all, for joining us. let me state at the outset, we will intentionally keep our prepared comments a bit tighter today, as we look forward to articulating greater detail on our revolving strategies with you at our upcoming investor day in a few weeks on may 24. but today, we are really pleased to share our first quarter results, results that continue to accelerate across nearly all areas of our business. our performance in the quarter demonstrates how the powerful combination of strategic investments and solid execution come together to yield improving fundamentals and we think this quarter provides a greater example of the opportunity ahead as we are just getting started. as always, as i'm going to start by thanking our global team with a special call out to those colleagues working on our erp implementation. it is this dedication to excellence by our employees around the world that is at the core of this quarter's strong performance. and it's why i'm so confident in kontoor's future. we have much more work to be done and we will remain humble and focused on areas within our control, but i know our colleagues are committed to delivering on our strategic plan. over the last two years we have consistently communicated the following strategy to drive more profitable and sustained growth over the longer term. first, enhance and accelerate our core u.s. wholesale business.
second, elevate our direct connection with consumers through channel expansion, focused on evolving our b2c and digital ecosystem. third, thoughtfully extend our reach around the globe, prioritizing opportunities within the china region. and fourth, diversify our product mix through category extensions, amplifying outdoor, workwear and t-shirts. and in support of these long-term growth opportunities we have also discussed where we are distorting tsr accretive investments and enablers, including elevating and prioritizing the highest roi demand creation platforms, scaling product and manufacturing innovation with the sustainability and esg threat throughout [phonetic], unlocking productivity through the implementation of our global erp and digital infrastructure to generate improved data analytics and consumer insights. and, finally, developing world-class talent to build a high-performance, purpose-led and increasingly growth minded culture. let me now share some of the highlights from the first quarter that provide great proof-points of how these strategies and investments are paying off. overall reported revenue increased 29% over the first quarter of last year. it is important to note that even with timing of shipments to have our regional erp implementation, we saw significant top-line upside to our internal expectations.
i would also point out that compared to the first quarter of 2019, we experienced 3% growth. and this growth would have been even greater, excluding quality of sales and strategic exits we've made over this time period. so a great sign of our business not only normalizing, but accelerating on a two-year basis. our u.s. business continues to see strengthening trends, with both lee and wrangler up compared to last year. and importantly, compared to 2019, as well, we saw strength across both the u.s. wholesale and digital channels. while fiscal stimulus has certainly contributed to increases in domestic consumer spending, our brands are absolutely benefiting from investments across marketing, product innovation, and design, all of which are allowing us to take share and drive higher aurs in the marketplace. according to npd, the wrangler and lee brands continued to see strong share gains, another quarter of outpacing the market. it's pretty straightforward, our investments are working. within demand creation, wrangler introduced georgia may jagger as the face of its women's heritage denim collection, allowing us to reach a younger female consumer and driving significant brand heat that cascades from premium to value. and at lee, a heightened emphasis on social media channels, as well as collaborations with high profile influencers are driving gains across engagement, traffic and conversion.
if you haven't seen the recent instyle shoot on instagram, featuring jennifer lopez wearing newly designed lee products, i will encourage you to take a look. and i would add, this was organic, what an incredible statement and brand elevating moment for lee. we remain committed to amplifying our demand creation efforts, with a focus on the tsr bolstering areas and this includes digital. we continue to see strong returns on our investments in transforming our digital ecosystem. while q1 experienced great growth over 2020, more impressive were u.s. digital gains relative to 2019 with own.com increasing 70% and digital wholesale of 132%. given the accretive nature of this channel, financially and strategically, we will continue to distort investment dollars to drive elevated and sustained growth in digital. more details to come on the building blocks for this growth at our investor day in a few weeks. we also continue to invest in talent as well across global positions, including design and marketing. we are building a world-class team with an increasing focus on developing the growth-oriented organizational mindset. in addition, over the past few months, we have also welcomed two new members to our board of directors.
today, we announced the appointment of mark schiller, the president and ceo of the hain celestial group. and in march, we welcomed rob lynch, the president and ceo of papa john's, as we further build out our team in capabilities. both mark and rob will bring incredible experience and insights to our board. turning to our investments within innovation, our foot remains on the gas pedal. during the first quarter, we expanded one of our key sustainability platforms indigood to include additional water savings technologies. we also recently announced a collaboration with panda biotech to accelerate the commercialization and scale capabilities of hemp grown in the u.s., another proof-point of our commitment to be a leader in the sustainability and ensure responsibility sourcing all over the globe. momentum in our outdoor line atg is only increasing, taking the wrangler brand to additional channels and extending our reach to new consumers. elevated design within lee is also driving increasing permission for the brand to play in premium points of distribution. and we know enhanced innovation supports pricing and the mixing up of aurs, a critical component of brand health.
by now, i'm sure most of you've heard or read of the potential emergence of a denim cycle. we think about this a bit differently, as we realize cycles by definition are finite nature. so we are most focused on structural change, not cyclical trends. this speaks to the vary investments we are making in the brand, investments that not only allow us to participate in casualization or denim cycles, but actually drive them. so not only take share, but expand the marketplace. and we are doing just that in our core and within our largest market. and outside of the u.s., we continue to see improvement despite an uneven macro environment. europe revenue was down 5% on a constant currency basis. while we expect conditions to remain difficult in europe, the evolution of our digital platform and new business development programs should help somewhat mitigate near-term headwinds and position us for success in the region over the longer term. and in china, our ongoing strategic investments continue to yield accelerating results. with first quarter revenue same triple-digit increases in year-over-year, and 20% constant currency growth compared with 2019. with a premium lifestyle offering strong collaborations in partnerships with key local influencers, the lee brand continues to build on its leading denim position in the region.
and we are pleased to share that the wrangler launch in china has been very successful, exceeding our expectations today, building momentum throughout the quarter, and setting the foundation for scale growth over time. finally, let me provide an update on new business development. as we've discussed over the last several quarters, despite the challenging environment, we've remained on the offense to take our brands into new points of distribution driven by diversified incremental category extensions. our lee business with walmart continues to gain momentum with increased category offerings this spring in solid visibility to the fall order book. turning to our wrangler atg line within north america, we continue to build in the core mass channel, but also expand within a new channels such as outdoor specialty and sporting goods, scheels a premium sporting goods retailer is a perfect example of where the atg lines can take the wrangler brand, launching this spring and extending to additional stores this fall.
and finally, we are thrilled to announce today a new development in our wrangler workwear business, where we recently won a significant new program with a key domestic retail partner more to come on this and other exciting expansions. but this certainly represents a tremendous opportunity for the work business is a testament to how our investments support category extensions, channel diversification, and new business development wins. before i hand it over to rustin, let me close with this. over the last few years, we have strived to do what we say, deliver near-term results, while continuing to invest in the long-term, and we're doing just that. we couldn't be more excited to share greater details on our go-forward plans and evolving strategies at our investor day in a couple of weeks.
so we look forward to it and hope all of you can join us. rustin?
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, scott. and thank you all for joining us on today's call. as scott mentioned, we will keep our remarks brief and focus largely on the quarter due to the upcoming investor day on may 24. before the first quarter review, though, i wanted to provide an update on our recent erp implementation in north america, as i know it is a topic of interest. in addition, i want to briefly elaborate on how our strategic investments like technology are yielding improving fundamentals and enhanced optionality. as mentioned on our last earnings call, the second regional erp implementation was scheduled in north america are early in the second quarter. i'm very pleased to report that we have successfully gone live and are executing according to plan on our transition and ramp up activities. this is a significant accomplishment and milestone for kontoor. and we look forward to our final regional implementation scheduled for the second half of 2021.
technology initiatives like erp and digital are excellent examples of how we remain committed to making the necessary investments to drive long-term sustainable growth and efficiency improvements. these actions are enabling execution to enhance and accelerate our core u.s. wholesale business expand under-indexed accretive channels like digital, enhanced international penetration in key markets like china and extend our category reach with programs like outdoor, workwear, and t-shirts. investments are not only leading to improved fundamentals and profitability, but also continuing to enhance optionality. on the last earnings call in early march, we mentioned that we had already made $75 million in discretionary debt repayments in the first quarter. given performance, we made an additional incremental debt repayment of $25 million in the quarter to bring the total $100 million in the period. with these additional repayments and, in spite of significant headwinds from the pandemic over the past year, we have reduced net debt or long-term debt less cash by over $320 million since the first quarter of 2020, while remaining laser focused on investing and executing to deliver sustained long-term benefits.
with this progress on de-levering the balance sheet, we are excited about the enhanced optionality as we transition to horizon two. now, let's turn to our first quarter review, i will focus my comments on key highlights and encourage you to refer to this morning's release for additional detail on the quarter. also, given the impacts covid-19 had on prior year results, i will provide select references to the same quarter 2019 results for additional context. beginning with revenue, global revenue increased 29% on a reported basis and was up 27% in constant currency compared to the same quarter last year. revenue gains during the quarter were broad-based across segments, regions and channels. u.s. and international wholesale, digital wholesale and own.com all delivered strong results in the quarter. as expected and discussed on the fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, first quarter revenue benefited from a shift in the timing of shipments from the second quarter to the first quarter ahead of the company's north american erp implementation.
as scott mentioned, though, even with the timing of shipments ahead of our erp transition, we saw significant top-line upside to our internal expectations. strength in the first quarter revenue was partially offset by the impacts of the strategic actions announced at year-end to rationalize our u.s. outlet fleet and transition to a new licensed business model in india. combined, these actions represented approximately five points of headwind in the quarter. additionally, covid-19 continued to negatively impact results in select channels end markets, particularly in europe. compared to adjusted revenue in the first quarter of 2019, global revenue increased 3% on a reported basis. on a regional basis for the quarter, u.s. revenues increased 29% compared to the same quarter last year driven by wholesale, new business development wins and digital. strategic investments in our digital capabilities continue to yield strong returns. u.s. digital wholesale has increased 132% and own.com has increased 70% compared to the same quarter in 2019. even with ongoing investments and promising early returns, though, we remain under-indexed and will continue to prioritize investment in this important channel moving forward. international revenues increased 30% on a reported basis, and 21% in constant currency compared to the first quarter 2020.
improvement was driven by the strong china results on a one- and one-year stack basis that scott mentioned earlier. despite ongoing headwinds from covid-19 in many markets, european reported revenue increased 4% over prior year, led by digital, where digital wholesale increased 98% and own.com increased 39%.turning to our brands, global revenue of our wrangler brand increased 31% on a reported basis and 30% in constant currency compared to the same quarter in 2020. wrangler u.s. revenue increased 38% led by broad-based strength in our wholesale, digital, western and workwear businesses. the western business continued to deliver strong results with revenue increasing 54% in the quarter led by men's and women's bottoms. in addition, key programming initiatives and category extensions, including atg, the female heritage collection, and expanded distribution for workwear drove strong growth. wrangler, international revenue was flat on a reported basis and decreased 6% in constant currency. new business development wins with our atg program and digital growth in europe, offset the business model change in india and ongoing covid-related impacts.
compared to adjusted revenue for the same quarter in 2019, global wrangler reported revenue increased 10%. on a constant currency basis, wrangler reported revenue increased 7% compared to the same quarter in 2019. lee brand global revenue increased 37% on a reported basis and 33% in constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2020. in the u.s., lee revenue increased 28% driven by wholesale including new distribution wins and continued strength in digital wholesale and own.com, which increased 73% and 69% respectively in the period. broad-based across both genders and multiple categories led by denim and non-denim bottoms. lee international revenue increased 50% on a reported basis and 40% in constant currency. as previously mentioned, china were so sequential momentum continues led the improvement. compared to adjusted revenue for the same quarter in 2019, global lee reported revenue increased 4%. on a constant currency basis, global lee reported revenue increased 2% compared to the same quarter in 2019. and, finally, from a channel perspective, we saw broad-based improving performance during the quarter.
on a reported basis, u.s. wholesale increased 37%, non-u.s. wholesale grew 30% and global own.com increased 62% compared to prior year. now on the gross margin. gross margin increased 830 basis points to 46.1% of revenue on a reported basis compared to the same period in the prior year. fundamental improvement continues to be driven by favorable channel, customer and product mix, as well as quality of sales initiatives. in addition, the period benefited from product cost enhancements, as well as lower inventory provisions and higher production volumes than prior year. before moving to sg&a, i want to make a couple more comments about our gross margin in future investments. as we have highlighted previously, we see opportunities for sustainable structural margin enhancements, as growth in currently under-indexed accretive channels and geographies begins to materialize. although, improvements may not always be linear on a quarter-to-quarter basis, our first quarter gross margin performance is an excellent early proof point on how focus areas like demand creation, digital capabilities and quality of sales are beginning to manifest.
these enhancements create oxygen in our p&l for us to reinvest back into the business, and we will continue to do so. finally, i realized that our prior year gross margin contains some covid-related impacts in the period that may distort comparisons. accordingly, to better illustrate the progress that has already been made. i wanted to highlight that our first quarter gross margin increased 500 basis points, compared to first quarter of 2019 on an adjusted basis. now on to sg&a. adjusted sg&a increased $12 million on a year-over-year basis to $181 million. increased demand creation and higher volume-related variable expenses were partially offset by lower bad debt expense than in the prior year. adjusted earnings per share was $1.43 compared to $0.27 in the same period in the prior year and compared to $0.96 in the first quarter of 2019. now, turning to our balance sheet, first quarter inventories decreased $139 million versus the prior year to $350 million or down 28%.the year-over-year decline reflects tighter inventory controls.
the reduction in the vf outlet fleet that took place at year-end and the business model change in india. excluding vf outlet in india, inventory decreased approximately 21% compared to the prior year. historically, working capital in the first quarter tends to be a use of cash as opposed to a source of cash. however, due to our performance in erp implementation, working capital in the first quarter was a source of cash and is expected to be a use of cash in the second quarter. we finished the first quarter with net debt of $586 million and $230 million in cash. we anticipate prudently moderating our currently elevated cash balances toward pre-covid levels as we move through 2021. and as we previously announced, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share payable on june 18, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on june 8, 2021. and now, onto our outlook, given the strength of the first quarter, we are raising our fiscal 2021 guidance for revenue, gross margin and adjusted eps. although we will not provide a quarterly outlook, i will share some additional color on anticipated quarterly cadence in light of the erp implementations.
as we shared on our fourth quarter earnings call, we anticipated some timing shifts around the implementation of our erp. specifically, as you would expect, we believe there were some order pattern timing shifts from the second quarter into the first quarter, somewhat tempering q2 revenue growth rates and corresponding profitability, while aiding the first and third quarters. these timing shifts should have no impact on our full year results. let me now turn to specific 2021 guidance. revenue is now expected to increase in the low-teens range over 2020 as compared to a low double-digit range in the prior guidance, including a mid-single-digit impact from the vf outlet actions and india business model changes. we expect second half revenue will be modestly above the first half of the year. to be clear, we expect second quarter growth rates to modestly accelerate from the first quarter. gross margin is now expected to increase by 230 to 270 basis points above the adjusted gross margin of 41.2%, achieved in 2020, as compared to 150 to 200 basis points in the prior guidance.
although second quarter margins will be adversely impacted by downtime in our production facilities for the erp implementation, the annual increase reflects continued benefits from ongoing quality of sales initiatives, as well as higher anticipated growth in more accretive channels such as digital and international. sg&a investments will continue to be made in brands and capabilities. due to the strengthening revenue and gross margin outlook, we expect to amplify sg&a investments in demand creation, digital and international expansion. these increases will be partially mitigated by ongoing tight expense controls, and sustained structural cost-containment initiatives.
adjusted eps is now expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share, as compared to $3.50 to $3.60 per share in the prior guidance. we expect second half earnings on $1 basis to be modestly above the first half of the year due to covid recovery and the natural seasonality of the business. in closing, as scott indicated, i would just like to reiterate how our first quarter results demonstrate improving fundamentals, driven by the powerful combination of strategic investments and solid execution. we look forward to sharing our go-forward strategies to drive greater shareholder value at our upcoming investor day. this concludes our prepared remarks.
and i will now turn the call back to our operator. operator?

operator
thank you. at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] thank you. and our first question is coming from the line of jay sole with ubs. please proceed with your questions.
jay sole -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you so much. i want to ask about the erp impact and the timing of the implementation. rustin, i think you said that the company has successfully gone live and is executing. but there are still some final regional implementations for the back half of the year. can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on what percentage of the erp system has been implemented and sort of what's the risk profile right now in terms of the business, the operational risk always associated with these kinds of things? how much risk is still there? what can you tell us about that?
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. good morning, jay. thanks for the question. in terms of the erp impact, maybe just let me first start with where we are on the erp implementation schedule. you may remember, jay, we implemented our first regional implementation in q3 of 2020. and that was in our asia region. and as we indicated this morning, on our prepared remarks, we just went live in north america here early in the second quarter. so, obviously, as you know, jay, we're predominantly a north american based business with roughly 75% of our sales in north america. so certainly the largest region is live. and as i indicated on the remarks, we're certainly executing according to plan with our transition and ramp-up activities. as you think about the timing impact, jay, specifically, as we said on the last call, we anticipated that there would be some timing shifts in order patterns that would really help q1 and potentially q3, while tempering q2 a bit more.
as a reminder though, i would say that those timing shifts are expected to have no impacts on the full year results. so as we think a little bit more about our q1, there were a number of puts and takes, jay, both positive and negative that impacted the quarter, including stimulus as scott talked about, lockdowns in europe, lapping the vfo in india, model changes, quality of sales initiatives, and of course, the timing shifts with the erp. so, several of those, including erp are really difficult to isolate the individual impact of those. but what i would emphasize for you, jay, is even with the shifts, as scott mentioned, our q1 top-line was really broad-based and significantly above expectations, really driven by the areas where you've seen us investing over the last several quarters, including u.s. wholesale, digital and china.
and we're really seeing that some ktb-specific outperformance was really growth versus not only 2020, but also 2019, even with the drag from some of the strategic exits that we've executed. and scott talked about the continued share gains. and that's really what we love, the momentum and the brand, and the underlying business. and that's given us the confidence to raise the full year outlook. so really happy about where we are on the erp implementation. it's been a significant journey. and again, two of the three regional platforms are live now, with the third one being europe in the back half of 2021.
jay sole -- ubs -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. maybe if i can follow up, scott, you made some interesting comments on denim, saying, you didn't want to use the word cyclical, because that's sort of implies an endpoint more you see structural gains. can you maybe elaborate on what you're seeing right now in the marketplace? what you see with consumers that they're doing differently, that gives you confidence in the category, really improving from where it was maybe a couple of years ago?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
yeah, i think we see a fundamental shift really. we think about -- to talk about the denim cycle, and that's something that we'll participate and we feel real strongly about and we're positioned extremely well. but we see this thing as a big movement, jay. we see it as a global movement to customization and you know, when i say -- casualization. so when we think about this, we think about the fact that we can play now with the globe, because of our business. we're restructuring where we're set up around the world. we've got a really, really nice set of initiatives that play really well into it. so if you think about all the work that we've done on our innovation, all the work that we're doing on our design, you've seen the product that we're producing now and how good it is globally.
and the demand creation portfolio that we put out, some of the stuff that i talked about today with georgia may jagger and j.lo, those things, they're really helping the consumer shift into this casualization around the globe, which is really important, because we think of it as a much bigger dynamic, a much more global dynamic, and something that we'll be able to participate in for the long term. but i think the key thing for us is we believe we're the ones that are driving it. so we're taking share in what we're doing, which is really important for our business going forward, is we're expanding the marketplace. so, jay, if you were to spend time, like you do in london and new york and san francisco globally, you're seeing that as people come back to work, they're dressing differently. the world went into a really tough situation that we're all trying to come out of now. and as people are coming out of it, they're saying to themselves, ""in the future, i'd like to be a little bit more casual. denim is going to be my play there."" and we've positioned ourselves really nicely.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from the line of erinn murphy with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
erinn murphy -- piper sandler -- analyst
great, thanks. good morning. i was hoping, scott, you could talk a little bit more about the tmall launch of the wrangler brand. you said it exceeded expectations. how do you see that scaling in the region over time? and then, just curious, china bigger picture for both brands, what's the promotional landscape been like versus the pre-pandemic? and then i have a quick follow-up question.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
sure, sure, no problem. so from the tmall standpoint, in the wrangler lunch, we feel really good about the launch. we set all of our internal expectations. it's a higher profile over there. i think the thing that's really important for us and we've talked a little bit about this, is we have such a head-start with our lee brand. we've been in the marketplace for a really long time. we know the consumer. we know the market. we know the customers. so we really know how to operate with a really senior team, so we've got a terrific team on the ground there. so bringing our brand wrangler to that marketplace was a real benefit for us having that kind of expertise. so we've seen and hit the metrics that we've established for ourselves. but i think the most important thing was that our team was very strategic and smart in how we launched this first from a digital standpoint.
and now, we'll go to a physical omni-channel presence going forward, which you're going to hear a lot more about as we come up to our investor day on may 24. but we're really pleased with how the consumer is thinking about and reacting to the wrangler brand in china right now. and then, from a broader perspective, you heard my comments and rustin's comments about how the business is doing in china. we're really pleased with the brand and how it's doing right now, pleased with the team. and we see a lot of opportunities still in that marketplace, i mean, significant opportunity going forward. i liken this to the very early stages. if it was a scale of one to 10, i liken this to a -- we're at like a two right now with all kinds of potential and opportunity ahead of us. so we're pretty pleased with where we are. and again, we're going to spend some time and we're going to unpack that for you at investor day going forward. but thanks for the question. thanks for joining us today, erinn.
erinn murphy -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. and then, i guess, a follow up for rustin on just the shaping of the year. and i hear you on the timing shift of erp. but looking at kind of how you spoke to q2, the implicit back half guidance is very -- it seems conservative to us. it really doesn't give you guys a lot of credit for growth, or just very modest growth in the back half to get to your low teens top-line. so can you just maybe help us think through some of the drivers there just -- or if we're missing anything? maybe it's kind of coming out of india business model change, but again, very different kind of second half versus first half growth rates.
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. thanks, erinn. good morning. thanks for the question. obviously, one of the things is the comp. as you think about 2020 and certainly strengthening, as you move through the back half of 2020, relative to the front-half, you certainly saw our results. so, that's part of it, but maybe let me step through kind of the full-year impact on both profitability and earnings. so, again, really strong momentum here in, q1.
and going into q2, as we talked a little bit about that, that erp go-live will cause some timing shifts, kind of benefiting q1 as well as q3, while tempering q2 a bit more. and just as a reminder, q2 is our lowest volume quarter. and so, as you would expect, we will have a bit more pronounced impact on profitability, particularly, as we continue to invest behind strategic initiatives and demand creation to support that top-line not just in 2020, the back half of 2021, erinn, but in 2022 and beyond. and finally, as we've stated, we will be -- we do expect to be modestly higher in the back half of eps on a dollar basis in the second half of the year. the other thing i would sort of highlight, erinn, is that, obviously, there is a lot of macro uncertainty as scott and i both referenced in our discussion earlier, whether that's continued lockdowns in europe, certainly supply chain disruptions. so we certainly want to be prudently conservative and feel like we've taken those into considerations, but really want to make sure that we're emphasizing those investments to support the long-term top-line as well in the back half. so, hopefully, that helps a little bit more with the shaping in the year and how we're seeing it play out.
operator
thank you. our next question will be coming from the line of adrienne yih with barclays. please proceed with your question.
adrienne yih -- barclays -- analyst
good morning. let me add my congratulations. this is a -- the second quarter in a row where we're really starting to see that horizon two play out, so well done there.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
thanks, adrienne.
adrienne yih -- barclays -- analyst
i was wondering if -- you're welcome. i was wondering if you can talk about, the china wrangler launch, what you're seeing there, how strong, i mean, china seems to be a hotbed of positive news, in terms of the strength of the recovery. and then on the other side, we have had put them down questions about, denim-based retailers having exposure. and, i know, this is a kind of political subject, but to the extent that do you have exposure, how do you know that you have -- if you were to have cotton, perhaps, that is exposed to that xinjiang region? and if you can talk a little bit about risk -- any risk reward aspect from china upside versus any exposure? thank you very much.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
good morning, adrienne. how are you? thanks for joining us today. it's scott.
adrienne yih -- barclays -- analyst
hey, scott.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
i'll start with your china question for wrangler -- nice to hear your voice. i'll start with the china wrangler question. we've talked a lot about it on the prepared remarks. but it's an opportunity to kind of talk more about it now. so i appreciate it. it was a big decision for us to go there. but it was a very easy decision that we made early on in our strategy, our portfolio there, roughly the business that we had built, the leadership team that we have in place and the experience that we have in the marketplace over a very, very long period of time. and quite frankly, the success that we've had there, it was an easy decision for us. it was just the timing standpoint, when will we go ahead after the spin and make the decision to move. so since the decision to move, and it was delayed during the pandemic, as you know a little bit, we've been really pleased. we've been pleased with how the consumer has taken the product.
we've been pleased with the demand creation and how the consumer is absorbing the demand creation. what i mean by that is that the consumer really gets the story and they get the brand, and i think that's the really important part. and then we can capitalize on the infrastructure that we already have in place, which is really important. and now, we're kind of phasing into kind of our second kind of thought process and strategy around how do we go ahead and start to really grow the brand there, and that we launched, as you know, digitally first and now we've gone to an omni-channel thought process in how we go head to wholesale and how we have our own physical stores to in the marketplace. so it's a really good position for us to be in. as far as exposure, as you know, we don't buy cotton, as you know, it's a fabric that we buy. and for us, we do a really nice job. one of the things that we pride ourselves on is our supply chain here at kontoor brands, very well established. one of the great parts about our spin was that our supply chain had been established from a world class supply chain, long-term supply chain. so this wasn't new to us, and we've got a lot of talents over.
so they've done a really nice job with making sure that working with our suppliers around the globe, that we are buying the right type of fabric for our products. so, right now, we feel very well positioned and how we are positioned in that situation currently.
adrienne yih -- barclays -- analyst
okay, fantastic. that's super helpful. i know, we've touched on the denim cycles, but i guess, i actually in more curious whether you think there's a fashion shift component to it. so we understand that there's a transference of athleisure, perhaps two, perhaps denim, which is sort of more broad base. but on top of that, can you talk about a fashion component of it, maybe change in silhouette, et cetera? and then for, rustin, really want to get a little bit more color on auc progress. i know that you have had continued auc progress in the face of rising input pricing pressure. so a little help, there would be great, thank you.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
yeah, for sure. so i'm thrilled you asked that question, because you're the first person has picked up on that component and that piece of it. and let me tell you why that's really important and why i'm really impressed with the question, because you're thinking about it in terms of the fact that we're expanding the marketplace. and that's exactly what we're thinking about. we have spent a ton of energy time money in our innovation, and also in our design. and that innovation in design is bringing our product to a more premium level, which is really good, because that just creates incredible brand heat throughout the entire portfolio. but what we're going to see throughout this casualization, and i mentioned this a little bit earlier, this is why it's important. big cities, major metro markets around the globe, from london to new york, to san francisco, to paris, to munich, they move into a casualization process. those people that come back into not just the workplace, but coming back into social environments, concerts, things like that, they are going to want to dress with a little higher design fashion element from a denim standpoint.
so we are playing right into that extending marketplace. that's why i said earlier that this -- the cycle is great, and we're going to participate in, no question, but we're going to expand the entire marketplace. that's where the real win is very long-term, and that's the component. so great question, glad you asked, because it's a really important part, and it helps us because it's really been part of the strategy of how we've been investing. now from an atg standpoint, we have been really pleased with atg. i think the thing that's really important for us for atg. it's been very easy for us to take the wrangler line into the outdoor world, because it's really just an extension of who that wrangler consumer is. and we've gotten really good traction, as you know, especially around the globe, so cubus and dressmann, female and male stores in the european marketplace, and then, of course, really, really good distribution here in the united states.
but i think the thing that's happening now for us, it's really important. we're now starting to see folks like scheels. scheels, an incredibly strong outdoor retailer, sporting goods retailer in the mid-central part of the united states bringing our product on, i think that's bringing real validation to the product. and, placing it right there next to our competition. and we really like when they do that, because what happens for us is the consumer comes in, and they see a couple of things. and it's very, very obvious for them quickly, one, they see an incredibly high quality product, they see it as a very, very good price, and they also have a trusted brand. so you add that those components, those three things, great brands, great product, and great price, the takeout is there, the consumer reception is really good. and we see really good things on the horizon. and we look forward to talk to you more about our atg line coming up on may 24. so thank you for the questions. i appreciate it.
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and adrienne, it's rustin. i'll go ahead and talk a little bit about rising input costs. so, certainly, as we've spoken about previously, we're not immune to the macro-economic challenges that are that are happening in the marketplace, whether that's port congestion, higher freight rates, labor shortages, we're certainly actively monitoring all of the input costs. and we've considered that in the updated outlook that we provided this morning, where we raised our gross margins from the previous guide of 150 to 200 basis points, versus adjusted margin from last year up to 230 to 270 basis points. and, just a couple of points to highlight, i mean, it was our third consecutive quarter of triple digit gross margin increases. in that first quarter, as i mentioned on my remarks, we did see 500 basis points improvement above our q1 2019 on an adjusted basis. so, the investments, i think, are big key here, adrienne, as we think about our model moving forward.
and we've talked about this quite a bit here this morning, whether that's in demand creation, innovation, digital, et cetera. and that proactive kind of margin improvement opportunities where we've been investing in is really driving favorable channel and geographic mix. and certainly, you've seen us focused on quality of sales that innovation in design is also going to help support pricing and mixing up of aurs. so, that's what's giving us confidence from a margin perspective. and, certainly, as we always do, we always talk about our supply chain as a differentiator. and that diversified supply chain, where approximately one-third of our global production is internally manufactured in this hemisphere, and approximately two-thirds are sourced from over 225 facilities in over 20 countries really provides us the flexibility to diversify where possible and minimize some of those inflationary pressures. so hopefully, that provides a little more color on how we're thinking about not just average unit costs, but also pricing and mixing up of aurs. thanks, adrienne.
operator
thank you. our next question will be coming from the line of bob drbul with guggenheim securities. please proceed with your questions.
bob drbul -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
good morning. i guess a couple of quick questions for me. can you talk a little bit about new business development wins that you're seeing? i think, first. and, i guess, can you comment a little more around as you look at the digital ecosystem evolution, where you think you are, and how that's developing? and i'd be remiss not to ask about the jlo campaign. so i don't know, if you could just give us an idea on demand creation, sort of, where you see it, especially with these gross margin gains and the ability to reinvest, where you are with the jlo campaign and the georgia may jagger campaign. that'd be pretty helpful for us. thanks.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
sure about that. that's no problem. thanks for the questions, really appreciate it. from the new business development standpoint, i think the thing that i'm most pleased with is that lee, since the very beginning, have decided that these brands were under invested, and under penetrated and under distributed. and we had a pretty big whitespace globally, and we've attacked that. but i think the thing that's probably the most important piece of it is that we just see a ton more opportunity going forward with the brand. so, when we had our success with our launch of walmart, and we've seen really, really nice results, especially since we got all our pos up, feel really good about that launch, that really got us going. and then, you see the things that we've done with atg, and this is a global point of view, right? so, i think, we've done with preston [phonetic], the things we've done with cubus, and then, obviously, the things that we're going to talk about in our upcoming meeting. so we're also going to spend time with you, we're going to take you through this in a pretty significant way, investor day, but there's much more to come. and then i look at like things like scheels, right? and i think about how do we structure and how do we have new business developments that really elevates the brand and puts us on the next pedestal so that we can get to the next level. and the win like that gets atg to the next level, because it's such an important customer, it's such an important consumer. and people see that at the right place, and you're seeing our products positioned really correctly, it just brings us additional brand heat, so really pleased with it. from a digital standpoint, that's a really big win for us. if you think about the work that we've done from the erp standpoint, and all the work that's -- rustin and joe, and the team has done on that, it's just an exemplary, and can't thank the team enough. but, i likened earlier, when i said on a scale of 10, we would be two, when i talked about some of the other stuff. we're just at the very beginning of the digital piece and we're seeing really accelerated results, as you've heard today in our response. our consumer is finding us online. they're finding us with our digital partners. they're finding us on our own digital.com. we're creating much better platforms for them to go ahead and work with us and shop with us. we think that we have easy products, most consumers know their pant size, most consumers know their shirt size and the accessories that we sell. so we're easy ' in easy sale from that standpoint. but i think the key, bob, is that, when you go to our sites now versus two years ago, you're just seeing a much better product from both wrangler and lee, and i think that's really a huge win. and then what you're seeing is people are being driven there, because of the incredible demand creation programs that we're creating. the heat that we get from jlo being on the cover of instyle magazine, all organic, which is terrific. the campaign with georgia may jagger, for our women's line with wrangler has just been, it's been off the charts successful, we've been really pleased with it. i think it really has to do with the talent. i would go as far as to say it's the talent that was hired and promoted in the organization. so the demand creation teams of both wrangler and lee, they're just -- they're terrific in the work that they're doing is really terrific. and, we're creating brand heat in the company in a pretty significant way, so really pleased. and i think, bob, if i can finish with this, is how it all flows together, right? you've got new business development, you've got our digital component, you've got our demand creation, you've got our innovation, and you've got all of that coming together, all of that infancy stages, and it's really creating an exciting opportunity for kontoor. we're just at the beginning of that and you're starting to see, we've climbed into horizon two in a really, really nice way. we've landed the plane, and now it's time for horizon two to take off. thanks, bob.
operator
thank you. our next question will be coming from the line of sam poser with susquehanna. please proceed with your question.
sam poser -- susquehanna -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. i've got a couple, one, just on your supply chain. i mean, what -- you're not getting, what percent of your supply chain is coming, is all from the north america and not being impacted by the courts right now?
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, so sam, it's rustin. good morning. as we talked a little bit about, our global production roughly one-third is in this hemisphere that is really serving this hemisphere. and, certainly, our plants in central america, are really servicing this hemisphere. again, two-thirds of our production is source, and certainly serves not just the u.s., but asia and europe as well. and certainly, obviously, sam, u.s. is about 75% of our business. so we have a pretty fair portion that is coming through with our own internal manufactured product in the hemisphere. and certainly that's helping us mitigate some of the broader supply chain challenges that you're hearing from others in the peer set.
sam poser -- susquehanna -- analyst
thanks. and then, secondly, you're increasing your marketing spend, and that sounds like, it's pretty much focused on digital. in doing that, and how much of that digital marketing, do you think helped the first quarter? and how are you thinking about that within your guidance for the back half? i have no more questions.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
yeah, it's a great question, sam. i mean, i know when you look at this business, we've been traditionally under-indexed, as you think about demand creation as a percent of revenue, sub 5% of our revenue has been spent historically on advertising. so we've talked since the spin about really wanting to invest back behind these brands. you certainly saw us start to do that a little bit more when we amplified in the fourth quarter some of the demand creation, certainly drove strong results around holiday and into the first quarter today with the results. and we certainly see an opportunity to continue to invest there.
and we're going to drive that. digital, as scott mentioned, is really a critical piece, but it's not exclusively digital. it's really talking about the brands and you're seeing really strong momentum, obviously, with both brands gaining share in the marketplace. and really, all of that is fueled and funded, as you know, sam, by that gross margin expansion. that's what creates the oxygen, gives us the ability to invest back into the brand while improving operating margins as well. and that's the secret sauce from our side.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from the line of jim duffy with stifel. please proceed with your question.
jim duffy -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. good morning. hi, scott. hi, rustin. hi, eric.
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey, jim.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
hi, jim. how are you doing?
jim duffy -- stifel -- analyst
well, thank you. i wanted to start talking on the gross margin, really super progress, really strong margin in the first quarter. rustin, it sounds like some give back in the second quarter. i'm trying to think as we look toward the second half of the year, is there any reason that that first quarter gross margin wouldn't be sustainable? is there some absorption of fixed cost deleverage from 2q manufacturing or what are some of the other things which would pressure the gross margin relative to what you were able to deliver in the first quarter?
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. it's a great question. thanks, jim. appreciate it. first quarter was really a milestone for us, as you know. we've had three consecutive quarters now, with triple-digit margin improvement. north of 46% was our strongest quarter to date in q1 by nearly 300 basis points. so, yeah, a number of drivers structurally really driving that, as we talked a little bit about, that favorable channel mix, quality of sales initiatives you've seen us undertake, as well as product cost enhancements we continue to focus on. and then, certainly, that first quarter also benefited by some customer and product mix, lower inventory provisions versus prior year, and certainly, higher production volumes versus prior year, which were impacted by covid. so that gross margin expansion remains a critical focal point for us, jim, and really enables us to invest back into the brands while improving the operating margins, as we talked about. as we think about this unfolding into the balance of the year, certainly as we go into the second quarter, there will be some margin impact, erp implementation activities with the cutover. so, we said that the gross margin expansion wouldn't be linear on a quarter to quarter basis. and then, as you think about the back half of the year, as we've talked about on the call here, jim, certainly a lot of uncertainty is still out there with supply chain issues. and we are just being prudently conservative as we're thinking about the balance of the year, and making sure that, we're dialing in the margin appropriately. but, obviously, we feel good about what we're seeing to raise that guidance on the gross margin, again, from that 150 to 200 basis points improvement up to the 230 to 270 we talked about this morning.
jim duffy -- stifel -- analyst
okay, great. and then, rustin, i wanted to ask about ebit margin and flow through. the guidance implies ebit margin back above pre-sten [phonetic] levels. i understand you're reinvesting some in marketing. can you talk about what the demand creation budget that's implied in that guidance is? you mentioned wanting to get it above the 5% level. where would you see it this year? and then, related to ebit margin, strong upside in the first quarter. i'm wondering for investors, is there any sort of framework to think about like when you have upside how much of that gets passed through to investors versus reinvested in the business? is it 2/3rds 1/3rd, 1/3rd 2/3rds, anything you can say on that would be helpful?
rustin welton -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, certainly, we'll go into the sg&a and our thoughts on how to invest and demand creation a little bit more at investor day here in a couple of weeks, jim. but maybe just a couple of points to highlight on your questions, you've heard us talk from the very beginning about earning our way into these investments. and you're seeing that materialize with that expansion on the gross margin side, and again, really creating that oxygen to reinvest back into the business. you saw us start to do that a little heavier in the fourth quarter of last year. and we're going to continue that this year. i won't get into specifically targets around advertising as a percent of revenue this year. but, again, we really like the momentum on the brands, and really investing behind the brands. they've been under indexed -- or under invested in historically. and that's a key part of our thesis here as kontoor is the ability to really invest back behind these brands and drive growth. and certainly, you'll see a lot more about that on the investor day here in a couple of weeks. but appreciate the question, jim, thanks.
operator
thank you. at this time, we've reached end of our question-and-answer session. and i'll turn the call over to scott baxter for closing remarks.

we anticipate this call will last about one hour scott?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
thanks, eric, and thank you all for joining us today. the momentum kontoort experienced to begin the year continued in the second quarter. with results coming in well above our expectations. our performance in the quarter once again illustrates the power of the ktb model, which affords us the opportunity to not only deliver on our near-term goals but also to continue to invest in the strategic growth catalysts outlined at our recent investor day. a huge thank you to our colleagues all around the world and a special call out to the teams engaged in the implementation of our erp platform during the quarter as their incredible efforts are helping to transform our organization. hopefully, you had a chance to attend our recent virtual investor day where we communicated our strategic vision for catalyzing growth over the next three years. during horizon 1, we optimized our model and set the foundation for growth.
as we execute on horizon two strategies, we expect to leverage investments to drive more sustained profitable growth. we expect to accelerate revenue, primarily driven by focusing on the following growth catalysts: first, enhancing and accelerating our core u.s. wholesale business; second, elevating our d2c and digital ecosystem; third, expanding the brands internationally, particularly in the china region; and fourth, diversifying our product mix through category extensions, including outdoor, workwear and t-shirts. and to support this growth, we continue to invest behind critical tsr accretive enablers, including enhancing demand creation platforms, scaling product and manufacturing innovation, with sustainability and esg as our guiding tenant, unlocking efficiency and productivity gains through the implementation of our global erp and digital infrastructure, and finally, leveraging our world-class talent to build a purpose-led high-performance and increasingly growth-minded culture.
and we have increased optionality within our capital allocation strategy, which is reflected in the $200 million share repurchase program we announced today. let me now share some highlights from the second quarter that demonstrate how these investments come to life and how our strategies are working. overall, reported revenue increased 41% year-over-year or 37% in constant currency. rustin will take you through some of the puts and takes in a bit, but i would note that our top line results exceeded our internal expectations. most importantly, underlying momentum of the business continued to strengthen as revenue growth sequentially accelerated from the first quarter with broad-based performance across our brands, channels and geographies. in the u.s., despite the timing shifts associated with the erp implementation somewhat temporary our growth rates.
we continue to see improving trends with both brands posting strong growth during the quarter compared to last year. our brands continue to benefit from the incremental investments we are making within talent, marketing, product innovation and design, all of which, support elevated pricing and product, allowing us to win in our largest channel, u.s. wholesale. during the second quarter, we continue to elevate our branded demand creation platforms influencers such as georgia may jagger not only connect the wrangler brand with a younger female consumer, but also fuels significant brand heat across distribution channels. another great example of our enhanced marketing efforts is wrangler's recently announced collaboration with iconic surf brand billabong. the billabong and wrangler collection launched in late july in anticipation of the back-to-school season with a second fall inspired installment planned for september of 2021. the collection celebrates the best of both brands and is the exciting result achieved when you put a western spin on a vintage surf.
we launched with a heavy digital-first approach as well as paid social, influencers and amplified pr. we're estimating over 95 million social media impressions around the launch, and this continues to highlight our diversifying distribution with products sold on branded sites and in billabong stores and other specialty channels. during the second quarter, we launched a collaboration with streetwear brand, the hundreds. this master blends the past with the present to achieve the perfect balance of classic workwear with a street wear it twist. across denim, tees, hoodies and outerwear. the collections are selling exclusively through the brand's digital platforms as well as the 100s l.a. store. after the successful debut, a second collection is scheduled to drop later this year. and the pipeline of collaborations for both brands is only getting stronger. we look forward to sharing some incredibly exciting fall holiday partnerships with you in the coming quarters. from a channel perspective, we continue to see strong returns on our investments in transforming our digital ecosystem as evidenced by our second quarter performance.
q2 saw great growth over last year but was even more impressive compared with 2019, with both global and u.s. owned.com increasing more than 80% and digital wholesale increasing more than 100%. as we outlined at our investor day, we remain highly under-indexed relative to our peers in this accretive channel, and we will continue to distort investments to drive toward our goal of 10% penetration over the next three years. we also continue to benefit from investments in new categories such as outdoor, workwear and t-shirts with nearly $150 billion in total addressable markets. these categories represent significant opportunity for the incremental business. the new categories also augment and diversify the collection beyond our core denim bottoms business and do so in a highly organic way. within outdoor in our atg line, we've established a brand positioning and value equation that is a true white space in the market, and we are beginning to scale distribution with an outdoor specialty and sporting goods channels, both domestically and abroad. as examples, we are excited to announce two great new partners for atg.
we are currently testing with academy sports in the u.s. and intersport in europe, both brand-enhancing incremental points of distribution for the atg line. we also have some exciting new sports specialty product introductions on the horizon. this includes our wrangler angler line focused on the rapidly growing fishing market that is expected to launch in the coming quarters. in t-shirts, a $100 billion-plus addressable market. there are three key areas we are aggressively pursuing, logo, lifestyle and licensed tees. tees are a natural category extension with a pair of genes, and we are just getting started in realizing the significant opportunity ahead of us, leveraging the strong brand heritage of both the lee and wrangler brands, we believe there are clear pathways to create great product that will resonate with current morals and attract new consumers. we recently won new t-shirt programs with both wrangler and lee with a key domestic repel partner, including selling in over 1,700 doors with store expansion to come in '22. our workwear business is also experiencing great momentum with potential for strong expansion in the quarters and years to come.
in the specialty and farm channel, we continue to see strong organic growth opportunities for our wrangler rigs product line. these retail segments have shown resiliency throughout the pandemic, and we believe we can continue to scale with new products for men and women in this tier of distribution. and finally, we expect to significantly increase our recently launched wrangler workwear program with a major u.s. retailer this year. in fact, we will more than double our door count with this key domestic partner from spring '21 and fall '21, taking us into over 3,300 doors. this is a great testament to how additional investments in category expansion are generating incremental business development opportunities for our brands. we expect growth from our outdoor work and tee shirt categories to add over $200 million in revenue for kontoor over the next three years. and finally, let me turn to how our investments in geographic expansion played out in the second quarter. we continue to see improvements despite an uneven macro environment. our european business saw significant year-over-year improvement up over 250% in constant currency compared with 2020 and over 40% in constant currency compared with 2019, driven by digital, and timing of shipments ahead of our european erp go live.
while we expect conditions to remain difficult in europe, the evolution of our digital platform and new business development programs should help mitigate near-term headwinds and position us for success in the region over the longer term. and in china, our ongoing strategic investments continue to yield great results. with reported second quarter revenue increasing 20% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. importantly, trends in the region accelerated throughout the quarter. largely dictated by some phasing within wholesale. digital in the region remained extremely strong, up 33% to last year and 67% to 2019 on a constant currency basis. with a premium lifestyle offering, strong collaborations and partnerships with key local influencers, the lee brand continues to build on its leading denim position in the region. and the launch of the wrangler brand in china continues to gain momentum, exceeding our expectations to date, building momentum throughout the quarter and setting the foundation for scaled growth over time. before i hand it over to rustin, let me close with a few comments about the balance of 2021.
we continue to operate in a very fluid and uncertain environment that includes restrictions in select locations inflationary pressures and global supply chain disruptions. and as we have repeatedly said, we are not immune to these macroeconomic challenges. however, as we highlighted at investor day, our operating model has been resilient. we believe consumers migrate to trusted, quality, value-oriented brands like wrangler and lee and times of uncertainty. and in fact, we continue to see solid momentum across both our brands. accordingly, we intend to distort and amplify brand-enhancing investments in the second half in areas like demand creation, digital and international expansion to accelerate momentum in 2022, while leveraging our differentiated global supply chain to chase incremental demand and mitigate or minimize global disruptions where possible. we believe kontoor resides in a unique position of strength as our accelerating fundamentals, coupled with increasing optionality of our capital allocation strategy provides a powerful combination that should unlock significant value for our stakeholders.
rustin? thank you, scott, and thank you all for joining us on today's call. as scott mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong second quarter results that exceeded our expectations and i look forward to walking you through the details shortly. before we dig into the quarter though, i'd like to briefly recap two key financial strategies that we outlined during our investor day. first, we reviewed in detail what we refer to as our virtuous cycle. specifically, this refers to our strategy to grow revenue and expand gross margins to create the oxygen in our p&l and allow us to distort investments in our brands and capabilities to drive future top line growth while delivering enhanced operating margins. our second quarter is a powerful illustration of how we are continuing to execute on this strategy to drive meaningful improvement in our fundamentals. delivering near-term performance while investing for long-term growth is a cornerstone of our financial strategy. accordingly, i'd like to provide an update on one of our key investment areas, our global erp and it infrastructure project. on our first quarter earnings call, we announced that we successfully went live early in the second quarter in our largest region, north america. today, i'm pleased to announce that we also successfully went live early in the third quarter in europe, our third and final region. while still early days, particularly for europe, these implementations represent significant milestones for kontoor, and i want to thank the organization for their tremendous efforts on these major accomplishments. these it investments have both short- and long-term implications on our operations and results. in the short term, our quarterly cadence was affected by timing shifts in shipments in advance of the implementation. as expected, this resulted in net transitory pressure during our second quarter with certain north american shipments shifting into the first quarter while certain european shipments shifted from the third to the second quarter. since north america represents roughly 75% of our global business, the net pressure was most pronounced on our second quarter results but is not expected to have an impact on the full year. in the long term, the it investments will enable us to run our operations globally as opposed to regionally while delivering the efficiency improvements in phase two cost saves that we have previously outlined. the investments we are making in the business, including technology support our catalyzing growth strategy to deliver long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. investments will scale thoughtfully throughout horizon two in areas such as digital, innovation and demand creation to support growth in underpenetrated channels, geographies and categories. based on early proof points, we will continue to look for ways to distort and amplify investments in these tsr accretive areas in the quarters ahead. the second key financial strategy i want to highlight is our enhanced capital allocation optionality. in horizon 1, we focused on two foundational capital allocation priorities, delevering the balance sheet and paying a superior dividend. accordingly, we've made considerable progress in paying down debt to help optimize our capital structure. in terms of the dividend, a superior dividend will continue to be a key element in the kontoor investment thesis. as we pivot to horizon 2, we have the ability to add powerful optionality to augment our organic foundational capital allocation elements. strong fundamental performance has been and will continue to be an increasing component of our mid-teens plus targeted tsr, fueled by the investments we have discussed today. over the next three years, we are expecting approximately $1 billion in cash from operations that will enable us to support a multifaceted capital allocation strategy. accordingly, as scott mentioned and you saw in this morning's release, we announced a $200 million share repurchase program as a powerful example of this optionality. in addition to offsetting dilution, we believe share repurchases provide another attractive vehicle to return cash to shareholders through opportunistic buybacks pending market conditions. combined with improving fundamentals and our superior dividend, we remain committed to strong total shareholder returns. we are pleased with how the virtuous cycle within our model is evolving and are excited about the capital allocation optionality materializing in the early days of horizon 2. now let's turn to our second quarter review. i will focus my comments on key highlights and encourage you to refer to this morning's release for additional detail on the quarter. also, given the impact covid-19 had on prior year results, i will provide select references to the same quarter in 2019 for additional context where appropriate. beginning with revenue. global revenue increased 41% on a reported basis and was up 37% in constant currency compared to the same quarter last year. even with the controlled ramp-up of our erp post go-live and timing shift of shipments discussed earlier, we saw top line upside to our internal expectations. strength in the second quarter revenue was also partially impacted by the strategic actions announced in the fourth quarter of 2020 to rationalize our vf outlet fleet in the u.s., discontinue the sale of third-party branded products in all domestic outlet stores and transition to a new licensed business model in india. combined, these actions represented approximately three points of headwind in the quarter. compared to adjusted revenue in the second quarter of 2019, global revenue decreased 19% on a reported basis due to these factors and continued covid-19 impacts in select markets and channels. on a regional basis for the quarter, u.s. revenues increased 27% compared to the same quarter last year. growth was driven by wholesale, new business development wins and continued strength in our western channel. in addition, we drove continued strength in digital. as scott mentioned, our digital penetration remains under indexed, and we will continue to amplify investments in this important channel. these investments are yielding strong returns. despite being adversely impacted by our north american erp cutover activities, u.s. digital wholesale and u.s. own.com increased 49% and 28%, respectively, compared to the same quarter in 2020. u.s. digital wholesale and u.s. own.com increased 106% and 89%, respectively, compared to the same quarter in 2019. the international revenues increased 106% on a reported basis and 87% in constant currency compared to the second quarter of 2020. growth was broad-based across all regions aided by easing lockdowns and timing shifts in europe, continued growth in china and strength in our digital businesses. turning to our brands. global revenue of our wrangler brand increased 24% on a reported basis and 22% in constant currency compared to the same quarter in 2020. wrangler u.s. revenue increased 14%, driven by strength in our western business, new product categories such as outdoor and female as well as digital with digital wholesale and own.com increasing 82% and 25%, respectively. we are particularly pleased with the strength in our western business, which continues to carry strong momentum from the first quarter, with second quarter revenue up 42%. the wrangler international revenue increased 137% on a reported basis and 115% in constant currency. digital, new business development wins with our atg program, as well as easing lockdowns and timing shifts in europe contributed to the strong growth in the quarter. compared to adjusted revenue for the same quarter in 2019, global wrangler revenue decreased 14% on both a reported and constant currency basis. lee brand global revenue increased 105% on a reported basis and 96% in constant currency compared to the second quarter of 2020. lee u.s. revenue, which was more adversely impacted than wrangler by retail door closures in the same period in 2020, increased 118%, driven by wholesale, new distribution wins and our digital businesses with digital wholesale and own.com increasing 3% and 33%, respectively. lee international revenue increased 91% on a reported basis and 73% in constant currency driven by digital. in addition, the quarter benefited from the easing of lockdowns on our brick-and-mortar stores and timing shifts due to the erp go-live in europe. compared to adjusted revenue for the same quarter in 2019, globally revenue decreased 15% on a reported basis and 17% on on a constant currency basis. and finally, from a channel perspective, we saw continued broad-based strength compared to the same quarter in 2020. on a reported basis, u.s. wholesale increased 29%, while non-u.s. wholesale grew 100% in constant currency. global branded d2c increased 48% in constant currency with own.com up 33% compared to prior year. now on to gross margin. reported gross margin increased 760 basis points to 46.1% of revenue compared to the same period in the prior year. favorable channel, customer and product mix benefited the quarter as well as strength in the accretive businesses such as western. we continue to see structural benefits from the fundamental drivers we outlined at our investor day, mix shifts to under-indexed and highly accretive channels and geographies and proactive supply chain initiatives and aur mix supported by innovation and select pricing. as you would expect, given compares the second quarter also benefited from certain discrete prior year items. as we discussed during the second quarter last year, gross margin was negatively impacted by covid-related headwinds and particularly from downtime in our owned manufacturing. in the current quarter, leverage of our owned manufacturing relative to these 2020 impacts favorably benefited the second quarter by 370 basis points on an adjusted basis. given these transitory distortions, i want to provide additional context relative to 2019, which more clearly highlights the progress we have made against our gross margin strategies. relative to the second quarter of 2019, gross margin increased 750 basis points on a reported basis or 610 basis points compared to adjusted gross margin, driven primarily by the fundamental factors previously mentioned. now on to sg&analyst. adjusted sg&a increased $39 million on a year-over-year basis to $168 million. increased demand creation, digital and higher volume-related variable expenses were partially offset by better fixed cost leverage on improving revenue and lower bad debt expense than in the prior year. adjusted earnings per share was $0.70 and compared to a $0.22 loss in the same period in the prior year and compared to $0.96 in the second quarter of 2019. now turning to our balance sheet. second quarter inventories decreased $30 million versus the prior year to $403 million or down 7%. the year-over-year decline reflects the fourth quarter 2020 actions to reduce the fleet and discontinue the sale of third-party branded products in our domestic outlets as well as the business model change in india. excluding vf outlet in india, inventory increased approximately 4% compared to the prior year in support of higher projected demand. we made $25 million in debt repayments in the quarter and finished the second quarter with net debt or long-term debt less cash of $615 million and $176 million in cash. our net leverage ratio or net debt divided by trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda, at the end of the second quarter was 1.5 times within our targeted range of one times to two times. and as previously announced, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share payable on september 20, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on september 10, 2021. and now on to our outlook. as scott mentioned earlier, we are not immune to macroeconomic challenges, including recent global supply chain issues experienced in most all industries. however, we believe our diversified global supply chain offers a distinct competitive advantage in scale and speed, and we remain focused on being agile and responsive while working to mitigate disruptions. our brands have momentum and are winning in the market, and we intend to continue amplifying investments in the back half to support top line growth in 2021 and 2022. to best position for the accelerating demand we see, we anticipate select elevated transitory costs such as freight in the back half of 2021. these transitory costs have been contemplated in our increased gross margin guidance. based on the strength of the second quarter and momentum and demand for our brands, we are raising our fiscal 2021 outlook for revenue, gross margin and adjusted eps. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-teens range over 2020 to $2.39 billion to $2.42 billion as compared to a low teens range in the prior guidance, including a mid-single-digit impact from the vf outlet actions in india business model changes. gross margin is now expected to increase by 330 to 380 basis points to 44.5% to 45% as compared to 230 to 270 basis points in the prior guidance. the increase reflects higher anticipated structural growth in more accretive channels such as digital and international. sg&a investments will continue to be made in our brands and capabilities. due to the strengthening revenue and gross margin outlook, we expect to amplify sg&a investments in demand creation, digital and international expansion to support second half 2021 revenue and accelerate momentum for 2022. these increases will be partially mitigated by ongoing tight expense controls and sustained structural post-pandemic cost containment initiatives. adjusted eps is now expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4 per share as compared to $3.70 to $3.80 per share in the prior guidance. this eps guidance does not assume the benefit of any share repurchases. before closing, i think it is important to consider our updated fiscal 2021 outlook in context of our historical results and our investor day projections. relative to 2019, our updated fiscal 2021 outlook at the midpoint of our ranges imply revenue is projected to be at or slightly higher than adjusted 2019 revenue levels, excluding the mid-single-digit impact from vf outlet and india. gross margin is projected to be up nearly 400 basis points compared to adjusted gross margin in 2019. and adjusted earnings per share is projected to be above 2019 levels even with amplified investment in sg&a. finally, our updated fiscal 2021 outlook puts us well on track, if not ahead of plan to deliver on our three year financial targets outlined at our recent investor day. in closing, i would like to reiterate scott's earlier remarks. we are very confident in our team and business and are pleased as we enter the second half of 2021 with great momentum. this concludes our prepared remarks, and i will now turn the call back to our operator. operator?

[operator instructions] our first questions come from the line of jay sole with ubs. please proceed with your question.
jay sole -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you so much. you just obviously raised the guidance today and the tone and some of the things you mentioned, it sounds like you have confidence in that raised guidance. but can you just talk us through a little bit more and maybe elaborate on what's giving you confidence to be able to raise the guidance today and looking forward, why you might be ahead of your investor day plan?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
hey jay. how are you? thanks for the question. jay, when we look at it, it all goes back to our strategy from the very beginning on how we started this and the amplification of the brands. we knew and the reason we wanted to spin is we had such a great opportunity ahead of us. and these brands were super powerful that they hadn't been invested in. well now we're starting to see with this incredible investment that we're making, supported by some really strong demand creation programs, my hats off to our global demand creation teams and we're starting to see the brands really come to life. what i'm most pleased with is how we're communicating with the consumers around the globe and how that's a two-way communication that's really taking root. and we think there's a lot more there as far as the future.
there are some uncontrollables in the background, but you saw how well we handle that during the pandemic, which i thought was really important. we've got an incredible playbook. and we're really happy about what's happening here going forward. we've got some visibility in the future from a business development standpoint, from a category extension standpoint and geography. so that's all reflected in our guidance. but just to sum it up is we wanted to take this company public because we knew we really had something special in these brands, and that's starting to come to life as we play out our strategy.
jay sole -- ubs -- analyst
understood. maybe if i can ask one more. just on that point. you mentioned the virtuous cycle of growth. and the company seems to be funding a lot of that demand creation, scott, that you mentioned with the strong gross margin gains. it sounds like you're talking about the the top line could really accelerate the top line growth rate, i mean could accelerate over the long term, even in the second half of the year. is that fair? maybe just can you connect the dots for us on how these demand creation investments are really going to -- whether it's category expansion or new business wins, like how that's really going to drive the top line to a growth rate above maybe what we've seen in the past?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. good morning jay, it's rustin. i'll go ahead and take that. yes, you absolutely are correct on the virtuous cycle. it's something we talk about quite a bit. our strategy really is to start to grow that top line revenue, which you've seen us do over the last several quarters and expand gross margins to create that oxygen in the p&l. and so you've seen some pretty significant gross margin gains as well with some of the efforts we've taken to obviously distort and accelerate growth in more accretive channels quality of sales restructuring actions, and that's creating that oxygen in the p&l that's really allowing us to distort investments in the brands and capabilities that scott talked about earlier to drive that future top line growth while delivering the enhanced operating margins. and i think that's really important. you've heard us talk a lot about earning our way to investing into these brands. and we're clearly doing that, and you're seeing the investments start to manifest. and i think this quarter's results are a great illustration of kind of how that virtuous cycle comes to live.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of erinn murphy with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
erinn murphy -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning. i was hoping you could speak a little bit more about the shelf space gains that you're securing across a number of new categories and retailers? and if you could talk about the phasing of some of these new programs? and then a follow-up for rustin. i guess, relatedly, why would that not imply a better than a 2% back half sales guide? i mean by running the math, if we're at mid-teens, it feels like the back half is around 2%, so just curious with some of the sell-in why that would not be higher?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
good morning, erinn. on i'll go ahead and start. we're really pleased, erinn. one of the things is the brands hadn't had a chance to go ahead and really flex what they can do and the consumer has really shown us a really big opportunity for us to go ahead into different categories and channels. and one of the things that we did is from the very beginning, we identified several categories, outdoor, workwear and t-shirts that are really fundamental to what we do. and we have seen that as we've gone ahead and built and this is a great complement to our teams, built incredible product at a really great value with a trusted brand and brought those to these different categories that we've seen really good acceptance. we've seen really good shelf space, as you mentioned, acceptance. and that has been translating for a while, as we've talked about in several of our last calls, but now it's really starting to take hold. and we talked about outdoor our last couple of calls with some big programs internationally and domestically.
and now we're just layering on with some really key customers like academy here and intersport in europe and the workwear was a big topic at investor day, really important for us from a category standpoint and we had a customer that was going to come in with almost 2,000 doors. and because the program is so good, the product is so good, and it's such a great value, they're going to come in at 3,300 doors in the fall. so another great example of how we're phasing that in. and then we've talked a little bit from a t-shirt standpoint, a big $100 billion category, which complements our bottoms denims business really well for both genders globally. -- a category we should be stronger in. we've hired a really good team there. we're really excited about that. and we're going to address that in several different categories and areas within t-shirts. and we've won a couple of big programs here recently, which we're really pleased about 1,700-plus stores that will happen both in fall and spring. so as you can see, a lot of concentrated effort into these categories that we hadn't been in before but are really complementary to what we do as a company.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, erinn, it's rustin, too. good morning. i'll take the second part of your question about the sales improvement in the back half. you're correct in terms of when you look at the guide that we issued this morning, it implies a low single-digit back half improvement relative to 2020. but i also want to highlight, you have to take into consideration as well the strategic exits that we made in the fourth quarter of 2020, specifically to reduce the vf fleet in half, discontinue the sale of third-party branded goods in all of our domestic outlets and then transition the india business from direct to a licensed model. all of those are weighted disproportionately a little bit more toward the back half because. clearly, q2 was most impacted last year as it related to covid. and so you need to take that into consideration that mid-single-digit annual impact from those strategic exits as well, a little bit more weighted on that back half. hopefully, that helps answer your question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of adrienne yih with barclays. please proceed with your question.
adrienne yih -- barclays -- analyst
good morning everybody. congratulations. great quarter. scott, so i always like to ask you about sort of high-level trends, levi's recent success with their denim offering, the strike this morning? i know not exactly your price point, but reporting kind of blowout numbers over 2019. and so how are you seeing back-to-school denim shaping up? and then how do you foresee it as we go into kind of the back half of the year? more importantly, how long can that trend last? and then for rustin, i really want to focus on -- you talked about modest inflation, maybe hitting the auc, but then the gross margins are so robust. it seems like either your just -- your supply chain is working for you. so any commentary on how you're going to manage that? and then remind us that the far east really is not impactful to you in terms of sourcing? thank you so much.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
great. i'll go ahead and start, adrian, good morning. nice to hear from you. so a couple of things. let's start with that. let's start with back-to-school. i have a school age child at home, and we haven't bought school support him for two years. he's 40 pounds of [indecipherable]. there's no way he can fit into school close for two years ago. in addition to the fact that styles and trends have changed in those two years. so we think there's really some pent-up demand because kids just aren't going to want to go back to the close they were in, and they aren't going to fit those. and there was no school back-to-school season at all last year. so we believe that's going to be really good for both us, the industry and also our consumers and our customers. so that will be a good moment in time for us all as we return to normal. as far as denim goes, you've seen our survey that we put out a little while ago, and we think that there is a positive just structural change, leaving the globe into casualization.
and we've seen it in all the major altan markets across the globe, whether it be london, paris, new york city, san francisco, people are moving to casualization as the worker comes back into the office, even if it's a flex environment, it doesn't matter. they're wanting to be casual like they were at home. so they're reinvesting a casual wardrobe, which i don't believe is cyclical, i believe it's here to stay for the long term going forward. and then i would also complement that with we like where we are and where we're positioned as a company because if you think about the evolution of our strategy, and we've only been around now as a public company for a shade over two years. we've been able to go ahead and build these great categories like outdoor workwear and t-shirts that are very complementary that we believe are at the very beginning stages of being powerful categories for us as a company over the very long term. so as i think about the future, i think about denim, i think about the categories that we've entered and the opportunities that we have in front of us in really, really exciting.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and adrienne, it's rustin. good morning. i'll go ahead and take the second part of your question. first, let me touch upon kind of the last bullet that you mentioned, which was kind of far east sourcing. so just as a reminder for everyone, our supply chain, our global diversified supply chain, we really feel is differentiated for us and does offer a competitive advantage. with a little over 1/3 of our global production internally manufactured in this hemisphere and approximately 2/3 that are sourced out of overseas predominantly out of asia. as we think a little bit about the second half gross margin, to your question, we clearly have focused on gross margin expansion. it's an important part of that virtuous cycle that you heard me speak about a minute ago with jay just really creating that oxygen to be able to invest back into our brands. and over the last four quarters, you've seen triple-digit growth from us in that expansion and really on the fundamental structural basis, being driven by that distorted growth in those accretive channels, the geographies and categories we've talked about as well as pursuing quality of sales and restructuring actions. and we anticipate those structural benefits will continue into the back half of 2021 and beyond.
however, we do anticipate they will be moderated in part by some of the elevated transitory cost to chase some of the incremental demand that scott talked about and we talked about earlier. certainly, the global supply chain disruption is well chronicled. and as we've stated today and previously, we're not immune from that, but we are certainly pursuing the demand and the momentum that we've got behind our brands. and our second half gross margin outlook has taken those factors into consideration. your last point was really about inflation. and as we think about moving forward next year, we mentioned a little bit at investor day that we anticipated that 2022 and 2023 gross margin improvement to be modestly more weighted toward 2023 and -- as some of these growth catalysts that we're investing in, like digital and international opportunities really scale. and so we're really proud about the guidance -- i mean, sorry, the gross margin we're delivering this year and would just draw you to sort of the conclusion in my remarks that the gross margin in our outlook here is projected to be up nearly 400 basis points compared to adjusted gross margin in 2019. so clearly a focal point for us and will remain so going forward. thanks adrienne.

thank you. our next questions come from the line of bob drbul with guggenheim securities. please proceed with your question.
bob drbul -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hey guys. good morning. congratulations. nice work.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks bob.
bob drbul -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
i guess i have two questions. the first one is with the announcement of the share repurchase program, does that imply just in the near term that m&a is off the table? you talked a little bit about your capital allocation. just wondering if you can maybe address that as you think about horizon one and the horizon 2. and then i think the second question i have, i'm not sure if you gave it, rustin, but some of the buckets in this gross margin expansion. i don't know if you could sort of break it down a little bit more just around where you see how it delivered in the second quarter, but also when you look at this outlook for the rest of the year, the biggest buckets, etc., would be helpful? thanks.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
bob, it's scott. good morning. thanks for the question. from the share repo standpoint, i think it all boils down to, as we talked about in the investor day, we're creating $1 billion in cash over the next three years. so as we've talked about from an optionality standpoint and as we phased into horizon 2, like we've talked about, it's really about optionality. and we think it's all in an equation in that we can do multiple things. so we're really happy about the share buyback. we think that's just a component of our allocation here as we go forward. it's part of our options. and everything is still on the table and will be as we move forward, and we'll continue to update the team and everybody going forward. so we feel real good.
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning. bob, i'll take the second part on the gross margin in the second quarter, and you've certainly seen this trend continue for the last several quarters, as i've talked about. this was our fourth consecutive quarter with triple-digit margin improvement has been a focal point for us, certainly focusing on those structural drivers, really being favorable channel mix geographic and product mix. those are kind of the largest drivers, i would say, bob, of that. and certainly, as we're continuing to invest in these under-indexed categories and geographies, as we've talked about, we see that continuing. certainly q2 did. benefit from free items such as the downtime. you recall last year, we modified our production in our own facilities. in account for covid impact of last year. so, roughly half of that improvements in the second quarter, relatively to last year. just got to do the discreet items last year. but certainly the gross margin expansion remains focal point for us. it's critical and just enables us to invest in to the brands. as you heard me mention multiple times this morning. so really happy with the delivery on q2. it allowed us to exceed our expectations this quarter.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of sam poser with williams trading. please proceed with your question.
sam poser -- williams trading -- analyst
good morning thank you for taking my question. just i want to follow up on the marketing spend, i guess, and the gross margin. but really, in the quarter, did you spend more in your demand creation investments than you anticipated? or did you just -- or you get a better return -- can you measure the return on those investments? and then in the guidance of the increased investments in the back half of the year. what kind of return are you expecting on that?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. sam, good morning. it's rustin. i'll go ahead and take that. certainly, we will talk to the marketing spend in the quarter, but make it a little bit more general comments for you. certainly, you know, sam, with all the engagements we've had, we're a total shareholder return driven organization. and as we look at investments, scott and i, that we can make into the brands and into the business and capabilities. we measure everything that we do on a tsr return basis on both the near-term and a long-term perspective. so certainly, we've been distorting investments into things like digital from a marketing perspective. and i think you certainly saw the results of that play out this quarter. we talked a little bit about the growth in the quarter, but on a two-year stack basis, both digital wholesale and our own.com, very impressive results relative to 2019. so we're very happy about the investments that we're making. and now that we are live on the erp side in both north america and europe, certainly an opportunity we see to distort and amplify those investments in the back half here that not only helps deliver the back half of 2021, sam, but really accelerates the momentum moving into 2022, which is really important for us.
sam poser -- williams trading -- analyst
no, i do understand that. i looking really for -- it sounds like based on your guidance that you're going to probably delever your sg&a in the back half of the year and you got good leverage in the front half of the year. and that's telling me that just sort of automatically some of those investments on a relative basis, it just won't give you the kind of same return. so i'm really trying to figure out how much of the beat in q2 was better return on those investments? and are you sort of guiding it the same way you guided q2 relative to those investments upfront? i'm saying because you guide the year and then do better because it sounds to me like you're getting a better sort of near-term result than you may have put into the numbers despite the fact it's helping the long term and it was intended to help the long term?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. and sam, i would just say that we measure the returns on both the near-term and a long-term basis. and clearly, as we distort investments on the marketing side specifically, we are looking more to accelerate the brands and the strength that they're demonstrating in this quarter to continue to accelerate in future quarters. so it's not just the next quarter. we're looking for the longer term as well. and obviously, as you've seen, the investments that we're making in the brands certainly have been paying off in terms of the top line growth.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of brook roach with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
brook roach -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning. and thanks for taking our questions. scott, rustin, on digital continues to deliver momentum. can you talk to the areas where you're seeing the most success, whether that's within a particular customer segment, conversion or new customer acquisition?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
yes, it certainly can. so brook, i think you have to start at the beginning of the journey. we were so under-indexed in digital, and it wasn't just from the standpoint of physical. we've now brought ourselves up to speed from an erp standpoint, putting the right platforms around the globe. that's at an infancy stage. then when we started the company, we went ahead and had to hire the right teams, and we've started to do that in a pretty robust way. we hired the right leader. and then we had to start thinking about how we communicate in a powerful way with our consumers, and we started to do that with some really good programs. and then we started to build better product into different categories like we've talked about today to make our site more robust and more exciting from a content standpoint for that consumer to come into and join the journey with us going forward. so at the beginning of that journey, we saw some really good core momentum from the standpoint the core really did well. but what's happened as that journey has kind of expanded and we've gone into other categories, we've seen really good gender momentum across the globe, both male and female, and we've seen really good category momentum.
so what i mean by that is our outdoor line for instance, has done really well. and then there's one other thing that i think is really interesting. our consumer is now starting to come to us because, one, they like the story and they like what they're seeing and hearing, and they're very pleased with the product. but in addition to that, we've done some really incredible collabs.. and those collabs are highlighted on our digital presence, too. so if you think about our big wrangler billabong that we have going on right now, as we head into back-to-school, that's done really well. and if you think about lee and our hundreds some of the things that they've done recently, those have done really well. so combining all of those assets together and being at the very early stages in building better products and expanding categories, we really like how the consumer is communicating with us going forward in our digital space. rustin, would you add anything there?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think you said it well, scott. the only thing i would add, brook, as well is that we've continued to make investments in our capabilities. and so certainly, we're under-indexed. we're at about 5% of revenue now. we see that opportunity as we laid out at investor day moving to 10% penetration. in all the areas, scott mentioned in terms of product and consumer very, very relevant. we've also made investments on the technology side, as you well know, going on to new platforms in 2020 in both north america and europe. and i think you're starting to see those results manifest in our p&l here. so lots of early days, lots of momentum and lots of opportunities still to go broad.
brook roach -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks. and if i could just ask one quick follow-up. can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing across your key u.s. wholesale partners maybe both in terms of program momentum at recently launched new initiatives or new business versus some of your legacy partners with more established programs such as western versus department store, off-mall department store versus mass? thank you.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
sure. thanks, brook. i'll take that. yes, we're -- like we mentioned in our preprepared remarks, we're really pleased with all the programs that we're launching across the board. i think it goes back to we win with winners. we've talked about that a lot. we are really pleased with how we placed ourselves in that line of communication and with the big customers that we have across the globe. and it's been all part of the strategy from horizon one win with winners and go forward, build great product that the consumer loves, the takeout will be there and continue to drive that with really good demand creation platforms. so from a strategic standpoint, we are really running our playbook and we're pleased with it right now.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of jim duffy with stifel. please proceed with your question.
jim duffy -- stifel -- analyst
thank you. good morning guys. great execution. congrats on g etting the erp implementation through. rustin, i want to build on other questions on the gross margins. sorry to do so. but just working through the annual guidance, it looks like it implies roughly a 44% gross margin for the back half of the year. that's more than 200 basis points below the run rate in the first half of the year. can you just maybe itemize some of the factors that would cause it to be such a big step down? and you mentioned pricing in your prepared remarks. i'm curious if you could speak to the balance between pricing and input cost inflation and how we should think about pricing as a tool to leverage brand vitality and manage the margins?
rustin welton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so let me go ahead and start here, jim, on the gross margin side. absolutely, you are correct. it implies kind of our guide 43%, 44% gross margin in the back half. and a couple of things that i would highlight certainly, our first half was around 46%. that was definitely a high watermark for us in the back half of last year, we were more around the 43% range. so certainly, continuing to strengthen and improve there. a couple of things as we're thinking about the back half. we mentioned in our prepared remarks in a couple of times here, some of the global supply chain disruptions and the fact that we're seeing increased demand. and so from our standpoint, we do see elevated transitory costs in the second half to meet some of that demand. and we've certainly reflected that in the gross margin outlook for the second half of the year. also, as scott mentioned and you've heard us talk numerous times, still a lot of uncertainty out there in the marketplace and very, very fluid. so we certainly have taken that into consideration as we've guided gross margin here in the back half of well. so i'll flip it over to scott and scott, if you want to take the second part of that with the question around inflation and pricing, that would be great.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer and board member
thanks jim, good to hear from you. jim, we're being really strategic with our pricing as we go forward. we're investing in the brands, as you know, and we're also investing -- we haven't talked a lot about it on this call, but from an innovation standpoint, pretty significantly to go ahead and keep our brands first and foremost in front of the consumer's mind. so we really like where we are. one of the things that we've talked about that i think is really important for our brands is that we offer incredible value already. so we have trusted brands. and in times like this jim being a value brand with a great brand behind it, being a value play with a great brand behind it with high, high quality and innovating and coming into different channels only helps us going forward. so that's the investment that we're making to go forward and make sure that we're putting ourselves, our brands and our company in a really good place.

operator
greetings and welcome to kontoor brands q3 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn this conference over to your host, mr. eric tracy, vice president, corporate finance and investor relations. thank you, sir. you may begin your presentation.
eric tracy -- senior director of investor relations
thank you, operator, and welcome to kontoor brands third quarter earnings conference call. participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. [operator instructions]. joining me on today's call are kontoor brands' chair, president and chief executive officer, scott baxter; and chief financial officer, rustin welton. following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. we anticipate the call will last about an hour. scott?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & chairman
thanks, eric, and hello to everyone joining us today. if you take one thing away from today's call, let it be this, kontoor and our wrangler and lee brands are in a meaningfully different and advantageous place compared to our past. we are now uniquely positioned to win in the marketplace and to create future value for all our stakeholders. this was evident in our third quarter results, and it's even more evident in the confidence we have in raising our guidance for fiscal '21 and the momentum we see in the holiday and fiscal '22. more on this in a bit. but simply put, our strategies are working.
our investments are yielding superior returns through the elevation of our brands, increasing permission to price and accelerating growth. no doubt, the current macro environment is placing significant challenges on companies and people. and as we've stated, kontoor is not immune, but we are keenly focused on controlling the controllables and on the execution of our strategic playbook that has consistently proven itself in setting our foundation during horizon one and now into horizon two where we'll look to catalyze growth. when we started the kontoor journey almost three years ago, our top priority in establishing our organizational culture was to take care of each other. and while we could not have predicted the obstacles we would face in the ensuing years, we believe that this core tenet and the great experience of our team could help us not only navigate difficult times but thrive through them. and i believe we have done just that.
so i want to thank our colleagues around the world for the ongoing collaboration, teamwork and resiliency and continuing to take care and support one another. so how are our strategies driving near-term results? let me provide some proof points from the third quarter that showcased our strategic emphasis on catalyzing growth across four key areas: first, elevating and accelerating our core u.s. business; second, channel expansion, primarily in our d2c and digital ecosystem; third, diversifying our product mix through category extensions, including outdoor, workwear and t-shirts; and fourth, expanding the brands geographically with a focus on china.
overall, global kontoor reported a revenue increase of 12% compared to last year and 2% to 2019. important to note, this included a negative high single-digit impact from strategic quality of sales actions within our vfo and india businesses. excluding these actions, global kontoor reported revenue would have been up 11% over 2019, far outpacing the market. our u.s. business during the third quarter increased 8%, not only to 2020, but also 8% to 2019. again, this includes the impact of our proactive measures within our vfo operations. so excluding these actions, the u.s. business would have been up high teens in the third quarter compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. and what's crucial is that this growth is healthy, balanced and broad-based across brands, categories and channels.
the u.s. was once again led by our rapidly evolving digital platforms with u.s.-owned dot-com increasing 118% and digital wholesale increasing 237% compared to 2019. u.s. wholesale increased 15% during the quarter, with outsized performance within our western business augmented by emerging new programs in outdoor, atg, workwear and female. in demonstrating the health of the lee and wrangler brands, our elevated position in the marketplace and increasing ability to take price, our digital aurs are up high single digits in the u.s. year-to-date. turning next to our global digital business. our results in the quarter highlight how our strategic investments are unlocking significant value and connecting us closer to our consumer more than ever before.
q3 saw great growth over last year, but was even more impressive compared with 2019 with reported global own.com in digital wholesale increasing 88% and 182% versus pre-pandemic levels. and the runway for future growth remains significant as we are still highly under-indexed in this accretive channel relative to our peers. our new erp platform will enhance our digital efforts. as we globalize our operations, we will continue to lean in on investments to achieve our goal of 10% digital penetration over the next three years. and while our channel and digital evolution has been extraordinary, we are as equally excited by the performance of our tremendous expansion of new categories beyond denim, including outdoor, workwear, t-shirts, western and female.
while our foundation lies in denim, we are rapidly developing a more diversified portfolio that augments and enhances our core offering. within outdoor and our atg line, we are leveraging great performance innovations to drive incremental penetration of existing retail partnerships, while also expanding into new points of distribution across the outdoor specialty and sporting goods channels both domestically and abroad. during the third quarter, our u.s. outdoor business saw 50% growth compared to 2019. our test of atg with academy sports here in the u.s. and intersport in europe are going very well, and we are excited about the opportunities for further expansion in these brand-elevating points of additional distribution for the line.
our workwear business is also seeing great momentum as reflected in the third quarter results, with more than 60% growth in the u.s. compared to 2019, as we discussed on our last call. we more than doubled our door count to over 3,000 stores for fall '21 compared to spring with one of our key domestic retail partners, and we are really excited about the future opportunities this program affords us in the quarters to come. and the development of our t-shirt category is building momentum with significant new programs set for spring '22. in addition to these new outdoor workwear and t-shirt categories, our wrangler modern female and western businesses in the u.s. are performing exceptionally well with substantial year-over-year growth during the quarter, up more than 100% and 50%, respectively.
the broad-based third quarter performance across categories is a direct function of how investments are generating incremental business development opportunities for our brands. and finally, we continue to catalyze growth geographically with solid results in the quarter despite an uneven covid environment across the globe. even with erp go-live in july, our european business saw nice year-over-year improvements up 19% in constant currency compared with 2020 driven by digital, brick-and-mortar reopening and new business development. and in china, our ongoing strategic investments continue to yield strong results, reported third quarter revenue increasing 22% and up 14% in constant currency.
you've heard from some regarding a broader slowdown in china. and while we haven't seen impacts to our business, we are obviously monitoring this closely. however, our brands are in distinctly advantaged positions in the market. lee has over two decades of experience in the region and is uniquely connected with the chinese culture while wrangler is just getting started in china with significant white space ahead, affording us the opportunity to grow in the most productive manner. to fuel this growth across core channels, categories and geographies, you've heard us talk quite a bit about investing behind key enablers.
these pillars in support of growth include enhancing and amplifying demand creation platforms; scaling product and manufacturing innovation with sustainability and esg as our guiding tenet; unlocking efficiency and productivity gains for the implementation of global erp supply chain and digital infrastructure; and last, leveraging our world-class talent to build a purpose-led high-performance and increasingly growth-minded culture. i'm going to focus my comments today on our man creation efforts, while rustin will provide greater insights with respect to our erp implementation and supply chain. the reason i want to highlight our investments in demand creation is pretty straightforward. we are doing things with both the wrangler and lee brands that we've simply never done before. this is reflected in the brand's recently launched marketing campaigns.
first with lee. if you haven't had a chance to see our newly original campaign that launched in october, i would encourage you to go to lee.com to check it out. hearing me talk about it simply doesn't do it justice. i promise you we'll be impressed at how this modern, elevated brand expression brings the lee transformation to life and just how differently the brand is showing up in the marketplace. produced in collaboration with preeminent photographer and creative director, mark seliger, and sets the title track struck by lenny kravitz, the work celebrates and encourages those who push boundaries through creativity, ingenuity and hard work. our cast of originals reflects the multifaceted and diverse lee consumer from climate warrior and fashion icon, quanta chasing horse; venice beach skateboarding legend, hayden mckenna, the unique character and personality of each cast member reflects what has always made lee original, the stories behind those who wear them.
the campaign went live in north america in october and includes most all media platforms, with a heavy lean toward digital that will run on streaming services such as disney and hulu as well as high-impact display and key social media platforms, including the brand's launch on tiktok. and for those of you in new york, we've also introduced lee originals on the streets of the city where originality and creativity thrive via strategic out-of-home media in soho, bushwook and williamsburg. the global campaign will be supported by existing and new collaborations and partnerships with key influencers. we are excited about lee's recent launch and newest partnerships with iconic brand pendleton.
this limited edition just dropped this week and reimagines essentials from the brand's combined 200-plus years in american apparel. each pair of gene is made in the u.s. with some of the last remaining salvage denim from cone denim's white oak mill in greensboro, north carolina. and this is just the beginning of lee's new brand messaging and repositioning. we couldn't be more excited to share what's on the horizon in the quarters to come. turning to the wrangler demand creation platform, the brand's newest global ad campaign with a right of life debuted in september in north america with live coverage on the nfl network. the campaign will also run on retail, digital and social media platforms across north america and europe. and our collaborations with the wrangler brand just keep building.
we had the initial launch of our billabong and wrangler collab in august with a second drop in september, tying perfectly for back-to-school, the partnership helped drive significant brand awareness with 1.7 million videos created on tiktok using our #summermashup. and beginning this fall, wrangler is officially partnering with yellowstone for much of the anticipated new season of the highly acclaimed most-watched series on cable tv. wrangler will always be a symbol of authentic western fashion.
the wrangler and yellowstone collaboration came to fruition after much of the denim apparel was organically seen on the show's beloved characters. collaborating with paramount network's yellowstone brings the lifestyle we've embodied for decades into the spotlight allows us to reach a new audience that is now learning what it means to evoke the cowboy spirit. we're thrilled to be able to add a layer of authenticity to the closets of yellowstone fans as appreciation for the western lifestyle continues to surge in popularity in mainstream culture and fashion.
augmenting our collabs, the brand continues to partner with key influencers that reach a younger, more diverse consumer base. for spring '22, georgia may jagger will continue her role as lead brand ambassador and the female face of wrangler, and we are thrilled to announce our partnership with r&b grammy-winning musician leon bridges. the two-season collaboration will launch in spring of '22 with leon as the face of wrangler's men's global product line, followed by a fall limited edition collaboration of key denim in western styles inspired by iconic silhouettes from our archives in leon's personal style.
finally, as we look to 2022, our demand creation efforts only build in support of commemorating the wrangler brand's 75th anniversary. we have a year-long celebration planned to honor wrangler's historic presence in music and fashion while also highlighting the courage, optimism and triumph of western culture. let me close with this. as you can see, there is a lot to be excited about with many proof points that our strategies and investments are fueling broad-based strength across our business. we will continue to amplify these strategic investments, particularly in demand creation and digital during the fourth quarter in support of our planned accelerating top line growth algorithm.
and while we are extremely proud of how we've navigated the last few years in establishing a solid foundation of which to build despite the turbulent macro environment, i want to share a few thoughts on why we are even more confident about what lies ahead. rustin will provide more details, but a few items based on our current views that support this confidence as we look to 2022. first, we expect fiscal '22 revenue to accelerate above the long-term target of mid-single digits we established at our recent investor day with particular strength in the first half, up low double digits; and second, despite macro inflationary pressures, we anticipate '22 gross margins to be at or above '21 levels.
we possess a powerful combination of accelerating fundamental drivers and increasing capital allocation optionality that afford us the opportunity to deliver consistent near-term results while continuing to invest in our business and fund shareholder-friendly actions, including our recent dividend increase of 15% as well as opportunistic share repurchases during the third quarter. as i said at start, kontoor is in a unique position of strength in the marketplace, and we look forward to executing and delivering superior future tsr for all of our stakeholders. rustin?
rustin welton -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thank you, scott, and thank you all for joining us on today's call. as scott outlined, we are very pleased with our third quarter results and the momentum of the business as we head into holiday in 2022. simply put, our brands are as healthy as they have ever been with the investments made and solid foundation that has been established since the spin. before turning to the quarterly review, i want to address a couple of topics that i know are top of mind: macroeconomic inflation and supply chain challenges as well as the status of the erp implementation. with respect to the widely discussed industry supply chain disruptions, cotton pricing and inflationary pressures, i want to emphasize the following points that we have repeatedly stressed.
first, while we are not immune to these issues, we continue to leverage the agility of our best-in-class supply chain to navigate the environment. and second, we remain focused on what we can control and are steadfastly executing our strategic playbook. in terms of the supply chain, we believe we are relatively advantaged in our position. our diversified global supply chain operations are differentiated with over 1/3 of our global production coming from our internal manufacturing facilities in the western hemisphere, with the balance being sourced from over 20 countries and approximately 225 facilities around the world. no single supplier makes up more than 10% of our cost of goods sold. internal manufacturing, combined with contracting in the western hemisphere, gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and allows for enhanced inventory management in the north american market.
our significant footprint in the western hemisphere has provided several advantages over the past few years, including being able to rapidly alter production to align with changing demand signals, minimizing excess and distressed inventory and mitigating exposure to congested coastal ports with extended lead times. in terms of sourcing, i know there are questions around china and vietnam exposure so i wanted to address each quickly. less than 3% of our product comes from china and is mostly china for china product, and less than 1% of our product comes from vietnam. finally, although we believe our global diversified supply chain is relatively advantaged, we have incurred elevated transitory costs as we anticipated and reflected in our revised outlook last quarter.
these transitory costs were largely driven by air freight as we chase production to meet the accelerated strong demand that scott highlighted earlier. in terms of inflation and cotton experience roughly a decade ago, we want to be very clear. our model and our brands are significantly better positioned now to offset pressures. so what gives us confidence to make this statement? let me provide the following specific reasons. first, our investments into our brands, from design to innovation to demand creation are substantially elevated to support higher price points in aurs. for illustration of how we are distorting investments, we anticipate our full year demand creation spend in 2021 to be up approximately 40% versus 2020, increasing approximately 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue and up approximately 20% versus 2019.
second, our product assortment and composition has evolved with the emergence of new categories like wrangler atg. distorted growth in categories like outdoor, channels like digital and geographies like international are allowing us to mix up to higher aurs. third, our cotton composition as a percentage of cost of goods sold, mid-teens today, has diversified into more synthetic fabrications in denim bottoms as well as outdoor performance, atg and tops. fourth, our domestic distribution continues to evolve into healthier channels and retailers. a decade ago, our first quality sales were predominantly in the wholesale channel and had much greater exposure to challenged mass and mid-tier retailers, such as sears, kmart and shopko. today, with our segmented offering, our brands have amplified their tiers of distribution in wholesale, particularly in areas such as western and digital and begun to distort growth in our own dot-com platforms.
fifth, structural mix shifts to accretive channels such as digital and international have and should continue to support gross margin, particularly as we remain underpenetrated relative to the market in these areas. finally, given ongoing negotiations, we won't dimensionalize our inflation and pricing assumptions for 2022. but i will say, we have good visibility into the first half and are confident in the back half given current market conditions. but i want to reiterate what scott stated earlier, the combination of executing pricing actions higher aurs and structurally accretive mix shifts support our view based on current market conditions, that full year '22 gross margins will be at or above full year '21 levels. turning to the erp. on our q2 earnings call, we shared that we had gone live on our final regional implementation in emea early in the third quarter.
today, i'm very pleased to report that we also exited the final transition service agreements, or tsas, with our former parent company in the third quarter. we are very pleased and proud of the team who has worked on this critical initiative for kontoor as the erp platform is foundational for the continued globalization of the business. now let's get to our third quarter review. i will focus my comments on key highlights and refer you to this morning's release for additional detail on the quarter. unless otherwise stated, growth rates are in constant currency compared to the third quarter of 2020. also, given the impacts covid-19 had on prior year results, i will provide select references to the same quarter in 2019 for additional context where appropriate, beginning with revenue, global revenue increased 11%.
strategic actions to rationalize our vf outlet fleet in the u.s., discontinue the sale of third-party branded products in all domestic outlet stores and transition to a new licensed business model in india represented approximately six points of headwind in the quarter compared to 2020. compared to revenue in the third quarter of 2019, global revenue increased 1% or 9%, excluding our strategic actions. on a regional basis for the quarter, u.s. revenues increased 8% compared to the same quarter last year. growth was broad-based with strength in digital, wholesale and western. wrangler's outdoor and female businesses also saw strong gains in the quarter. within our digital business, u.s. own.com and u.s. digital wholesale increased 52% and 90%, respectively, compared to the same quarter in 2020.
as scott mentioned, these growth rates were even stronger compared to 2019 with own.com and digital wholesale increasing 118% and 237% versus pre-pandemic levels. outpacing the u.s., international revenues increased 20%. growth in the quarter was partially impacted by the previously discussed timing shift into q2 due to the european erp go-live. despite this shift, we saw strength in all channels, double-digit growth in china and continued strength in our digital businesses. turning to our brands. global revenue of our wrangler brand increased 21%. wrangler u.s. revenue increased 20%, driven by strength in our workwear and western businesses new focus areas such as outdoor and female as well as ongoing gains in digital with digital wholesale and own.com increasing 93% and 67%, respectively.
compared to the third quarter of 2019, wrangler u.s. own.com increased 142%. wrangler international revenue increased 32%, another proof point that our distorted investments in geographic expansion are paying off. strength from digital, new business development wins including our atg program in the sporting goods channel were partially offset by the previously mentioned timing shift in europe. lee brand global revenue increased 4%. in the u.s., strength from improving sell-through of new programs and increases in digital was more than offset by the previously mentioned strategic actions that accounted for nearly five points of headwind, demand fulfillment challenges and comparisons to a significant new distribution gain in the third quarter of 2020.
lee u.s. revenue decreased 4% compared to the same quarter last year but is expected to return to strong growth in the fourth quarter. lee international revenue increased 15% driven by amplified investments with digital and the ongoing recovery in our brick-and-mortar business. and finally, from a channel perspective, we saw continued broad-based strength compared to the same quarter in 2020. u.s. wholesale increased 15%, while non-u.s. wholesale grew 21%. despite the previously mentioned strategic actions within the vfo operations, global branded d2c increased 2% on a reported basis and was flat in constant currency with own.com up 39%.
now on to gross margin. adjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points to 44.1% of revenue. favorable channel, customer and product mix as well as business model changes were the primary drivers of the gains, partially offset by increased air freight. i will provide more on our gross margin expectations shortly, but we continue to see benefits from the structural margin enhancements i previously discussed. mix shifts to highly accretive channels and geographies, proactive supply chain initiatives and aur mix supported by innovation. adjusted sg&a increased $36 million versus last year to $186 million. higher demand creation, digital investments and compensation costs more than offset better fixed cost leverage on improving revenue and restructuring benefits.
prior year comparisons were affected by reduced spending in 2020 in light of covid uncertainty. as we have discussed and as seen in the third quarter, we believe these strategic investments such as in digital and demand creation will continue to unlock our catalyzing growth strategy and support expected demand in the fourth quarter and accelerating top line into 2022. adjusted earnings per share was $1.28 compared to $1.33 in the same period in the prior year and compared to $0.95 in the third quarter of 2019. now turning to our balance sheet. third quarter inventories decreased 5% compared to last year. the decline reflects the fourth quarter 2020 actions to reduce the fleet and discontinue the sale of third-party branded products in our domestic outlets as well as the business model change in india.
excluding these actions, inventory increased approximately 4% compared to the prior year in support of chasing higher projected demand. we finished the third quarter with net debt or long-term debt less cash of $576 million and $215 million in cash and equivalents. our net leverage ratio or net debt divided by trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda at the end of the third quarter was 1.4 times, within our targeted range of one to 2 times. and as previously announced, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.46 per share, an increase of 15%, a testament to our board's confidence in the strength of improving fundamentals. finally, during the quarter, we repurchased $10 million in common stock. at the end of the third quarter, we had $190 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. when combined with the strong dividend, we've returned a total of $79 million to shareholders through the first three quarters of 2021.
we will continue to use the share repurchase program to offset dilution while also opportunistically buying shares as market conditions warrant. these accretive shareholder-friendly actions reflect our increasing capital allocation optionality, allowing us to continue to invest in our brands and business while productively returning excess cash to shareholders. this is powerful and further highlights how our model is differentiated. and now on to our outlook. based on the strength of the third quarter and demand momentum for our brands, we are raising our fiscal 2021 outlook of new gross margin and adjusted eps.
revenue is now expected to increase in the high teens range over 2020 to $2.47 billion to $2.48 billion as compared to a mid-teens range in the prior guidance. this includes the mid-single-digit impact from the vf outlet actions and india business model changes. unpacking this a bit further, and importantly, comparing to pre-pandemic 2019 levels, third quarter 2021 revenue increased 1% compared to 2019 and was up 9%, excluding the impact from the strategic actions in vfo in india. our guidance implies fourth quarter revenue will be up 3% to 4% compared with 2019 or up 13%, excluding the impact from the strategic actions in vfo in india.
at the midpoint of our guidance, 2021 revenue is expected to be approximately 6% above 2019 levels, excluding the strategic actions, well above most in the industry. adjusted gross margin is now expected to increase at the high end of the prior guidance range of 44.5% to 45% of revenue compared to 41.2% achieved in 2020. the increase is expected to be driven by growth in more accretive channels such as digital and international, somewhat tempered by higher transitory airfreight expenses in support of strong demand. sg&a investments will continue to be made in brands and capabilities.
due to the strengthening revenue and gross margin outlook during the fourth quarter, the company expects to make incremental sg&a investments in demand creation and digital to support expected accelerating revenue growth in 2022. specifically, compared to our prior guidance, we have chosen to invest an additional $15 million in demand creation and digital during the fourth quarter. adjusted eps is now expected to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.20 per share as compared to $3.90 to $4 per share in the prior guidance. this eps guidance does not assume the benefit of any future share repurchases.
this eps guidance includes a $0.20 impact from the incremental demand creation and digital investments in the fourth quarter compared to prior guidance, somewhat offset by lower interest expense, a lower expected effective tax rate and year-to-date share repurchases, which, in aggregate, should benefit eps by approximately $0.19. finally, in light of the current environment, i would like to close with a few additional comments on 2022. first, our catalyzing growth strategy is working. the health of and demand for our brands has never been better. and this is manifesting and accelerating demand going into 2022. based on solid visibility, we expect 2022 revenues to increase at a rate above our mid-single-digit long-term algorithm outlined at our investor day.
we expect first half top line growth to be particularly strong, up low double digits. and second, we are not immune to the current inflationary environment. however, assuming current conditions, our best-in-class supply chain, combined with increasing permission to price and elevated aurs as well as expected ongoing benefits from structurally accretive mix shifts, we anticipate 2022 full year gross margins to be at or above 2021 levels. to close, i want to reiterate scott's comments on the momentum of the business as we head into holiday and the first half of 2022. our brands are as well positioned as they have ever been, and we are well on our way to meet and exceed our multiyear targets. this concludes our prepared remarks, and i will now turn the call back to our operator. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of adrienne yih with barclays.
adrienne yih -- barclays -- analyst
great. and boy, that's a whole lot of good news in 30 months. so congrats, really well done. my first question is on the low double-digit first half guidance. there are a few companies that are willing to go out and start giving us '22 guide. so there clearly, what you talked about is things that you're seeing up.
and so my question is, are you seeing that in the order book? and how much confidence do you have there? and then the drivers of that, scott, i always like to get your opinion on the denim cycle. how strong is that? how long is that? and then, rustin, you mentioned something on average unit retail. are you planning on taking initial retails up in spring of next year like many others are? and i do have a follow-up
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & chairman
all right. well, thanks, adrienne. i'll go ahead and start. so really proud of the results that we've shown year-to-date, and i think that's a real catalyst as we grow this company. and i'm really proud of how we've pivoted from horizon one spanning the company up to horizon 2, turning ourselves into a growth company. and as you look at all that we've done, i think the thing that's really beneficial for us as we head into '22 is that, that opportunity for us to go to low double digits is a blanket approach.
so all i mean by that is it's happening everywhere. so it's not just in one specific area. it's in our channels, it's in our geographies, china and europe, it's in our categories. and we introduced all-terrain gear and work and t-shirts, and they're all working really well. so it gives us really good confidence as we head into '22. and yes, it is because we have a really good understanding of our business, and we know where it's going to be. so from an order book standpoint, that does give us confidence. and as we think about the denim cycle very, very early stages.
and i've said before, it's much more than the denim cycle. this is a casualization of what's happening around the world, and we are seeing that take hold. i mean from one part of the globe to the other part of the globe, and it's really exciting to see, and denim is a big, big part of that. but i'll tell you what we've done with t-shirts and all-terrain gear and the outdoor category and people coming back to work, i think the one thing that as i look at the team, how we've pivoted ourselves to go ahead and play in the categories that are really meaningful going forward as an organization, i think, has been very strategic. so thank you.
rustin welton -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
to your second question about aur retails, certainly, we're in active negotiations now. so i'm not going to go into specific assumptions, as i indicated in the prepared remarks around '22 cost inflation or pricing assumptions, but i will make a couple of comments. certainly, as we think about 2022, we're not immune, as we've said, from inflationary pressures that are out there. the second half of 2022, we'll see stronger inflationary pressures than the first half, as you would expect.
and then we're confident given existing conditions that we can offset the cogs inflation through the combination, as we talked about, of the ongoing ktb specific actions around structural mix shifts, higher aurs and cost efficiencies you've heard us talk about for several quarters. as well as strategic pricing. so we'll get into more details on the fourth quarter and specifically around assumptions.
adrienne yih -- barclays -- analyst
great. and then, rustin, a really quick housekeeping one, if you will, what percent of sales is cotton as raw material? you've been...
rustin welton -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. we said cotton in the prepared remarks, adrienne, was approximately mid-teens percent of our cost of goods sold.

our next question comes from the line of bob drbul with guggenheim securities.
bob drbul -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
scott, congratulations on the chairman title.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & chairman
thank you, bob. appreciate that.
bob drbul -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
i guess a couple of questions. when you look at the digital acceleration, it was just quite impressive. so when you look at your capabilities in terms of your ability to continue to meet that high demand, do you think that the 10% number appears too low when you look at it over a longer period of time? because it just seems like it's really taken off. and then the second question is, when you look at the returns you're getting on the demand creation, just how do you think about that longer term? i guess when you think about '21 into '22 as well, just more thoughts around the levels and sort of how you're spending that it seems like you're getting great returns.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & chairman
thanks, bob. i'll take the first one and rustin will take the second. from a digital standpoint, when we spun, we had a huge opportunity here. and i think it's really a real tribute to the leadership that we've developed within that category for our company, the really great folks that we've hired, the investment that we're making within that category relative to the fact that it's very accretive, and the fact that a couple of things have all come together for us. so we rolled out a new erp system, so we have new platforms across the globe.
we're creating much better products, what's driving higher aurs in that category, with much better demand creation, so people are driving to our sites. and as you can see, 118% up for the quarter and our own.com is all there. but i think your question is great because it's a challenge that i have up to the team that we can do better than 10%. that's our goal, but we have to do better for our shareholders, and we are going to work really hard to do that, and i have a lot of faith in our group that we can do that. but i'll tell you about we're going to continue to make investments there, too, because we see it as really, really important.
from a demand creation standpoint, it's part of our virtuous cycle of growth, right? when we spun, we knew these brands needed big time investment. and we also had to have smart investments. so we hired two exceptional leaders from a marketing standpoint, and they've really helped us, and you heard me talk about these two new big global campaigns that we've never done anything like that before.
and the reception has been from the community amazing. so as we continue to do that and as we continue to grow our gross margin, we're creating an [indecipherable] in that fuel to invest back in these brands in a really way, which i'm most encouraged about with the team. so really focused on that. and rustin, maybe a few comments about the second half?
rustin welton -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. so to scott's point, i think we're seeing those returns, bob, that you mentioned earlier. and that's what's causing us to lean in and invest again, an additional $15 million or $0.20 into accelerating that digital and demand creation in the fourth quarter. and it's because we're seeing those strong returns from the investments and certainly, you called it out in the q3 results. as you think about sort of getting to the guide of $4.15 to $4.20, bob, it's partially offset with, again, in our prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about $0.19 of benefit from below-the-line items like tax and lower interest and year-to-date share repurchases, but feel really good about that combined raise in revenue and gross margin guide that's really netting us to that $4.15 and $4.20 from an operational perspective.
we're just seeing those returns and really playing out. and so that plays into 2022 as well. so just one other point just to call out, bob, as a reminder, with this updated guide, if we go back to the investor day, we talked about a 15%-plus operating margin by 23 with triple-digit expansion in '21. and as you can see, we remain well on track with our raised full year guide. so very confident in the investments we're making.
operator
our next question comes from the line of mauricio tena with ubs.
mauricio tena -- ubs -- analyst
great. just a couple of questions. first, on inventory, can you tell us a little bit more about where you stand on inventory? you mentioned you were up 4%, excluding the business model changes, but i just want to understand if there's an component there? just to make sure you have enough to support growth and what you're doing in terms of air freight and logistics. and secondly, on the capital allocation optionality, you did also repurchase $125 million in shares. so how should we think about that like going forward in terms of -- could that be like a quarterly number? or like on an annualized basis, could that -- could we see like a triple digit in terms of million of dollars of capital returns to shareholders based on just share repurchases?
rustin welton -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, mauricio. this is rustin. i'll start with the first one around inventory and airfreight, and scott can jump in on capital allocation. we'll kind of tag team that one. so in terms of your question around inventory, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we continue to chase demand based on the momentum of the business. and retail inventories remain lean, as everyone knows. we are projecting kind of year-end inventory to increase double digits year-over-year to support this momentum, not just in the fourth quarter, but obviously heading into the first half of '22.
we do expect, as you think rolling forward here, that inventory is going to grow slower than revenue due to those lean retail inventory. so as we're getting product in, we're shipping it out. and then certainly, we've got some internal initiatives as well around sku rat activities as we talked about a little bit at investor day. so we're going to lean into inventory where appropriate, given some of the inflationary pressures and again, the strong demand signal that we're seeing. in terms of airfreight, i mentioned last quarter and we reflected it in our outlook that we were not immune and expected some transitory airfreight costs, which you saw.
certainly, in the third quarter here with 180 basis points of headwind from airfreight. we believe that will continue. we certainly utilized in the third quarter. we'll continue to utilize airfreight where possible and appropriate to meet that strong demand. believe that elevated airfreight is transitory, as we talked about, but likely mauricio to continue into 2022. and maybe just to dimensionalize it a little bit for you. in q3, our gross margins were 44.1% with 180 basis points of headwind from airfreight. and at the midpoint of our outlook we provided here, implied margins are around 43% for the fourth quarter. again, elevated airfreight will continue to be a headwind as we chase that strong demand. so certainly aggressively going after the demand signals that we see. scott, do you want to take capital allocation?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & chairman
thanks, mauricio, for the question. so mauricio, i just want to remind everybody, if you go back to how quickly we paid down our debt, it's a really proud moment for us as an organization. during a really difficult time we paid our debt down quickly in horizon 1, as we said we would, meeting our promises. and we talked a lot about -- and this means a lot. we talked a lot about the optionality. we said dividend increases, we said share buybacks, we said m&a.
we said that we had the optionality to do that after we paid down the debt. and i think what you're seeing right now is you're seeing the execution of that. so in a very short period of time, this quarter, we've increased the dividend 15% superior dividend, which is important to our tsr. and in addition to that, we started our stock repurchase program. so we started doing what we said we would do, and we're generating $1 billion over this 3-year period. so we still have a lot of optionality just because we've done those two things, we still have a lot more powder that we can use going forward as we see as the best thing to do for our shareholders. rustin, anything to add?
rustin welton -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. i would just sort of say, mauricio, the multifaceted approach that scott just laid out really speaks to the power of our operating cash flow, that we can pursue a multifaceted optionality concurrently. i think that's really important to take away. certainly, this quarter, we talked about the share repo beginning. just as a reminder, as the guide that we gave this morning, raising our guide is all organic. so you should think about any future share repurchases as incremental. so i just wanted to highlight those points. but thanks, mauricio, for the question.

our next question comes from the line of erinn murphy with piper sandler.
erinn murphy -- piper sandler -- analyst
let me add my congratulations. i am personally very about your yellowstone collaboration as well. so very good job on that.
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & chairman
sunday night, erinn.
erinn murphy -- piper sandler -- analyst
i know. it's on my calendar. a couple for me that haven't been asked yet. first on china, i'd love if you could share a little bit more about what you're seeing with the wrangler business on tmall now that you're starting to fully annualize that relationship? and then for both brands, how are you positioned into 11/11? and then secondly, could you just remind us how your consumer was impacted by u.s. stimulus last year? and then what have you taken into consideration with that low double-digit first half guide for stimulus?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & chairman
sure. erinn, i'll go ahead and take those. this is scott. so from a china standpoint, we are really -- and i talked about this a little bit on my prepared remarks, we're really pleased with how we're interacting with the chinese consumer right now. that dates back to the fact that we've been in the market since 1995 and have a really loyal following there, in addition to the fact that we have really strong leadership throughout that region. so i'm really pleased with that. so the lee brand continues to do well.
from the wrangler brand kickoff standpoint, yes, it has been about a year now, coming up on a year actually. and it continues to meet the targets that we've set for from the standpoint of how we're rolling it out, how the brand is being received. i think the one thing that will be exciting for us is you're going to see some more demand creation on the wrangler brand here really soon in china. so that's really exciting. and then from a stimulus standpoint, the consumer, for us, we play in all markets. so for us, that's really important. we play at the highest market and we play in the mass market.
so we have a wide range in consumer. in addition to the fact that we have picked up multiple different programs, which is really important for us, and it's broad-based. so it's not just here. it's in europe, it's in china. and it's not just in our core, but i do want to make mention that our core business is really important to us. it's really strong. we're really pleased, but we're continuing to do more. and we're not stopping from a sustainability and innovation standpoint, demand creation. we're pushing the envelope, hiring great people, gearing up for a really good horizon to turning this into a real growth vehicle going forward. so thanks for the question. really appreciate it.

our next question comes from the line of brooke roach with goldman sachs.
brooke roach -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning and thank you so much for taking our questions. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the recent success of your new distribution wins that you've achieved over the course of the past year. it's great to see how many wins you've seen across partners and channels and subsegments of the brand, but i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how those programs are performing with each of your partners. are they comping positively as they anniversary the first year? and how important are some of those new realized distribution wins to the strong 1h revenue outlook into 2022?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & chairman
okay. thanks, brooke. this is scott. i'll take that. let's start with lee. so a year ago, we kicked off a new program with a major customer, one of our win with the winter customers, and that has gone really well. the pos has continued to improve. in addition to that, it's gone so well and the consumer takeout and the acceptance has been good. we're really pleased with the product. we've won some additional programs on the lee brand with that customer. so really important to us. t-shirt category, which we entered, and we talked a lot about, it's a $100 billion category.
it just accessorizes so well with our bottom, and we've got a couple of really big wins there. we talked about 1,700 doors. and again, we're really pleased with the initial takeout in the pos. workwear is another example of -- this year, 3,300 new doors, a category that's really, really important. and then i think about things like outdoor. so a couple of years ago, we introduced this line, and it has grown significantly. it's really important to our business. it's given us confidence as a company that we can do things outside of our core. and we've got multiple points of distribution that are working.
but specific to your question, we're testing right now, for instance, here in the u.s. and also in europe with intersport and we're testing here with academy. and both of those tests are going very well, and the pos is going very well. and the consumer takeout is really good. they love the product. so i'm feeling really confident from a new business development standpoint, from a new category standpoint for our team. there's going to be more that we're going to come out with in the future, which is really exciting. but for those specific instances, we feel really good about the first half relative to that and we're building going forward in the future.
brooke roach -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of sam poser with williams trading.
sam poser -- williams trading -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. the guidance for the fourth quarter, the implied guidance for the fourth quarter, i mean, how should we think about the lee and wrangler business? and are you constrained by inventory at all in q4 from a revenue perspective, given it's implying a fairly good deceleration? and just based on what i'm looking at, i mean, it's a fairly good deceleration, and it looks like your momentum is a little bit stronger than what you're giving us.
rustin welton -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, sam. it's rustin. i'll go ahead and take that piece. as we think about the fourth quarter, certainly, scott laid out all of the things that we're confident about moving into holiday as well as into 2022. we've tried to take into consideration the chasing on the demand and the inventory side and reflecting that guidance. didn't split out sort of commentary by brand, but we did talk a little bit about the fourth quarter for lee returning to strong growth.
and so we wanted to -- on the lee piece, what we're seeing there is really strong pos that's really pulling from consumers, and that's supported by some increased air freight to meet that demand. lee tends to be, sam, a little bit more of a sourced business than wrangler, and we're seeing strong momentum from a pos perspective, seeing strong momentum on the digital side as well. and then there's some additional business development wins, including a holiday program on the lee piece. so that's driving it.
i think the point i would really bring home on the fourth quarter, sam, because certainly, as you recall last year, there was a 53rd week, etc, is going back to 2019. and if you exclude those actions around vfo in india, the fourth quarter projection is scheduled to be up 3% to 4%. if you exclude those actions, it's 13%. so again, it speaks to the momentum of the business and really the investments and to scott's point earlier, the broad-based support we're seeing across channels, categories and geographies that's giving us that confidence.
sam poser -- williams trading -- analyst
thanks. and then on the sg&a, i mean, i'm just sort of backing into numbers, but it looks like -- i mean it looks like you're going to spend over a lot of money on sg&a. and even with -- even before like on the old numbers, it looked like it was going to be a large number. so i mean, how -- is sg&a going to be up $35 million, $45 million from q3? i mean, is that...
rustin welton -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. a couple of things to comment on. as you think about comparisons, sam, to prior year, particularly q3, there were some covid-related sort of expense reductions, given the uncertainty around covid last year. so that distorts the comparison to prior year a little bit. as you think about q4 and the investments, i draw you back to the prepared remarks with the wrangler and lee campaigns just now dropping. so certainly, we want to get out and support those campaigns.
we're very excited about it, as you heard us talk about on the call and the opportunities that are there. and based upon the returns that we've seen, that's what's giving us that confidence that we want to dial up that $15 million of incremental investment into digital and demand creation. and again, that's going to be a $0.20 headwind on eps. so we think that is the right move for the investment on the brands, not just in '21, but in '22 and beyond. and in my prepared remarks, you saw how we're inflecting there, sam. we're going to be up in advertising projected to be up an expected 40% compared to last year's numbers, and that's about 100 basis points and 20% over 2019 numbers as well. so again, very pleased with the investments, and that's what's giving us the confidence to distort and make sure the brands are healthy for the long run.

our last question comes from the line of jim duffy with stifel.
peter mcgoldrick -- stifel -- analyst
this is peter mcgoldrick on for jim. it seems like you've got a lot of momentum in the marketing messaging for both brands. can you provide any insight to demand creation priorities between them? what are the biggest dollar opportunities for investment? and then looking into 2022, are there any marketing opportunities that might not have been there at the beginning of 2021?
scott baxter -- president, chief executive officer & chairman
yes, peter, i'll take that. this is scott. we feel really good about both brands and about the opportunities to invest in both brands. and i think that you heard me talk a little bit earlier about these new global ad campaigns that we kicked off in both. fairly significant for us, peter, because that hasn't been done in these brands before. and it's something that's going to set us apart. it's also something that i think is a springboard for the organization to build upon as we go forward and we think about the power of these brands. we're going to learn a lot from both of those two, and i think that's really important. but i think if there's anything i want you to take from i want you to take from the fact that there's a ton of opportunity left here. demand creation is a huge opportunity for us.
we're going to continue to invest in it. and we're starting to invest at a level that our competition has been investing in for a very long time, and it feels good to get to that point that we need to so that we can go ahead and continue to grow these brands globally. much more to come going forward. really excited about the georgia may jagger, leon bridges, all the different things and the collaborations with pendleton that lee is doing. there's just so many things that we haven't done before, but it's all in the logical sequence that will play out over the next couple of years. and our big global ad campaigns were exactly where we wanted to put them, when we wanted to put them because we hit our playbook metrics. so thank you, peter
