good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the acadia pharmaceuticals second quarter 2021 financial results conference call. my name is jonathan, and i will be your coordinator for today.
[operator instructions] i would now like to turn the presentation over to mr. mark johnson, vice president of investor relations at acadia. please proceed.
mark johnson -- vice president, investor relations
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss acadia's second quarter 2021 financial results. joining me on the call today from acadia are steve davis, our chief executive officer; who will provide an overview of our q2 2021 financial performance and a review of our business operations. also joining us today is amanda morgan, our chief revenue and customer officer; and charmaine lykins, global product planning and chief marketing officer, who will provide updates on our commercial performance. dr. serge stankovic, our president, will discuss our pipeline progress; and our chief financial officer, elena ridloff, will then discuss our financial results in more detail before turning it back to steve for final remarks and opening the call up for your questions. i would also like to point out that we're using supplement slides, which are available on the events and presentations section of our website.
before we proceed, i would first like to remind you that during our call today, we will be making a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements, including goals, expectations, plans, prospects, growth potential, timing of events or future results are based on current information, assumptions and expectations that are inherently subject to change and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. these factors and other risks associated with our business can be found in our filings made with the sec. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are made only as of today's date.
i will now turn the call over to steve.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
thank you, mark. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i'd like to start with a review of our commercial performance, followed by some important company updates.
please turn to slide four. for the second quarter of 2021, nuplazid achieved $115.2 million in net sales, representing a 5% year-over-year increase driven by sequential and year-over-year volume growth. as a result of a slower pace of pandemic recovery and a higher-than-expected gross to net, we are projecting net sales for the year at $480 million to $515 million. elena will discuss the gross to net dynamics in greater detail in her section. let me speak to the continuing impacts of the pandemic, which impacted our growth in the second quarter. in the office space channel, parkinson's patients visits in the quarter were down 20% from pre-pandemic levels. this is important because many physicians are hesitant [technical issues] patients on a new therapy without diagnosing them first in person. so while we still grew new patient starts in the quarter, the rate of growth in the new patient starts was significantly impacted by reduced parkinson's patient visits.
in the long-term care channel, occupancy rate [technical issues] facilities are currently approximately 15% below pre-pandemic levels and new admissions are down approximately 17%. for many of our patients being in or admitted to a long-term care facility often coincides with the pdp diagnosis and thus a new patient start on nuplazid. the reduction in both ongoing occupancy rates and new patient admissions continue to impact our ability to start new patients on nuplazid in the ltc setting. despite these impacts of the pandemic on [technical issues] patient population, we've grown our new patient starts and our business overall. our ability to grow despite these headwinds is further reinforced by our strong relative performance compared to other branded products in the long-term care channel. [technical issues] patient visits, long-term care facility admissions and less in-person detailing were headwinds, has slowed our growth in the second quarter. these headwinds are, of course, temporal.
going forward, despite these headwinds, we expect to continue to grow our business, including new sequential volume growth and new patient starts. as pandemic conditions for the parkinson's community improve, we expect these headwinds to become tailwinds, further accelerating our growth. in addition, we have commenced several pdp growth initiatives that amanda and charmaine will speak to in a moment.
let's move to an update on our drp program on slide five. we recently completed a type a end of review meeting with the fda to discuss the issues raised in the complete response letter that we received in april. today, we'd like to share the key takeaways from that meeting. first, the fda reaffirmed their stated position in the crl that pimavanserin should be studied by individual subgroups of dementia and advised us that the best path forward to conduct an additional clinical study in each of the subgroups for which we seek approval. in the meeting, we highlighted the consistent and clinically meaningful efficacy observed in the drp population overall, as well as across individual dementia subgroups [technical issues] alzheimer's disease, dementia with lewy bodies, parkinson's disease dementia and patients with mixed pathologies.
as a result of these discussions, the fda indicated that they are open to discuss additional analyses from the harmony study and the -019 study that may support a potential resubmission without conducting an additional study. we're planning to discuss analyses with the fda at a meeting later this year. in parallel with preparations for this meeting, we will also prepare for all potential outcomes that may come from this discussion.
in addition to drp, let me highlight clinical updates as we turn to slide six. we recently completed enrollment from our phase iii program for trofinetide in rett syndrome and are on track to deliver top line results by the end of the year. our phase iii program for pimavanserin for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia continues to enroll well. as a reminder, the pivotal advance-2 study was started in the third quarter of last year. earlier this year, we initiated a phase ii study evaluating acp-044 for postoperative pain associated with bunionectomy surgery, and expect top line results later this year. furthermore, in the second quarter, we initiated a phase ii study evaluating 044 for pain associated with osteoarthritis. business development continues to be a key priority for our strategy to expand our pipeline for long-term growth and bring new therapies to patients with high unmet needs.
i would now like to turn the call over to amanda and charmaine to discuss our second quarter commercial performance and growth initiatives.
amanda morgan -- senior vice president, chief revenue and customer officer
thank you, steve. today, i'd like to review our second quarter performance and our long-term expectations for nuplazid in parkinson's disease psychosis.
please turn to slide eight. in the quarter, we delivered net sales of $115.2 million with sequential volume growth of 3% across both the office space and long-term care channel. this quarterly performance was primarily driven by new patient starts and continuing patients, which demonstrated strong patient adherence and compliance. although new patients starts are consistent with pre-pandemic levels, they are not yet accelerating at our expected rate. we believe the reasons for this is that growth of new patient starts are dependent upon parkinson's patient office visits and new admissions and occupancy rates within the long-term care channel, both of which have slowed due to the continued impact of the pandemic.
the challenges related to the pandemic have disproportionately affected the patient population, which we serve. to give you further color on this, as shown in the graph on the left, parkinson's patient visits within the office-based setting were still approximately 20% below pre-pandemic levels in the quarter. we know physician patient visits are highly correlated with new patient starts, and therefore, we are confident that as patients return to their physician offices, new patient starts will increase, resulting in greater nuplazid demand, which will drive market penetration. despite office-based visits being down, new patient starts in total have remained at pre-pandemic levels, as highlighted in the graph on the right, reflecting our team's ability to execute in a challenging environment. we've been able to accomplish this through our hcp messaging, which elevates pd psychosis symptom identification and highlights the efficacy and safety of nuplazid and the urgency to treat psychosis early.
please turn to slide nine. now turning our attention to the long-term care channel. as you can see from the graph on the top right, occupancy levels have been slowly improving at 0.5% to 1% each month. however, they are still 15% below pre-covid levels. for many patients, the identification of hallucinations and delusions, resulting in a diagnosis of pdp, often occurs in a long-term care facility and may coincide with the new resident admission. as new admissions increase and occupancy levels return to normal, we fully expect our momentum to translate into accelerated growth within the ltc channel. as shown in the graph on the bottom right, long-term care bottles began growing sequentially in the second quarter as a result of our enhanced marketing and promotional messaging and a modest increase of patients within long-term care facilities.
overall, we are encouraged as nuplazid's growth outperformed foundational parkinson's medications, including carbidopa/levodopa as well as a market basket of branded ltc products across multiple therapeutic areas. this performance indicates strong brand support and positions us to accelerate growth within this setting. in the near term, our ability to accelerate growth will be largely dependent on the pace of recovery of patient office visits, ltc new admissions and face-to-face engagement.
regardless of this, we have implemented new growth initiatives, which charmaine will now highlight.
charmaine lykins -- senior vice president, global production planning and chief marketing officer
thanks, amanda. please turn to slide 10. let's discuss our new growth initiatives, which will position us well in the second half of the year to capitalize on improvements to the leading indicators that amanda just discussed. these initiatives incorporate new market research insights, specifically as it pertains to awareness of nuplazid's safety and tolerability profile and in light of other important medical considerations when treating parkinson's patients. our growth initiatives leverage important clinical data duly available for nuplazid promotion to highlight nuplazid safety benefits. nuplazid's safety profile is a distinct advantage. we are elevating that advantage to increase diagnosis and capture a higher percentage of new pdp patients.
today, less than 50% of patients with a pdp diagnosis receive treatment. and also, our market research indicates that 37% of physicians delay pd psychosis treatment because of safety concerns associated with off-label antipsychotics. in addition, a key concern in parkinson's patients is stops. and another is motor impairment. our communication to hcp's highlights that nuplazid has no warning for orthostatic hypotension related or sedation-related events. cognitive impairment is another concern for physicians, especially for parkinson's patients who have been diagnosed with comorbid dementia. our promotional materials will now include the saps-pd efficacy data in the cognitively impaired subset of patients with mmse scores ranging from 21 to 25 from our pivotal pdp study. beyond efficacy, we will also communicate that there are no safety differences across age, gender and cognition with nuplazid treatment. after being presented with our new safety messages, approximately 77% of physicians stated that they would be more willing now to prescribe nuplazid to treat pd psychosis earlier than before.
please turn to slide 11. our promotional messaging highlights the efficacy and safety of nuplazid and amplifies our improvement without impairment strategic vision. the new messaging will be executed across all promotional channels, including our field teams in the second half of the year. we continue to see strong brand support for nuplazid and high engagement of our promotional presentations at medical congresses, with over 2,000 hcps attending a branded nuplazid program in q2. additionally, we continue to amplify our message through digital and nonpersonal promotion efforts to reach our target healthcare providers.
we've increased our efforts with caregivers and patients to drive more patient identification. our consumer programs educate patients and caregivers about the signs and symptoms of pd psychosis and why it's important to talk to your doctor. our dtc and digital platforms activate those patients to request nuplazid by name. our initiatives will increase patient identification and our promotional messages with a focus on safety set us up well to accelerate new patient starts in the back half of the year and drive long-term prescription growth of nuplazid.
now i'll turn it over to serge to share our pipeline progress.
serge stankovic -- president
thank you, charmaine. good afternoon, everyone. please turn to slide 13. as steve mentioned, we had a constructive dialogue with the fda at our end of review type a meeting. while we still do not have alignment with the fda on what it would take for a resubmission, we are encouraged by the agency's optimist to continue the discussion and allow us to present additional data analysis to further support a resubmission without an additional clinical study.
accordingly, it will take some time for us to prepare and for the fda to schedule the meeting. as such, we will have an update on our -- on the outcome later this year. furthermore, consistent with the views expressed in the crl regarding individual subgroups of dementia, it appears the division of psychiatry of the fda has changed their view on breakthrough therapy designation for dementia-related psychosis and have notified us that they are considering rescinding the drp designation for pimavanserin. we will be meeting with the fda in the coming months to discuss further. in the meantime, our new publications in both drp and pdp, continue to be received very well by the medical and scientific community.
let's discuss further on slide 14. i'm excited to share that the positive results from our phase iii harmony study were published in the new england journal of medicine. we are pleased to be able to share these important findings that clearly demonstrates three main takeaways regarding pimavanserin as a potential treatment for drp: one, in the open-label portion of the study, pimavanserin treatment clearly demonstrated a meaningful reduction of the symptoms of psychosis; two, continuation of pimavanserin treatment in a double-blind portion significantly reduced the risk of relapse of psychosis by almost three times; and three, importantly, pimavanserin was not associated with a decline in cognition or motor symptoms and was well tolerated in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.
also in july, acadia hosted a disease awareness symposium to further discuss the high unmet need in drp at this year's alzheimer's association international conference. the symposium was highlighted by key experts in the field discussing whether dementia subtypes matter when it comes to treating psychosis and the urgency for awareness and appropriate management of hallucinations and delusions across dementias. the discussion among the experts was both consistent and supportive of our view that dementia-related psychosis is most appropriately studied broadly.
in june, results from the open-label extension study, which highlights the sustained pimavanserin response in patients with pdp, were published in parkinsonism and related disorders. these data further demonstrate the utility of pimavanserin in pdp.
let's move to our development stage pipeline, starting on slide 15, with an update on our trofinetide program for rett syndrome. as steve mentioned, we have recently completed enrollment in the phase iii lavender study and are on track to announce top line results in the fourth quarter of this year.
turning to slide 16. our phase iii program evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of negative symptoms schizophrenia includes two pivotal study, our positive advance-1 study and advance-2, which we initiated in the third quarter of last year. enrollment continues to progress well and is on track.
please turn to slide 17 for an update on our acp-044 program. acp-044 is a novel first-in-class orally administered non-opioid analgesic that is being studied in both acute and chronic pain models. the phase ii study evaluating acp-044 for the treatment of postoperative pain following bunionectomy surgery is enrolling well, and we expect results in the fourth quarter of this year. furthermore, we recently initiated a phase ii study for patients suffering from pain associated with osteoarthritis.
slide 18 highlights a brief summary of our acp-319 m1 pam program for the potential treatment of schizophrenia and cognitive impairment in alzheimer's disease. as part of our transition, we are completing some additional nonclinical work and we'll be progressing our phase i program with the initiation of a multiple-ascending dose study in the fourth quarter of this year.
slide 19 summarizes our ongoing development time lines. most notably, in the fourth quarter, we look forward to announcing top line results from our phase iii trofinetide study in rett syndrome and top line results from our phase ii study for acp-044 in postoperative pain. we look forward to keeping you updated as we advance our pipeline.
with that, i will turn the call over to elena now.

stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
thank you, elena. please turn to slide 24. in closing, on the commercial front, we continue to execute in a challenging environment, in the short to intermediate term expect to continue to grow despite these conditions. looking from the intermediate to long term, we're really confident in the potential of nuplazid and are committed to getting it to the pdp patients who desperately need it. regarding drp, we look forward to continuing our discussion with the fda to align on a potential path to a resubmission. we're focused on advancing our development pipeline with two clinical data readouts in the fourth quarter of 2021, while continuing to pursue attractive business development deals. finally, i would like to thank our employees for their passion to our mission to elevate life.
i'll now open up the call for questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line cory kasimov from jpmorgan. your question, please?
gavin scott -- jpmorgan -- analyst
this is gavin on for cory. thanks for taking our questions. just curious, do the fda clarify what particular analysis needs to be completed to convince them? or what do you think you can show them to be convincing? thank you.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks for the question, gavin. serge, do you want to take this?
serge stankovic -- president
yes. thanks, gavin. we brought to the type a meeting a number of additional analysis -- that we looked at the meeting as an opportunity for us to address some of the questions and concerns expressed in the crl as we didn't have opportunity prior to this to bring it. so the analysis that we brought and were of quite a bit of interest to the fda could be summarized in a couple of buckets.
one is, as it relates to the clinical characteristics and features of psychosis among the different dementia subtypes. we analyze specifically -- we analyzed and looked at the psychosis rating scales and did a variety of different cluster analysis, item analysis, characterizing this clinical picture of psychosis among different subtypes, whether before treatment, in the course of the treatment as well as following withdrawal of successful treatment, essentially showing a very similar pattern of clinical characteristics and behavior among these different subtypes. so that's one bucket of analysis.
the other bucket is related to the meaningful -- clinically meaningful response, not only overall, among different -- among patients with dementia-related psychosis, but also when you look at a pattern of response and the meaningfulness of the response among different subtypes. particularly when you look at the response to pimavanserin treatment, we see quite a bit of similarity and meaningfulness in that clinical response. so we perform a number of different analyses demonstrated that as well. so those were kind of the main features of the analysis that we performed and presented to fda, and we'll continue to discuss as we move forward with our discussions.
gavin scott -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of neena bitritto-garg, your question please, from citi?
neena bitritto-garg -- citi -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. so just on the drp indication as well. i guess, have you gotten a sense from the fda around if you are able to kind of move forward with some additional analyses of the existing data. would a refiling or a resubmission kind of be for the broad indication? or do you think it would be for specific subtypes only? thanks.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
thanks so much for the question. serge, do you want to address this?
serge stankovic -- president
yes. well, neena, thanks for the question. when we look at the discussions that we have and the potential parts, they essentially boils down to three pathways that we can pursue. one is that additional analysis and the discussion and review of the data results with the alignment that the data -- existing data is sufficient for approval of the broad drp indication. the other option is that the data that we have for the subtypes, particularly for some of the larger subtypes that we have like alzheimer's disease psychosis, along with the study in alzheimer's disease psychosis that we have, with the analysis and data that we present, we aligned that, that data is sufficient to -- for the approval of individual indications -- individual subtype without additional clinical work.
and finally, the third part would be that if fda remains steadfast with their position that they would want to see additional clinical data, then additional work in an individual indication would be required to move forward. so that's how we see. obviously, our position is for the first or the second option. and i think the data that we have presented received some traction, and we're continuing discussion and we are happy to have that opportunity.
neena bitritto-garg -- citi -- analyst
perfect, thank you.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
this is steve. i don't know if others heard this, but there was some skipping when serge was talking. so i just want to clarify. so as serge mentioned, there's three potential ways this could play out. first is our position that our existing data supports a broad drp label. we made that case in the type a meeting we have, and we determined that we need to continue the discussion on that front. so that's one possibility. another possibility is to resubmit based upon one or more individual subtypes. serge mentioned alzheimer's disease psychosis is where we obviously have the greatest amount of data.
it was the largest group in the study. we also had very compelling data in dementia with lewy bodies. so a second potential outcome here is that we resubmit again without additional clinical work based upon one or more subtypes. the third possibility, of course, is that the fda, and this is their current view, requires that we do additional clinical work and submit on individual subtypes. now having said that, again, here, too, they said, this is what we suggest you do. we think this is your best path forward but we're willing to have a further discussion with you about the possibility of submitting without additional clinical work. that's where things stand today. those are the three potential outcomes as we see it.
neena bitritto-garg -- citi -- analyst
okay, thank you
operator
our next question comes from the line of jeff hung from morgan stanley. your question, please?
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. just to clarify. so the follow-up meeting with the fda, is this a meeting where the agency will make a final decision on whether to allow for the resubmission without the additional clinical study? or is there a potential that this could go on to multiple additional meetings? and i have a follow-up on that.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yes. serge, do you want to take that?
serge stankovic -- president
yes. just to clarify, i mean, type a meeting that we already had with the fda, 60-minute meeting. and obviously, we brought a lot of information and data to that meeting and in the briefing document. so the extension of this meeting that we will have in the next scheduled meeting is essentially continuation of the discussion that we already have, they already started and had with the fda. we do anticipate that we will come to a certain point of alignment and -- with the fda or at a certain point of understanding what will be necessary along the three different pathways that we just discussed at that next meeting and obviously are hoping that the data that we are bringing and the discussion at the meeting will support our position and proposals how to move forward.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and if i can clarify. so then can you provide a little more color on the fda reiterating their position in being open to having another meeting? like was that more that they're pretty firm on their position, but they'll hear you out? or does it seem like they're more open to an actual discussion?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
i'll start, and then i'll let serge add additional color, if he like. i don't think they would have suggested -- we're open to having another meeting if they weren't interested in hearing more of the analysis that we're doing -- that we did for the type a meeting and we're continuing to refine that. so i think they're being genuine when they agreed to have a further dialogue. as serge mentioned, the type a meeting was only a 60-minute meeting. we could only cover so much ground in that meeting. having said that, again, i just want to be clear. they said, we believe your best path forward is to do additional clinical work and do an additional clinical study for each subtype that you want to pursue. but we're open to having a further discussion. that's as much clarity as i can give you at this point. we need to have the next meeting in order to try to get further clarity.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of ritu baral from cowen. your question, please?
lyla youssef -- cowen -- analyst
this is lyla on for ritu. thanks for taking the question. maybe just to follow up on drp. for the meeting that you plan to have with the fda later this year. now is that expected to be with the same reviewers, the same members of the fda you've been interacting with? or is there any potential that it might escalate to more senior members of the division? thank you.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
serge, do you want to take that?
serge stankovic -- president
yes. let me just say that we -- first of all, we were very pleased to have a strong fda representation and presence at our type a meeting along -- both from the division as well as from the office for neuroscience. at the meeting, obviously, the division -- psychiatry division director, tiffany farchione, was present, but also the director of office for neuroscience, billy dunn, was present at the meeting. so we anticipate, as we continue this discussion, to continue to have that strong presence from the fda side as well and continue our constructive dialogue.
lyla youssef -- cowen -- analyst
thank you for clarifying.
operator
our next question comes from the line of charles duncan from cantor fitzgerald. your question, please?
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i had a question -- one additional question on drp and then a commercial question. and that is regarding drp, i guess, i'm wondering if you're contemplating actually initiating a trial with one of these patient subgroups. and then given the kind of perspective that you got from aaic, i'm wondering if you can provide any additional color on why you think the psychiatry division is contemplating there being differences in psychosis across these degenerative disorders?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
serge, do you want to take this question?
serge stankovic -- president
yes. let me try to address the first part of the -- second part of the question, and that is we received quite a bit of support from the medical community out there in regard to interpretation of the data and the results of our harmony study and the overall data that we submitted as a part of our supplemental nda. so there is, indeed, as you are pointing out, a little bit of discrepancy in the way how division of psychiatry looked at the data and how the wider medical and scientific community look at the data.
we were very -- as i mentioned, very pleased with the fact that we also published the data in the new england journal of medicine and received also a positive editorial in regard to the overall data we have. but it is -- remains a debate within the community about how to study dementia-related psychosis, to study it as a single entity -- clinical entity, which is positioned where we had, and we had an agreement to that effect or to studies by dementia subtypes. and i guess that the division of psychiatry on the basis of available data to them and the data that we presented came to a conclusion that, that way of studying psychosis by dementia subtypes is an appropriate way to study dementia-related psychosis. but that's the best that i can say.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
charles, i think you also were asking about running an additional study. and i would just -- yes, go ahead, serge.
serge stankovic -- president
yes. we are obviously preparing for all possible alternative outcomes of our discussion. we do not want to prejudge the discussion or -- but we are prepared for all possible outcomes and alternative actions that we would be taking as we move forward with this. so that's how we look at the things.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
okay. quick commercial question then. and i know that you don't promote off-label. but i'm just wondering if you're able to detect any change in the use of pimavanserin off-label as a result of the agency decision and the visibility around that. i don't even know if there is off-label use, but i'm wondering if that -- if there is, if that dynamic changed over the course of the second quarter?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks for the question, charles. from the time we've launched in pdp, we've had very little off-label use. we can't track every bottle. we don't know the final destination of every bottle, for instance, that goes into long-term care. but the majority of our sales of our bottles come through our hub and we know what the diagnosis is on every bottle, every prescription that comes to our hub. and when we look at those prescriptions, the amount that is off-label has consistently been in the low single digits. so more than 95% of prescriptions are on label. it's difficult to get the drug off-label as it is many drugs. it's possible but difficult. and so for that reason, very high percent of our bottles are on label. that has not changed throughout the last cycle of the product, and we're not seeing any differences in that today.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thanks steve, for adding color.

our next question comes from the line of tazeen ahmad from bank of america. your question, please?
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. serge, i just wanted to maybe clarify on the comment that you made in your press statement of the breakthrough status. i guess why would it be the case that fda might be reconsidering breakthrough? and who's going to make that decision? as you kind of have these meetings -- your next meeting, is anybody in that committee going to be involved in determining breakthrough status? and if and when it's determined what the future path is going to be? let's say, the best case, you don't have to do another study. you can resubmit. there's a chance now go up that it would be for a regular review, given the breakthrough status might be revoked? thanks.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yes, sure. serge, do you want to take this?
serge stankovic -- president
yes. a couple of things here. first of all, just a clarification. we received this notification from the fda prior to our type a meeting. and the breakthrough designation at this point -- the reason we believe this is consistent with their crl is it's very consistent with their position that the data did not substantiate approval for this particular indication. and at this point in the life cycle of the development, really that the breakthrough therapy designation -- it does not have an impact as otherwise would have. so from that perspective, this is something that we are not surprised to see.
to your question, the division makes a recommendation for the breakthrough therapy designation and it's then approved by the higher levels with the agency. and in regard to the review, which is important point, in case of resubmission, that resubmission goes either to -- depending on whether it's a labeling resubmission or it's additional data, which in this case, would probably be, would take six months review cycle. so it wouldn't go -- it doesn't go in a manner like original submission.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, got it. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of jason butler from jmp securities. your question, please?
jason butler -- jmp securities -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. just on drp. was the phase ii adp study discussed at all or any of the fda's comments in the crl relating to that study discussed? and then just on the commercial side, in geographies where the case rates of covid have remained lower, are you seeing a better return to physicians' offices or occupancy levels in ltc that are closer to normal? are you seeing different things across the country? or is it still depressed across the country? thanks.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
serge, why don't you take the first question?
serge stankovic -- president
yes. thanks, jason. the fda invited us to bring additional data and analysis. the point that we brought to the meeting in the discussion as far as the phase ii adp study goes is the conclusion -- positive conclusions of that study remain regardless of how you look at the data and analyze the data and independent on any concerns that the division expressed in regard to some quality issues with that study, single-center study and so on. so from that perspective, they did invite us to bring that additional analysis and data validating the overall conclusion of that study because it is an important study in the overall package of the data we submitted.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
right. thanks so much. amanda, do you want to take the geography question?
amanda morgan -- senior vice president, chief revenue and customer officer
yes. thanks. i'll take the second question. thanks, steve. so specific to, are we seeing differences across the u.s. as it relates to the pandemic, and we do see regional differences across the u.s. but what i will say is that we have seen from the beginning of the year until this year -- we've seen a return of our face-to-face engagements with our reps and our physicians. and we've seen ltc new admissions continue to grow, although still at pre-covid levels as well as pd patient office visits. so we'll continue to track those leading indicators and continue to optimize with our engagements with our hcps as we navigate the pandemic.
jason butler -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. thanks for taking the questions.

our next question comes from the line of marc goodman from svb leerink. your question, please?
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst
so steve, to confirm if the fda ends up saying, ok, you need another study, you're willing to do another study in one of these subgroups? is that confirmed?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yes. i appreciate the question, marc. i think the honest answer is we need to know what would be required for an approval in the individual subgroups, or for that matter, for drp generally. and we just haven't had -- we're not at that point of the discussions yet. so we need to understand what that path looks like. obviously, if it's a asset that -- if we ultimately determine that we need to do additional clinical work to get an approval, if the path is one that we feel like is appropriate, it's scientifically valid, we still have a lot of patent life and we'll be eager to pursue it. if the path forward is one that we feel like is just not feasible, it would be very difficult to enroll or take a very, very long time to enroll, then you want to take that into consideration. but next steps next and the next thing we need to is have further discussion with fda.
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst
so basically, at the meeting, they told you that you should do another study in a subgroup to get that particular subgroup, but they didn't give you any guidance on that type of study at all? there was no discussion about what it would be?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
we did not have a discussion on what that would look like. that's correct. we spent the majority of the meeting talking about the new analysis that we had done and had a dialogue around that. and again, as i said, i want to be really clear. they said, we think your best path forward is to do additional clinical work. however, we're willing to have a further discussion with you to further consider the analysis that you've done.
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst
right. and serge, your comments -- somewhere in the comments, you used the term, some traction. we got some traction. so i was just curious what part of the discussion was it that you got some traction?
serge stankovic -- president
i would just directly say the buckets that i described both sets of analysis that we were discussing were received with quite a bit of interest. this was a new information that -- new data that we brought, new analysis, and there was quite a bit of interest and discussion. and finally, encouragement to see more of that analysis and continued discussion in that. that is the reason that i characterized as a traction, but really relates to both buckets of the analysis.
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
marc, i might just add one additional comment. any time you get a crl, and we were very clear about this before the type a meeting, you would expect that going into that meeting because they just issued a crl that their view would be that you should do additional clinical work. so i would say we're very pleased that both dr. farchione and dr. dunn were at the meeting. and we had an opportunity to present the analysis that we did. and as serge mentioned, i think there was very meaningful interest in the analysis, and we had a very constructive dialogue. so i think coming out of that meeting with the recognition that this warrants further discussion, i think, is what serge is referring to when he said, we got some traction and feel like we had a productive discussion and that we need to continue that dialogue.
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of salveen richter from goldman sachs. your question, please?
andrea tan -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking our questions. this is andrea on for salveen. elena, maybe one for you. with respect to the lowered guidance there, can you help us understand what proportion of that reduction is due to expected continued impact from the pandemic versus gross to net?
elena ridloff -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure, andrea. so about half the reduction is a result of the slower pace of recovery due to the pandemic and about half of it is due to the gross to net.
andrea tan -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. and then, serge, one question on acp-044 for the data that you're expecting in the fourth quarter of this year. can you help frame expectations for that? and what is clinically meaningful?
serge stankovic -- president
yes. we are conducting, just as a reminder, a study in postsurgical pain, bunionectomy surgery, about 280 -- 240 patients study and expect the results before the end of the year. in that study, the primary outcome measure is pain intensity measured over 24 hours. we are testing two kind of dosing regimens in the study at the highest dose level. and it's a placebo-controlled study. so we would be very pleased to see a significant separation in the pain intensity or reduction in pain intensity with treatment.

our next question comes from the line of joseph stringer from needham and company. your question, please?
joseph stringer -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for taking our questions. first one, commercial on pdp. just following up on an earlier question on sort of regional differences. just curious if you had any data or info on hesitancy among vaccinated pdp patients, whether it be returning to office visits? and i know in the long-term care, it's a little bit different dynamic. you mentioned occupancy and new admissions were down. but is there a different sort of effect for each of those settings? and then the second question is just on rett. can you remind us again what to expect for a clinically meaningful change in rsbq and cgi endpoints? thank you.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yes, sure. amanda, do you want to take the first question and, serge, the second?
amanda morgan -- senior vice president, chief revenue and customer officer
sure. thanks for the question, joseph. so let me kind of separate my question to two kind of -- or my answer into two distinct categories when we think about regional differences and how we think about the business. but it really boils down to two things, and it's either the face-to-face physician and patient visits or the face-to-face physician and rep interactions. and specifically with the face-to-face physician and patient visits, this is important because we know hcps are more effective diagnosing pd psychosis, and they have an increased willingness to prescribe a new product during an in-person patient visit. and so currently, in-person patient visits, as i shared, are about 20% below pre-covid level. so regardless of this, though, we've maintained our new patient starts pre-pandemic.
the second thing we look at, both regionally and nationally, is when we look at face-to-face physician and rep interactions. and so what we know is that when we engage with our hcps in person we're just more effective than we are when we interact virtually. and so currently, more than 2/3 of our physicians and rep interactions are in person, which is a significant improvement from the beginning of the year, but it is still pre -- at pre-covid levels. so throughout our growth initiatives, the temporal headwinds turning those into tailwinds, we do expect to see an increased demand for nuplazid. and we do expect that to kind of vary regionally, but those are really the ways we look at it from both a regional and national perspective.
serge stankovic -- president
yes. about the trofinetide rett phase iii study, as a reminder, the study has two co-primary measure: one is rett behavioral symptoms questionnaire, which is a caregiver completed questionnaire across symptoms of rett syndrome. and the second is clinical global impression of improvement, which is a physician rating scale. so in itself, the study has sort of internal validation of whether the rating scale changes that are observed in individual patients correlate with the improvement -- meaningful improvement that the physician characterized on the scale -- on their rating scale. so from that perspective, since we need to reach both separation from placebo and fold co-primary measure, there is an internal validation of meaningfulness of the results whenever we separate from placebo. i will remind you that in the phase ii study that was positive, there was about a 15% reduction on the scale. and obviously, that was meaningful separation, particularly in the context of the broad -- our assessment of the broad symptoms across rett syndrome as well as that there are no other available treatments at this point.
joseph stringer -- needham and company -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of jay olson from oppenheimer. your question, please?
jay olson -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks for the update and thanks for taking our questions. i was wondering if you could share any thoughts on cerevel's data for their m4 pam and any read across that you might see to your m1 pam? and then maybe if you could please provide an update on your latest thoughts about potential indications to pursue with your m1 pam and when we should expect to see phase i data? thank you.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks much for the question. serge, do you want to take that?
serge stankovic -- president
yes. let me start with our thinking around what potential indication for the m1 pam that we are currently developing. we are taking -- as we mentioned, in a broad stroke, we are looking at schizophrenia and the cognition and cognitive symptoms in dementia. when we talk about schizophrenia, obviously, one can pursue acute symptoms of schizophrenia, but also negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. we will be, what i say, following the molecule, listening to the molecule as we are developing it and conducting our phase ii because there are some indications -- there are some -- those that believe that m1 is more targeted toward and successful in the treatment of cognitive symptoms while the m4 may be more successful in treating the acute symptoms.
i would say that we -- as much as we believe in that lower, we would also -- there are data that suggest different, and we would like to evaluate as we further move with the development of m1 pam. as far as the m4 data from cerevel, i would say it's an impressive data. it is in acute -- short-term acute treatment of positive symptoms of schizophrenia. we looked at that data. first of all, we do need better treatments for schizophrenia. so we are very pleased to see such positive results as cerevel reported. but i would also say that we are seeing that as a validation of muscarinic receptor as a target for schizophrenia and are very, very pleased that we also have a program in development in that area.

our next question comes from the line of gregory renza from rbc capital markets. your question, please?
gregory renza -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much for taking my question. steve, just on the type a meeting. i know coming into that meeting you were really striving for an understanding of why the fda appeared to have changed their position there. i'm just curious, coming out of that now, if you felt as though you've reached that understanding and as you've alluded to, kind of, the alignment path forward. what that means for getting on a firmer footing with them with the next steps?
and then just secondly, on a separate topic just related to bd. just curious if you could update us on sort of your criteria there, especially as maybe the wider industry has been prompted to rethink assets and development plans following the aducanumab approval? thank you very much.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yes. sure. let me take them one at a time, and i'll answer the first question and then serge again feel free to add any additional color. look, i think this is a situation where reasonable minds can differ. and we believe our position in the way to look at drp broadly as one indication is supported by the data in the medical literature in terms of the way physicians think about this indication, most importantly in terms of the way it presents and the way it response to treatment. so we feel like we've got a very strong case there. we think our data from our harmony study is consistent and supports that position.
as serge mentioned, when you look at the drug-treated group in the randomized withdrawal portion of the study, between subgroups, the response is very similar. it's also very similar in the open-label portion of the study. so however, we respect the fact that the fda, particularly the psychiatry division, has a different position. and this is not to say that we're right and they are wrong or vice versa. they just have a different position than we do. so recognizing that, our objective is to accomplish two things. one is we want to get this drug to patients who desperately need it as fast as possible and, two, we want to get it to the broadest group of patients that can benefit from it. so as we go forward, we're going to focus on where we can try to find alignment to accomplish those two objectives, recognizing that we just have a reasonable difference of scientific opinion. serge, anything you want to add to that?
serge stankovic -- president
i think you summed it up quite well.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
okay. and then to your second question regarding bd, you broke up in, i think, a key part of the second question. could you repeat that?
gregory renza -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
sure, steve. just i'm curious if you could just update us on the criteria that you're applying when you look at external assets and just curious if some of the aducanumab approval while it's prompted by others in the sector to maybe rethink how to look at assets and development programs, if that applies to you as well?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks much for the question. i would say our strategy on business development is unchanged. we built a presence in both neurology and psychiatry. we have very strong franchises there both on the r&d as well as on the commercial and medical affairs fronts, and we're going to continue to pursue that. as it relates specifically to aducanumab, i would say that has not had a meaningful impact in terms of our view of assets and the development paths forward. having said that, i'll say we obviously -- this is a topic of great discussion in the general press. there's probably a political point of view and social points of view and medical points of view there that relate to how the fda is currently thinking about the accelerated approval pathway, and we'll continue to stay very much on top of that. but i would say when i step back and think about the things that are most impactful to our strategy on business development, this is not a -- this does not create a sea change or significant difference.
gregory renza -- rbc capital markets -- analyst

we have time for two more questions. our next question comes from the line of danielle brill from raymond james. your question, please?
danielle brill -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks so much for the question. this may be a follow-up to the one just asked, but maybe just if you could clarify a bit. steve, it seems like there's nothing gating to having another meeting with the fda. so i guess, can you just walk us through exactly what the next steps are from here to get that meeting scheduled? and then on the commercial side, i'm curious if you have any insights as to why pd office visits were down more in 2q than for 1q when the pandemic was at all-time highs? thank you.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks. i'll ask amanda to answer the second question in a second. but as it relates to the -- i'm sorry, danielle, could you repeat the first question?
danielle brill -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. i'm just wondering like what the steps are from here to having that follow-up discussion with the fda.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yes. got it. okay. sorry. so let me just cover kind of mechanically first. so mechanically, we need to submit the request. and then depending on whether it's a type a, b or c meeting, it will be a 30-, 60- or 75-day clock on the meeting and then we need to submit a briefing document 30 days before the meeting. so it's just mechanical rules that are in place with fda. we are working very diligently on the material that will be needed to be included in the briefing document, and we're going to confirm that we have that clearly within our sights before making the request.
so that's coming. and just as a little bit of additional context, i would say, as we've reported previously, we unfortunately didn't get an opportunity to learn of the fda's concerns in drp that led to the crl until we got the crl. so we're very thankful and appreciative of the opportunity to have the type a meeting we had and respond to those concerns. and so as we continue this dialogue, we want to make certain that we are very responsive to their concerns and responsive to the dialogue that we're having. and so in order to do that, now that we know those concerns, we've had an initial discussion with them, it's important to get this right for the next discussion as well. so that's, of course, our number one priority.
i'm sorry, amanda, do you want to take the second question?
amanda morgan -- senior vice president, chief revenue and customer officer
yes, sure. thanks, steve. thanks, danielle, for the question. specific to pd office visits, i'd just remind that we serve a pd patient population that is elderly. so as the pandemic continues, this is an elderly patient population that we serve.
danielle brill -- raymond james -- analyst

our final question for today comes from the line of vamil divan from mizuho securities. your question, please?
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thanks for squeezing me in and thanks for the details today. so maybe just one on the commercial side, again, i guess, for elena. just the comments around gross to net. maybe i know it's too early to kind of give formal guidance for next year or beyond. but can you just sort of talk about as you are just talking about the higher gross to net this year, is this sort of more the range you'd expect sort of generally speaking, going forward? or is this more of an unusual situation this year where things will kind of settle back down as we look at 2022 and beyond? thank you.
elena ridloff -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
so we -- as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've seen the volume from 340b institutions grow this year. it was pretty stable last year, in the low single digits, and it increased this year to mid- to high single digits. this is a trend that's been seen more broadly in the industry. so i wouldn't expect it to reverse. so as i mentioned in the -- we expect for this year, gross to net to be about 20%. and we'll provide guidance for next year on our 4q call in the february time frame.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the acadia pharmaceuticals third quarter 2021 financial results conference call. my name is gigi, and i'll be your coordinator for today.
i would now like to turn the presentation over to mark johnson, vice president of investor relations at acadia. please proceed.
mark johnson -- vice president, investor relations
[technical issues] today's call to discuss acadia's third quarter 2021 financial results. joining me on the call today from acadia are steve davis, our chief executive officer, who'll provide an overview of our q3 2021 financial performance and a review of our business operation. also joining us today is brendan teehan, our chief operating officer and head of commercial, who'll provide updates on our commercial performance. dr. serge stankovic, our president will discuss our pipeline progress; and our interim chief financial officer, mark schneyer will then discuss our financial results in more detail before turning it back to steve for final remarks and opening the call for your question. i would also like to point out that we are using supplemental slides, which are available on the events and presentation section of our website.
before we proceed, i would first like to remind you that during our call today, we'll be making a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements including goals, expectations, plans, prospects, growth potential, timing of events or future results are based on current information, assumptions and expectations that are inherently subject to change and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. these factors and other risks associated with our business can be found in our filings made with the sec. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are made only as of today's date.
i'll now turn the call over to steve.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
thank you, mark. good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. i'd like to start with a quick recap of our commercial performance followed by regulatory update for pimavanserin and a preview of our upcoming catalysts.
please turn to slide 4. first, i'd like to take a moment to remind everyone of our announcement last week that brendan teehan has been promoted to the position of chief operating officer and head of commercial. brendan has been a tremendous leader for our team, and i'm very excited to be able to further leverage his deep experience and strong capabilities. while brendan will take you through our commercial update in greater detail in a minute, let me just say that on a macro level, the parkinson's disease market continues to be significantly impacted as a result of the pandemic.
despite these challenges, nuplazid has outperformed branded drugs in the space and for the third quarter of 2021, nuplazid achieved $131.6 million in net sales. this represents a 9% year-over-year increase with sequential and year-over-year volume growth. as shown in the graph on the left, our team has continued to execute with year-over-year and sequential growth each quarter since the beginning of the year. to be more precise, nuplazid has outperformed the market basket of top prescribed brands in neurology and parkinson's disease in the office-based setting. similarly, nuplazid continued its strong outperformance in the long-term care channel.
our strong relative performance underscores our team's ability to adapt and find ways to grow our brand. this includes our recently launched branded campaign targeting healthcare providers, which promotes nuplazid's unique safety profile specifically as it relates to the parkinson's community. on the patient and caregiver front, we're in the process of launching a new dtc campaign aimed at solving one of our biggest covid-related challenges, which is physicians not seeing as many pdp patients in-person. as such, this dtc campaign is aimed at patients and caregivers who are at home and is designed to activate them to have a conversation with their doctor about their symptoms of psychosis and potential treatment with nuplazid. our growth initiatives, new leadership and strong relative performance give us confidence that we'll further accelerate the growth of nuplazid into 2022.
now let's move to our regulatory update regarding our snda for pimavanserin on slide 5. as you recall at our type a end of review meeting, the fda made it clear that today they are looking at individual subgroups of dementia rather than drp as a single group. accordingly, they stated that they believe our best path forward is to conduct an additional study in each subgroup where we seek approval. however, at that meeting, the fda also stated based on additional analyses [phonetic] we've shared with them that they are open to having another meeting to discuss whether there is a potential path to resubmission without an additional clinical study in any of the subgroups. this meeting is now scheduled and we expect to be able to report on the results of the meeting around year-end.
when we look at our dementia subgroup data, it is very clear that we have the most data for alzheimer's disease, which represent somewhere between 60% and 80% of all dementia patients in the u.s. our database includes two independent clinical studies providing evidence of pimavanserin antipsychotic efficacy in alzheimer's disease psychosis, study -019 and the harmony study. together, these studies demonstrate improvement in psychotic symptoms and reduction of risk of relapse of psychosis in adp patients. at our upcoming meeting with the fda, we look forward to sharing additional analyses we've done in response to feedback from the last meeting.
serge will provide more details on this opportunity in his section. as we look ahead, i'd like to highlight some important near-term catalysts as shown on slide 6. first, as i've noted, we look forward to providing an update from our meeting with the fda around year-end. second, we expect to announce top-line results from lavender, our pivotal phase 3 study for trofinetide in rett syndrome later this quarter. and third, we expect to announce top-line results from a phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating acp-044 in postoperative pain following bunionectomy surgery in the first quarter of 2022. finally, our company is well poised for further expansion. we have a healthy balance sheet, a growing revenue base and best-in-class in-house r&d and commercial teams. business development continues to be a key priority of our strategy and we continue to be very active on that front.
i would now like to turn the call over to brendan to discuss our commercial performance.
brendan teehan -- executive vice president, chief operating officer, head of commercial
thank you, steve. today, i'd like to review our third quarter performance for nuplazid in parkinson's disease psychosis, please turn to slide 8. in the quarter, we delivered net sales of $131.6 million. this quarterly performance represents sequential demand growth fueled by new patient starts and continuing patients with strong adherence and compliance rates. i'd like to start with a further dive into the current macroenvironment that we're operating in.
as we've stated previously, the pandemic has disproportionately affected the parkinson's disease patient population, significantly impacting the market. as shown on the slide, pd office visits and occupancy rates at long-term care facilities are still down significantly from pre-pandemic levels. despite this, nuplazid has continued to grow meaningfully throughout the period with strong relative performance as compared to the overall parkinson's disease and broader neurology markets. more specifically, when we compare recent quarterly performance with pre-pandemic performance of 2019, we see the following, in the office-based setting, carbidopa and levodopa are down 4% and the top 10 parkinson's brands on average are down 7% over that time period. and while the top 15 marketed neurology products are up 15%, nuplazid is up fully 28% for that same time period.
similarly, in the long-term care channel, carbidopa and levodopa are down 12% and the top 15 ltc brands are down on average 22%, while nuplazid has grown 8%. perhaps the most important of all of these data points is the carbidopa and levodopa total prescription trend. these are the fundamental pd movement disorder medications and they have trended down during the pandemic. this decline clearly signifies just how challenged the pd market has been over the past two years. however, against the backdrop of this environment, nuplazid has continued to grow in both channels giving us confidence in our future growth.
we've had to adapt and utilizing novel analytics and thoughtful implementation of our tactics have found new opportunities to grow new patient starts. our strong relative performance and continued growth across all channels underscores our commercial execution and gives us confidence that our tactics are working and will continue resonating in months ahead. furthermore, our team is not simply waiting around for the macroenvironment to improve. we are buckling down and working even harder to ensure that we are interacting with in educating physicians, patients and their caregivers on pd psychosis and treatment with nuplazid.
let's turn to slide 9 to continue the discussion on what we are doing to further grow the brand. to continue to drive brand choice and growth in the second half of the year, we have introduced two new important campaigns, one focused principally on the healthcare provider or hcp audience and the other focused on engaging patients and caregivers. on this slide, i'd like to discuss our new hcp focused messaging platform that educates the treating community on the unique safety profile of nuplazid, specifically as it relates to the parkinson's community. our campaign is amplified across all promotional channels, including our field teams and is resonating well with hcps. this messaging incorporates market research insights focused on hcp's treatment goals for parkinson's patients experiencing psychosis and specifically on nuplazid's safety and tolerability profile in light of other important medical consideration. the most notable being the desire to avoid impacting motor function. our messaging demonstrates a deep understanding of our clinicians' treatment goals by leveraging important clinical data to better educate physicians on nuplazid's safety and efficacy profile. while early in the roll-out of this campaign, this messaging is resonating with physicians and we see the opportunity to further increase diagnosis and capture a higher percentage of new pdp patients for nuplazid moving forward.
slide 10 highlights our new direct-to-consumer campaign, which is intended to reach patients and caregivers at home and drive them to their physicians to have conversations about their symptoms of psychosis and treatment with nuplazid. this campaign should help solve one of our biggest covid-related challenges, patients staying at home and not seeing their physicians in-person and therefore not adequately discussing their symptoms or new treatment options. our campaign has been on air since mid-october. it tells an important patient caregiver-centered story about the impact of pd psychosis. the ad introduces nuplazid and its potential treatment benefits to both patients and their families. the ad also includes a critical component of disease awareness to help patients understand and recognize the signs and symptoms and prevalence of psychosis in patients living with parkinson's disease. with the work our commercial team has been doing executing on the new message platform on the hcp side, this is the perfect time to introduce a new patient-centric campaign, drive new patients to their newly educated doctors and grow the nuplazid brand.
of course, while we expect to see traction in the fourth quarter, the full benefit of these complementary campaigns will be mostly realized in next year's growth. the bottom-line, patients and caregivers are in need of better treatment options such as nuplazid and patients and caregivers need to recognize the symptoms of psychosis and its connection to parkinson's disease. we are confident our campaigns will accomplish this.
i will now turn it over to serge.
serge stankovic -- president
thank you, brendan, and good afternoon, everyone. as steve mentioned, we have had a constructive dialog with the fda and are looking forward to our upcoming meeting. while we continue to believe that evaluating pimavanserin as a treatment for the broad dementia-related psychosis indication is most appropriate, we understand the fda's position and are preparing additional analysis [phonetic] to support pimavanserin as a potential treatment by dementia subgroup.
let's start the discussion on slide 12 with an overview of our harmony data, specifically looking at the alzheimer's disease subgroup, which as steve mentioned is the most prevalent form of dementia. on the left side of the slide is an overview of pimavanserin antipsychotic efficacy observed overall and in the alzheimer's [phonetic] disease subgroup in the open-label portion of the harmony study, as well as the primary efficacy outcome in the double-blind portion. as we previously noted, harmony was not powered to show statistical significance by dementia subgroup. however, we did prospectively plan exploratory efficacy analysis of dementia subgroups. in the alzheimer's disease subgroups, we see that alzheimer's disease subjects who remain of pimavanserin were about 40% less likely to experience a relapse of psychotic symptoms compared with those on placebo has shown with hazard ratio of 0.62. post-hoc analysis of the pimavanserin 34 milligram dose group, the dose currently approved for treating pdp patients showed about 50% risk reduction with a hazard ratio of 0.47.
for context, this magnitude of effect is in line with what has been observed in numerous relapse prevention studies of comparable design for approved drugs in various psychiatric indications such as schizophrenia or depression. in addition, this benefit is further supported by a number of complementary analysis, some examples of which are listed on the right hand side of the slide. these analysis consistently show the antipsychotic efficacy across different endpoints within the alzheimer's disease subgroup, which clearly support the overall conclusion of the clinically meaningful benefit that pimavanserin demonstrated in the treatment of psychosis in alzheimer's patients. furthermore, these additional analysis also demonstrate and confirm pimavanserin's observed antipsychotic treatment effect across all dementia subgroups and thus provide further supportive evidence for the benefit of pimavanserin in alzheimer's disease psychosis.
please turn to slide 13. in the upcoming meeting, we will also discuss with the fda our positive -019 study, a randomized, placebo-controlled study of pimavanserin for the treatment of symptoms of psychosis in alzheimer's disease patients. the primary efficacy outcome was positive with p-value equal to 0.045. in a pre-specified analysis of alzheimer's disease subjects with more severe psychotic symptoms, the magnitude of efficacy more than doubled with a p-value equal to 0.011.
in response to issues raised in the complete response letter, acadia has conducted multiple sensitivity and responder analysis that support the primary efficacy conclusion. note that the responder analysis shown on the right of the slide also demonstrate that pimavanserin had even greater efficacy in those patients with a higher severity of psychosis. to recap, pimavanserin has been evaluated in adp patients across two independent clinical studies, and in addition to positive and clinically meaningful efficacy has been well tolerated and importantly has not shown negative impact on cognition or motor function. in our next meeting with the fda, we will share several analysis and a substantial data set demonstrating the potential utility of pimavanserin in the treatment of adp in order to further examine the potential for resubmission without conducting additional clinical studies.
now i would like to discuss our pivotal phase 3 study evaluating trofinetide as a potential treatment for rett syndrome on slide 14. lavender is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study in approximately 180 young females age 5 to 20 with rett syndrome, patients are evaluated for 12 weeks. the co-primary endpoints are rett syndrome behavioral questionnaire or rsbq, a caregiver assessment tool and the clinical global impression of improvement or cgi-i, which is a physician assessment. we are currently on track to announce top-line results by year-end. and importantly, we have agreement with the fda that positive results from lavender in addition to supportive efficacy data from the previous phase 2 study and the safety database we are collecting could be sufficient to support a new drug application.
finally, let me remind you that there is nothing approved for the treatment of rett syndrome. rett is a devastating and burdensome disease for both the patients and their caregivers often requiring around-the-clock support. we have had several discussions with the key opinion leaders and experts in the field. they inform us that even a modest improvement of symptoms could make a significant and very meaningful difference in the ability to care for the patients and for their overall functioning. we look forward to announcing the results of this study in the near future.
slide 15 shows a summary of our phase 3 program evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which includes two pivotal studies, our positive advance-1 study and advance-2 which we initiated in the third quarter of last year. please turn to slide 16 for an update on our acp-044 program. our ongoing phase 2 study evaluating acp-044 for the treatment of postoperative pain following bunionectomy surgery is nearing enrollment completion. however, we now expect the results in the first quarter of 2022. this slight delay is due to slower than expected enrollment with the postponement of many elective surgeries during the summer covid-19 delta variant surge. in addition, as a reminder, earlier this year we initiated a phase 2 study for patients suffering from pain associated with osteoarthritis and plan to provide an update on this study next year.
slide 17 highlights a brief summary of our acp-319 m1 pam program for the potential treatment of schizophrenia and cognitive impairment in alzheimer's disease. we recently initiated a multiple ascending dose study as our phase 1 work continues for this program. turning to slide 18, at acadia, we're committed to investing in therapies to address high unmet needs in cns. our clinical development pipeline has two late stage phase 3 programs, as well as multiple early stage program. this year we have initiated multiple clinical studies, including acp-044 in acute pain in q1, acp-044 in chronic pain in q2, and most recently the acp-319 multiple ascending dose study.
with that, i'll turn the call over to mark.
mark schneyer -- senior vice president, business development, chief business and interim chief financial officer
thank you, serge. today, i'll discuss our third quarter 2021 results, please turn to slide 20. in the third quarter of 2021, we recorded $131.6 million in net sales, an increase of approximately 9% compared to $120.6 million of net sales in q3 of 2020. our net sales increase in q3 2021 represents 3% volume growth year-over-year. the gross to net adjustment for q3 2021 was 15.2%. weeks of inventory in the channel at the end of the third quarter was slightly down. as a result, sequential demand growth of approximately 3% was slightly higher than sequential selling growth of approximately 1%.
moving down the p&l, gaap r&d expenses decreased to $58.6 million in the quarter compared to $120.1 million in q3 2020. recall last year, gaap r&d expense included the $52.8 million upfront consideration and transaction costs related to our acquisition of cersci therapeutics. gaap sg&a expenses were relatively flat at $81.7 million in the third quarter compared to $81.6 million in the third quarter of last year. non-cash stock-based compensation expense during the quarter was $15.5 million compared to $21.4 million for the same period in 2020. our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $540.3 million.
i'll now provide some additional color on our financial expectations and guidance ranges for the remainder of the year, please turn to slide 21. as we mentioned previously, our commercial team is continuing to execute well and deliver quarter-over-quarter growth with strong relative performance in both channels. as a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we expect a much higher impact from gross to net as a result of accruing for the donut hole obligation associated with year-end inventory in the channel.
in addition, recall that last quarter we guided to gross to net being somewhere around 20% for the full-year. as we get closer to the end of the year, we have narrowed the top end of our full-year 2021 net sales guidance range to $480 million to $500 million from the previous range of $480 million to $515 million. our net sales guidance assumes that inventory levels remain relatively flat in the channel as we approach the end of the year.
i'd like to provide a little bit more commentary on our net sales guidance. as we saw on slide 8 of brendan's presentation, our leading indicators of pd office visits and ltc occupancy rates has started to improve in the first half of the year. however, in the third quarter, they seem to have leveled off or declined. this is a reflection of the covid-19 delta variant surge we experienced in the summer. our net sales guidance range factors and scenarios that depends on how long our leading indicators remain relatively flat versus how quickly they return to grow.
moving on to the expense side for 2021, we have lowered our gaap r&d guidance to be between $230 million and $245 million for the full-year from our previous range of $250 million to $270 million. and finally, we have slightly narrowed the top end of our gaap sg&a full-year guidance range to be between $385 million to $405 million from $385 million to $415 million.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to steve.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
thank you, mark. please turn to slide 23. in closing, i'd like to remark on how proud i'm of our teams for their execution this year. our commercial team has worked tirelessly all year on delivering pimavanserin to more parkinson's patients and their families who are suffering from the symptoms of psychosis. they've achieved more with less and continue to push through the pandemic conditions. our r&d team has executed during a time when patient enrollment is difficult. we're now poised to report out on two key clinical studies, phase 3 results from lavender, our trofinetide study in rett syndrome and phase 2 results from our acp-044 study in postoperative pain. and, of course, we look forward to providing additional clarity regarding adp around year-end. finally, i would like to thank all of our employees for their commitment to our mission to elevate life.
i'll now open up the call for questions. operator?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] please standby while we compile the q&a roster. our first question comes from the line of neena bitritto-garg from citi. your line is now open.
neena bitritto-garg -- citi -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. so just a question about the commercial performance of nuplazid. i guess, can you comment at all on the pace of new starts during the quarter versus q2? and then also just on q4, just from -- from mark's commentary just now, it sounds like we should expect a higher gross to net and kind of similar patient dynamics quarter-over-quarter, i guess, should -- is it kind of safe for us to assume that q4 could actually be kind of a down quarter? thanks.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the questions, neena. i'm going to ask brendan answer the first question and mark, the second.
brendan teehan -- executive vice president, chief operating officer, head of commercial
neena, thanks for the question. the question regarding new patient starts in the third quarter, we are seeing new patient starts that are approaching the pre-pandemic levels, so largely comparable in between the quarters. as we head into the fourth quarter with dtc and our increased -- and our efforts with our hcp campaign, we would expect to continue growth moving into 2022.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
thanks, brendan. mark?
mark schneyer -- senior vice president, business development, chief business and interim chief financial officer
yeah, neena, thanks for the question. i think with the range of scenario -- of guidance that we put out for net sales, there's -- i think what i want to point out is, there is volume growth across that full range. but yes we are with an expected higher gross to net adjustment for the fourth quarter at the lower end of that range, the implication for fourth quarter net sales has got -- reported net sales at the bottom end of the range would be lower than the third quarter reported net sales.
neena bitritto-garg -- citi -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of cory kasimov from jpmorgan. your line is now open.
gavin scott -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, this is gavin on for cory. we had a question actually on drp regulatory review, carano [phonetic] is expected to invest their drug candidate for drp, but are now planning to launch a phase 3 next year in adp specifically, have you had any feedback from the agency about how they're broadly thinking about the drp setting relative to the independent components as this development would seem to -- to help your case?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
gavin, i didn't hear the second part of that question, could you repeat that part?
gavin scott -- jpmorgan -- analyst
i just said that this development would seem to help your case?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
got it, ok, thanks. well look, we can't obviously comment on what other people's interactions are with the fda. i would just simply say that the fda has made it clear to us that they think the correct way to assess this population based upon reviewing our data is on a subgroup by subgroup basis. so that's what we're focused on, that's what we'll be focused on at the next meeting.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ritu baral from cowen. your line is now open.
ritu baral -- cowen -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking the question. i did want to follow up on that last question, i guess, i was going to ask it a slightly different way. as you approach this meeting and come out on the far side, if the fda does prove immovable, is an adp specific trial sort of the best next option, and so far as you clearly have treatment effect, it would just take a well powered study to address as you mentioned 60% to 80% of the overall drp population? and then further as you plan to discuss -019, can you remind us -- i believe the fda sort of changed its mind on whether they considered -019 a well-controlled study and i think that was around sort of like the whole quote-unquote, administrative single center aspect of it. can you remind us of what their interpretation of well-controlled was versus acadia's conduct of the study? thanks.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question, ritu. i'm going to take the first part, i'm going to ask serge to answer the -019 portion of the question. serge, if you have any other comments regarding the harmony, please chime in as well. so just to recap very briefly, we received a crl in april, and through that process and our type a meeting, the fda made it clear that they are looking at dementia-related psychosis on a subgroup by subgroup basis as i mentioned a second ago.
at our type a meeting, we presented data to the -- that was intended to demonstrate both a consistency of response on drug-treated patients versus placebo-controlled patients or placebo-treated patients. and also cluster analyses that broke down the individual components of the saps-h+d scale, which was used throughout the study, it's used for enrollment entry criteria, it was used during the 12-week response period and then during the six-month randomized portion of the study.
and when we broke that down on individual components, what we saw again was a very consistency of response irrespective of underlying subgroups. so across each of those elements, patients looked pretty much the same when they came into the study, they looked -- they responded in a very similar way during the 12-week open-label period and then they responded -- those on drug that has responded in a very similar way during the randomized portion of the study.
the one area where we did see difference was in the placebo group on patients that have both comorbid parkinson's disease and trench [phonetic] dementia. and in that group, we saw a more rapid relapse in that group relative to patients sub -- placebo patients in other subgroups, and we attribute that to the fact that these patients were taking dopaminergic therapies for their motor function and that is known to, can exacerbate psychotic symptoms.
so at the conclusion of that meeting, the fda said we get your points, we think you made some valid points, we want to reiterate we think the best way to study this population is on a subgroup by subgroup basis, and we think your best path forward is to run an additional study in each of the subgroups that you were seeking approval, however, didn't get to complete the conversation. it's a one-hour meeting, of course, through dialog back and forth before the meeting, and they said, we would be very open to having another meeting with you if you like to further discuss the potential for resubmitting without an additional clinical study.
and so what we're telling you today is, we think the subgroup where that is -- where there's the greatest potential of doing that is in alzheimer's disease psychosis. that's the group that was about 70% of the population in our harmony study, also epidemiologically it represents about 70% of dementia patients and we also have our study -019 that serge will speak to in a second, where we had a very positive result in the alzheimer's dementia psychosis population. and so for all those reasons, as we said, we're very focused now on this next meeting in taking new analyses that we've done since the last meeting that focuses on the alzheimer's disease psychosis population. so we look forward to having that meeting, obviously, that's the next step we need to have a meeting, and as soon as we have, we'll be able to give further guidance about next steps. serge, do you want to address the -019 study.
serge stankovic -- president
yes, thank you. in respect to -019 study, just a reminder, our alzheimer's disease psychosis study that was conducted in the care homes, in a number of care homes in the uk, fda raised certain issues that in the complete response letter, they expressed concern that makes it difficult for them to consider this study adequate and well-controlled study. these issues by the fda can be roughly categorized into two buckets, one is related to the design of the study and the others are related to conduct of the study or the protocol deviations that were recorded and reported in the study.
in respect to design, two specific issues were emphasized, one that this is a single center study, and the second is that the secondary outcome measures, there was no type 1 error control for the secondary outcomes. we believe that we can and intend to address these concerns, particularly from the perspective that in our understanding none of these are requirements for the adequate and well-controlled study. just as a reminder as i said, this study is done under coordination of a single investigator in the uk, but it was done in a number of care homes or nursing homes throughout the broader uk, london area.
from the perspective of the conduct, we also intend to address not only in detail the, specifically the protocol deviations that are reported, and by the way, they are reported in the study report from very beginning and we discussed them, but we will further elaborate on the specifics and timing and their ability to impact the study per se and the interpretation of the results, but also we will provide a number of additional sensitivity analysis that are intended to demonstrate that these protocol deviations did not impact the overall conclusions of the study in anyway.
so in short, we are -- from the data perspective, we have a level of comfort that we can address these concerns raised by the fda and that is exactly what we intend to do in the -- in our meeting, as well as in -- eventually in the resubmission. and we believe that following that, this study can and should be considered adequate and well-controlled study and supportive in the overall as an independent evidence of efficacy of pimavanserin in the alzheimer's disease psychosis.
ritu baral -- cowen -- analyst
got it, thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of charles duncan from cantor fitzgerald. your line is now open.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yes, hi, good afternoon, steve and team. first of all, thanks for taking our question and congrats on a solid quarter. i wanted to ask you one commercial question and then one pipeline question. regarding the commercial question, i guess i'm thinking about the two new campaigns for hcps and direct-to-consumer, and i think brendan suggested that higher percentage of pdp diagnosis would be the goal. i guess i'm wondering if you could provide us some color on where you're at today and where you'd like to be in say 12 months?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
sure. brendan, go ahead.
brendan teehan -- executive vice president, chief operating officer, head of commercial
excuse me, charles, thank you very much for the question. first i'd say, we're excited about both campaigns. the hcp campaign is focused on drawing attention to the ability to improve psychosis while not impacting motor function. we know that our patients are going to see their hcps principally because of their parkinson's disease and we need to weave in the story about parkinson's disease psychosis and the need to treat. we've done market research on the campaign. hcps are responding very favorably to it. they demonstrate an interest, a higher interest in prescribing nuplazid as a function of telling the story that way.
the second campaign more focused on patients and caregivers, you can see in the dtc story, which is to, first of all, highlight nuplazid as the solution to parkinson's disease psychosis, but every bit is importantly to make sure that those patients and caregivers understand that this is a normal part of their parkinson's disease experience, and thus it's important to bring that situation to their hcp's attention. so we are using those in a complementary fashion. we've been very proud of the dtc campaigns up to now and how that has engaged patients and caregivers with their treaters in that conversation and we're very confident that, that will happen again here.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
okay. and then second question is for serge on the pipeline, perhaps you just answered this in addressing ritu's question, but i'm wondering if you could provide us a little bit more color on the new analyses that have been conducted, are they primarily around efficacy or they -- are they around safety? i mean, brendan just mentioned a lack of impact on motor function and it would seem to me that would be important, as well as cognition in the adp population. so what kind of analyses have you conducted? and then secondarily, when would you be able to update this, would the meeting happen by the end of the year or would you be in a position to update by the end of this year or so?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yeah, serge, please go ahead.
serge stankovic -- president
yes, thanks, charles. let me just get one by one. in regard to new analyses, i'll start first of all by stating something that we previously also stated that questions raised in the complete response letter were related to the way of how the efficacy evidence in the patient population should be derived, and the -- as steve said, what is the appropriate way of evaluating efficacy in dementia patients with psychosis whether as a group or as by dementia subtype.
so as you can imagine, most of the discussion that we have is around that evidence efficacy in patient population. and in this specific case, we are preparing a number of analyses that are specifically designed to whether it's natural to start with a subgroup that is the largest subgroup of alzheimer's disease psychosis, whether we are providing a broader additional analyses, and i'll comment on that just in a second. but also i don't want to address your question about safety, and that is there were issues related to safety, because the pimavanserin safety profile is unchanged and all the additional data that we have provided in the supplemental nda did not open any new questions in regard to the safety of pimavanserin.
that calls as well for the certain safety benefit that we see with pimavanserin and that is related to the motor function and specifically in this patient population with dementia to lack of negative impact in -- in cognition -- in cognitive functioning. and, of course, that is a part, it was a part of our supplemental nda submission, it's also a part of this discussion where we certainly are providing the information in that respect. in regard to specifically alzheimer's disease psychosis and the additional evidence that, that can be looked at in three -- grouped in three different groups. one is related to the primary and secondary outcome, and that is of the reduction in relapse, as well as reduction in the upper clause [phonetic] discontinuation in this specific group, where we are providing variety of ways of looking into that analyses and demonstrating the benefit that is clinically meaningful and substantive.
as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, between 40% and 50% reduction, where we're also providing not only the overall in the alzheimer's group, but also specifically in the larger group of patients that received 34 milligram, which is a dose we -- recommended dose and the approved dose in pdp and recommended dose in drp or alzheimer's disease psychosis. second group analyses is following the -- different ways of measuring severity of psychotic symptoms in all of the patients following randomization either to continue active treatment with pimavanserin or to discontinue pimavanserin and switch to placebo or to placebo. we are following over time, the severity of symptoms in these two groups of patients both on the scale for psychotic symptoms for hallucinations and delusions, as well as in the clinical global impression of change and improvement, where we are looking at and demonstrating that patients that remaining on treatment continue -- overall continue with the benefit of pimavanserin in terms of control of psychotic symptoms.
we are also looking on the relationship of the dose and drug exposure, pharmacokinetic exposure and the efficacy of the drug as another way of looking of the -- that the effects that we're seeing and benefit that we're seeing in patients that are receiving pimavanserin is real true effect and not spurious finding. and the third group of evidence is really related to the broader overview of the response across different dementia subtypes and characterization of psychotic symptoms prior to treatment, following the treatment with one purpose, and that is to demonstrate the benefits that we're seeing across the subgroup is another supportive evidence that what we're seeing in alzheimer's disease psychosis subgroup is a real effect. and finally, i would just mention that we're also looking at categorical presentation of response across different categories of patients, specifically in the alzheimer's disease psychosis and confirming again both overall and in the 34 milligram group, the substantive evidence of benefit in treating patients with pimavanserin. so i hope this helps on the -- on a broader scale.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
definitely. look forward to hearing the response from the agency, hopefully, they allocate more than an hour to you and forget about the timing of the response, we'll just hear when we hear it.
serge stankovic -- president
yeah, well, i'm sorry, i will address that, i just slipped my mind. we are saying that we -- meeting is scheduled, we will have the meeting and anticipate that we will receive minutes from that meeting around year-end. just because we're talking about year-end holidays, it's a little bit difficult for us to confidently say that, that whether we will receive the minutes before the end of the year or maybe just after the end year and therefore, we are characterizing that around year-end.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
very good. thanks for the added color, serge.
serge stankovic -- president
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of yatin suneja from guggenheim partners. your line is now open.
yatin suneja -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
thank you. hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. just a few question on trofinetide. so you guys are looking at two or a co-primary endpoint, could you comment on what sort of agreements you have with the fda if you hit on one and what exactly you are aiming to show both on rsbq and cgi-i? and the second question i have is that could you also confirm to us or let us know if all patients have entered the ole portion of the study or are there any patients who decided to enter -- to not enter the ole after the 12-week treatment period?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks much for the question. serge, do you want to take both of those?
serge stankovic -- president
yeah, thanks, yatin. first in terms of the co-primary measure, as we have disclosed to actually having the actual data from the study, i think i would hesitate to speculate on different scenarios that may occur, obviously, what we are focused on is obtaining a positive result and statistical separation of both the rett syndrome behavioral questionnaire scale and on the clinician scale. rest assured, we are certainly preparing for all different scenarios in the background, but i don't think it would serve any good purpose for us to speculate what would be -- what would happen if it happens.
from the -- on the second point, vast majority of patients -- we, of course, don't provide again the specific numbers, but i can say that vast majority of patients have rolled over into the open-label extension of the study. and therefore, i think that's -- that hasn't been an issue from the perspective of the further safety exposures on the patient -- for the patients in this program.
yatin suneja -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. just one more clarifying question on the timeline, could you just maybe let us know how long it might take for you to analyze the data once the trial is completing, just trying to get a sense that if these data could sort of get pushed to january?
serge stankovic -- president
i can just say that we are on track to report top-line results from this study before the end year, there hasn't been a change in that respect.
yatin suneja -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. good luck with that. thank you.
serge stankovic -- president
thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of marc goodman from svb leerink. your line is now open.
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst
serge, you explained nicely what new data you're going to be given to the fda when you do the meeting, but i'm just curious there were a couple of slides that you went over with us today, has the fda even seen that data, that subgroup data of alzheimer's?
serge stankovic -- president
yes, marc, thanks for the question. we have in the previous meeting discussed some of this, so they have seen some of the data, discussion in the general terms of what we should be providing have been discussed, but some of the output on some of this analyses hasn't. so it's sort of a mixture in that regard. but they have -- we have provided them with a good general idea what direction we are moving in that respect, and we'll be providing much more color in the next meeting in terms of the output and specific data.
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst
right, ok. and then just separately commercial question, can you just give us a sense of how the reps in the office has just changed relative to second quarter and how -- in the third quarter and then how fourth quarter has changed, just give us a sense of the past four months how that's changed?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question, marc. brendan, do you want to take that?
brendan teehan -- executive vice president, chief operating officer, head of commercial
sure. marc, thanks for the question. we have seen improved access rates for our representatives both in the community and ltc setting. so i think we previously reported very much in line with what we've seen in the industry. we're up around 70% of visits being face to face, it varies a little bit between community and ltc, but we are encouraged by what we're seeing so far in the early fourth quarter.

and where were we three months ago?
brendan teehan -- executive vice president, chief operating officer, head of commercial
so we would -- we were reporting in the 60%, 65% range, so it's continuing to arc up.
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
maybe just to again say a little bit more, it's very low at the beginning of the year for us and everyone else. and what we've seen in the industry is month by month from the beginning of this year, those numbers were really going up on a very continual and meaningful basis [technical issues]. with the delta variant, you saw that slowdown quite a bit. so where we stand today is, as brendan mentioned about 70% of our details are in-person, about 30% are virtual. and i think as we see the impact of the delta variant kind of pull all the way through and you guys are all seeing the same press that we are, i think we're probably approaching that point now, we'll see the impact of the delta variant pass as well.
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of gregory renza from rbc capital markets. your line is now open.
gregory renza -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, steve and team. my congratulations on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. steve, just to follow up on the regulatory update that -- that's expected and as you proceed with engaging the fda, i know you -- in the past, you have characterized that the stance as more of an agree to disagree position with respect to the totality of drp versus the subgroups, and i'm just curious, if you can comment quickly on how that's evolved if that changes you're going into the subgroup meeting or the meeting on the subgroup with respect to starting with alzheimer's disease, and just your level of enthusiasm that that's the right way to proceed with the drp indication going forward? thank you very much.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
let me take -- thanks for the question, greg. let me take a little bit of running start at it. there is no drug approved to treat dementia-related psychosis, there is no drug approved to treat alzheimer's disease psychosis, so we're breaking ground. we today have undoubtedly the largest safety database in dementia-related psychosis patients or alzheimer's disease psychosis patients. in addition, we've done really groundbreaking work in terms of trying to determine how to treat these patients.
our view has not changed. we still believe that the best way to study this population is looking at dementia-related psychosis as a whole, reasons for that described very thoroughly before.the underlying etiology is relevant as it relates to the dementia itself, but as it relates to psychosis, the symptoms are very similar, they respond in a very similar way, and we think that is the best way to study population. however, in this groundbreaking area, where there is very little data to go on, we understand that reasonable minds [phonetic] can differ and the fda does not share that view.
their view is that we should be looking at things and they should be looking at things on a subgroup by subgroup basis. so recognizing that, we have pivoted to focus on that for the next meeting, describe the history of the crl dialog we've had, and i would just simply say at this point in time that fda, this includes the division of psychiatry, as well as the office of neuroscience have been very engaged. it's a very important topic to them, of course, it's a very important topic to us as well. and together, we expect that this next meeting to come to a conclusion. we are eager to make a decision and move forward. and if they remain engaged in the way that they have been up to this point, i think the prospects are very good. but i'll simply say, again, this is a new area where there's a lot of virgin territory that has not been encountered before. having said that, when we look at our data in adp, that is alzheimer's disease psychosis, we think that data represents a strong case for the utility of pimavanserin from both an efficacy, as well as a safety and tolerability perspective for utility in those -- in that patient population. we need to have that meeting with fda to see if we can find alignment around that.
gregory renza -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, steve. i appreciate the color.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ami fadia from needham. your line is now open.
ami fadia -- needham -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my question. i had a follow-up on drp and want to ask the question in a slightly different way, is the point of contention with the fda around whether or not there is adequate data in the alzheimer's disease sub population or whether or not the phase 2 study can be viewed as acceptable as part of registrational package, if you could give us your best sort of view on that? and then i have a different question.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
well, i'll try to give you a little bit of additional color and then serge feel free to jump in if anything else you want to add. i think when we designed our phase 3 program and we aligned with the fda about how to pursue that program, we and the fda aligned around a design that was not to study alzheimer's disease psychosis or dementia with lewy body psychosis or parkinson's dementia psychosis, it was to study all of these subgroups as one single group, and so that's the phase 3 program we ran.
today, as i've just described, the fda has a perspective that we should be looking at things or they are looking at things on a subgroup by subgroup basis. and so from that perspective, we're in a situation that is a little bit atypical because we're talking about now a group that was not -- where we did not design the study to show statistically significant data on a subgroup basis, but we have very clinically meaningful results in that subgroup. and serge described i think very thoroughly, we've looked at things from a multitude of cross-sectional perspectives to see if we have consistency in that data and we do.
we also have our -019 study that was focused on just alzheimer's disease psychosis patients, we have a positive study there, as serge has described, we need to have further dialog with fda around the perspective of that being an adequate and well-controlled study. so that's where the pieces on the chessboard are. we're very eager to have the next meeting with fda to see if we can align around the data to the data that we have.
serge stankovic -- president
yeah, if i just may add, i think it's very important to remember that with everything that steve said that we did not set out to study alzheimer's disease psychosis subgroup or any other subgroup specifically, but more as a group that now that we are aligning out the evidence for benefit in that specific subgroup, this has to be taken in the context of actually us having two positive studies. one positive study is -019 study and the second positive study is drp study, and looking at the subgroup of alzheimer's disease psychosis is in the context of the robustly positive overall evidence or efficacy. this is a very different situation that if you would look on the study that failed on its primary analyses and then you're looking at a subgroup and seeing whether there is a benefit in the subgroup, completely different, and from that perspective, much more persuasive and convincing in terms of evidence. so we believe that there is independent evidence to two separate studies demonstrating benefit in this particular subgroup of dementia.
ami fadia -- needham -- analyst
great, that was very helpful. my second question is on trofinetide, and you answered a question earlier about the co-primary endpoints and the clinical meaningfulness of those, i understand that any type of improvement would be welcome in this patient population, however, as we think about the chronic nature of treatment and the possible requirements of other supportive care for these patients, how would you think about pricing the drug should it get approved?
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks much for the question. i think as much as i'd like to answer the question, i think it would just be premature and imprudent for us to comment on pricing at this juncture. the next step, of course, in that program is to open the envelope, determine the results and if they're -- if we have results that support an application, we'll file it and look forward to moving forward. i would just simply say that as is the case with nuplazid, we would seek to price the drug based on the value that we're delivering. it is in the rett syndrome population, it's a very, very unfortunate situation, where it's -- the extraordinarily high disease burden, and if we can help improve the lives of those patients and their caregivers, we think that'd be very important from a medical perspective.
ami fadia -- needham -- analyst
got it. i appreciate that. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of paul matteis from stifel. your line is now open.
paul matteis -- stifel -- analyst
hey, thanks so much. i had a couple of questions on the refiling strategy and just the drp data in general. i guess one is just kind of related to reconciling one thing we've had trouble wrapping our heads around and that is you speak to patients with drp presenting similarly and responding similarly, but just going back to the forest plot, the hazard ratio in parkinson's is around 0.1 and it's a lot higher in other subgroups except for lewy body. so i was just kind of curious how you explain that and if that is not driven by biological differences and disease in your view?
and then second on the adp subgroup, can you just speak to statistics or anything around that, that can kind of quantitatively bolster your case. i know you talked about a 40% relapse reduction, but the hazard ratio upper bounds is almost 1.5. so how do you think fda will view that quantitatively speaking or if there is any sort of p-value that's tied to it? thanks so much.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks much for the question. serge, do you want to take those?
serge stankovic -- president
yes. let me address first question. paul you characterized, well, the principal question about the difference that we see in the observed hazard ratio in parkinson's disease psychosis versus the other subgroups of dementia, like alzheimer's. and what i think the question is, is that really a reason for the biological difference in the response or there is something else going on here that we could point out to and think of, i will, first of all, say, when you just look to the relapse rates in patients on pimavanserin versus relapse rates in patients on placebo after randomization, what we see actually that relapse rates among dementia subtypes are very similar for the groups on pimavanserin, where the difference really is striking is in placebo where patients are randomized to discontinuation of treatment, it turns out that the parkinson's disease patients relapse much faster at a faster rate than all other patients from group.
so we thought about that why is that happening, because it's on the active treatment, the relapse rates are fairly similar among different subtypes, and thought about what is unique about parkinson's disease patients that is not present in other subtype. one thing that is unique is actually dopaminergic therapy, it is dopamine stimulating therapy or replacement therapy that these patients are on, all of them are on that, there is virtually just in the whole sample we have just one that wasn't. and when you look at and what is happening is that there additional sort of a stimulus that while the psychotic symptoms are controlled once you discontinue antipsychotic treatment in these patients, they relapse faster because they have this additional kind of promoting element in their concomitant therapy.
so we have presented -- when we intent to present some additional data to fda in that regard, because we look this -- there are small samples, obviously, there is very few other patients that are not parkinson's that are on dopamine stimulating therapy, but we can look at that and look at the patterns, and it seems that there is some confirmation of this hypothesis that we are -- so what we see in our data, it's not about biological difference, it is about confounding related to the concomitant therapy effects that we are seeing in this subgroup. so i hope that helps a little bit with your conundrum and reconciling these different hazard ratios.
and now, i'll ask you in regard to the second part of your question, it escaped my mind, while i was thinking and talking about this. so if you can remind me please?
paul matteis -- stifel -- analyst
yeah, no worries, serge, and thank you for the thoughts there, that was super interesting. as it relates to the adp subgroup right, i mean, we see the 40% relapse reduction, but we also see the hazard ratio for the 95% confidence interval, the upper bounds almost 1.5, which would suggest this is really far away from statistical significance or at least there is -- it's telling you there is a ton of, i guess just sample size issue in the data and i'd be kind of curious how you think about that?
serge stankovic -- president
well, the -- as steve said, the study is not designed to test statistically separation in the subgroups, because we needed to have more patients in each of the subgroups in order to see that as a reasonable power. so confidence intervals that you're seeing are actually simply a consequence of the sample size that we have, smaller the sample size, larger the confidence intervals that you are talking about.
but what we are presenting the body of evidence related to alzheimer's disease psychosis is a number of different analysis, some of them reached statis -- nominal statistical significance, some doesn't, but what is important point is consistency of that effect. the question is, is the 40% or 50% risk reduction that we are seeing, nobody argued, it's clinically meaningful and robust. the question is, is that a spurious finding or it is a real true effect.
and one way to demonstrate that, if you look to consistency of different analytical approaches, different outcome measures, different time points and point out to that consistency. and, let's say, sometimes it's not significant, sometimes it's significant nominally, because these are -- some of these are post-hoc analysis or not controlled for type 1 error. but the point is, if you see something consistently, you start to be convinced that it is actually a true effect and true benefit rather than some spurious chance findings.
paul matteis -- stifel -- analyst
all right. thank you so much, serge.
serge stankovic -- president
thank you.

thank you. we have time for one more question. our next question comes from the line of jeff hung from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. for acp-044, can you provide more granularity on when you expect to complete enrollment and when in the first quarter the data might readout? i guess when would you need to have the enrollment completed for the data in january versus data in march, just appreciate any color you can provide. thanks.
stephen r. davis -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks so much for the question, jeff. serge, do you want to take that?
serge stankovic -- president
yes, happy to. thanks, jeff. what i will say is that we -- as i said, we are experiencing some headwinds, but it's a slight delay. we anticipate that we should be completing enrollment before the end of the year, by the end of the year, and therefore by sometimes within the first quarter or toward the end of first quarter, we should have top -line results. that's again as i'm saying is in the context of dependency, particularly sensitivity of this type of elective surgeries and enrollment there is always a certain level of uncertainty, but we are -- that's generally our expectation.
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right. thank you.
operator
thank you. at this time, i'm showing no further questions. i would like to turn the call back over to steve davis for closing remarks.
