[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of edward kelly from wells fargo.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah. hi, guys. good morning.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
first question is on the whole foods contract. any more detail that you can provide? i think the economics were the same, which i'm not so sure was the case the last time you extended it. and then it's been extended for two years. i thought last time, maybe it was extended longer.
so just any additional thoughts you can provide there?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, sure. thanks. i am unbelievably proud of what we've accomplished in this negotiation because it really demonstrated to us and it demonstrated to amazon and whole foods how important the programs are and how important the companies are to each other. and if you remember, those of you who have been around for a while, we typically had negotiated with whole foods every five years.
and now, we've got a whole new process because whole foods is no longer independent. so we're dealing with two parties. and so really, one way to look at it is in the old world, even though we had a 10-year contract, we were really negotiating a brand-new one every five years, which to me meant we had a five-year contract, and now, we have a seven or almost seven, and so that's a spectacular result. for those who follow amazon, you know that those kinds of contracts are really unusual.
and so we feel really fortunate to be able to get that done. as far as the economics, you're 100% right, they're essentially the same as the agreement that we currently have in place. and just for perspective, seven years is a long, long time. it's, i think, one of the longest contracts that we have throughout the entire company.
and just for perspective, amazon in 2014 was $80 billion. i think they did $386 billion last year, so 6 times growth. so to be able to have a customer that exhibits that kind of growth, i think, is something that is really good for our shareholders.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. and then just a second question for you on how -- customer products or vendor promotions and kind of what you're seeing out there in the marketplace today. has that picked up at all? remind us what a normalization in that sort of means for your p&l. and then as we look at the gross margin, i know shrink helped, but i guess, the vendor stuff hurt.
as we sort of think about the world normalizing, can you sustain sort of flat wholesale gross margins when we net all this out?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i mean, we don't guide to gross margin, number one. but number two is -- what i would tell you, there's far more tailwinds than there are headwinds and as it relates generally to gross margin. because if you think about general service level is still lagging where it was pre-pandemic pretty significantly. and when you're in a situation where suppliers are having a hard time still in filling the demand, there's obviously a lack of promotional activity as well.
so the retailers are seeing that in their gross margin, right? because since there's no promotional activity, they have a higher retail margin. but because we do have margin that we earn in promotional periods, when we start to get the fill rate back, when the manufacturers start promoting again, when the retailers start promoting again, that's going to be an opportunity for unfi to be able to jump back in, in a big way to that marginal income. now, we don't disclose the value associated with it, but it's a good number and it's a pretty significant tailwind for us. the other thing is inflation.
inflation still runs in the 100-basis-point range. and we all have an expectation that, again, once we come out of covid, once products start returning to the shelves, once retailers start bringing back all the items that the manufacturers discontinued, we're going to start seeing some of those input costs passed through, and that's a really good thing for us as well.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of rupesh parikh from oppenheimer.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question and congrats on the nice quarter. so i guess just starting with the guidance. so you guys now expect ebitda and eps to be at the higher end of the range, but you didn't change your sales expectation.
so just curious why you still believe in the current sales range and you having adjusted that. and also the key food contract, i was just curious in terms of what sort of contribution you expect related to key food this year? and then what percent impacts next year?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i'll start with the key food. i'll start with the key food. key food is not going to start until our next fiscal year into 2022. go ahead, john.
john howard -- chief financial officer
yes. no, i appreciate it. that was going to be part of the comment. so the key food will be fy '22 as we continue to invest in the allentown facility.
as we think about the sales and the ebitda numbers that we're seeing right now, we feel comfortable from a top-line perspective with the range that we provided, what we're seeing as we think about the first half of fy '21 and what we are forecasting in the back half. we're seeing the continued improvement in value coming from the leverage and the scale that comes from unfi, and we're seeing the continued value from our value path and productivity initiatives that are flowing through our margin and sg&a, opex. we're seeing all of that flow through our p&l. so that's why we're thinking about from holding net debt sales in that range but guiding toward the upper end on the ebitda and eps.
and of course, the eps is getting the benefit of the interest as well.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
rupesh, what i would tell you is good management teams look out two years in advance. and i would tell you, this is a really good management team because, as you know, we made a lot of big strategic decisions a couple of years ago. and what's proving out is pretty close to what we hoped to do, and that was to be able to grow our bottom-line ebitda at a rate that was considerably faster than our top line. and that's exactly what's happening as a result of a lot of initiatives to increase productivity, to optimize the network, and to provide a higher level of service to our customers, and that's what we're doing.
from a revenue perspective, i think chris gave some just terrific analogies in his script that essentially tried to explain wholesale revenue growth versus retail revenue growth. and i think that's where a lot of people get confused because the retail revenue growth has retail margin embedded in it. i think the important note is that unfi, on a net basis, is growing considerably faster than the market itself.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
ok. great. and then --
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i think, rupesh, just to build on a lot of that is just the idea that, number one, we are so confident in the guidance that we provided that we're actually providing that guidance. i mean, it's something where we feel good about our numbers. we feel good about our outlook for fy '21 that we are putting the guidance out there.
so we feel really, really good about that.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
ok. great. and then just one follow-up question. so since we don't have comparable financials for the prior year for q3.
so you look at the operating expense this quarter is around $860 million or so. is that the right baseline to think about going forward? i don't know if you can provide any color there. and then you also called out a reduction in benefit expense this quarter. so i don't know if you can quantify what that temporary benefit was for the quarter.
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we generally don't provide any information or any guidance by quarter. if i think about -- i know you want to think about your model in the back half. i think the part that we would focus on is the upper end of that ebitda range and the upper end of the eps range.
i think that's what we're focused on. we manage, of course, the entire p&l, but we wouldn't provide that information by quarter, rupesh.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
ok. great. thank you. i'll pass it along.
john howard -- chief financial officer
appreciate it. thanks.

your next question comes from the line of john heinbockel from guggenheim.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hey, steve. curious, you talked about the $90 million of cross-sell revenue. roughly speaking, what was the contribution from new accounts, right, as part of that $450 million? and then what does the pipeline look like? and is it predominantly -- if you think about independents versus -- i imagine there's not too many key foods out there, but is it predominantly the independent pipeline is robust and larger account, maybe a little less so or no?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
chris, i think, should get this one, john. yes.
chris testa -- president
hey, john, it's chris. so the $90 million, so that is incremental on a rolling basis since the acquisition, it's close to $500 million. the pipeline literally has 1,000 different opportunities in it, ranging from all categories, all sizes. and what we saw in the quarter was the wins were not concentrated in any category or any channel.
so what we're experiencing is exactly what steve laid out two years ago when we talked about the strategic decisions we made to build out the store. the wins are happening in independents. they're happening in chains. they're happening in e-comm.
and it's across produce, meat, general merchandise, center store, natural, conventional. so key food, you're right. there's not a lot of key food out there, and we announced key food because it is a significant new win. however, every day, every week, there's a lot of smaller wins coming in across all channels, across all categories.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
and, john, what i would add is two things. one, one of the really interesting outcomes is that some of our fastest growth is in conventional distribution with retailers that have captive facilities either because we're closer to the stores or we can do it more efficiently. but more importantly is the whole world has changed. retailers think about supply chain differently today than they did a year ago.
and the focus is on aggregating volume to few. it drives down their cost. it makes it easier. it lets them focus on what they really need to concentrate on, which is keeping consumers either in their store or on their site.
and again, as you think about the strategic acquisition of supervalu and the migration toward being a wholesaler of scale that can provide everything that a retailer needs, that's going to benefit unfi for years to come.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
and then just a follow-up on the cross-sell, right? so going from $500 million to $1 billion, i think that's by the end of fiscal '22. correct me if i'm wrong. and so that's $500 million over six quarters, which would seem to be a little bit less than what you had this last quarter. is that conservatism? do you think that for whatever reason, maybe cross-sell slows down a little bit and then picks up again? curious, that $500 million.
chris testa -- president
yeah. john, it wasn't meant to be strict financial guidance for the next fiscal year. it's just what we think we're doing for as a run-rate basis on our cross rate. we don't expect it to slow down.
the number was over $1 billion, and i think that's a fair estimate based on what we're seeing and what we're adding each quarter.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
and i would tell you, john, we're just starting to get really, really spectacular at fresh. we've made some additions to our leadership team that chris mentioned. we're building out the infrastructure. i think we're now the largest in protein and produce across the country.
there are some holes that we need to fill but that could be the leading driver toward cross-selling over the next couple of years.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
ok. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of greg badishkanian from wolfe research.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. this is spencer hanus on for greg. the industry is facing pretty tough compares over the next few weeks. any color on how much of the sales growth you're expecting the industry to retain? and then, i guess, post covid, how are you thinking about what your customer mix is going to look like?
chris testa -- president
yeah. good questions. it's been a really volatile environment. and just to lay out the guidance like we did in the beginning of the year and reaffirming at this call, basically, what we're looking at is what we thought was going to happen for the year was grocery was going to remain elevated throughout the fiscal year.
we still believe in that. as we head into a post-pandemic world, we still think the work from home is going to be a tailwind for us. so we'll continue to have elevated levels. we think that shopping closer to home is going to remain.
that's a consumer behavior that's going to remain. that's going to help our independent and chain business that is out in the suburbs. spencer, what was the other part of your question?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
just in the next couple of weeks, i don't think we could comment on kind of what's going to happen over the next couple of weeks. but i think what i would tell you is, first of all, our revenue did kick up quarter to quarter, 1 to 2. and we've seen some real consistency in our overall revenue since we got past, let's call it, may of last year. and so since then, we think the revenue has been pretty consistent and will likely be pretty consistent, albeit leaving the next month or two out.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. and then just a follow-up on the cross-selling commentary. i think you mentioned that one of the biggest sources of the cross-selling lifts you're seeing is opportunities from retailers with captive distribution centers.
so if you think out longer term, do you think that retailers with those type of distribution systems, do they move to a more capital-light model? how are you thinking about that longer term?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
i mean, i think that people are doing the work. maybe 20 years ago, certain large retailers of scale said, ""look, we just need to own our own captive network."" now, remember that some of our largest customers on the natural side are retailers with a captive network. it's just that they couldn't replicate, and they can't replicate what we did on the natural side. but i think retailers today are very sophisticated, especially retailers with captive networks, and they're taking a look at what's the most efficient route to market.
and if that means using a third-party like unfi, then that's what they're going to do, and that's exactly what's happening.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of jim salera from northcoast research.
jim salera -- northcoast research -- analyst
hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. i wanted to drill down a little bit on the operating margin line. i guess you had a really impressive improvement both year over year and quarter over quarter. i just wanted to see how much of that is just benefit from not having some of the covid-related issues at the warehouse? and how much of that is sustainable from the investments and the consolidation and the automation across the distribution network?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
so this is eric. i'll start out, and then john, maybe you can jump in. i mean, i would start by just acknowledging our team's efforts around covid in our safety protocols and all the tireless efforts that they put forward, keeping each other safe. i think what you saw was a reflection of our consolidation, stabilization in the pacific northwest.
we mentioned it on the first-quarter call. and our dcs have really become fully operational in those markets, which were reflected in the overall reduction in opex expense. we've also introduced our operations excellence program as part of our value path initiative, which is also starting to show out some results. so i think we're very confident in going forward on where we are and in part of our guidance, obviously, is maintaining.
john, i'll turn it over to you.
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. eric, i think you're spot on with that. when we think sequentially, we saw a 3.2% increase in sales from q1 to q2 but a 30% increase in ebitda. some of that is driven by those q1 challenges that we've talked about before, particularly in the pacific northwest, that have substantially subsided at this point.
and i think we have much more sustainability in those. and the rest of it comes down to some of the additional productivity we talked about earlier, the value path initiatives, as well as some of the timing of those benefit costs that will come back toward the end of fy '21. so i think it's really a great quarter and a great year from that perspective to show that sequential improvement in ebitda even with the anticipated one-time pacific northwest consolidation issues.
jim salera -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. and so looking forward, do you think that there's any room for improvement? i know historically, wholesale hasn't been able to have that ebit margin level above 2%. i mean, do you guys think that as you work through some of the order distribution centers, like you said, add some of these efficiency gains, do you think it's possible to get to a sustainable level where you have your ebit margin maybe at 2%, 2.5%, somewhere in that range?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll tell you how i think about it, and eric can chime in as well. without providing any type of forward-looking guidance on numbers or anything else, i think it is comfortable to tell you that we are still working through productivity initiatives. we still have upside related to value path that we know we're still going after between now and fy '23.
we know we still have a large final component of the synergies related to the system standardization. that's going to be a big tailwind for us as we get on the other side of that aspect. so i think we still have lots of opportunities in front of us to continue to improve our ebitda margin.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
and we've only really optimized two networks, pacific northwest and southern california. and there's still quite a few to go.
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
yeah. and we're also continuing our investment in automation, which is really starting to settle in and will continue to throw off productivity improvements.
jim salera -- northcoast research -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys.
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks for the question.

your next question comes from the line of matt fishbein from jefferies.
matt fishbein -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for the question. just really a clarification question for me, and i apologize if i missed it, or i misunderstood here.
but the sg&a stepped down sequentially from q4, q1 levels. but even though you have higher sales this quarter, i think you're talking the pacific northwest stabilization combined with productivity initiatives. just want to make sure i understand correctly. is it some trapped costs coming offline in the pacific northwest? or i think you just said maybe it's route consolidation.
just trying to get a sense of what inning we're in with the pressures you saw in q1 going away. and then if you can just clarify, i guess, on the value path end, what so far has been done for you to include value path in the explanation of the operating margin improvement this quarter? and kind of what inning are we in with hitting those targets? i know those were much longer-term targets. and i'm surprised that we're already seeing some of that playthrough in q2. thanks.
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
yes. so this is eric. so i'll start in the pacific northwest. i would say we're in the middle innings on our optimization.
one of the dcs was brand new, came out of the ground. so we had to start up and to settle in. another experienced large remodel and expansion. and i can tell you that the staffs in the buildings have become fully productive.
we've eliminated most of our third-party labor support. so i think we are well on our way, but we still have room to continue. as far as value path goes, we've experienced a lot of progress on our initiatives from private brand sourcing to working with our customers on delivery frequency, our distribution center productivity initiative that we call our operational excellence, as well as working on our administrative footprint across the network, as steve mentioned, our distribution center network footprint. and then we're also tackling our organizational effectiveness and looking at all of the components for all the support functions.
so, yes, we are seeing value. but there, too, we're probably in the middle innings, and we have a line of sight over the next couple of years of where that will shake out. but really solid progress given the pandemic and all the other challenges we've been dealing with, but the momentum is there. and the team is really in a different mindset.
it's all about evolving as an organization.
operator
our next question comes from the line of karen short from barclays.
cait howard -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is cait howard on for karen. just one question for me.
i don't know if i missed it, but can you share any update on what you're seeing with fill rates currently and where you think that will go over the next few quarters?
chris testa -- president
yeah. hey, cait, this is chris. so they still remain behind historical fill rates pre-pandemic. we did see sequential improvement by about 400 basis points across the business, largely from the larger cpg suppliers that are catching up to demand.
but we are still seeing -- we're still lower than we expected. and as steve mentioned, that's a headwind as it relates to promotional dollars. we get healthy rates from all of our suppliers. we have hundreds of calls every day about get healthy rates.
and most of the sentiment is that it's going to come back over the course of the summer. and we'll start to see a little bit better fill rates, historical fill rates as we go through the summer months.
cait howard -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks.
chris testa -- president
sure.
operator
your next question comes from eric larson from seaport global securities.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks, everybody, and congratulations on a good quarter. steve, i may have heard this right or wrong. it's just a near-term comment that i think you said inflation was 100 basis points this quarter.
we obviously, in the industry, have quite a bit more inflation, and it seems like many of the cpg companies aren't all taking pricing up fairly aggressively. obviously, there's a lag to how that comes in. but could you comment more on how you might see inflation maybe later in this fiscal year? maybe it really accelerates in your next fiscal year, but how that might translate into your inflation rates? and then would that maybe possibly increase the promotional activity? or how would you view that?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so you're 100% right. and we have very marginal inflation right now. but we do expect that the inflation rate will start to ramp up, i think, pretty dramatically.
i mean, i don't have any facts that would say it's going to happen other than i've been doing it a long time. and based upon what we see in the pipeline, i think one could make the assumption that inflation will start to ramp up pretty dramatically in our fiscal '22, not in the current year but in fiscal '22. and what will also happen at the same time is a pretty significant increase in the promotional rate as the cpgs really work hard to get the products back on the shelf, product that was discontinued. and so we'll start to see a lot of that promotional activity return.
and so that will be a pretty significant tailwind for us as we go into '22 because, obviously, we do make a profit on retailer promotions, and the math of inflation just works in our favor in a really big way.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yeah. that's exactly what i was getting into. and then let me just ask a little longer-term question. and you've already touched on it, where you've optimized some of your distribution systems, obviously, in the pacific northwest.
you've only hit really [inaudible] in southern california, and you've got a whole bunch more, i think, of the center of a country like iowa, etc., where you have concentration now of three or four dcs. number one is will that require a lot more capital, number one. and number two is what is really, truly the upside for that? have you given any guidance or any kind of notion of what on ebitda benefits or margin benefits might be as you gradually get through those optimization programs?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
so this is eric. i'll try to fill in those blanks. i mean, we are still very much in the process of evaluating our network, both conventional, natural, giving cross-selling, giving the additional demand, and protecting our capacity for growth. so i think we're very early on in that planning besides the markets we've already talked about.
we also have utilization of automation that's across the network that we're also very focused on. and i think over the coming months, we'll have a little bit more detail to share, but we're not just quite there yet.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
just from a common-sense perspective, if you have multiple dcs, you have multiple inventory, you have multiple overhead. and multiple trucks and multiple material handling equipment and so on and so forth. so obviously, we can improve our service level. we can improve the capital nature of a market by operating out of fewer dcs.
and one thing that is a big part of our strategy is the power and scale. in a distribution business, the more volume you can flow through a singular dc, the more ebitda you're going to create.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
correct. so on the capital side of that, is it more of consolidating existing facilities and eliminating maybe the less efficient? or does it require buildup around greenfield?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. no, this is not a capex play. it's not a greenfield. i mean, it's possible that could happen within the next five years, but we don't see that near term.
we're still comfortable. we're still operating in that kind of 1% of revenue from a capex perspective, and we've been pretty disciplined with that number.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
perfect. thank you.

your final question comes from the line of kelly bania from bmo capital markets.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks. this is kelly bania from bmo.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. just wanted to follow up on inflation, again, and what you're seeing at wholesale versus retail and if there's any differences maybe between what you're seeing across channels at retail in terms of inflation.
chris testa -- president
hi, kelly. so the biggest driver of the gap between wholesale and retail is the promotional dollars. so with the lack of promos happening at retail -- sorry, getting a little bit of echo. with the lack of promotion effort in retail, that's where the inflation has happened.
so that's the biggest driver. again, we expect those promo dollars to come back and --
steve bloomquist -- vice president of investor relations
now we lost chris. hold on a second.
chris testa -- president
ok. sorry. i'm on back.
steve bloomquist -- vice president of investor relations
there you go.
chris testa -- president
can you hear me? is the echo gone?
steve bloomquist -- vice president of investor relations
yeah.
chris testa -- president
sorry about that, kelly. so i'll start from the top. the biggest driver of the retail inflation is the lack of promo dollar spent, right? so that's the cpg dollars that are going against the retail dollars, and they're just not spending those promos. and we've mentioned a few times, those promo dollars also flow through us and impact our margin.
but it doesn't impact our inflation, and that's where you're seeing the biggest gap. it's not in any specific channel. at least we're not seeing any specific channel. we look at inflation across all of retail.
and the number that i've mentioned earlier, the 400 basis points difference, was across all channels. so that's the biggest reason. it's just promo dollar spend that's not happening.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. there is also, kelly, many retailers have also taken price. and so that's also embedded in the number as well. so that's the gap.
the gap between what you're seeing in retail and wholesale is what chris just said. it's retailers taking price and the lack of promo, which gets you to that 300, 400-basis-point difference.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. so you're saying your wholesale inflation was 100 basis points, and you're estimating --
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't remember exactly what it was, but it was in the 100-basis-point range, which has been what it's been running for the past year and a half, two years. but i find it hard to believe that coming out of covid, where so many products have been discontinued, fill rates have been so poor that -- and by the way, manufacturers, to a large degree, have held their pricing relatively flat despite increasing input costs. we know that there's been a lot of increasing input costs a lot -- through a lot of the commodities. so i really believe that once we get into late summer, fall, we're going to start to see our inflation rate ramp up pretty materially, which is good for us because, remember, we get the benefit of the map on the inflation, and then we get the benefit of running the promos through our systems.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. ok. that's helpful. and i just had to ask another question on whole foods and the contract.
i guess i was looking at it as if it were a shorter duration than historically, given that it's seven years versus 10. i guess are you expecting that you would renegotiate halfway through that contract as you did historically?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
no.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
or this renegotiated in seven years? is that --
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
this will be renegotiated in seven years. so that's one of the major changes in the contract. in the old world, when we were just negotiating with whole foods, we had a 10-year agreement. we negotiated every five years.
we all decided that was not in the best interest of either company. they're focused on growth. we're focused on growth. and so now, we have a full seven-year contract without renewal periods in between.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i see. and just last very basic question on the dc optimization. as you look back to what you laid out to us at the investor day in terms of the dcs and how the inventory would flow between slow-moving and fast-turning, how does that compare to what you are doing or what has changed? and when will we get products going on one truck? is that part of the vision? or can you just really help us understand logistically what is happening and what is changing?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah. so that is still the vision. the vision is to get the product on one truck.
that obviously is what drives real economies, both for us and for the customer. we are doing that. in some markets, it's still a little clunky, but obviously, we have gone through a network optimization in the pacific northwest and in southern california. we've added automation to those facilities, which is handling a lot of the slower moving and each pick inventory.
but the strategy is still the same, and that is to have fast-moving warehouse, slower-moving warehouse, and a general merchandise regional facility to supply all those types of products. again, this is a multi-year journey. we're migrating on to singular it platforms because that, obviously, is a precursor to getting on to that one invoice, one truck. and we've made a lot of progress.
the strategy hasn't changed. covid did delay us a little bit because, obviously, we had to ramp up the demand, but we will get there. that is still the strategy.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. it was a great quarter. i really want to thank our team of over 30,000 associates around the u.s. and canada.
the work that they did to get product delivered every single day through weather and covid and so many other things was just amazing. the strategy that we've put in place is working. our customers are telling us it's working, and they're showing us that it's working with what they're buying from us and what they continue to buy from us. so a terrific quarter.
we anticipate having a really good year and thank you for being with us today.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the unfi fiscal 2021 second-quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to mr. steve bloomquist, vice president of investor relations.
sir, the floor is yours. please go ahead.
steve bloomquist -- vice president of investor relations
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on unfi's second-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. by now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release issued earlier this morning. the press release, webcast, and a supplemental slide deck are available under the investors section of the company's website at www.unfi.com. joining me for today's call are steve spinner, our chairman and chief executive officer; john howard, our chief financial officer; chris testa, president of unfi; and eric dorne, our chief operating officer.
steve, chris, and john will provide a business update, after which, we'll take your questions. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that comments made by management during today's call may contain forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include plans, expectations, estimates, and projections that might involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks are discussed in the company's earnings release and sec filings.
actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements. and lastly, i'd like to point out that during today's call, management will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. definitions and reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures are included in our press release. with that, i'll turn the call over to steve. 
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steve. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fiscal 2021 second-quarter earnings call. as you saw in this morning's press release, we delivered another quarter of outstanding financial results. second-quarter sales grew 7.1%.
second-quarter adjusted ebitda grew 57% or $74 million. and second-quarter adjusted ebitda margin expanded 95 basis points. this quarter's $206 million of adjusted ebitda was the second highest in unfi's history behind only last year's third quarter that benefited from the significant jump in demand as consumers began loading their pantries heading into the pandemic. this quarter also represented the fourth consecutive quarter where we've grown adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps at a significantly higher rate, and we've grown sales.
we continued to make great progress in our debt-reduction efforts this quarter and improved our net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio to 3.2 times, a full 2-turn improvement since last year's second quarter. as a reminder, we have paid down almost $1 billion of debt since fiscal 2019 and are well on our way toward less than 3 times leverage. momentum continues to build throughout our business, and we are delivering strong results as we execute on our strategies. this quarter's results are a clear validation of the great work we are doing to increase shareholder value.
our cross-selling strategy is resonating with both existing and new customers who are looking to aggregate volume. our award-winning brands business, an important differentiator for unfi, continues to grow, as does our professional services business, both of which help our customers succeed in today's evolving retail landscape. looking forward, we continue to believe that unfi is well-positioned for continued growth and that food-at-home consumption will remain elevated for the next several years. companies continue to push office return dates further into the future as they evaluate return-to-work strategies in light of increased productivity, and work flexibility that come with working from home.
at the same time, many americans continue to manage their household budgets closely with dining in providing a more affordable meal option and a great opportunity to connect as a family. consumers also continue to look for better food options with ingredient transparency, and unfi continues to lead the way forward in this important segment. we expect this backdrop will continue to provide a tailwind for us as we pursue growth within the $140 billion addressable wholesale market, of which, $38 billion comes from gaining share of wallet with our current customers and an additional $78 billion from adding new customers. in addition, we continue to move forward on optimizing our distribution network, generating additional operating benefits to the value path initiative, and investing in technologies that provide valuable insights into our future business growth and lower our cost structure.
finally, i'm pleased that we've extended the contract with our largest customer through late 2027, almost seven years from now. we believe this reflects the strong working relationship between the two companies and the benefit unfi brings to their operations and growth. let me now turn the call over to chris to provide more context on our business performance. chris?
chris testa -- president
thanks, steve, and good morning, everyone. on today's call, i'll provide additional color on our fiscal 2021 second-quarter performance and discuss the key trends we're currently seeing in our business. i will also highlight the drivers that continue to differentiate unfi, giving us confidence in our ability to drive long-term market share growth. as you saw in this morning's press release, total sales for the quarter increased 7.1% or $415 million, compared to last year's second quarter.
excluding retail, our wholesale growth rate was 6.5%. for perspective, we believe unfi's growth was about 200 basis points higher than nielsen's retail syndicated data when accounting for the 400 basis points difference in retail versus wholesale inflation, and our 80 basis points foodservice channel headwind. our second-quarter sales growth also accelerated 110 basis points compared to the 6% sales growth in our first quarter. we believe there are several reasons for this sales growth expansion.
the first is unfi's unique ability to cross-sell. our cross-selling efforts generated approximately $90 million in incremental sales for the quarter, bringing our total incremental revenue from cross-selling to nearly $500 million since the supervalu acquisition. looking forward, we see a path to delivering a cumulative $1 billion in cross-selling revenue by the end of our fiscal 2022 as we continue to gain traction with larger wins. as we mentioned on the last call, we believe that there's a $140 billion addressable market for unfi, including $38 billion of upside opportunity by cross-selling and gaining further penetration with our existing customers.
we are gaining momentum, and cross-selling remains an exciting key benefit for our customers and unfi. the second reason for our q2 sales growth was revenue gained from new customers. our sales teams have been aggressively capitalizing on our opportunities to drive sales gains across all parts of the store. and we're winning business every week across all categories, including fresh and general merchandise, center store grocery, frozen, and others.
unfi has the portfolio and distribution footprint to compete with the local and national wholesalers and provide customers with the advantage of our scale. we also continue to invest in our people and expertise. to that end, we've hired dorn wenninger as our svp of produce. dorn comes from us from walmart mexico, and he's already hit the ground running.
he's another great example of the talent we've added over the past year to accelerate growth for our customers and unfi. the third reason driving our outsized growth is the change in consumer behavior at retail. mckinsey has reported that roughly 10% of people have changed their primary grocery store during the pandemic largely based on proximity to home. unfi customers have benefited from this, especially our independents who tap into an additional growing consumer preference to shop smaller footprint stores.
we have and will continue to support all of our customers, particularly as the future of work remains uncertain but likely does not entail everyone returning to work in the same fashion they did pre-pandemic. also, the rising importance of e-commerce is changing how consumers interact with our stores. we estimate that 70% of independents and a larger percent of chains now offer e-commerce solutions to their customers. and unfi provides the digital platforms and necessary support to help our customers succeed.
by point of fact, we have onboarded hundreds of new customers onto our e-commerce platform solution since the start of the pandemic and have many more in the pipeline. moving forward, we believe these consumer trends will continue, and unfi is uniquely positioned to adapt to changing consumer behavior by servicing our diverse customer base through an unmatched portfolio of products, programs, and services. turning to our sales performance by channel. second-quarter sales to chains were up 6.5%, and to independent retailers were up 9%.
both channels were ahead of the syndicated data i cited earlier when adjusting for inflation, and both experienced accelerated growth versus q1 2021. our continued growth with customers in these sales channels is the result of the factors i just mentioned. specifically, with chains, we have had cross-selling gains with natural customers that have begun to use unfi to support their captive conventional distribution, and we have won new business with many independents that are now unfi customers. wholesale sales in the supernatural channel were up 7.2% compared to last year's second quarter, which was the combination of greater sales to existing stores, as well as sales to stores open less than one year.
and finally, our other channel grew slightly as strong gains in our e-commerce business more than offset the softness in foodservice and military. second-quarter e-commerce sales increased 97% led by new business and sales growth to the largest e-commerce player, who is now a top 25 customer for unfi. speaking of e-commerce, we'll soon be introducing a new platform called community marketplace. this will be an exciting extension of our easy options b2b e-commerce solution that will provide unfi customers additional access to growing on-trend local brands.
similar to other e-commerce marketplaces, sales on unfi's proprietary community marketplace will bypass their traditional distribution through our dc network and allow for smaller emerging brands to be ordered and shipped directly to retail customers throughout the u.s. this will give our customers access to an even broader assortment of items, with flexible order sizes and convenience to order from multiple sources online in one place. for existing unfi suppliers interested in expanding their portfolios or for newer brands of suppliers looking for a gateway into unfi, they gain immediate opportunity to access unfi's more than 30,000 unique customer locations and benefit from a fast and easy onboarding that could eventually lead to broader distribution in our dc network. in short, we believe community marketplace is the disruptive digital innovation needed to connect growing brands with our customers to ultimately bring end consumers more freedom of food choice.
we're finalizing the details, and i look forward to sharing more on our next call. our strong top-line results include another quarter of growth in our retail business, where same-store sales increased 15.3%. e-commerce at retail continues its robust growth trajectory, increasing by nearly 190% at cub. last month, one of the two cub stores that were damaged during last year's civil unrest in minneapolis reopened and included several new offerings and departments based on input from the community.
cub maintained its long-held no. 1 market share position in the minneapolis market, and we're very proud of our commitment to serving communities that depend on us. we expect the second store to reopen in the next 30 days. another sales growth driver was our brands+ private brands business, which grew 7.3% in the second quarter.
within the portfolio, our largest brand, essential everyday, grew double digits, driven by gains with larger customers and better in-stock levels than many of the national brand alternatives. our inbound fill rates for our own brands have been averaging 1,000 basis points higher than national brands. our field day brand, exclusively distributed via our natural independent customers, has seen over 30% growth this fiscal year, fueled by supporting core grocery categories and new items. across the entire brands+ portfolio, innovation continues to be the focus with approximately 200 new item launches planned for this fiscal year.
to this end, we've seen tremendous growth from products like woodstock's organic frozen avocados, which quickly became the no. 2 ranked new item in the frozen fruit category in the u.s. natural enhanced channel. we have a strong long-term plan for this portfolio that capitalizes on the upside opportunity with existing, as well as new customers and leaning into brands+ as a point of difference for unfi and our customers.
moving beyond our product offerings, we continue to expand our professional services portfolio to offer customers unique solutions beyond selling groceries to them. one recent example involves bringing digital currencies such as bitcoin to our customers' stores through a relationship with coin cloud. coin cloud is a small footprint kiosk that empowers consumers to buy, sell or trade digital currency with cash without the need for a bank account or debit card. to date, we've signed 80 contracts and see this potential to grow to 4,000-plus unfi locations.
this is just one example of new services we are adding to our current portfolio, including more traditional services like store design, merchandising, and payment processing. in total, unfi offers 150 types of services to keep our customer stores relevant, to drive their retail sales, and to help them lower their cost. lastly, on the operations side, we continue to move forward with optimizing and expanding our distribution center network to better service our customers and deliver operating efficiencies. in pennsylvania, our work is well under way on our new allentown campus, which will be operational in time to ship key food early next fiscal year.
our new riverside, california facility and a major expansion in ridgefield, washington are complete and fully operational. we introduced automation in portions of both of these distribution centers, where we expect to experience a 100% increase in throughput as measured by units picked per hour, which will yield expense savings in addition to improving our order accuracy and lowering operational credits. given the truly differentiated business model, which includes aggressively growing our wholesale business while monetizing our unique assets like brands, e-comm, and services, we're optimistic about the rest of the year and our prospects beyond fiscal 2021. as steve said, we're running on all cylinders, and we truly are.
with that, i'll turn the call over to john.
john howard -- chief financial officer
thank you, chris. good morning, everyone. on today's call, i will provide additional context on our quarterly financial performance, balance sheet, capital structure, and full-year outlook for fiscal 2021. as steve and chris said, we're very pleased with our operating momentum in this quarter's strong performance.
we set second-quarter records for net sales, which totaled $6.9 billion; adjusted ebitda, which came in at $206 million; and adjusted eps of $1.25 per share. second-quarter gross margin rate expanded 12 basis points versus last year's second quarter, driven by a margin mix benefit from greater retail sales growth relative to wholesale sales growth, as well as lower levels of promotional spending in our retail operations. gross margin rate for our wholesale and other businesses was approximately flat as a decrease in shrink expense, which last year included about 7 basis points of expense associated with customer bankruptcies, was offset by lower levels of supplier-related income. second-quarter operating expense rate declined 82 basis points to 12.59% of sales including 45 basis points associated with the reduction in bad debt expense versus last year's second quarter that included three customer bankruptcies.
the remaining improvement was driven by our value path productivity initiatives and strong leverage of the fixed and semi-fixed portions of our cost structure. our second-quarter results also included the benefit of lower health and welfare costs based on lower usage levels during the pandemic. as covid vaccination levels increase and doctor visits and medical procedures return to pre-pandemic levels, we expect our benefit-cost to return to pre-pandemic levels as well. our 57% growth in second-quarter adjusted ebitda on a 7% increase in sales translated to a 95-basis-point year-over-year expansion in our adjusted ebitda margin, the fourth consecutive quarter we grew year-over-year adjusted ebitda at a significantly higher rate than sales.
excluding the impact of last year's customer bankruptcies, second-quarter adjusted ebitda margin grew approximately 45 basis points. these results again demonstrate our ability to translate top-line performance into even stronger bottom-line growth, which we believe will continue to generate significant shareholder value. on a gaap basis, we reported $1 in earnings per share, which included $0.25 per share in after-tax charges, primarily related to advisory fees for our transformational value path initiative and the acceleration of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issued discount tied to the $150 million term loan prepayment made early in the quarter. our adjusted eps, which excludes the impact of these items and several smaller adjustments, totaled $1.25.
turning to the balance sheet. our total outstanding net debt finished the quarter at just under $2.5 billion, the lowest quarter ending level since the supervalu acquisition. we generated $265 million in net cash from operating activities in the quarter, which led to a reduction in total outstanding net debt of nearly $250 million. free cash flow in the second quarter included the anticipated working capital recapture as we sold through inventory that had increased for the holiday selling season.
our year-to-date net debt reduction now totals approximately $115 million. our net debt-to-adjusted ebitda leverage improved to 3.2 times and benefited from both lower debt levels and higher trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda compared to the first quarter. as steve mentioned, this leverage ratio has improved by 2 full turns since the second quarter of fiscal 2020. in addition to lower debt levels, we recently took two other steps to lower our annual interest expense.
early in the second quarter, we borrowed $150 million on our asset-based revolving credit facility and reduced the balance on our term loan by an equal amount. then following the end of the second quarter, we took advantage of favorable credit markets and successfully repriced the term loan, lowering the interest rate by 75 basis points. based on the second-quarter ending balances, these two actions will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $11 million, which equates to about a $0.13 annual increase in earnings per share. we believe the operating environment will continue to benefit from food-at-home consumption, which, combined with our year-to-date results and the anticipated continued build of benefits from our acquisition synergies and value path, gives us a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve our fiscal-year 2021 operating guidance.
we are reaffirming our full-year guidance for net sales, which we continue to expect to be in the range of $27 billion to $27.8 billion, and now expect to finish toward the upper end of the previously provided ranges of $690 million to $730 million for adjusted ebitda and $3.05 to $3.55 per share for adjusted eps. we are maintaining our previous guidance of $250 million to $300 million for capital expenditures and approximately $250 million of net debt reduction, both of which include this year's investments in our new allentown distribution center to support key food. last, we now expect to finish the year with a net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio of approximately 3.3 times. although we don't provide quarterly earnings guidance, i do want to comment briefly on our expectation for the third quarter.
as a reminder, our third-quarter results and fiscal 2020 benefited from the unprecedented stock-up surge as covid-driven demand began to spread. while we expect continued elevated demand and strong absolute levels of performance in the back half of fiscal 2021, we do expect our fiscal 2021 third-quarter sales, adjusted ebitda, and adjusted eps to be below prior-year levels. however, we remain confident and optimistic in our full-year outlook, as reflected in our expectation to finish the year toward the upper end of our ranges for adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps. increasing value for our shareholders remains a priority and focus of unfi.
with our differentiated business model and large addressable market, we remain confident in our ability to grow our business and generate meaningful free cash flow. in the near term, we will continue to use our free cash flow to further reduce debt and improve our leverage. thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in unfi. with that, let me turn the call back to steve.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, john. as john discussed, we remain laser-focused on driving our business forward and are committed to increasing shareholder value. we're pleased with our year-to-date performance and remain confident we'll deliver on our full-year outlook. since our last call, we released our 2020 esg report.
we're proud of the progress we're making and have launched an ambitious 2030 agenda built around the theme, better for all. this past year, unfi has improved its cdp climate change response score to an a- through purposeful actions and enhanced disclosures. we've announced new paid parental leave benefits. we've delivered the equivalent of 19 million meals to those in need.
and achieved a 7% year-over-year improvement in food waste diverted from landfills, just to name a few. longer term, we've challenged ourselves to reduce food waste by 50% by 2025, achieve zero waste to landfills from our dcs by 2030, reduce our distribution center energy intensity by 30% by 2030, and donate the equivalent of over 200 million meals to those in need by 2030. corporate citizenship is very important to us and part of what makes unfi a special company. we're dedicated to serving our customers while doing right for those who need, all while being sensitive to our impact on the planet and the environment.
to that end, we've expanded a zero-emissions all-electric trailer pilot with 53 new trailers that will operate in california. we also remain focused on succession and continue to evaluate candidates to serve as unfi's next ceo. covid has made the process a bit more complicated, and the board has asked me to extend my timeline in order to ensure that we continue to have a comprehensive process. and i'm committed to staying until i can turn the reins over to our new ceo.
our business is strong. our future is bright, and i'm confident unfi will have a new and exciting leader later this year. our associates deliver results every day safely and efficiently, and i want to thank them for all their hard work during the quarter. in conclusion, i'm very pleased that fiscal 2021 is unfolding largely as we had originally anticipated.
our optimistic full-year outlook demonstrates the confidence we have in our people and business. and as i stated on our last call, i continue to believe that unfi's best days lie ahead. with that, we're ready to take your questions. thank you.
",2021-Q2,UNFI

operator
[operator instructions] the first question comes from edward kelly with wells fargo.
edward kelly -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning. so, the first thing i want to ask you just about, you know, on the sales guidance and being at the lower end of the sales guidance. you talked about some of the business wins taking a little bit longer to materialize.
could you just provide a bit more color on that and on what's happening there? and then in addition to that, the $500 million of new business wins that you're talking about for '22, just additional color on what's driving that as well.
chris testa -- president of unfi
hey, ed, this is chris. thanks for the question. so, yeah. so, as john mentioned, we're reaffirming the sales guidance at the low end of the range for the year.
we feel very good about where we're coming in on sales for q3 and where we'll finish in q4. you know, we have some commitments from new customers, they're rather large, and large commitments always take a little bit more time than the smaller ones. we're winning new business every day, every week from multiple sources, from multiple competitors and it's just going to take time to onboard it. that said, we have the commitments that's why we feel comfortable giving the $500 million number.
and just to reiterate, that's on top of the onboarding of key food, which will happen in phases starting in fiscal '22 as well.
edward kelly -- wells fargo -- analyst
ok. and then just a follow-up, i wanted to ask you about the cost side and specifically related to drivers and driver pay and retention. there's obviously a lot of, you know, pressure in the marketplace today. we are hearing about, you know, some foodservice guys paying bonuses to hire drivers as they're trying to ramp business back again.
just curious as to the extent that that's impacting you. and then what's your outlook for driver pay inflation from here? do you think that that's a line item that will tick up or maybe you think sort of business as usual?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll start it and then eric may want to weigh in. you know, as we think about the rest of this year and next year, i would say that there are a couple of differences in place to look at, right? so fuel, cost of goods, labor, inflation are the primary inputs that are changing. fuel is somewhat neutral to us because of the vast majority of fuel increases we pass through. the increasing cost of goods is a benefit to us because as a wholesaler the vast majority of our business is on a cost-plus that will turn out to be a benefit to us because it has the increased cost of goods, we pass it through, and we typically buy into rising markets.
inflation, to which there's been very little, obviously, we expect to have some more inflation come our way throughout the balance of this year and certainly into '22. that's also a benefit because we passed that through. on the labor side, we've done a ton of work throughout the year making sure that our folks' drivers included are being paid a competitive wage and, as you heard in the script, we've increased wages throughout the year and that's obviously reflected in our numbers. but more importantly, the wages are having a really good environment, having a really good work-life balance managing overtime, managing productivity, managing turnover.
and as a result of doing that, we've seen an increase in productivity. we've seen more stability in our turnover. so i think we're optimistic. but again, the labor market for drivers and warehouse is shifting, and we've done a really good job shifting with it.
we have a new facility opening in allentown, pennsylvania, which was our first lifestyle center, which has some really sophisticated technology around flexible work hours shift sharing. so we feel pretty good about where we are. eric, anything you want to add?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
yeah, thanks, steve, and thanks, ed. i would just add my optimism as well given all the associated focus programs that we've introduced over the last 12 months. and just to reinforce what steve mentioned earlier, we've adjusted a good deal of markets across the country to maintain pace on wages, on premiums, and we're going to continue to modify as we go here. but the big headline here is around associates' focus programs around flexible workarounds shift sharing and, you know, we're expanding rosters when necessary to help mitigate their work-life balance situation and manage overtime, as well as reducing throughput or turnover, excuse me.
so that's all i'll add. 
edward kelly -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
operator
next question comes from john heinbockel with guggenheim.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
let me just start with cross-selling. when you think about 2021, i mean, where will the cross-sell revenue contribution come in? do you think -- and how that compares to what you expect it? and then when you think about '22, just the order of magnitude, could the cross-sell contribution be -- could it be as much as double '21 or is that optimistic?
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. hey, john, this is chris. so two steps on cross-selling. one, is the incremental cross-sell, right? so those are the wins that we gained over the year.
and then two is the rolling cross-sell. so ones that we gained in the prior year prior quarters that we continue to maintain. so for fiscal '21, we think the incremental will be somewhere around $250 million. so that's new revenue gains that we didn't have in the prior year.
the vast majority of that coming from conventional customers that we're -- that we sell natural to and that we are augmenting their captive distribution with that now on a broader portfolio of conventional products. so that's where fiscal '21 is going to come in. i think fiscal '22, you know, we're not giving fiscal '22 guidance but i think you could expect to see fiscal '22 incremental cross-selling to again be in that range around 250 to 300. but also realizing the gains of the 250 we got this year.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i would only add to that, john, if you think about the kind of -- if you think about what we said during the script, '20 was a record heavily driven by covid. 2021 is going to be a record heavily driven by cross-selling and expense control. we also said that '22 is going to be a record driven primarily by new sales onboarding and expense control.
most of that -- most of those sales wins and most of the pipelines are by selling more to --
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
then you know, maybe secondarily, when you think about two topics, right, you've been hurt by supplier promo income being down or negligent, you know, would that be a drag on as much as 40 million or 50 million this past year, you know, for '21? just what order of magnitude that should come back? and then secondly, when you think about key food in allentown, right, so it's a direct 13 million this year, you know, you'll sort of ramp up next year, is it neutral, do you think, to retain allentown in '22 or still a drag?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so you know, i don't know exactly what that drag on the supplier promo is. it's material, but i don't know what the exact number is. and you know, it's not going to come back all at once, it'll start to come back over time.
and you know, as you know, in the heat of covid, suppliers discontinued a lot of skus to focus on the ones that they could manufacture and the ones that consumers wanted. obviously, in order to get those skus placed back into retail, cpgs are going to have to pay for that. and so we're going to start to see that turn around i think toward the back half of this year, the back quarter of this year, and through 2022. as far as the expenses in allentown, i think that the majority, and i'll let john or eric correct me here, i would say the majority of the start-up costs will be taken in this fiscal year.
i think they'll be a bit of a drag next year as the business starts to ramp up. is that right, john.
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. that is correct, steve. we've got the 13 million that john mentioned that we talked about in my script and then we're expecting somewhere in the neighborhood of maybe another 5 million to 10 million in fy '22 that will be a part of that number as well.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. thanks.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
john, this is an amazing facility. i mean, it is -- i think it's 1.3 million square feet between two buildings. it's a campus. it's really the first building we're opening.
as i said earlier, a lifestyle building that's going to be really associate-friendly. it's going to be a fun place to work, and we're really excited to see that rollout. and one other comment i want to make back to ed's question earlier on drivers is one of the significant benefits we have is, unlike food service or drivers, they're not touching every case. and our trailers have hydraulic lift gates and electric pallet shops.
and they're bumping a dock for the most part and they're moving the full pallets off the truck and into the retail store, whereas the foodservice drivers have to touch every single case and put it on a hand truck. and so that's one of the reasons why we've had so much success in hiring drivers, specifically at foodservice while they were down.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
thank you.
operator
next question comes from eric larson with seaport research partners.
eric larson -- seaport global holdings -- analyst
yeah, thanks, everyone. thanks for the question. so, steve, i'd like to drill down a little bit more on kind of the underlying inflation rate. and obviously, what we're seeing from the cpg companies is kind of, you know, high single-digit input cost inflation.
i think it's probably been 10 to 12 years since we've actually seen it that high. so is that what you -- is that sort of underlying cost rate what you think that cpg companies will price, and you're starting to see that now where it will be mostly a 2022 event?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
that seems high to me, eric. well, look, i think there is going to be material inflation that makes its way through the system. we're going to have to wait and see. you're right, we haven't seen inflation in a very long time.
chris and john, you want to add something for that?
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. i'll just add that, you know, we have a process for cpg increases, our suppliers' increases, where we get notification 60, 90 days in advance. and to your point, eric, they are higher than normal. i think a lot of cpg is held off during covid.
and in the meantime, labor's increased, transportation has increased, and there have been raw material inputs that have increased. so they are coming in, they haven't quite hit yet, but what we've seen in the notifications, they are higher than normal. i would put them more in the mid-single digits than the high single digits. but you know, we service so many suppliers that it's hard to say in aggregate where they'd come in.
i agree with steve that the high single seems high. i think it's going to be more in the mid-single digits, which again is significant -- significantly higher than the 1% to 2% that we typically see.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
we did see, eric, some inflation in our protein and now was almost exclusively driven by the meat producers' inability to actually make the product that i would call short-term.
eric larson -- seaport global holdings -- analyst
ok. yeah. that's sort of the refrigerated kind of the perimeter of the store stuff, and that tends to be sort of passed through -- you know, those tend to be sort of passed-through products. but your center of the store items tends to be more -- when cpg take those prices up, they hold them, and then they, you know, they tend to promote it back.
and you rarely see those prices go back down again. so when you look what you might be -- what we call transitory inflation or not, what are your viewpoints on that? can we see -- i mean could we see more volatility like what you see in your fiscal '22 or '23 or maybe late '22 prices come back down, which has more volatility in that, or would you expect to see with higher prices a higher rate of sustainable promotion?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, you're exactly right there. so what's going to happen is those costs are not going to come down, they're going to stay inflated. and then in order to move the product, the product will be healthily promoted. and in either way, that's a big tailwind for us because of the cost of goods goes up, we buy into rising inventory and passed through the price.
if the cpg heavily promotes the products, we manage the promotion, and that turns into gross margin for us.
eric larson -- seaport global holdings -- analyst
ok. perfect. thank you, everybody.

next question comes from jim salera with northcoast research. 
jim salera -- northcoast research -- analyst
guys?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, jim.
jim salera -- northcoast research -- analyst
so looking at the top 100 customers, obviously, you guys perform better on the sales side there than just kind of with the business in general. what's driving the discrepancy between those top 100 customers? it just that you have a broader selection of the portfolio that you're selling to them is a better cross-selling some of the service platforms. what's driving the better performance of those compared to business as a whole?
chris testa -- president of unfi
hey, this is chris. i'll take that one. it's really a couple of things. one, we're talking about really sophisticated long-standing customers that have quickly adopted e-comm, have quickly adopted pricing strategies, have quickly adapted to offering foodservice and prepared foods in their stores, so they're just really good at strategy and execution.
but the second part is cross-selling. you know, we have a huge benefit to offer large customers that want to use us to offset some of their either capacity constraints or their transportation constraints and use our system to offset that distribution that they would typically carry. and so the other thing is now that we have this broader portfolio by bringing these two companies together, we have a really unique offering to sell natural and conventional nationally, which really no one else can do. and the benefits of that are really being seen with our top 100 customers because we're selling them a broader portfolio of products that we didn't have two and a half years ago.
jim salera -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. and i just -- when you're looking at that overall incremental cross-sell opportunity, especially on the service side, what percentage of that would you say comes from the top 100 customers versus the rest of the business portfolio?
chris testa -- president of unfi
it's hard to say. you know, the top 100 customers are bigger wins. i mean, we're getting smaller cross-selling wins at every level if you think about just an independent conventional store that wants the top 200 and 500 natural items. you know, those are really helpful to them and their customers but it's not really moving the total needle.
i don't have that top 100 customers, but i would say that the vast majority is over 75% of those wins are happening with the top 100.
jim salera -- northcoast research -- analyst
ok, great. thanks, chris.
chris testa -- president of unfi
sure.

next question comes from greg badishkanian with wolfe research.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. this is spencer hanus on for greg. just a quick follow-up on the inflation discussion. what is your outlook for retail and wholesale inflation in 2021? are you hearing anything from your retail partners about concerns about passing through elevated cost increases? and then, how should we expect the cadence of benefits from higher inflation flowing through to your business?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
so i don't have any additional color on the actual numbers related to inflation other than we know inflation is going up. as to when it goes up and how much it goes up, you know what, i'm not sure. but i certainly believe that it's going to be in the mid-single digits earlier. as far as pass through, as chris said earlier, we, from a policy perspective, depending upon the product category, we typically get between 60 and 90 days advance notice, which gives us the ability to buy into rising markets, which is a source of gross margin for us, which is a little would be a tailwind.
but we passed through 100%, pretty damn close to 100% of the cost of goods that get pushed to us.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, can you give us a quick update on fill rates? and then, any sense of when vendor promos get back to pre-covid levels? are there any categories that are standing out as being a laggard in getting back to those historical fill rates?
chris testa -- president of unfi
hey, spencer, this is chris. yeah, so fill rates, we're seeing the highest fill rate we've had all year. we have over 600-basis-point improvement from the start of the year, albeit we are still well below where we were pre-covid levels. it's a tailwind for us because as steve mentioned, fill rate going up means a lot more new products are starting to come into the marketplace.
a new product is a good thing for us. it's a good thing for our customers with slotting fees and promos -- promotional dollars. as far as the categories, it's really mixed. you know, some of those categories that were really far behind are still lagging as you'd expect.
i'm talking about air disinfectants and cleaners. they're still far behind pre-covid levels, but they're gaining. right now, what suppliers are really dealing with is transportation, which is a new challenge that data exists that's in labor. and so that's what's kind of causing the fill rate to get even higher.
but we're optimistic, we had a 600-basis-point improvement from the start of the year, we had a 200-basis-point improvement from q2. and you know, we're talking to our suppliers every day about how we can get our fair share of those high-demand products.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thank you.

next question comes from peter saleh with btig.  
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. i just want to come back to the conversation around labor inflation and or shortages, and warehouse personnel, and drivers. how much of this issue, the ongoing issue right now, do you feel is related to outsized or high unemployment benefits, which is, i guess, more transitory that ends in september, or how much of this do you think is kind of a more permanent change in industry structure?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, you know, this is a personal opinion, i don't think much of it is really associated with unemployment benefits on the driver side. our drivers are sophisticated. they're knowledgeable and they're working. i think we're in a temporary period where the demand for freight is outpacing the ability of the industry to move the freight.
what i do feel like is it's temporary. once we get back to stability economically, people are back at work, and the pandemic is predominantly behind us, i think this is all going to stabilize. and like we said earlier, you know, there are pockets where we have some struggles around finding drivers but generally speaking, we're in really good shape for all the reasons we talked about earlier. so it's a long way of saying, i think, we're just in a temporary period where demand for drivers and fleet is just outpacing the ability for the industry to cover it.
but it's near-term, it will pass.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
understood. very helpful. and just lastly on the inflation that you guys are anticipating on the cost of goods, is the pass-through -- is there any delay in the pass-through of the cost to your customers or is it fairly immediate?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's immediate, no delay.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

next question comes from bill kirk with mkm partners.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
hey, everybody, thank you for taking the question. just one for me. what does capacity utilization look like at the new new york facility once you have the billion annual from key food on and once you have the incremental 500 million up and running? i guess the question is how much more room physically will that -- all that locations have for future wins on top?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
yeah. bill this is eric. i'll take that. this is a reminder, you know, that facility is 1.3 million square feet.
it is a multiple building. yes, we are onboarding 300 from key food stores but we do have additional capacity there post the opening to handle the metro new york marketplace for future customer growth. so we're pretty excited about what that building offers us at that marketplace and looking forward to seeing it come to life here in less than eight weeks.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
and keep in mind, we have big facilities in york, pennsylvania; harrisburg, pennsylvania; carlisle, pennsylvania; hudson valley, new york. we have that market really well covered.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
thank you. that's it for me. thank you, guys.
operator
next question comes from william reuter with bank of america.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning. earlier, when you were discussing the challenges with drivers, you noted that it wasn't necessarily about wage inflation, but it was more about offering greater flexibility to them. will that be effective in offering greater flexibility to your drivers to attract them have the same impact in terms of the labor hours that you'll be using as inflation would, and is there some way to put some sort of numbers around that?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm not sure i understand the question. i think what you're saying is inflation -- you're talking about wage inflation?
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. so earlier, an analyst asked about whether you were seeing wage inflation of your drivers and the answer was kind of, no, it's not necessarily about wage inflation, it's about trying to attract additional drivers by offering greater work-life balance flexibility, etc. i was -- i would expect that offering that flexibility is going to require more hours. so effectively, your total cost of labor increases.
is that incorrect?
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
so we have already increased wages for our drivers in some markets around the country and that's reflected in our financial performance and in our expectations for the year. but what i believe is happening is that the workforce is changing. a lot of associates today want less overtime. they want more work-life balance.
they want to be able to leave in the morning and come home at night. they don't want to go on multiday runs. and so that's very different than the way it was even three or four years ago where the opposite was true. and so our routes, and our routes planning, and our dc management, are all predicated on what the worker of today really wants out of a job.
and as long as we can give them what they want, then we're going to keep our turnover down and our productivity high. the other thing that's really important to us is safety and having a really robust safety program that demonstrates to our workforce, drivers in particular, that we care, and we do. and all those things combined into a different type of workforce today that was here three or four years ago, and companies just have to change and be cognizant of, you know, what the worker of today really demands. and all of that is reflected in our numbers that we've seen so far this year, how we're committing to the numbers from the rest of the year, and what we see happening in 2022, which by the way, we've already said is going to be another record year.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then just as a follow-up, obviously, the retail business has performed very well over the last year, trying to figure out what a sustainable level they are maybe challenging, but has your perspective changed on your interest in keeping that asset, given that you had to explore different options, you know, in the past? what are you, guys, plan with that currently? thanks.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, i can tell you that this is a leadership team, we are so incredibly proud of what our retail division has done. you know, they've been there, they've been open, they've been supporting the communities in so many different ways, and yes, our financial results have been just incredible throughout the pandemic, and they continue to be incredible. i think, as you know, we took them off the market during covid. we just didn't feel like it was an appropriate time to try to sell a retail business and that they are not back on the market today.
and we'll talk a lot more about that at investor day. but today, we own it, we love it, and we're going to continue to run it, and it just an example -- exemplary now that we have over the last couple of years.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you for your insights.
operator
the last question comes from jim salera with northcoast research.
jim salera -- northcoast research -- analyst
hey, guys. just a follow-up question on the drivers' supply. steve, you've mentioned that the demand for freight is really outpacing the supply right now. do you anticipate that the way that it will balance itself out or you'll see more people -- more drivers entering the market so there's going to be a greater labor supply, or fill rates will improve and so that'll take miles off the road, or maybe a little bit more in dc, you have less miles to travel? just trying to put some --
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i think that what's really happened is there has been just so much pent-up demand for products that get shipped by truck over the last year or so. and we're seeing that demand in all of them all of the primary statistics that you would look at. but i would say that it's -- that this will come off. and so as that demand falls off, the labor market for freight will stabilize.
and that's really what i was trying to get at. we're hiring drivers. i think there will be drivers -- more drivers coming into the marketplace. we know how to do it.
we've got a big fleet of owned vehicles and drivers who represent us every single day.so you know, i think, we're just in a temporary lull. and if you certainly look back in the history of freight, we've seen this before. and the demand will come off, more drivers will enter the marketplace, and we'll be much more stable. it may take another year or so but, you know, there are lots of things that we're doing to make sure that we have a terrific driver workforce to deliver our products every day.
jim salera -- northcoast research -- analyst
great, thanks.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
all right. thank you very much for joining us today. i can't tell you, you know, i've been here for 12 years, there's never been a more exciting time to be with unfi. i truly believe that the best year is in front of us.
as i said earlier, '20 was a record, '21 is going to be a record, and '22 is going to be even better. so thanks for joining us. be safe. and we look forward to seeing you at our investor day on june 24th.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the unfi fiscal 2021 third-quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i'd now like to hand the conference over to mr. steven bloomquist, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
steve bloomquist -- vice president, investor relations
good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on unfi's third-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. by now you should have received a copy of the earnings release issued this morning. the press release, webcast, and a supplemental slide deck are available under the investors section of the company's website at www.unfi.com under the events tab. joining me for today's call are steve spinner, our chairman, and chief executive officer; john howard, our chief financial officer; chris testa, president of unfi; and eric dorne, our chief operating officer.
steve, chris, and john will provide a business update after which we'll take your questions. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that comments made by management during today's call may contain forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include plans, expectations, estimates, and projections that might involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks are discussed in the company's earnings release and sec filings.
actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements. and lastly, i'd like to point out that during today's call, management will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. definitions and reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures are included in our press release. i will now turn the call over to steve. 
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steve. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fiscal 2021 third-quarter earnings call. as you saw in this morning's press release, we delivered another quarter of outstanding financial results. third-quarter sales were over $6.62 billion, third-quarter adjusted ebitda was $179 million, and third-quarter adjusted eps was $0.94, all were in line with our internal expectations and keep us on track to deliver our full-year fiscal 2021 guidance and record ebitda year following 2020, which was positively influenced by the onset of covid-19.
we also reduced our outstanding net debt by $62 million in the quarter. from a year-over-year basis, you'll recall that last spring was truly an unprecedented time in the food industry, and we indicated on our last call we would not positively cycle last year's third quarter in which our customers benefited tremendously from the stock-up buying that took place as the covid pandemic began to spread. but we're very pleased with our strong performance this quarter, which maintains the momentum building across our business. first and foremost, our team delivered.
our 28,000 associates across the u.s. and canada adjusted, learned, grew, and executed for our customers. we care deeply about our role in ensuring that food continues to move, and our results demonstrated just that. this quarter's results again validate the work we are doing to both make our customers stronger and to drive shareholder value.
we know it all begins with the simple yet powerful idea of what unfi can do to make our customers more successful. our data analytics and cross-selling capabilities position our customers to quickly pivot to sell more of what today's consumer wants. our private brands help them offer desirable, differentiated products to their shoppers at great prices. our services lower their expense structure and make running their business easier, and our innovation is continually looking forward and asking the critical questions of what's next, followed by what will unfi do to bring it to our customers in the easiest possible way.
one of the larger industry dynamics is the return of cost inflation, which up until now has been relatively benign. as many of you know, unfi has historically benefited from inflation based on the structure of our business model. in addition, we expect a tailwind from the return of cpg promotional dollars, which over the past 12 months, have been considerably lower than historical levels. during that time frame, large manufacturers have been able to sell their products without the need for regular promotions, which has begun to reverse as suppliers more aggressively promote their products to consumers with more choices as overall product availability improves.
another important topic has been the challenges around hiring and retaining associates. one of our most important core beliefs has always been to do the right thing, which includes continuously and proactively looking for ways to keep unfi as an employer of choice. this includes looking at ways to create better work-life balance, our commitment to diversity and inclusion, and our relentless focus on safety. with june being national safety month, we are launching a new framework and rally cry for workplace safety that will drive safety culture even further to move us closer to our ultimate goal of zero injuries.
we will be flexible, we will compensate our team fairly, and we will be creative and proactive as our workforce initiatives continue to evolve. we'll have more to say about these topics in two weeks as part of our investor day. in addition, we're always making sure our compensation levels are competitive. and to that end, we've adjusted wage scales in many of our markets over the past 12 months, which has led to greater stability in our workforce.
we're seeing improved productivity and decreased over time, offsetting these wage increases which has allowed us to maintain consistent operating expense rates. in addition, we've continuously been investing in automation to improve throughput and order accuracy, while easing the local challenges around the available workforce. over the past 12 months and through the balance of the year, we'll continue to make meaningful investments in two, soon to be three, automated facilities and we'll continue to look for further opportunities to use technology where the business case makes sense. we'll provide additional color around our updated growth strategy and longer-term financial outlook in a couple of weeks at our june 24 investor day.
as you read in the press release, the event will be virtual and include a live q&a session following commentary from many of our leaders. we're hoping you can join us. fiscal 2020 was a record year for unfi in terms of sales and adjusted ebitda, and fiscal 2021 is expected to be even stronger. we believe the factors i just spoke to, as well as the onboarding of key food's northeast stores, and the pipeline business chris will address will contribute to fiscal 2022 being another record year.
let me now turn the call over to chris to provide more context on our business performance. chris?
chris testa -- president of unfi
thanks, steve, and good morning, everyone. on today's call, i'll provide additional color on our fiscal 2021 third-quarter performance and discuss some of the key trends we're currently seeing in our business. as you saw in this morning's press release, total sales for the quarter were $6.6 billion. as expected, this was below last year's record-setting third quarter finishing 5.9% down but up 6.7% on a two-year stack basis.
we calculate this by adding the year-over-year growth rate to the prior year-over-year growth rate and believe it to be an appropriate way to view sales this quarter given the unprecedented activity in last year's third quarter. for additional perspective, nielsen syndicated retail sales declined 5.3% for our fiscal third quarter, which included an approximate 110-basis-point inflation tailwind compared to unfi's wholesale inflation. after factoring this in, we believe the change in our wholesale sales was about 16 basis points favorable compared to nielsen's reported retail sales, and this is driven by our continued success with cross-selling and winning new business. steve touched upon inflation in the quarter, which overall was relatively benign for us.
however, we have received notice from many suppliers indicating they will be taking price increases in the coming months. so, we expect inflation to have a larger impact on our business leading into fiscal 2022. as many of you know, inflation has historically been a positive tailwind to our wholesale business as our contracts generally allow unfi the pass-through, manufacturer cost increases, as well as higher outbound fuel expenses. additionally, we anticipate higher supplier promotional spending to coincide with price increases and we have already seen some indicators of this trend beginning.
let's turn to the performance of each of our sales channels. our chains business was down 5.6% compared to last year's third quarter and up 5.4% on a two-year stack basis. within chains, we continue to be encouraged by the year-over-year increases we're seeing from cross-selling wins with several of our top 10 chain customers, including those with captive distribution networks. our independent retailer channel was down 11.4% compared to last year's third quarter and up 3.8% on a two-year stack basis.
many of our independents who have added e-commerce capability are reopening their foodservice programs and are using our professional service teams for store remodels as they look to differentiate and adapt to the shifting consumer shopping behavior. the supernatural channel was up 0.6% compared to last year's third quarter and up nearly 17% on a two-year stack basis. as we reported earlier in the quarter, we signed a long-term agreement with this important customer and continue to support them as they open new locations, strive for operational efficiencies, and look for new ways to improve their customer experience. our retail stores continue to perform as sales declined 9.3% compared to last year's third quarter and increased 14.9% on a two-year stack basis following last year's record comp sales growth.
both cub and shoppers continue to do a great job adapting to various consumer changes in catering to the local consumer needs. for example, in the twin cities, cub's my cub my way philosophy allows customers to shop in-store 24 hours a day or place their online orders for delivery, or click-and-collect pickup, all meant to meet the customer where and how they choose to purchase their grocery items. and finally, our other channel was down 3.2% compared to last year's third quarter and down slightly on a two-year stack basis as strong e-commerce gains have nearly offset all the softness in both foodservice and military channels. sales to our top 100 customers were down just 3.4% compared to last year's third quarter, about 240 basis points stronger than our total wholesale net sales.
despite lapping the unprecedented level of stock-up buying that occurred in last year's third quarter, nearly one-third of these customers had double-digit year-over-year sales increases with unfi. we believe this reflects the strength of their businesses and their confidence in rewarding us with a greater share of their purchases. looking forward, our business pipeline remains robust, and we're optimistic we'll be able to add an incremental $500 million of annual new business that will phase in throughout fiscal 2022. this would be additional volume on top of the onboarding of key food, which will have an estimated $1 billion annual run rate, which will also phase in throughout fiscal 2022.
our newly reorganized sales team remains committed to executing against the large $140 billion adjustable market that we have described on previous calls and we'll discuss more at our upcoming investor day. let's talk about the progress we're making on some of our growth platforms starting with owned brands. as we've said previously, we plan to focus on innovation and introduced new items to meet the evolving needs of today's consumers. this year, we've continued to drive against innovation launching over 100 new products across 15 categories on just our field day brand.
top-selling skus include functional beverages, personal care items, and pantry supplies. at the same time, our essential everyday brand has record sales in the quarter with international customers as our brands+ team is aggressively expanding distribution in central and south america. and finally, last week, we announced a new line of bold, no-sugar-added hot sauces that complement woodstock's strength in the condiment category. and in keeping with our woodstock brand dna, these products are non-gmo project verified and are produced from a carbon-neutral facility.
we'll continue to lean into high-growth consumer segments and high-margin categories for future owned brands' expansion. we are also aggressively marketing our more than 150 services that bring the following benefits to our customers. first, customers save time, allowing them to focus on running their business. second, customers save money, allowing them to reallocate savings to other drivers in their operations.
and third, customers receive help in driving revenue by bringing new offerings or insights. a great example is our payments offering that generates significant savings in credit card fees for our customers. we've completed 148 installs over the past six months and in one instance saved a multi-store customer over $500,000 annually from just this single service. we'll have more to say about both our brands and services businesses at our investor day later this month.
within the important e-commerce space, our recently launched community marketplace continues to build as more skus get added to this innovative platform. although it's still in its infancy, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of this extension of our unfi easy options b2b business. as for e-commerce capability that we provide to our brick-and-mortar customers, we've now added 215 stores to our platform in the past year with another 120 in the process of being onboarded. these customers can now offer online ordering, click and collect, and delivery to their shoppers.
moving to retail, our retail banners continue to perform well under mike stiger's leadership. we're especially pleased with the traction e-commerce is getting at cub, where third-quarter year-over-year e-comm sales increased 27%. we've recently expanded online ordering and delivery to include all cub liquor, as well as wine & spirits locations, reflecting the great work the team is doing to make sure we're meeting the needs of our customers. we're also proud of the efforts in the community as exemplified by our recent partnership with the minnesota twins, where we've administered covid vaccines at select home games in support of minnesota's ""roll up your sleeves, mn"" fans campaign.
finally, we're proud to have reopened our second cub store damaged during last year's civil unrest. local leadership has built both a friendship and business relationship with the community group, we push for peace, whose employees now greet customers entering the store. this progressive new model has not only strengthened our ties with the local community but simply makes good business sense. on a trailing fourth-quarter basis, retail has contributed nearly $100 million in adjusted ebitda, reflecting the strength of our operations and the brand loyalty within their markets.
lastly, let me make a couple of comments on the operations side of our business. in addition to the comments we've made earlier about our approach to compensation and workforce stability, we also continue to move forward with optimizing our supply chain and expanding our distribution center network to better service our customers and deliver operating efficiencies. for the first time this year, our outbound field rate improved year over year as we continued to work with suppliers on a journey back to pre-covid service levels. our 1.3 million square foot allentown campus remains on track to begin shipping early next fiscal year and we're looking to add additional volumes through new customer wins in the new york metro area.
in addition, the third quarter saw us begin to deploy several emerging technology initiatives, including new material handling technology to improve both the efficiency and work environment for our associates. we'll provide additional detail on our distribution network initiatives at investor day, including some visuals that will help bring some of these amazing locations to life for you. despite all the changes with the industry and macro environment, unfi has remained committed to our plan to leverage our scale and help our customers win. we have executed this plan throughout fiscal '21 and we're all very excited and optimistic for the future.
our associates have done an amazing job through this pandemic getting the products to our customers on time and in a safe professional manner. we're operating at a high level ,and we have every reason to believe our momentum will continue into next fiscal year and beyond. with that, i'll turn the call over to john.
john howard -- chief financial officer
thank you, chris. good morning, everyone. on today's call, i will provide additional context on our quarterly financial performance, balance sheet, capital structure, and full-year outlook for fiscal 2021. as steve and chris said, we're very pleased with our operating performance this quarter.
we delivered strong results as we cycled last year's unprecedented stock-up surge as covid-driven demand began. sales for the third quarter totaled $6.62 billion, adjusted ebitda was $179 million, and adjusted eps was $0.94 per share. third-quarter gross margin rate was 34 basis points lower than last year's third quarter, driven predominantly by lower levels of supply related income in our wholesale business. last year's third quarter was a largely normal promotional environment, which didn't begin to change until well into our fiscal fourth quarter and had yet to return to the pre-pandemic levels.
the gross margin rate in our retail business was approximately flat to last year. third-quarter operating expense rate increased 13 basis points to 13.09% of sales. this included the deleveraging impact of lower sales and nearly $3 million in start-up costs related to our newest dc in allentown, partially offset by lower covid-19-related costs, as well as the benefits from our value path program. this quarter's strong performance was the result of the team doing a great job managing expenses in light of a changing environment, demonstrating our ability to run the business more efficiently over time.
we're pleased with the third-quarter adjusted ebitda margin rate of 2.71%. on a gaap basis, we reported $0.80 per share, which included $0.14 per share and after-tax charges primarily related to advisory fees for our transformational value path initiative. our adjusted eps totaled $0.94 per share. turning to the balance sheet, our total outstanding net debt finished the quarter at $2.43 billion, setting another quarter ending record low following the supervalu acquisition.
we generated $129 million in net cash from operating activities in the quarter, which led to a reduction in total outstanding net debt of $62 million. our year-to-date net cash from operating activities and asset sale proceeds net of capital expenditures have allowed us to reduce our net debt by approximately $200 million on a face-value basis, which keeps us on track to achieve our full-year debt-reduction target. our net debt-to-adjusted ebitda leverage ended the quarter at 3.3 times, up a tenth of a turn from the second quarter due to the expected year-over-year decline in adjusted ebitda as we cycled last year's third quarter, partially offset by lower debt levels. this is a full turn lower than where we were at the end of last year's third quarter.
as you read in our press release, we're reaffirming the comments we provided on our last call toward the guidance ranges we originally provided on last year's fourth-quarter call. as for net sales, we're anticipating several new business wins to take longer than originally anticipated to onboard, which will cause us to finish at the low end of our sales guidance. this includes some of the business chris referenced regarding our pipeline. as for adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps, our strong cost controls and the benefits from the value path initiative we introduced earlier this year will allow us to finish at the upper end of the guidance range as we provided for each metric, both of which include approximately $13 million in allentown start-up costs.
we're maintaining our previous guidance of $250 million to $300 million for capital expenditures and approximately $250 million of net debt reduction on a face-value basis, both of which include this year's investment in our new allentown distribution center to support key food. we continue to expect our net debt-to-adjusted ebitda leverage ratio to finish the fiscal year at approximately 3.3 times. increasing value for our shareholders remains a priority and focus of unfi. with our differentiated business model and large addressable market, we remain confident in our ability to grow our business and generate meaningful free cash flow.
we look forward to providing more details on our future growth plans, including the metrics we will use to measure our success at investor day in two weeks. thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in unfi. with that, let me turn the call back to steve.
steve spinner -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, john. as john discussed, we remain laser-focused on driving our business forward and are committed to increasing shareholder value. we're pleased with our year-to-date performance and remain confident that we'll deliver on our full-year outlook. fiscal 2020 was a record year for unfi in terms of sales and adjusted ebitda, and fiscal 2021 is expected to be even stronger.
we believe the factors i just spoke to, as well as the onboarding of key food's northeast stores and the pipeline business chris addressed, will contribute to fiscal 2022 being another record year. we're also in the midst of active succession planning for unfi's new ceo. while we don't have any incremental update today and don't plan to announce anything prior to or at our june 24 investor event, the process continues with the support of our top-tier search firm and our board of directors. to reiterate my comment on the last call, our business is strong, our future is bright, and i'm confident unfi will have a new and exciting leader later this year.
in conclusion, i am thrilled with our performance this quarter. we have a great deal of momentum and i continue to believe that unfi's best days lie ahead. with that, we're ready to take your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions]. our first question is from the line of bill kirk from mkm partners. please go ahead.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
and good morning, everyone. thank you for the questions. my first question is for sandy. back in june, the company gave the goals for fiscal 2024, and i guess my question is, what areas do you envision as maybe the most challenging and the heaviest lifting? and which areas toward those goals are more of the lower-hanging fruit in your mind?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
thanks, bill. seven weeks in, i'm still very much on a steep learning curve, learning about all facets of the business. and i'm learning from the senior team about the details of the strategic plan. and i have to tell you, i like what i'm seeing.
the plan is customer-focused and growth-oriented with an estimated $140 billion addressable opportunity that we talked about with existing and also potential new customers. in parallel, our customers are counting on us to do the very best job possible to meet their product service needs in a complicated environment. so for at least the foreseeable short-term, my focus continues to be on learning about our business, listening to our customers and unfi teammates, and accelerating the quality of our execution on behalf of our customers.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
thank you. and then maybe one has been manufacturer-led activity versus retailer-led. and then what do you expect that to look like going forward?
chris testa -- president
yeah. i'm not going to speak to the retailer led because that's really for the retailers to speak about. but the manufacturer-led promotions are starting [inaudible] we are seeing more activity in our promotions. the thing that is still sort of a headwind for us, bill, is the fill rate.
so those two things go head -- hand-in-hand. promotions come as the fill rate improves, and we didn't see steady improvement on our inbound supplier fill rate up until the summer. and then the summer months, it started to decline for all the macro issues that i'm sure everybody is aware of, raw material shortages, especially in bottled beverages, labor, freight, and so forth. so we -- from a percentage base, we're happy with what we're seeing from the promotions.
but in aggregate, the fill rate is going to continue to be a headwind on the promotional activity.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
thank you. thank you, both.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of scott mushkin. please go ahead.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
thanks and welcome, sandy. looking forward to working -- looking forward to working together. the supernatural channel obviously is growing pretty rapidly even though it's cycling. i wonder if you could give us any thoughts on what's going on there, how sustainable that is?
chris testa -- president
hey, scott. it's chris. well, yes, there's a couple of reasons for that growth. one, it was the slower growth in the fourth quarter last year, so it's cycling that number from last year.
so that's why we're seeing the bigger year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. and then two, as we announced earlier in fiscal '21, we got the extension with our largest customer there, that's open the door for additional categories and growth. so we see that continuing, at least for the fiscal '22 year and hopefully beyond that.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
perfect. that's obviously good news. and the second question is a little bit more short-term. obviously, you got a facility closed down because of covid, how should we -- the thing is you kind of sit back half later, but how should we specifically think about the first quarter revenues kind of cost just so we can kind of get the models right here?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. no. i appreciate that. this is john.
as you know, we generally don't provide quarterly guidance. i think the comments that i made in the script relates to some of the headwinds we're seeing in q1, centralia, et cetera. i think that can help guide how you guys think about the quarter. we look at it as a full year.
we know the year is -- has various degrees of uncertainty, but we feel good about the numbers that we put out there for the full year.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
and then my final one is just you guys talked about labor. obviously, labor is a challenge. you talked about some of the things you're doing to mitigate it. are you worried about some other distribution centers being either short-labor or covid, or is that really not a concern that you put into the model at this stage.
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
good morning, scott. it's eric. i would just start out by saying that centralia was the first significant disruption we've had in our network since the pandemic began. and that's large because of the proactive and robust protocols we've implemented across the network by our teams.
we also are very focused on our workforce, and as chris referenced that we've taken a lot of proactive and innovative steps to, not only address wage challenges, but also workforce availability and workforce lifestyle, so we remain very focused. we've seen some pockets of improvement while we're also experiencing the challenges that we've described in other dcs across the network, but we're continuing to stay on it, it's our number one focus and we have the entire organization supporting our supply chain teams as we work through this.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
all right, guys. thanks for your thoughts. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question is from jim solera from northcoast research. your line is open.
jim solera -- northcoast research -- analyst
thanks, guys. great quarter. good guidance for the out-year. i guess, first of all, i wanted to drill down a little bit on the net sales guidance for the next year.
so if i'm looking kind of back of the envelope math, there's $800 million in there-ish from key food, which leaves about $500 million upsides. could you maybe break down where you see the opportunity? is that going to come from cross-selling wins, from new account wins, new products or any granularity confront of that would be awesome?
chris testa -- president
hey, jim. it's chris. on the key food win, that -- we won't realize the full billion dollars a year that we talked about in a fiscal year until fiscal '23, so that will be phased in across fiscal '22. but again, we're not going to see that full benefit in a single fiscal year until next year.
like the rest of it, it's going to be coming from weekly wins, daily wins, of all sizes. if you think about what unfi has to offer, there is no single competitor that we compete against, so every day we're seeing wins with produce, we're seeing wins that are helping our customers with their captive distribution, we're seeing natural to conventional, conventional to natural. so in that total fiscal '22 guidance, it's all of those on top of the key food's onboarding that we're going to have throughout the year.
jim solera -- northcoast research -- analyst
ok. great. and actually to build off something you mentioned that with the captive distribution. we've all heard about some of the supply chain and logistics challenges.
does that end up benefiting you guys? if some of these captives, retailers don't have the capacity to scale up or if they get some, whether it's covid outbreak or any issues they might have. do they kind of lean on you guys more to support their existing network or do you guys view that as a tailwind if some of these supply chain headwinds for the broader [inaudible] to keep going to move forward?
chris testa -- president
the short answer to your question is, yes. the supply chain is stressed right now and it's been stressed for 17 months. and that level -- that environment has been an opportunity for unfi. we're uniquely positioned because we have the full portfolio of conventional and natural.
so you think about some of those large natural retailers -- i'm sorry, conventional retailers that we were previously just selling natural. they can now come to unfi and leverage our network to sell them conventional and take some relief on their captive distribution. so absolutely, what we learned through the pandemic is when the supply chain stress, that typically is a tailwind for us that creates opportunities for us.
jim solera -- northcoast research -- analyst
awesome, and if i could sneak in one more quick question. you did a really impressive on the operating margin side. can you maybe just touch on a real quick couple of leverage you guys are pulling to keep that number where in fact is filed where it's basically flat year over year. i would imagine you guys move some of the shrinks benefits just compared to the big covid quarter last still around.
so any detail on that you could provide, it would be great.
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah, if you look at the ebitda margin, when we think about what's driving that, we've talked before about the value path initiative, which has various underlying multi-pads that we're running related to margin, sg&a, opex, et cetera. all of which is bringing that value that you are seeing as we can leverage the p&l. and then as we talked about for fy '22 and the go-forward for '22. we know we've got some of those headwinds that i mentioned, particularly the -- we looked at '22 as a transition year.
we've got some health and wellness, that'll be coming back if some rent for the marino valley side. we're losing the stabilized csa contractually from a contract that's been pronounced there for years. we knew all of that was coming as we established those long-term targets. so when we think about ebitda margin from '21 to '22, we know we've got those headwinds in '22, but we also know once we go through that transition year and get into '23 and '24, we're going to be right on track for those targets.
jim solera -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. i'll pass it on.
operator
thank you. the next one we have eric larson from seaport research partners. please go ahead.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
thank you. congratulations on a good quarter, guys, and, sandy, welcome aboard. we're looking forward to working with you over the next, hopefully, a number of years. so welcome aboard.
the first question i have is, i believe you said that fourth-quarter inflation was 2.4%. and obviously, this is rooted first inflationary period you've had in many years. so, maybe this question is for chris. in your guidance, are you building in maybe a 2% plus inflation rate for this year? and of course, then that should really help your gross margins, well then maybe john can comment on that.
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah, eric. this is john, i'll start and chris can add some color as well. i think the way we think about '22, we're including about 1% inflation for the year. we know the situation we're in right now.
but as it relates to a full-year, we think we're going on [inaudible], come back to roughly a 1% for the year. as we talked about before, broadly inflation is a little bit of a tailwind for us. so anything above that could provide a little bit of upside but for us, the way we think about inflation internally, it's more about how we can coordinate and work with our suppliers so that we can then provide competitive pricing for our customers. and that's really our focus to support our growth initiatives.
and that's the way we view that. but as it relates to purely the numbers you're seeing in the guidance, we've got 1% for the full year in our numbers.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. and then just a quick follow-up to that. your largest customer has been trying to increase the value of their grocery portfolio relative to other conventional for some time. are you seeing the same rate of inflation across all the channels, or are there large disparities?
chris testa -- president
so eric, i think you're talking about the register sales, right? the inflation and what the retailers are doing to pass them on, or not pass them on. i don't think we're in a position really to comment on the retailer pricing strategies on that. to your point, there are many different approaches, whether to pass it on or not, but i don't think that we can comment on the strategy of our customers.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. i just thought i'd try. thank you, chris. and then just final follow-up on [inaudible], maybe i was -- it's related to the first question that was asked on the conference call.
so do you endorse the new 2024 guidance that was put out at the investor day in june or are you reserving the right as you get to learn the business more over the next three or four to five months, the right to adjust those guidance numbers?
john howard -- chief financial officer
to john, the answer to that is both. i am excited about the strategic plan. i think we have a tremendous opportunity. i haven't seen anything that would signal to me that the numbers that we put out there aren't exactly [inaudible].
but as a team, we're going to always be agile, and work together to make sure that our plans make the most sense for all of our stakeholders, our shareholders, our customers, our employees, et cetera. so very supportive and certainly reserving the right to tighten the plan in a different way based on condition.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
great. thank you, everyone. congrats again.
operator
thank you. next, we have john heinbockel from guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
thanks. so guys, i want to start top-line in the environment. so if i think about the cross-sell embedded in the guidance for '22, it seems to me it's got to be maybe half or less than half of what it was in '21. is that fair in order of magnitude? and then i'm curious in this environment right where there's so much uncertainty.
is it easier or harder to win new accounts [inaudible] or people more likely to stay with them -- where they're at for now, or they're looking to move more than they did before. i'm curious what you're seeing on that front.
chris testa -- president
hey, john. it's chris. on the guidance moving forward, i think that you're looking at it the right way. and as we think about our sales growth over the next three years, i think your estimate on half of it coming from existing customers is the right way to look at it.
our growth platforms like services, brands, fresh, the majority of that is going to come from deeper customer penetration. in addition to the daily, weekly blocking and tackling of getting more categories, fixing the mix, and just improving our share of wallet with our existing customers. that said, our growth will be balanced by new customers as well. key food, it's going to be a big part of that on fiscal '22, so it will be more weighted that way in the short year, but long term, i think about half is the right way to look at it.
and then as far as the environment, look it's -- i've been here over 12 years. it's still a competitive environment. and -- but what we have found as i said earlier, under these conditions in this environment of a stressed supply chain, our customers are looking for security. when you have the distribution network that we have, when you have the buying scale and purchasing power that we have when you have the broad portfolio of products that we have, including a huge portfolio of fresh, which is where the consumers going, to the perimeter of the store.
we have proven to win a lot more than we're losing. so it's not easy, it remains competitive. we've got to show value to our customers to get those new accounts. but what we've seen over the last 17 months is that when the supply chain is stressed, it's typically we're the answer for a lot of customers' problems.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
all right. maybe as a follow-up then, the -- where do you guys sit today on capacity utilization or the availability in the network, right. and i know it'll vary by dc, but are there any places that are getting stressed. and then your thoughts on if labor is going to stay elevated.
what more can you do on automation. and i know you've done the big supercenters with automation. can you bring automation on a more limited basis to more dcs or is that not financially feasible.
chris testa -- president
it's a good question. i'll take the first part and turn the automation question over to eric. so one thing during the pandemic is we learned that our network, you might go back to the third quarter of fiscal '20. we learned that our network can pump out more volume.
and we haven't yet hit that feeling that we saw back then, and i actually wouldn't even call it a feeling, i would call it a realization that we had in the third quarter of last year. so we know that the existing network can handle more volume. and we're also building, right? so we just started our new dc in allentown, pennsylvania to service the new york metro market and we continue to invest in cappx for building expansions and/or new buildings where needed. so it does vary by market to your point but we have a long-term capacity plan that's embedded in the fiscal '24 guidance that we believe we can achieve those numbers with that guidance in our caprx reinvestment.
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
yeah. and john, i would just add on to chris ' comments that going through centralia, we saw the network pivot very quickly during that disruption to service our customers on the west coast. further demonstrating our capacity as well as some of the strategic investments, where texas is getting an expansion.
john howard -- chief financial officer
we're investing heavily in our carlile, pa automated building, which should hopefully come online during summer next year. and just a reminder, we did have full-scale automation for our repax offering in riverside, california as well as richfield, washington that is months in operation now and yielding terrific benefits both from productivity, quality, and labor standpoint. so, it's not important to add that.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next one. we have kelly bania from bmo capital. your line is open.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is kelly bania. also just wanted to add my welcome to you, sandy, look forward to working with you.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
thank you.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
also, just [inaudible] outlook for fiscal '22. i think in your slides here, you have an estimated market contraction of about 1% to 2% and was just [inaudible] help us understand your thought process there. i'm assuming that's the volume related, but just [inaudible] the thought process and what you see -- how you see that impacting retail versus wholesale.
chris testa -- president
well, the numbers we're providing, obviously wholesale, but it is consumer-driven kelly, with that is the cycling of covid and the consumer trends that we're seeing is the shift between away-from-home spending and in-home spending. and we are seeing tremendous moderation as we get out of the pantry loading and the covid spikes, but we do think there's going to continue to be moderation throughout the year.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then i guess this is just another question on wages and benefits. and can you just help quantify to what extent you are investing on a year-over-year basis? just what headwind is as [inaudible] to the guidance in terms of wages and benefits and overtime and so forth.
john howard -- chief financial officer
hey, kelly. this is john. we won't get into specifics on that but what i can tell you is given the challenges that we all know about happening to market, we've made what we consider to be reasonable assumptions in that guidance for the year, for what those costs will be for us in '22 compared to '21, and that's embedded in those numbers. but beyond that, as far as providing specifics with that, we generally won't do that.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. i'll try one more just on retail here if you don't mind. i believe you mentioned the gross margin was flat to last year in retail. i was just wondering if you could talk about puts and takes there as i would assume shrink would be a little bit more of a headwind this year, but maybe there are some other factors.
and then just more broadly as you think about retail ebitda margins. it's pretty much doubled over the past few years. and i'm just wondering if you expect them to stay at these higher levels in fiscal '22.
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure, kelly. happy to answer that one. so a lot of what you're seeing is a combination of factors, and i'm going to give you the first one, which is our retail leadership team, which has just been outstanding throughout the pandemic. as well as the timing of potential sales [inaudible] better coming out of the acquisition.
and as we talked about on investor day, we're now in a position where we believe we're going to keep and continue to run those at this stage. so when we think about that ebitda performance, i think a lot of it is just the broader stability, and the expert leadership from that retail team that we have; that's just been outstanding and the other two markets that we continue to operate in. if you think just about the margins, even gross or ebitda margin, those are expected to be relatively flat, just from a -- there are puts and takes related to promo spend. there's a little bit of strength noise in there, but the reality is there are also corresponding offsets.
there's no dramatic movement one way or the other within those margin rates. it's relatively stable beyond just the market contraction that we're [inaudible]
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
go on to the next question.
operator
certainly, sir. our next question is from william reuter from bank of america. your line is open.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning. you mentioned some disruption in terms of the service levels from some of your vendors. what levels of fulfillment of orders are you seeing. and how has this impacted your ability with your customers in terms of service levels?
chris testa -- president
yeah. it's been a roller-coaster. we ended significantly above our service level than we were the fourth quarter prior post [inaudible] continue to improve and everybody expected that trajectory to continue. but over the last three months, we've seen the deterioration base for the macro factors that i mentioned earlier, labor, [inaudible] freight, raw materials, and so forth.
as far as our ability to service our customers, what the customers and the wholesalers are disappointed that we [inaudible] at this [inaudible] items replacing planogram [inaudible] with items that we do have in stock. taking high demand, low inventory items off promotion, working with our suppliers every day from the top-down on making sure that we have our fair share of product coming in. this is where scale helps our customers because, for most of our suppliers, we're a top one, two or three customer to them. and so that gives us larger broad buying power, and larger allocations for those high-demand skews.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i would imagine, just following up on this, that these are industry trends that your customers generally understand and don't create a great risk of customer losses when contracts end. am i understanding that right or has there been frustration from some customers?
chris testa -- president
there is. you're right with your understanding. it is industrywide and our customers are patient and understanding on that. but i would say that the entire indigenous folks that we don't even service, it just fatigued by it and we're used to it [inaudible] is correct that the industrywide [inaudible] trends do not get [inaudible]
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then just lastly for me, you provided a lot of the components of free cash flow in terms of ebitda and capex, etc. i guess the pieces that we don't know are working capital assumptions for the year, as well as proceeds from the sale [inaudible] facility out west. so i guess, can you provide anything that's going to get us to that leverage below three times, meaning, how much below three times are we thinking or what the range of [inaudible] from asset sales might be.
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. we've managed the specifics to that, but those are the two remaining components. when you think about the $1.3 million facility square-foot, the facility we have we've got to put inventory in, bringing on a large new customer, you can imagine the working capital impact of just those two things alone coupled with the broader growth that's embedded in our top [inaudible] so certainly working capital be a large [inaudible] component. and we're thinking about that riverside sale-leaseback arrangement.
we'll talk about that when the deal closes, nfy '22, but i think the other component like debt reduction is the ability to deploy capital leaves off our books as well. so it's going to be a really good transaction for us from a debt perspective. now i think guiding toward below three is comfortable for us given some of the uncertainty as we move through fy '22 if we have an opportunity to tighten that up.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks. that's all from me.
operator
thank you. the next one we have greg badishkanian from wolfe research. please go ahead.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. this is spencer hanus on for greg. i just wanted to drill down into inflation [inaudible] run rate to the full year [inaudible] of next year. any additional color [inaudible]
john howard -- chief financial officer
the way we think about that again, it's something we next 12 months can look like. and we know we're in an inflationary environment right now, but we think about on balance for the year, we think that 1% looks to be relatively reasonable. so when we think about what we're -- how q1 or again, we don't provide that quarterly guidance but i think it's reasonable to assume that we are seeing similar inflation situations as you're seeing and reading about elsewhere. but we still believe on balance for the year will be somewhere around that 1%
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then do you think your fill rates are lagging the industry today or are you guys in mind? and then has the worsening of service levels impacted your ability to get cross-sell wins over time? and then just a follow-up on the centralia dc has that reopened yet and is it [inaudible]
chris testa -- president
so i'll take the fill rate question, spencer. no, we do not believe we are below the industry, and matter of fact, we think we're above the industry because of our purchasing scale. so we also do quite a bit of our volume through fresh. and the fresh categories have been not impacted to the level of the center store cpg category.
so we think our fill rates are actually above the standard in the industry, albeit the industry is much lower than we wish we were. do you want to take the question [inaudible]
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
sure. spencer, this is eric. i will just -- i'm happy to report that our centralia, dc has returned to normal operating business again. with a two-day shutdown, full shutdown, and then we had a partial week that was disruptive, and i think.
speaking on behalf of the whole company, we can't thank our customers enough for their cooperation as we worked through that situation.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
sure.
operator
thank you. we have time for one last question, and it would be from peter saleh from btig. please go ahead.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question and congrats, sandy. i just want to come back to the comment on inflation. i know you guys have guided me to 1% inflation for fy '22.
it does sound [inaudible] like inflation, at least, from your last comments, is running similarly. in the first quarter, so are you assuming inflation trails off in the back end of the year? and then what would be driving that? just any more color on that would be helpful.
john howard -- chief financial officer
[inaudible] balance for the year, and as i mentioned, we're seeing relatively similar inflation as you are reading and hearing about elsewhere. do i think it will trail off, i think it's not sustainable at its current phase. at what point that trails off, and how that happens, what drives it. now your guess is as good as mine, but i think certainly where we are right now in the current environment does not seem to be sustainable for 12 months.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
understood. all right. and then just on the labor environment, can you guys give us a sense of where your staffing levels are today versus where they were maybe pre-pandemic and maybe what you're seeing on turn or turnover and has that slowed or moderated at all in the recent past?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
yeah. i mean, this is eric. our turnover has not slowed. i mean, the workforce has a variety of options, lot of steps to not only improve our associates' experience but also improve our retention.
so i think this is an ongoing problem that we're going [inaudible] we've taken. but we as an organization are very focused on this and are putting all of our resources against supporting our supply chain and our distribution centers as we work through this.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst

sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
thank you, steve, and good morning everyone. and thank you for joining us on our fiscal 2021 fourth-quarter earnings call. let me begin by saying how happy i am to join unfi and how excited i am to be back in the food business. over my career, i've had the opportunity to meet and work with many of our customers and i look forward to renewing and carrying forward those relationships.
i also look forward to meeting customers that i've not met and learning how unfi can help make all of them even more successful. i've been on the job for about seven weeks now and has spent the majority of my time meeting with customers, our senior team, and with associates across the organization. focusing on growth opportunities for customers and how we can all work together to capture these opportunities in a very complex operating environment. several things have become apparent to me about this company.
first, i've been impressed with the leadership team, both on an individual level as well as how they work together collectively to solve problems, serve our customers and our associates, and move the business forward. they've brought me up to speed and given me the support i've needed to successfully onboard during these interesting times. they also embodied the values and culture that were a key part of what attracted me to unfi. second, my early take is that there are significant opportunities to improve the way we serve existing and new customers, and the opportunity to partner with suppliers to bring customers the highest quality differentiated products and services that they want and need.
importantly, as the covid pandemic lingers, our operating environment remains challenging. from our suppliers to unfi, to our customers, we are all facing challenges making, moving and delivering products through our interdependent supply chains. my focus will continue to be learning the full extent of this business, and assisting our team as we manage through the challenges and execute our plans for the benefit of our incredible community of customers. in doing so, i'm confident that we will continue to find ways to help our customers create value, which will benefit all of our stakeholders.
the final point i'd make is, despite the challenges that we're managing, we have momentum in our business, and it is accelerating. and i believe our plans for the new fiscal year will carry that momentum forward. under the leadership of my predecessor, steve spinner, and our senior team, we delivered a solid fiscal 2021, and we expect this new fiscal year to be even better. we start fiscal '22 with less debt and an improved leverage ratio, and plans for further growth driven by a sincere focus on doing everything we can do to serve our customers.
john will go over the details of our fiscal '22 outlook shortly, and i'm genuinely excited for the year to come. let me now turn the call over to our president, chris testa, for his comments on our performance. chris.
chris testa -- president
thanks, sandy. and good morning, everyone. on today's call, i'll provide color on our fourth-quarter performance and commentary on how these results and our fuel the future strategy will help drive growth for unfi moving forward. we're pleased with our results this quarter and for fiscal 2021 in total.
sales for the full year came in about where we expected while adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps were both above our previous outlook. we believe our fourth-quarter results reflect the work underway as we begin to implement our fuel the future strategy. focusing on the fourth quarter, sales totaled slightly more than $6.7 billion. this was down slightly from last year's fourth quarter, as we are now cycling the months in calendar 2020, with the elevated levels of early covid-19 consumer demand.
anticipated sales decline in our retail, independent and chain channels, which are the largest [inaudible] a year ago, were partially offset by growth in the supernatural and other channels. on a sequential basis, our business is growing as sales in the fourth quarter increased about 1.6% from the third quarter. part of this, about 80 of the 160 basis point increase was the result of accelerating inflation within our business, which increased to approximately 2.4% in the fourth quarter. the remaining 80 basis points was the result of the underlying strength of our customers' retail business and our committed success with cross-selling, and the addition of new customers.
a meaningful portion of sequential increase came from our top 100 customers, where sales increased 2.2% from q3 to q4. the fourth quarter also included an incremental $80 million in cross-selling revenue. as customers continue to benefit from unfi's unmatched product variety, and the value only we can ask from consolidating purchases. in fiscal '21, over $700 million of our total revenue came from cross-selling that was made possible by the merger of our conventional and natural businesses.
selling more to existing customers represents a $38 billion addressable opportunity, and we believe is unfi's unique advantage. with over 18,000 unique customers representing over 30,000 locations, unfi has significant growth potential with customers we already service. new customers will also play an important role for our future growth, and our sales pipeline includes hundreds of opportunities to help us grow share within the $140 billion adjustable market opportunity, we [inaudible] the discussed. let's turn to the growth platforms we spoke to at our investor day under our [inaudible] the future pillar, mainly own brands, professional services, and fresh.
starting with our own brands business, our three-pronged strategy for growth is built around increasing penetration with our existing customers, bringing owned brands to new customers and channels that presently don't carry them, and introducing innovative items that meet the evolving needs of today's consumers. we're making progress across all three fronts as we're now selling our own brands' products to a nearly an additional 500 stores that were onboarded during fiscal '21. and we realized significant top-line growth on key brands like woodstock, tomorrow's and field day. we've also introduced about 100 new items to our portfolio products this year, and plan to introduce another 150 in fiscal '22, including more plant-based and functional ingredient skews.
this combination of larger customer base and relevant new product offerings is expected to be part of our growth in fiscal 2022. professional services remains another key differentiator for unfi. in fiscal 2021, our services business grew 12% and we're looking for our fiscal 2022 to be another year of double-digit growth. our optimism is based on customer feedback that our portfolio of services adds value to their businesses.
and a robust pipeline of opportunities that our sales organization is actively pursuing. in fiscal 2021, we introduced 17 new services, and we expect to launch similar number this coming year driven by current industry trends, as well as feedback from customers and what problems we can help them solve. two noteworthy services coming this year include an advanced retail pricing platform that will allow customers to manage gross margins across the entire store in more sophisticated ways than were previously available from any wholesaler. and an offering net tracks scanned data against product code dates, and provide the store real-time information on unsold products that may be going past their code dates and allows them to better manage inventory and reduce shrink.
finally is fresh, where we continue to invest in people, infrastructure, and technology to strengthen our foundation and the platform for future growth as consumer demand continues to be strong for products sold around the perimeter of the store. a bullish outlook includes growing produce sales at a rate several 100 basis points above total company growth rate. in addition to improving our infrastructure across the network, we've staffed many of our facilities with produce specialists that have a strong working knowledge of this category, which gives us further confidence in our ability to better support our customers and accelerate growth. we've also restructured our sourcing team to take full advantage of unfi's purchasing scale.
deeper relationships with growers are expected to improve our supply consistency to days out of the supply chain and ultimately improve product quality across the network and help drive sales. finally, our bakery daily category experienced double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. consumer demand has increased since the height of the pandemic and unfi is uniquely positioned with a broad portfolio of specialty items, including a majority of the skus we sell through our tony's fine foods portfolio. turning now to operations.
our fulfillment network is facing the same labor shortages, supply shortages, and ongoing pandemic challenges being felt throughout the u.s. supply chain. we continue to take innovative and meaningful steps to mitigate each of these headwinds, allowing us to provide the best possible service to our customers. starting with labor.
we have and will continue to modify distribution center associate wage groups as necessary to maintain competitive compensation programs. we're also taking steps beyond wage increases to focus on the work-life experience of our associates, including the implementation of new incentives, daily pay, enhanced health benefits, and flextime programs. these wage and lifestyle programs are part of our ongoing efforts to attract and retain talent. we have also refocused our entire organization on the recruiting and onboarding and training of new associates in our dcs, so we're prepared for the upcoming holiday season and future growth.
suppliers face many of the same challenges we see in our network. and the retailer community is growing fatigue with a limited assortments and increasing out-of-stocks across several key categories. these supply challenges caused our inbound supplier service levels to begin to deteriorate in the fourth quarter. to offset these challenges, we continue to proactively meet with our vendor partners to get our deserved share of supply and get in front of the upcoming holiday demand so we can provide the best possible experience for our customers.
safety and the well-being of our associates is our top priority. as a result, we did voluntarily and temporarily suspend full operations at our centralia, washington distribution center in the first week of august due to an increase of covid-19 cases at that facility. during the shutdown, we continue to service our customers to the greatest extent possible, despite increase costs, by leveraging contingency plans to meet essential customer needs and through moderating shipments, and shifting the volume to other distribution centers. while we do expect this voluntary temporary shutdown to be a headwind to our fiscal 2022 first-quarter financial results, the impact is incorporated into the full-year financial guidance that john will review with you shortly.
we continue to maintain our strong covid safety protocols that are in line or greater than cdc guidance, including mandatory mask-wearing, enhanced sanitation protocols, onsite vaccine clinics, and strict social distancing enforcement throughout our entire fulfillment network. now turning to retail, our [inaudible] banners had another solid quarter. the 6% decline in sales was largely the result of cycling last year's 21% year-over-year increase. putting the two-year spac at 15.2%, which is in line or ahead of many food retailers.
as you heard during our investor day, we are investing in our retail business to enhance the shopping experience for our consumers through efforts like an enhanced e-commerce platform, expanded delivery offerings, and improved data analytics and merchandising concepts. we're striving to make our stores more appealing and easier to shop. finally, we're proud to have been recently awarded a progressive grocer impact award in the category of sustainability in resource conservation. this award recognizes our ambitious goals and progress under the better for all platform, and is a great reflection of the strategic direction and outstanding efforts of our people.
we will be releasing our next esg report in early 2022. and we're excited to share all the great work being done at unfi to make our world, our communities and our people better. let me now turn the call over to john.
john howard -- chief financial officer
thank you chris, and good morning, everyone. on today's call, i will cover our fourth-quarter financial performance, balance sheet, capital structure, and outlook for next year, our fiscal 2022. as sandy and chris both said, we're very pleased with our operating performance this quarter and the finish we had to fiscal 2021. sales for the fourth quarter totaled $6.7 billion, slightly below last year given the prior comparisons chris mentioned, while adjusted ebitda of $201 million and adjusted eps of a $1.18 per share were both higher than last year, and contribute to our finishing above our fiscal 21 full-year outlook.
fourth-quarter gross margin rate increased seven basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter, driven by the benefits from our value path initiatives, partially offset by a higher year-over-year lifo charge. gross margin rate in our retail business was approximately flat to last year. fourth-quarter operating expense rate increased slightly compared to last year's fourth quarter, driven by higher employee-related costs, as well as $9 million in start-up costs, related to alan down that i mentioned on our last call. these two items were partially offset by lower levels of pandemic-related costs and incentive compensation expense, as well as the benefits from value path on our ongoing operating expense.
we're pleased with the fourth quarter's adjusted ebitda rate of 3% of net sales for the second-highest quarterly rate during the last three years. we also experienced leverage in our p&l for fiscal 2021 as we increased adjusted ebitda by nearly 11% on a 1.5% sales increase. our gaap earnings per share totaled $0.69, which included $0.49 in net after-tax charges. our adjusted eps for the fourth quarter totaled a $1.18 per share, further demonstrating our p&l leverage.
as you know, unfi contributes to various multi-employer pension plans across our wholesale and retail operations. across these plans, we look for opportunities to maintain benefits for our associates, while also reducing risks around retirement benefit obligations. during the fourth quarter, we elected to withdraw from three multi-employer retail pension plans, covering certain associates in our club banner. these defined benefit plans have been replaced with defined contribution plans going forward.
this action resulted in a $63 million pension withdrawal charge in the fourth quarter, which is recorded in the operating expense line of our p&l. to satisfy our withdrawal liability, we'll make cumulative annual [inaudible] after-tax cash payments of $3 million, which will have a nominal impact on our annual free cash flow. across our multi-employer pension plans, we will continue to look for opportunities to maintain benefits for our associates, while also reducing risks around future retirement benefit obligations. we may have another transaction before the end of the calendar year, and we will consider additional transactions that further decouple our retail operations from its remaining net plans.
turning to the balance sheet. we have [inaudible] $9 billion, and total liquidity of over $1.3 billion. a combination of cash provided by operations and asset sale proceeds led to a $317 million reduction in our net debt level compared to the end of fiscal 2020, and a nearly $1.1 billion reduction since the supervalu acquisition. our lower net debt balance in q4 operating performance drove our leverage down to 3.1 times, an improvement from 3.9 times leverage at the end of fiscal 2020.
and these figures include a $310 million capital investment back into our business, including nearly $80 million toward the allentown distribution center, as well as additional investments across the business to enable growth, deliver automation, maintain our physical assets and help us deliver synergies and cost savings, all with the goal of better serving our customers. let's turn to our outlook for fiscal 2022. today's operating backdrop continues to evolve and change quickly, so our guidance for fiscal 2022 reflects our current expectations. starting with net sales, we expect fiscal 2022's full-year net sales to be in the range of 27.8 to $28.3 billion, which represents more than a $1 billion increase over fiscal 2021, or about 4% at the midpoint.
net new business, including the phase on-boarding of new business in the northeast, and with our largest customer, as well as continued cross-selling and new customer wins are expected to contribute 4% to 5% of growth. we're also [inaudible] percentage points. [inaudible] i expected modest contraction in overall industry growth. we're expecting adjusted ebitda for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of $760 million to $790 million, also about a 4% increase at the midpoint.
from a puts-and-takes perspective, fiscal 2022 will benefit from the higher level of sales and the continued benefits from our value path initiative, net of dollars reinvested in the business. temporary year-over-year headwinds, including [inaudible] fiscal 2021 as associates are assumed to make more frequent business to the healthcare providers. the ending of our transition services agreement will save a lot and added rent expense from the strategic value-maximizing sale-leaseback at our riverside california distribution center, where we've exercised an option to monetize that asset. these costs as we transition from fiscal '21 to fiscal '22 are all included in our outlook and at this point, we don't foresee items of a similar magnitude [inaudible] or '24.
adjusted [inaudible] eps is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share, an increase of about 4% at [inaudible] for an increase in adjusted ebitda [inaudible] tax rate of approximately 26%. it also includes lower net non-cash pension income based on the improved funded [inaudible] retirement plans, which are now slightly overfunded on a net basis compared to last year's $294 million net underfunded position. this favorable change in the funded status has allowed us to further de-risk these liabilities by migrating to a more conservative asset allocation, which in turn leads to lower assumed return on assets. the year-over-year decrease in non-cash earnings per share.
given the cadence of onboarding new business, and the timing of the temporary voluntary should [inaudible] the growth to be weighted to the back half [inaudible] after fiscal 2022. the timing and impact of these items [inaudible] for the current fiscal year [inaudible] to deliver the sales, adjusted ebitda, and adjusted eps targets i've outlined for you today. we expect to reduce net [inaudible] $150 million in fiscal [inaudible] concludes the investment we expect to make in the working capital to support our new [inaudible] business. the use of cash in fiscal 2022, unlike fiscal 2021, when we received an overall [inaudible] net refund, driven by provisions within the cares act, which required us to utilize prior-year net operating losses at a 35% rate.
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million, which excludes the amount for the riverside sale-leaseback transaction, which will be [inaudible] to be less than three times by the end of the fiscal '22 driven by higher adjusted ebitda and further debt reduction, including applying the proceeds of our riverside monetization to reducing debt. the fundamental growth drivers we outlined in june remain unchanged and we believe that they will be the catalyst that delivers the fiscal 2024 targets provided at investor day. except for the centralia temporary closure, all of the fiscal '22 headwinds i spoke to were considered when we established our fiscal 2024 [inaudible] figures provided at investor day. therefore, we can continue to feel confident in our ability to meet or exceed those targets.
increasing value for our shareholders remains a priority and focus of unfi. we remain confident in our ability to grow our [inaudible] cash flow. operator, we're now ready to take questions.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question is from the line of john heinbockel from guggenheim.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
thank you, guys. let me start with, do you have any way of telling relative allocation and fill rates versus various competitors and retailers, right? because you would think you should have a better allocation than smaller distributors and smaller retailers. do you have a sense of that? and then can that drive new customer acquisition right in the short run here, because you have product and others don't or is that too optimistic?
chris testa -- president
yes. hey, john, it's chris. so it's impossible for us to tell what's going on with cpg allocation of products. what we do is we work with them every day to make sure that we're securing our fair share of supply.
and given our scale and given that we're the top one, two, three customer for many of the cpgs, we get more product, right, on a straight allocation basis. so that is what the cpgs are telling us. as far as acquisition of new customers, that is an attractive selling point, in addition to since covid hit almost 20 months ago, it stressed the supply chain. and what we have found is that, our customers are looking for alternatives in this stressed environment.
and what we found is unfi is an attractive alternative, not only because of the product availability that you asked about, but also just the consistency and the size and the scale of the network. so that's been helpful for us to attract new customers.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
and if you think about the pipeline you referenced, right? so it's the biggest you've had. i don't know if that's a number of folks you're having conversations with or volume that they represent. but if you think about the composition of that, so maybe speak to that, but also the composition, large versus small, conventional versus more specialty or even maybe non-food retail, what does the composition look like?
chris testa -- president
sure. so first, to answer your question, it's the volume they represent. so that's how we're measuring that. look, we are tracking hundreds of opportunities.
and if you think about what unfi sells, with over 300 skus with a deep fresh portfolio, with the deep conventional portfolio, with the deep natural portfolio, brand services, there is really no single competitor out there. so the customers -- the potential customers in the pipeline are really ranged from the large national customers. they range from customers with captive distribution, looking for alternatives. there are also a lot in hundreds of local regional customers as well.
so it really is the range, john. and we still look at that $38 billion opportunity with existing customers as white space, as well as the $78 billion opportunity with new customers. so it's -- the pipeline represents a fair amount of both.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
and one last real quick one. the key food will get to the $1 billion run rate win. and i guess in the first quarter, what might key food have been running at? $100 million plus or something like that?
chris testa -- president
so we don't disclose how much we do with each customer, but we won't realize the full volume of the key food until fiscal 2023. it has ramped up throughout the year, but we won't get the full volume until 12 months next year.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. thank you.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
sure.
operator
your next question is from the line of scott mushkin with r5 capital.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my call. great work given the environment. so i guess that's the first thing i wanted to ask about is, obviously, it's really hard right now operating.
we saw in the campbell's call, and they were talking about how difficult to run some of those plants. so i was wondering if you guys could talk about what your expectation is. i know there's a lot of pressure points in the quarter you just reported. how are you thinking about the next couple of quarters as far as availability of labor, just the challenge of running your network? is it going to lessen or is it going to remain the same?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
yes, scott, this is sandy. i think our outlook is essentially realistic. it's very hard to predict what's around the next corner. as chris said in his remarks, we've made some improvements in terms of our net openings in our fulfillment system, and we're doing that by intensifying our recruiting, but also working on simplifying the associate experience as well.
and we talk to suppliers, they continue to believe that they're going to have constraints around their supply environment. and so our general expectation is that we're going to have to stay agile. we're going to have to stay customer-focused and that the environment will continue to be difficult.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
and staffing levels are ok right now. i'm just looking at the cold cases are going through the roof. i mean are you able to staff?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
eric, why don't you take that?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
yes, scott, we are and we're actively enforcing our protocols around covid, whether it's mask wearing, social distancing. and we continue -- we've offered incentives for vaccinations. we're encouraging and educating our staff around the benefits of vaccinations. and as chris referenced, we closed our headcount gap by 30%, and we're continuing to work on that.
and associate-friendly programs like flex shift is really starting to take hold. we're seeing almost 4% of our total hours with those associates, and it's growing every week. so we are focused on it. we're going to stay focused on it and work our way through it.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
then my follow-up is much more of a longer-term question. i mean, i know the thought process is we're going to do more consolidation of the distribution networks. i don't think you mentioned it, maybe i missed it, but i was wondering where we are in that process? like how are you guys are thinking maybe out the next couple of years on that item?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
yes. scott, i'll take this again. it's eric. we are actively looking at that, but we are focused on meeting our capacity needs for the here and now.
so we have looked at expansions that we have underway, obviously, with allentown coming online and adding 1.3 million square feet to service the new york market, and we continue to invest -- strategically invest in automation. we've got two new automated systems on the west coast that we've talked about in richfield and riverside. we're expanding our carlyle, pa automation system, and we're looking at other strategic expansions around the network. so i think this is very much a dynamic situation based on our growth and meeting the pipeline that chris referenced, making sure that we can continue to stay flexible and agile as the business comes on.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
that's perfect, guys. thanks very much. appreciate it.
operator
your next question is from william reuter with bank of america.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning. on the allentown distribution center, have you talked about how much of that capacity is going to be used by key foods? and you've been hoping to get additional customers in the new york metro area. how has that process gone so far?
chris testa -- president
yes. so we are focused on that start-up. any start-up that you have for any warehouse, you want to build gradually and work out the kinks. as i said, we've had some expected challenges there, but we're really proud of the progress.
and we're just focused on servicing the business we have there. and we will  we do plan to continue to add to serve that very attractive in dense marketplace in the near term.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then in the prepared remarks, you talked about limited product availability and how that's reducing promotions. can you talk a little bit about how the balance of this -- i guess, how this is negatively impacting margins versus the positive of inflation?
chris testa -- president
yes. so i'll say this is, first off, the fill rate, we're still growing over $300 million in the quarter year over year and the fill rate was only up slightly. so there's plenty of product and supply out there. it just might not have the skus and everything that our customers want because of the supply restriction.
so we're selling a lot of products. we're doing everything we can to keep our customer shelves filled. regarding promo, we are seeing it come back as far as activity. our merchandising team is working closely with suppliers to make sure that we're getting the best promos for our customers, doing everything to mitigate price increases.
and we did see a year-over-year increase in promo activity. the fill rate and less new skus is a headwind. but overall, we're actually  our promo expectations were in line with what we thought was going to happen for the quarter.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then lastly, if i could just sneak one in. with regard to the one facility that was shut down in august, it's now fully operational. are there any facilities that are getting levels of covid transmission that you're concerned you may have to shut them down again?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
bill, this is eric. no, we have not seen that. and again, i'd reinforce the protocols that we have in place. we've been maintaining mask wearing in all facilities, social distancing.
we continue to offer incentives for vaccinations and encourage our associates to get vaccinated. so we're monitoring. we have a really robust program in place to monitor and we're continuing to just see the normal trends across the country. so nothing alarming that we would communicate.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks a lot and good luck.
operator
next question is from bill kirk with mkm partners.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
good morning, everyone. more so than normal, it sounds like customers ordered early for the holidays and maybe expanded their inventories. so i guess how big of a benefit was that, or how abnormal was that inventory load relative to other like periods? and does it reverse out here in later in 2q? do their inventories come back down at your customers?
chris testa -- president
bill, this is chris. i think you're talking about for the november and thanksgiving season and the december season. so this is always  this quarter, q2 that we're in right now, always represents our highest inventory build because of the inventory  sorry, because of the holidays. so it's in line with what we've seen for prior years.
nothing dramatically lower, nothing dramatically bigger. as far as the order early, i mean, we started talking about thanksgiving in july. and that was just to work really closely with our customers and our suppliers to make sure we had those high-demand items on their shelves. so we feel pretty good about our performance in thanksgiving.
there's always opportunities to do better and we're focused on the december holidays right now.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
and kind of as a follow-up. did you see retailers who normally rely on their own captive distribution? did you see them lean on your services more in the period? and if they were, because maybe they were having some of their own supply chain restrictions, but if they leaned on you more, do they stay, or do they go back to their normal sourcing systems?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
bill, this is sandy. i'm going to make a strategic point, and then i'll turn it over to chris to answer your question. i think one of the things we've been paying attention to is making sure that we take care of our customers that exist while we think about growing new customers. as chris said, the pipeline is very rich and robust of all types of customers, and you described that.
but what matters to us every day is that the customers who trusted us before will get the best possible service. and then we add customers, as we have the capability and capacity to do it. and so chris, you can get into the detail. but i think the point i want to reinforce is, how loyal we are to the customers who've been loyal to us.
chris testa -- president
yes. just to add to what sandy said, we have not seen a retraction from that new business gains from captive customers. that is actually, if anything, it's gone the opposite direction.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. thank you, everyone.

the next question is from eric larson with seaport research.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yes. thanks, everyone. thanks for the question. so i would like to dig a little bit more, maybe just a question for chris, into the promotional environment.
obviously, the manufacturers are taking prices up aggressively, looks like they might even need another round due to higher costs. so traditionally, that's been a good profit center for you as they increase their promotional discount rates during promotional periods. so has that kicked in fully yet here, chris? or do you still expect increased benefits going forward on that?
chris testa -- president
so i will say that it has not kicked in fully. and although we are getting those promotions, to your point, that behavior is staying consistent. and what's preventing it from fully kicking in is the product supply, right? so i mean if you think about promotions, promotions are based on transactions and number of transactions. and when you have less skus, when you're on allocation, when you're not launching new product, those transaction levels are lower.
the promotions are there, the programs are there, but i would -- to your question directly about fully kicking in, no, i don't think it has. i think there's been some headwinds because of the product availability issues that we're having.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. thanks. and a little bit more detail kind of on fill rates. obviously, product availability as part of it has -- any other part of the supply chain been an issue either? i think you mentioned a little bit about transportation.
but is it like 90% just product availability on fill rates, or are there other constraints in your supply chain that are restricting that fill rate completion?
chris testa -- president
no. our fill rate is a reflection of our inbound fill rate from our suppliers. and there's no surprises there. it is labor, it's availability, transportation, it's raw materials, it's all the macro environment factors that you've been hearing about and actually we spoke at in the last call.
so there's really nothing unique to our environment. our supply chain that's hindering fill rate, it's really about inbound.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
got it. ok. and then my final question, i think, is for john. john, i think you talked a little bit about this at year-end.
your $300 million of capex spending, i think if i recall correctly that, that is still a little bit of an elevated spending rate for this upcoming year. is that the case, or is $300 million more of kind of what we should expect going forward?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yes. what we've said -- i appreciate the question, eric. and what we've talked about on that is being roughly around that 1% of sales, and we put in for our 2022 guidance the $300 million. and just as a reminder, as i said in my script, that's excluding the financial reporting aspect related to how we're going to monetize riverside, because it will give you the impression that's driving that up much higher.
but that $300 million, we're still targeting that $300 million of cash capex for fy 2022. we haven't brought that down yet. we're seeing some similar supply chain challenges on some of the projects. but we're continuing to keep that $300 million out there and doing everything we can to make those investments line up with our customer focus.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. thank you, everyone.

[operator instructions] our next question is from the line of greg badishkanian with wolfe research.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. this is spencer hanus on for greg. can you talk about your expectations for inflation for the full year? should we expect the 1q run rate of two and a half to 3% to be a good proxy for the full year? and then how much of a sales headwind were the lower fill rates in the quarter? and just how does that flow into the full year guidance that you should see a really significant benefit from the higher run rate inflation?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
so, spencer, i'll take the first part of that as it relates to the inflation. as i mentioned, we did raise our view on that from the 100 bps. and that 250 to 300 bps is how we're thinking about certainly in the near-term. but as i mentioned, there's also some of this corresponding offsets related to the supply chain and other challenges that we're seeing that will keep that sales in line with where we provided our original guidance.
chris testa -- president
and then just as far as the fill rate impact on sales, so i'll say this, look, fill rate was up slightly year over year, and sales were up over four and a half percent. so we have products, and that we work with our customers to sell when we don't have the products, exact products they want, right? so namely, replacing in-stock skus from our brand portfolio, which typically has a 5% to 10% more favorable fill rate than national brands. we look for alternatives for our products that are going to be in stock longer term. so we're generating the sales for those out-of-stock and constricted items.
the exact headwinds is -- i can't put a number on that. i don't think anybody can because we work so hard with our customers to control the controllables, right, to find the products, to keep their sales full and make sure that we're getting the revenue from whatever we have in our warehouses.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then just a follow-up on the dc consolidation question. do you still think that the plan laid out by steve make strategic sense? and how long would you expect the consolidation plans to be pushed out? is it six months, 12 months, 18 months? any color there would be helpful.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
i don't think, spencer, we would put a time frame on it as we're trying to stay agile here and leverage our capacity to service the customers that we have and that we're acquiring. so i think that this is very much a dynamic situation, and we're going to continue to leverage our building. and as we add new customers that profile will really change. so i think more to come on that as we move forward.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from the line of peter saleh with btig.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. congrats on the quarter. i just wanted to come back to the conversation around labor and the changes you guys have made to the employee, i guess, compensation.
i think you guys mentioned there was a 30% reduction in  i think it's the gaap versus headcount gap that you guys are expecting. maybe can you elaborate there? and then just  have you seen any changes in your turnover rates? have those come down as you've made changes to the compensation structure? thank you.
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
yes. peter, this is eric. the 30% that we referenced is the gap of associates we need to service our business versus what we had. so we closed that gap by 30% by doing a variety of things, all of which focused on the associate experience, the lifestyle inside the buildings.
we're striving after work-life balance, reducing over time, increasing flexibility. so it's really not just about wages that we've adjusted. we're going after more than that. and other things like early wage access is an innovative program that we've put in throughout the network.
we revised our success share plan for inside the dc. and we've also modified our health benefit options to all associates. so this is more than just wages and we're optimistic on what we're seeing. and again, this is a focus for us moving forward through this challenging time.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you for that. and then just lastly on the leverage. i know it ticked up a little bit here.
can we expect  or what's the timing you guys anticipate to get to call that two and a half times leverage? can we anticipate that you might get there by the end of fy 2022, or is this more of a sometime in '23 target?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
yes. so what we've put out there, peter, is we talked about getting to the two to two and a half range as part of our investor day, which would be the end of fy 2024 for us. and certainly, we'll be doing it on a gradual basis. we're forecasting being in below 3x at the end of this fiscal year.
and we're anticipating, at this point, continuing that trend to get to that two to two and a half range by the end of fy 2024.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
thank you very much.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
appreciate the question.
steve bloomquist -- vice president, investor relations
i think we've answered all the questions in the queue. so i guess we had one more come in. why don't you bring that in for us?
operator
and the next question is from edward kelly with wells fargo.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes, hi guys. good morning. could you just talk a little bit about the rate of labor inflation that you are currently seeing and expect going forward, both from like a driver perspective and warehouse perspective? foodservice has been ramping, hiring. wondering what's been happening with sort of market pressure there and your expectations around that?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
yes. this is eric. i'm not sure i'd put a number to it. but as chris referenced in his script, we've made market adjustments, and we'll continue to make market adjustments as things continue to evolve here.
and as far as drivers, specifically, we've put different programs in place for our drivers, whether they're premiums or sign-on bonuses. and we feel very confident with our associate profile here on drivers that we offer a different experience than other players in the market, and we're going continue to leverage that as we move forward.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
ed, this is sandy. i think what i'd add to that is that market competitive is the key, and then where we're trying to differentiate is through the different lifestyle and employee-friendly programs. there's a whole lot of effort going on across eric's organization to get closer to our team and to make unfi a better place to work. and through that, to be able to take market competitive investments, which is all about customer capability, but leverage it to get the most value possible out of every dollar spent.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and then can you just -- i don't know, is there any update on retail and the strategic outlook for that business? and how it fits within unfi over the long term?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yes. no, happy to answer that. this is john. like we talked about at investor day, we are going to continue to optimize retail.
we've got an outstanding leadership team that is in place there, spearheaded by mike stigers. and he -- that function that, that segment has been performing outstanding, both the cub banner in the minneapolis market as well as the shoppers banners on the east coast. and our approach to that is that, can continue to optimize, which means we're going to run, we're going to invest, we're going to grow, and we're going to do all the things that you would expect us to do with an asset that we own. and at the same time, what that means is, if an opportunity presents itself to monetize it at an appropriate value, we're happy to consider it.
but under the leadership that we have and the results that they're producing, we're going to continue to optimize and grow it.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
yes. and it's sandy, again. what i'd also add is it's a great place for us to learn. our retail leadership team gives us really direct feedback about what they need and what programs, services, brands and other things we can do to serve them better.
and that visibility is very helpful to us.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and then, just lastly for you. related to the change, you mentioned change with captive distribution and making inroads there. can you just provide a bit more color on that? how much of that is just people are looking for product right now versus you building a more sustained relationship in that area?
chris testa -- president
ed, it's chris. i think it's more than just product supply, i think, there's retailers with captive distribution that are looking long term and considering their own capital investment versus leveraging unfi's network. and given the scale of our network, we can provide an attractive option to them rather than investing on their own. and i think generally, that's where it's coming from.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
and i think also, this is sandy. serving captive retailer is not new. i mean, it could be category-specific natural products, different kinds of items that they want to have, innovation, etc. and so it's a growing part of the business, but it's not a new part of the business.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
chris testa -- president
ok. thank you, guys, for joining us today and for joining us this morning. i hope you've heard and take away from today's call that unfi is growing and improving within a challenging and unpredictable environment by steadfastly focusing on what we need to do to make our customers successful. as i said on the last call, our job is to help our customers and suppliers compete, grow, serve their customers and add value to their businesses across our network.
our success depends on repeating this day in and day out, and i'm pleased with how well we're doing, while being challenged by significant opportunities for ongoing improvement. for our customers, we thank you for your continued partnership and the business we do together. and for our suppliers and unfi associates listening today, our thanks to each of you for everything that you do for our business, our customers, our communities and each other. and for our shareholders, thank you for the trust you put in us through your continued investment in unfi.

good day, and for standing by. welcome to the unfi fiscal 2022 first quarter earnings call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, steve bloomquist, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
steve bloomquist -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us on unfi's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. by now you should have received a copy of the earnings release issued this morning. the press release, webcast and a supplemental slide deck are available under the investors section of the company's website at www.unfi.com under the events tab.
joining me for today's call are sandy douglas, our chief executive officer; john howard, our chief financial officer; chris testa, president of unfi; and eric dorne, our chief operating officer. sandy, chris and john will provide a business update. after which, we'll take your questions. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that comments made by management during today's call may contain forward-looking statements.
these forward-looking statements include plans, expectations, estimates and projections that might involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks are discussed in the company's earnings release and sec filings. actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements. and lastly, i'd like to point out that during today's call, management will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures.
definitions and reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures are included in our press release. i'll now turn the call over to sandy. 
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
thanks, steve. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fiscal 2022 first quarter earnings call. as you saw in this morning's press release, we delivered first quarter results through a time of continued challenges across the industry, including ongoing supply chain difficulties, declining fill rates and rising inflation. unfi is performing through this unpredictable environment by steadfastly focusing on what we need to do to make our customers successful, which will continue to be our core operating objective.
tomorrow, as i cross the four month mark at unfi, i continue to invest a significant amount of my time meeting with our customers with the simple goal of learning as much as i can about their business, what differentiates their offering in the marketplace, what are their biggest opportunities and pain points and what can we do to add value to their operations. making customers stronger is a core tenet of unfi's mission statement, and i have a genuine passion for helping food retailers succeed. and i'm committed to doing everything possible to bring solutions that accomplish this. our teams regularly meet with customers to introduce new items, to plan and coordinate promotions and to look forward to the next major selling event.
customers were encouraged to order early for this year's november-december holiday season and build their inventories wherever possible. we also make sure they know about the many services that unfi offers to lower their cost structure, increase sales and simplify their operations. we've received positive feedback from our customers on the work that we did together around thanksgiving. and now we're laser-focused on doing the best possible job to meet their needs as we move through the upcoming holidays.
further, i've initiated conversations with several of our larger suppliers, many of whom i've known for quite some time. having been on the supplier side of the industry for 30 years, i know how important it is to partner across the supply chain to transparently share information and identify opportunities to increase distribution and maximize sales. unfi's b2b2c business model puts us in a unique position to help suppliers understand and access our diverse and vibrant retail customers and their 30,000 retail locations. to more effectively bring together suppliers and customers, we're developing unique new programs that provide better and deeper insights into unfi's diverse retailer base so that unfi, our suppliers and our customers can collectively work together in partnership to create more and more value together.
i've also enjoyed meeting many of our frontline sales and supply chain associates in sales meetings and in our distribution centers. this has given me the opportunity to hear firsthand what's on their minds, what issues are most important to them and how we can continue to increase engagement in meaningful ways. a common theme during these visits is how proud our associates are to be part of the important role that unfi plays in keeping the food supply chain flowing. i also touched upon unfi's culture on our last call, which i now had more exposure to.
we're proud of the work that we've done around esg topics and our better for all mission of making the world a better place, not just for one but for all. and it's core to who we are as a company. from our top priority of associate safety to an ongoing commitment toward diversity and inclusion to ambitious climate and environmental goals, to name just a few, unfi's core value remains doing the right thing every day. we look forward to sharing our 2021 esg report with all of you in early calendar 2022.
overall, we're encouraged with the first quarter and the start to fiscal 2022. despite a difficult backdrop, which isn't likely to change in the short term, the momentum that i spoke about on the last call is continuing. and we expect to carry forward the momentum for the balance of the fiscal year. our fuel the future strategy is customer-focused, growth-oriented and the blueprint for what will drive unfi for the foreseeable future.
our energy is dedicated to every element of customer support to make sure we do the best job possible taking care of our customers in a complicated environment. having said that, i also find it encouraging that our associates across the board are never satisfied. they're continually looking for how we can get better for our customers and our suppliers in the days, weeks and months ahead. let me now turn the call over to our president, chris testa, for his comments on our performance.
chris?
chris testa -- president
thanks, sandy, and good morning, everyone. on today's call, i'll provide further color on key drivers behind unfi's q1 results and future growth, the trends that are impacting our industry and some insights on unfi's operating environment. let's start with our results for the quarter, where consolidated sales came in at $7 billion, a 4.7% increase over last year's q1 and nearly a 4% sequential increase from the fourth quarter. it's worth noting that this is only the second time in the company's history that revenue totaled $7 billion in a single quarter.
all three major sales channels experienced year-over-year growth, which was driven by two primary factors: new business wins and inflation. modest market contraction and continued supply chain challenges were also partial offsets to these favorable sales drivers. our strong supernatural sales were driven by winning new categories and skus with our largest customer, which reflects the strength of our relationship and the value we bring to their business. independent sales channel growth was driven largely by new sales we realized from our allentown, pennsylvania facility, which began serving independents in the new york metro area in q1.
this new dc has been the largest distribution center start-up in unfi's history, and its run rate volume has quickly made it a top 15 warehouse in terms of revenue. as you'd anticipate, we've had some learnings along the way, but we are pleased with our progress and the greater opportunity to pursue enhanced customer service to existing customers and new customer growth in the new york metro market. both in the supernatural and independent new business wins have been exceeding volume expectations, and we expect continued strong performance through the balance of this fiscal year. our sales team also remains focused on cross-selling, and we generated over $60 million of incremental cross-selling revenue in the quarter.
the majority of the incremental cross-selling revenue occurred in our chains channel, where we have expanded the categories we sell to these large retailers by offering the benefits of consolidating their purchases with unfi. this includes retailers who operate their own captive distribution networks. our first quarter cross-selling gains kept us on track to deliver the $1 billion cumulative cross-selling revenue target by the end of this fiscal year. across all channels, our top 100 customers realized year-over-year revenue gains of 6.7%, driven by expanding the categories we service with our existing customer base and new business initiatives.
our growth platforms that we previously outlined in our fuel the future strategy also expanded in q1. our fresh sales team has been working closely with our existing customers to add meat, produce and bakery deli items in the all-important perimeter of the store. in addition to the fresh categories we're onboarding in supernatural, we'll now be distributing produce to another large national customer as a result of our expansive dc footprint and category expertise. and every week, we're gaining shelf space with fresh categories at a regional level.
our own brands business continues to roll out new items and push for additional points of distribution with the 30,000 customer outlets unfi currently services. our brand portfolio of over 5,000 skus allows us to pivot quickly and tap into emerging consumer trends. accordingly, our revenue from natural and organic brands increased over 6% in the quarter as consumers seek products with these clean label attributes. we've also seen traction with a new save everyday pricing program for our value items that are positioned to be attractive, affordable alternatives to national brands.
finally, on the professional services side, we had a strong quarter from retailers seeking solutions to lower their operating costs or expand revenue beyond retail and groceries. we're seeing a 15% increase in the number of remodels being done by our customers compared to last year as they look to reinvest in their businesses. our coin cloud offering, which enables our customers to bring cryptocurrency to their shoppers, continues to gain traction. we've now placed nearly 500 machines in customer stores and are scheduled for another 200 in the coming months.
regarding inflation, we saw inflation impact our wholesale net sales by two and a half to 3%, net of volume and mix changes. due to the cost-plus nature of the majority of our pricing agreements, inflation is typically a positive driver of top-line revenue and margin gains. for q1, our growth can be looked at as roughly half coming from new business wins, net of expected market contraction, and half coming from inflation. at least for the next several months, we don't see inflation easing.
our procurement and merchandising teams are working closely with our suppliers to offset some of these price hikes with increased promotional activity to help our customers manage through this period. many of the underlying drivers of this inflation, ranging from commodity shortages to labor shortages to limited transportation are also adversely impacting unfi fill rates. after many months of steady improvement, we, like the broader industry, have seen supplier inbound fill rates deteriorate. simply put, lower fill rates adversely impact our customers who may not receive everything they order and rely on unfi to carry a broad assortment of skus that go beyond just the top sellers.
at the same time, limited product availability typically reduces vendor new item launches and promotional spend as suppliers aren't likely to promote products where supply levels are scarce. to do the best job we can for our customers, we continue to diligently work with our suppliers to find and source as much product as possible and to recommend alternative solutions so our customers can present a complete offering on their shelves. these alternatives include actions like substituting own brands where national brand availability is low, updating planograms to focus on items with higher anticipated in-stock positions and daily contact with suppliers in an effort to make sure unfi receives its fair share of product and has the critical insight of what's to come so we can plan accordingly. for the most part, we were successful in helping our customers navigate through fill rate challenges during thanksgiving, and we are now focused on the december holiday season.
we believe we are well positioned from an inventory perspective and have been planning with our customers to secure holiday-focused items well in advance. shifting to operations. i'm pleased to report that our centralia facility that experienced a temporary voluntary shutdown in august due to late summer rise in covid cases is fully operational. we incurred some higher operational costs during the recovery period as we did everything possible to leverage the scale of our network to continue to service impacted customers, including temporarily shifting volume to neighboring dcs.
broadly speaking, unfi is not immune to the challenges facing today's labor market, but we are actively managing our way through these difficult times with innovative employee programs designed to attract and retain frontline workers. we have made significant investments in wages and are focusing our recruiting efforts on attracting associates into our dcs. investments in programs like flex shift and early access, which is a program that allows dc employees to receive pay earlier than traditional weekly paychecks, are helping us attract and retain more employees. these efforts are paying off and have led to a 30% reduction in open headcount in our warehouse operations compared to year-end.
we're still not where we need to be, but these programs and others are designed to address worker concerns and lifestyle needs. they are also expected to contribute to long-lasting associate retainment and consistent performance for our customers. finally, we're encouraged by the performance of our retail stores, as sales were down only slightly against a very strong comparison in fiscal 2021's first quarter when sales increased by more than 15%. on a two-year stack basis, retail sales increased 14.7%.
operationally, we introduced enhancements to our e-commerce and delivery platforms at cub to better meet the needs of our customers. online orders at cub now allow customers to use their my cub rewards card to gain access to exclusive promotions and digital coupons, and all orders are shopped locally by a dedicated team of cub associates. this is another great example of adapting our business model to the changing needs of today's consumer so we can serve them in the best way possible. although we expect supply chain challenges to continue, we also believe that strong food and home trends and inflation will help offset some of these headwinds.
against that backdrop, as sandy said, our energy is focused on making sure we are fully resourced toward customer support as we can be. while there are challenges, we're focused on implementing solutions to minimize supply chain disruptions and delivering for our customers. we also continue to build our pipeline, with customers looking to consolidate purchases with unfi or potential new customers looking to leverage our scale to provide consistent service in these volatile times. our new customer pipeline is more robust than any time in my 12 years here at unfi, and we're optimistic about our prospects.
we are pleased with our performance this quarter and optimistic about the balance of fiscal 2022. the environment has been challenging and will likely remain that way, at least in the near term, but we're confident in our ability to make our customers stronger through all that unfi can offer them. now, let me turn the call over to john.
john howard -- chief financial officer
thank you, chris, and good morning, everyone. on today's call, i'll cover our first quarter financial performance, balance sheet, capital structure and comments on our fiscal 2022 outlook. as sandy and chris both said, we're encouraged by our operating performance this quarter and the start to fiscal 2022. sales for the first quarter totaled $7 billion, a 4.7% increase compared to last year's q1.
adjusted ebitda increased nearly 19% from $159 million to $189 million. first quarter gross margin rate increased 38 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. our wholesale margin rate was impacted by this quarter's elevated inflation as well as the continued benefits from our valuepath initiatives. first quarter operating expense rate declined 20 basis points compared to last year, driven by the favorable leverage from higher sales and lower year-over-year costs when comparing last year's cost related to the consolidation in the pacific northwest against this year's start-up costs for our dc supporting the new york metro area.
these were partially offset by higher operating costs in our supply chain, including transportation costs, part of which came in support of our customers during the temporary and voluntary closure of our centralia, washington distribution center the first week of the quarter, as well as investments in adding and retaining labor to better service our customers. as we've stated before, one of our goals is to grow adjusted ebitda faster than sales. and this quarter's 19% growth in adjusted ebitda on a 4.7% increase in sales exemplified just that and translated to a 32-basis-point year-over-year expansion in our adjusted ebitda margin. our gaap earnings per share totaled $1.25, which included $0.28 in net favorable items.
this includes our gaap tax rate, which benefited from employee stock award vestings as well as the release of various tax reserves. our adjusted eps for the quarter totaled $0.97 per share compared to $0.51 last year, an increase of 90%, further demonstrating our p&l leverage. turning to the balance sheet. we finished the quarter with total outstanding net debt of $2.48 billion, a $194 million increase compared to year-end.
this reflects our customary first quarter investment in working capital as we add inventory going into the holiday selling season in support of our customers as well as the addition of inventory into our newest distribution center. the expected seasonal increase in working capital should convert to a source of cash in the second quarter. as expected, our net debt-to-adjusted ebitda leverage ratio increased slightly compared to the end of fiscal 2021 to 3.2 times as the higher trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda was more than offset by higher net debt balance driven by seasonal working capital increases. we still expect full year adjusted ebitda growth and a lower year-over-year debt level to push our adjusted ebitda leverage ratio below three times by year-end.
late in the quarter, both moody's and s&p upgraded our corporate family credit ratings as well as the ratings on our secured term loan and unsecured bonds. we subsequently repriced our term loan at a rate of libor plus 3.25%, which is 25 basis points lower than the previous rate. simultaneously, with the repricing, we drew $150 million under our abl facility and made a prepayment on the term loan, reducing its outstanding balance from $994 million at quarter end to $844 million. these two actions combined are expected to save unfi nearly $6 million in annual cash interest expense.
let's turn to our outlook for fiscal 2022. we are reaffirming our full year outlook for net sales, which we continue to expect to be in the range of $27.8 billion to $28.3 billion. our outlook for adjusted ebitda remains unchanged with a range of $760 million to $790 million. and finally, our outlook for adjusted eps is also unchanged and expected to finish between $3.90 and $4.20 per share.
we now believe that inflation will be above the 1% level we provided on our last call but that more prolonged challenges across the supply chain will offset potential sales impacts. our base measure of inflation is the increase to our landed cost of goods, which was approximately 4% for the quarter. however, we believe the inflation impact to our net sales, as chris discussed, was approximately two and a half to 3% when we factor in changes in consumer buying habits, including mix shifts in certain fresh categories. although our sales were impacted by inflation, there are offsets in our p&l that include a higher lifo charge and an increase in certain operating expenses.
our outlook for debt reduction remains unchanged at $100 million to $150 million, as does our expectation for capital expenditures of approximately $300 million, which, as a reminder, excludes the amount for the riverside purchase and sale leaseback transaction, which we expect to occur in the second half of the fiscal year. as you heard, today's operating backdrop remains challenging, yet we remain confident in our ability to serve our customers and deliver on our full year guidance. before we open up the call for questions, let me reiterate our commitment to increasing shareholder value and delivering the long-term targets presented at june's investor day. our business model and mission are built to succeed in normal times as well as those that we've characterized as more challenging.
as sandy stated earlier, our focus on helping our customers succeed remains at the center of everything we do and who we are as a company, and we appreciate your continued support. operator, we're now ready to take questions.

[operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of john heinbockel from guggenheim. your line is open.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey. first, guys. can you quantify a little bit or speak to the deterioration in fill rates? so what has been the magnitude of that slowdown? and do you think that we see a continued deterioration in the near term? and i guess, other than flexing scale, is there anything else you can do to mitigate that?
chris testa -- president of unfi
hey, john. this is chris. i'll start off with the answer on that one. so we saw improving fill rates right up until the end of the summer, right up until basically halfway through our fourth quarter last year, and then it's deteriorated sequentially since then.
we did not expect that. we definitely anticipated fill rates to improve. the impact of it is really, really hard to measure on net sales. i'll put it to you this way.
there are some cases where we're actually shipping more units of a particular sku than last year, but fill rate has been cut in half because demand is higher. and that's demand coming from new and existing customer base. so from a net sales impact, really tough to measure. i mean, you saw the sales growth over $5 billion -- i'm sorry, $500 million in the quarter, seven and a half percent.
so we're still growing sales despite the fill rate. where it is impactful is the customer experience, and we're doing everything we can to mitigate that with our merchandising teams to replace items with products that are in stock, including our own brands. and the second impact is on promotional dollars. although promotional dollars have increased year over year, and it's behind where we thought they would be, and that's because there just isn't the demand.
i'm sorry, there's just not the supply to put those promotional dollars against.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. and then maybe to follow that up, right, if you have fill rates that are better than the industry, that would help you on the pipeline side, right, attracting new customers. but is there a reticence on your part to bring in a lot of new customers in a fill rate environment like this for fear of sort of execution or service, nothing where you'd like it in the short run? or no, that's -- you think that's manageable?
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah, not at all. and what we're dealing with here is an industrywide thing. so the advantage that we have is for many suppliers, we're a top five customer to them. so from an allocation standpoint, we tend to get a fair share, a lot of that allocated inventory.
so no, it's an industrywide event, and it certainly does not at all prevent us from adding on new customers.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok, thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of bill kirk from mkm partners. your line is open.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
hey. good morning, everybody. so sandy, i think you called out the reliance on third-party labor in the quarter. from here, absenteeism is likely way down.
i think chris gave a stat on that. and then peak seasonality, peak demand seasonality, is also behind you. so i guess, my question would be with seasonality and absenteeism down, have you seen some cost improvements already in the first half of the third quarter here?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
well, obviously, we'll talk about the third quarter when the third quarter is over on our call. but i think a couple of facts, just to understand the second quarter, is that about two-thirds of our year-over-year operating expense increase was a function of what we had to invest over the holidays in third-party labor and overtime. and we did that because we're strategically and mission-focused on helping our customers. to the extent that we continue to make progress filling jobs, which chris outlined some of the numbers of our improvement there, and to the extent that absenteeism from covid or any other cause continues to go down, you can expect that we would see that improve, and that's certainly what we're working to accomplish.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok, perfect. and then how does cash use change with the new lower leverage expectation? i know it had been a goal to get under three. and your flexibility with cash opens up as you meet certain threshold. so how does it change at 2, 7?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's a great question, bill. this is john. we always look at how to best utilize our cash to the benefit of our shareholders. certainly, getting below 3x opens up the ability for us to consider returns to shareholders.
that door, as i've said before, that door cracks open a little bit below three, and has kicked wide open when we get below 2.5. and then it just becomes -- the returns to shareholders becomes one of many opportunities we have to use cash, along with m&a opportunities, additional capex, automation, expansion and as we optimize retail. and we look at all of those opportunities within that portfolio to use our cash, and we'll continue to assess those as we move forward.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
awesome. thank you, everyone.
john howard -- chief financial officer
thanks, bill.
operator
your next question comes from the line of edward kelly from wells fargo. your line is open.
unknown speaker
yeah. hey, guys. anthony on for ed. thanks for taking our question.
i just wanted to ask about fuel prices. can you just talk through how we should be thinking about higher fuel prices going through the financials? to what extent are there hedges in place? and what is baked into customer contracts with surcharges? and then is there any lag for us to think about in passing that through?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
anthony, this is eric. our fuel prices, as john mentioned, are up 40% year over year for the second quarter. and we are anticipating that trend, given what's going on in the world here, to continue. we do have a program in place where we can hedge against certain inbound or are backhauling fuel that has been in place and will continue to be in place.
and then we have a fuel surcharge program with our customers that we pass through some of the increases, but we recognize, basically, a four-week lag in doing so. so what you're seeing is that 40% increase, and we're anticipating that, that will continue.
unknown speaker
got it. that's helpful. and then just on independents, it looks like there was a pretty impressive growth in the segment in the quarter, i think, in excess of 10% on a three-year geometric average basis. i was just hoping you could give us a little more color on what's driving that? how much did omicron play a part in the acceleration versus what we saw in q1? and how sustainable do you think that is in the coming quarters?
chris testa -- president of unfi
are you talking about the revenue growth, anthony?
unknown speaker
yes, sir.
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. so we'll start with the consumer. certainly, we're seeing food-at-home trends remain elevated by most estimates. it's around 52% of total food spend.
that's above pre-covid levels, and it seems to have plateaued there. in other words, it remains really, really strong. and you have a work-from-home dynamic going on where folks -- it's been -- there's been a fundamental shift there that we believe it's going to continue. and now with inflation, what the consumer is saying is they're going to spend less on discretionary categories and more in the essentials.
and of course, that's good for the food category. regarding the revenue, it is strong because of the demand we're seeing from our existing customers as long -- in addition to new business wins. and as i pointed out, those new business wins are accounting for almost half of the revenue growth. if you look at the units, we estimate somewhere around 40% of the growth is coming from just pure shipping more units with the balance coming from inflationary lift.
unknown speaker
got it. that's really helpful. thanks, guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of eric larson from seaport research partners. your line is open.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah. thank you. thanks for taking the question, everybody. so my question is on your revenue guidance.
and i think, chris, you may have touched base on this right now. so the increase in your revenue guidance, is this still -- is it a 40-60 blend of unit growth versus inflation? is that still kind of the mix for how your new guidance is looking?
chris testa -- president of unfi
it's -- hey, eric. it's a good question. we don't split it out that way. we look at the revenue growth coming from not only the inflation but the sustainability of servicing the customers that we have today and the customers that we see in the pipeline.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. and so if you achieved your goal in fiscal '22 of $1 billion of kind of new customer sales, what is that delta on a year-over-year basis? i know you had some big sales last year. what is the incremental increase this year if you achieve that $1 billion of new customer revenue?
chris testa -- president of unfi
i'm sorry, eric, i don't quite understand the question.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
so i think the $1 billion of new customer revenue is a cumulative number for the last year or two.
chris testa -- president of unfi
ok. you're talking about cross-selling. you're talking about the cross-selling number that i referenced?
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah, correct. yes, that's correct.
chris testa -- president of unfi
ok. i'm sorry, i got confused with the new customers. so cross-selling is existing customers, right, primarily existing customers. and that's... 
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
right. right. correct. 
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah, yeah, yeah. so that is, in the year, and if you look at our guidance for the year, if you -- we can attribute about $1 billion. we think we'll land about $1 billion as the direct result of the aggregation and the combination of bringing together the two companies that wouldn't have existed otherwise. that's what that cross-selling number is.
as far as going forward, we will continue to maintain that and add on to it with incremental cross-selling wins. so for example, in the second quarter, we added $100 million of incremental cross-selling wins. but in aggregate, cross-selling will contribute about $1 billion for fiscal '22. does that answer your question, eric?
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yah. yeah, it does. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of william reuter from bank of america. your line is open.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning. just following up on one of the questions about your fuel and the ability to pass it through. you mentioned you passed through some of this on a four-week lag.
does -- when you say some, is that the majority of those costs or is it some small component of those fuel costs?
john howard -- chief financial officer
it's -- we passed through less than 50% of the costs. but what we're anticipating, as we think about fuel costs and increases in the internal math that we've done, even in the back half of the year, some of those increases that we're anticipating won't be dramatically material to our financial results between the hedging programs and the fuel surcharge that we're able to pass on.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. is there any way to think about, in general, what your annual fuel costs were last year so we can get some context about the magnitude of what an increase represents?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. we haven't provided that information before, so it's not something we would start providing now.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then my last question is with regard to the lower fill rates that you experienced. i expect the majority of customers are seeing this from suppliers, and -- or they expect that they would see it if they had a supplier other than yourselves. do you anticipate that this will have any impact in terms of customer retention? i would expect the answer is no.
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. the answer is no. i mean, our customer base, if they're buying from a wholesaler, there's a big benefit to buy from a wholesaler with scale. and this is an area where scale is a benefit to help improve our ability and access to high-demand items.
so there -- this is an industry dynamic. and in this industry dynamic, you find that scale wins. in other words, we have access to these high-demand products because, like i said earlier, we're typically the top one, two, three, four, five customer for a lot of these suppliers.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
make sense. i'll pass it to others. thank you. 
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of kelly bania from bmo. your line is open.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking our questions. just wanted to ask about the market contraction that you were planning for this year.
and particularly, as you look at your volume trends across channels, if you are seeing or expect to see any divergences in volume by channel or retailer type as customers react to these higher levels of inflation.
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. good morning, kelly. this is chris. i'll take that one.
so i would call the market contraction about what we anticipated. and when i look at that, it's less on a per unit basis and how many units we're shipping, but more on like looking at share shifts that are happening with the industry. and we've seen some shift happening that seems to have plateaued. in other words, it's stopped.
and we're actually seeing some share come back to our customers in the third period of the quarter. so it seems to be stabilizing. and look, we have a strategy in place, and has always been our strategy in place, to outpace the market contraction with cross-selling and new business wins, in addition to developing custom programs by channel. and we're committed to helping each channel maintain success.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and a question -- another question on just the fill rates. just helpful commentary about the trends and the challenges there, but could that at all be a benefit to your cross-selling initiative as other suppliers deal with fill rate challenges? and does that maybe open up the doors for you in terms of cross-selling and items that maybe you have better in stock?
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah, it's a great question. the short answer is yes, and i'll point to an example, and that's our brands group. our brands portfolio does over $1 billion at wholesale. in other words, it's a very large portfolio.
and our fill rates on our brands are at 500 to 1,000 bps better than the national brands. so when we anticipate, or we see a long-term out-of-stock sku, we quickly try to pivot the customer to sku that is in -- higher in stock, and in many cases, that is our brands business. so look, it's a difficult environment. and the winners in this environment are the ones that can navigate quickly.
and we have a sales team and a merchandising team and our procurement team that's doing that. we've had to change our behavior to be quick and nimble to secure high-demand skus. and again, this is where having a very big team that is in constant daily contact with suppliers helps a lot.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, thank you.  and then maybe just a last one on key foods. is there any color you can help us model with the contribution that was to the quarter? and is the timing of that ramping as expected? and any start-up costs we should be thinking about?
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. we're not going to talk about any specific customer or the margin or revenue associated with them. but we're happy with the key food start-up. we're happy with the allentown distribution center.
that's just seven months into its start. we've onboarded a steady workforce there. we're making progress every day. and i will just tell you that allentown dc has met our expectations.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you.

and your last question comes from the line of carla casella from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
carla casella -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. i have one follow-up on the prior question and one on my own as well. so when you're selling more of your own brand versus brand, is there a significant margin differential or a price point differential?
chris testa -- president of unfi
hey, carla. this is chris. our brands business are margin accretive.
carla casella -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, just like peers. ok, great. and then i know you did an exit for some of your multiemployer pension. is there any liability remaining? and have you heard anything -- or are your plans eligible for any of the arpa assistance that we should be hearing about, and your view -- maybe your timing there?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, carla. this is john. we are aware of that, and we do have a team that monitors that, and we do look for opportunities to capitalize on strategic plans to exit.
we did that in q4 of last year. we're monitoring the litigation, and we will continue to do so to look for those opportunities.
carla casella -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. have you disclosed the amount of multiemployer off-balance sheet liability that you have as of this quarter or as of last year?
john howard -- chief financial officer
no, i think we disclosed the appropriate amount in our k, so nothing that we would disclose for the quarter.

good morning. my name is rob, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the unfi fiscal 2022 second quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] thank you.
steve bloomquist, vice president of investor relations, you may begin your conference.
steve bloomquist -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us on unfi's second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. by now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release issued this morning. the press release, webcast and the supplemental slide deck are available under the investors section of the company's website at www.unfi.com.
joining me for today's call are sandy douglas, our chief executive officer; john howard, our chief financial officer; chris testa, president of unfi; and eric dorne, our chief operating officer. sandy, chris and john will provide a business update, after which we'll take your questions. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that comments made by management during today's call may contain forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include plans, expectations, estimates and projections that might involve significant risks and uncertainties.
these risks are discussed in the company's earnings release and sec filings. actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements. and lastly, i'd like to point out that during today's call, management will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. definitions and reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures are included in our press release.
i'll now turn the call over to sandy. 
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
thanks, steve, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fiscal 2022 second quarter earnings call. as you saw in this morning's press release, unfi delivered the highest sales quarter in company history as we continue to build upon the key elements of our strategy. despite an environment that remains challenging, the six pillars of our fuel the future strategy all contributed to our results this quarter. at its core, fuel the future focuses on servicing customers and adding value to their businesses, which leads to profitable growth for our company and increased value for unfi shareholders.
we bring value to our customers in many ways, and we're continuously looking for new opportunities to do so. consolidating purchases of natural, conventional, fresh and specialty items with unfi simplifies their business. our own brands allow customers to offer a broad array of unique and innovative items that bring desired product attributes and affordability to their shoppers. professional services deliver solutions to our customers that solve a variety of needs and allow them to take advantage of unfi's scale to reduce costs or increase sales.
and as consumers seek out healthier and fresher products, we're investing resources to drive growth across these categories. chris will provide more details on each momentarily as well as the growth drivers of our retail stores. the opportunity to add value also applies to what we can do to help our suppliers grow their businesses. after seven months in numerous conversations with cpg companies, i believe that we have significant opportunity to help our suppliers learn more about our diverse customer base and their many different go-to-market strategies and to tap into the knowledge we possess from servicing 30,000 locations across all 50 states and canada.
by providing insights not available through traditional sources, we can assist suppliers in understanding the full opportunity in working with and through unfi, which we believe will add growth and value to their businesses as well as those of our customers. our performance this quarter came during a time of heightened uncertainty across the economy. continuing supply chain challenges are at the heart of the issues, which continue to create short- and long-term impacts on unfi and our customers. accelerating inflation, along with varying degrees of negative unit elasticity, lower inbound fill rates, increased fuel expense, labor shortages, increasing wages and increased use of third-party labor to manage stress points are all impacts on our business and our customers' businesses this past quarter.
the omicron variant led to significant numbers of associates not being able to work during periods of our second quarter. we proactively responded to the resulting higher associate absenteeisms with increased overtime and third-party labor investment to do the best job possible in servicing our customers. feedback over the important holiday selling period has been generally favorable as customers see how hard we're working to support them, but we know that we have significant opportunities for improvement, and we're committed to continuously doing so. moving on, unfi's associates and the company's culture are what make this a special place to work.
i'm proud we received a score of 100 on the human rights campaign foundation's 2022 corporate equality index, the nation's foremost report measuring policies and practices related to workplace equality. we also plan to issue our 2021 esg report later this month. again, this year, under the title better for all, this year's report asks the question, can businesses create value for customers and shareholders and build something better for people in the planet at the same time? the report outlines the many steps that unfi is taking to respond with our actions and our future plans. we've made progress in many important areas that benefit people, communities and the planet while recognizing areas in which we can do better.
overall, our strategic business decisions are guided by the pillars composing the fuel the future strategy, but it's also important that they align with our better for all goals. i would encourage you all to read about the strides we're making when the report is published later this month. we're encouraged with the second quarter and our performance to date in fiscal 2022. our first half results and operating momentum position us to increase our outlook for full year sales and maintain the ranges for adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps, acknowledging that the environment remains volatile.
despite the challenges we faced in the first half of fiscal 2022, our team's resilience, ingenuity and agility give us confidence that we will deliver our updated outlook. i want to reinforce that we will remain flexible to ensure that if conditions change, we'll take every action necessary as we did this past quarter to do the very best job possible for our customers. looking forward, some elements of today's operating environment are structural and likely to remain, while others will normalize over time. unfi has a history of finding new ways to help customers and suppliers grow across our ecosystem while driving efficiencies throughout our business, and we expect that will continue in the years to come.
we remain confident that we can and will deliver the fiscal 2024 financial targets provided at last june's investor day. finally, in recent months, we've augmented our strong senior management team and our board talent with individuals who bring skills and experiences that will strengthen unfi. to that end, we're pleased to have added shamim mohammad to our board of directors. shamim's proven track record and experience in technology and strategic leadership make him a valuable addition to our board.
in addition, i recently added two seasoned executives to our leadership team, who, i'm confident, will help us create value for our customers and help us execute on our fuel the future strategy. so now let me turn the call over to our president, chris testa, for his remarks. chris?
chris testa -- president of unfi
thanks, sandy, and good morning, everyone. on today's call, i'll provide further color on key drivers behind unfi's second quarter results, future growth, the trends and operating environment sandy touched on that are impacting our business and industry. sales for the quarter were $7.4 billion, a seven and a half percent increase over last year's q2, bringing the two-year stack to 14.6% and a 6% sequential increase over the year's first quarter. all sales channels experienced year-over-year growth, while modest anticipated market contraction and continued deterioration in fill rates partially offset these gains.
we're confident that our customer-centric approach is driving results. and are pleased that the growth in the quarter came from both selling more to existing customers as well as from business we're now doing with new customers, each a key growth component in our fuel the future strategy. let's start with gains made with our existing customers. looking at our top 25 customers and excluding the anchor customer in our new allentown dc, revenue grew nearly 7% in the quarter compared to last year's second quarter and over 5% sequentially compared to q1.
a portion of these gains were the result of continued success with cross-selling as we added an incremental $100 million of total revenue in the quarter. as customers consolidate their purchases with unfi, their operations become more efficient in multiple areas, including receiving, stocking and back-office functions. our year-to-date performance keeps us on pace to achieve $1 billion in cross-selling revenue by the end of fiscal 2022. our fuel the future strategy also looks to increase sales in our fresh portfolio, which includes meat, bakery, deli and produce.
we're pleased with the steady progress and growth we're seeing as we continue to invest in people, technology and infrastructure to win in the important perimeter departments of the store. specifically in produce, our customers expect a high quality and view produce as a defining part of their store. we have expanded our direct-from-farm relationships, which improves our ability to deliver fresher product across a wide portfolio of conventional and organic offerings. combined with the expertise of our merchandising specialists, i'm happy to report that our continued focus helped us grow second quarter produce sales at a rate that exceeded the broad u.s.
produce market by over 400 basis points. another differentiated benefit unfi brings to its customers is its own brands portfolio. in the second quarter, woodstock, our 30 year, beloved organic and non-gmo brand, grew over 17%, with share gains in several natural channel categories, including frozen fruit. we expanded own brand distribution with several larger customers, in part due to our higher inbound fill rates that are consistently 500 to 1,000 basis points above national brands, in addition to gains resulting from joint business planning with our customers.
the final growth platform that i'll address is professional services, where we continue to bring new ideas to our customers that provide value to their operations and growth for unfi. our services results yielded gains that were almost three times the growth rate of our wholesale business, resulting from our focus on providing solutions for our customers beyond selling them groceries. for example, our payments business added another 150 stores in the second quarter, which brings the total number of stores to about 3,500. collectively, these stores generate about 700 million transactions per year.
and because of partnering with unfi and leveraging our scale, we estimate their collective annual savings and processing fees to be about $40 million. that is meaningful savings to our customers that are trying to compete and find ways to improve their p&l, especially in an inflationary environment. as for new business, we're realizing sales gains across every channel from new business wins achieved last year in fiscal '21 and over the last six months. our sales pipeline remains robust, and we continue to be confident in our ability to onboard new customers based on our unmatched capabilities to help our customers be successful.
based on year-over-year unit sale increases, we estimate that roughly 40% of our top-line sales growth in the quarter came from volume gains, including cross-selling and new business, with the remainder coming from inflation. we're encouraged by the growth we're experiencing and the drivers behind the growth, but we continue to be constrained by deteriorating fill rates caused primarily for upstream supply chain challenges. deteriorating fill rates were driven by high demand, the impact of omicron and the availability of freight and labor, including in our own dcs, as well as continuing raw material and packaging shortages. daily conversations with our suppliers reinforce the unpredictable nature of the environment as the recovery time lines generally are getting pushed further into the future, which will adversely impact the level of promotions and innovation launches this year.
our merchandising teams continue to work on behalf of our customers to lessen, to the extent we can, the impact on their business. we're forecasting more frequently as supply challenges on one brand in a category can quickly cause demand spikes for similar brands. we're also making every effort to leverage our scale to maximize buying opportunities that include on-demand ordering to absorb any excess inventory or assisting with our own transportation resources. we are communicating regularly with customers to help find alternative products, including our own brands, so they can plan accordingly.
unfi's agility, resourcefulness and persistence is helping us navigate the environment, and we'll continue to do everything we can to help our customers. shifting to operations. although our second quarter operating expense rate declined 48 basis points sequentially from q1, it was still higher than expected due to elevated absenteeism brought on by omicron. as sandy mentioned, these unplanned absences led to greater reliance on overtime, third-party warehouse labor and outside drivers to best service our customers during the critical holiday shopping season.
it was further compounded by surging diesel prices, which were up about 40% in january compared to january of 2021. given the current state of global events, we anticipate fuel will continue to be a headwind for the near term. with our distribution centers, we continue to make meaningful progress on reducing the number of open positions. we finished the fiscal year 2021 with a dc vacancy rate of about 15%.
the initiatives i spoke about on the last call reduced that figure to 12% at the end of q1. despite the onset of omicron and the heightened absenteeism in december and january, we further reduced the vacancy rate to 9% at the end of the second quarter. on the transportation side, the market for drivers remains highly competitive. we're taking meaningful actions with similar initiatives to address open driver positions and have stabilized the base.
our goal over the coming quarters is to make similar progress toward reducing our driver vacancy rate. we're still not where we need to be, but the programs we've implemented to address worker concerns and lifestyle needs are clearly having a positive impact. they are also designed to increase associate retention, which drives improved productivity and consistent performance for our customers. turning to our retail stores.
we're pleased with both the top and bottom-line growth from our cub and shoppers banners. last quarter, i talked about bringing cub's e-commerce platform in-house, which has delivered strong results. average weekly e-com sales have increased about 25%, and additional marketing and analytics capabilities are coming soon that will add to the brand experience for our customers. we've also seen great performance in community involvement from our pharmacies, where scripts grew about 4% in the quarter, which is in addition to strong growth in seasonal flu vaccines and steady demand for covid vaccines and booster shots in q2.
we're also continuing to invest in and optimize our retail business, as last month, cub opened its 30th wine and spirits liquor store. plans are already in place for the next store as we look to optimize and strengthen the cub brand. as sandy said, we're pleased with our performance this quarter and optimistic about the balance of fiscal 2022. we expect food-at-home sales to remain strong as people continue to work from home and manage their household budgets in the face of high levels of food inflation.
the environment remains unpredictable in several ways, but we're confident in our ability to help our customers succeed through all that unfi has to offer. let me now turn the call over to john.

thank you, chris, and good morning, everyone. on today's call, i'll cover our second quarter financial performance, balance sheet, capital structure and our fiscal 2022 outlook. as sandy said, second quarter sales of $7.4 billion was a new high for unfi, surpassing the previous high in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 when the pandemic first began. second quarter gross margin rate increased 8 basis points compared to last year's second quarter.
our wholesale margin rate was again favorably impacted by our elevated level of cost inflation as our business model and customer contracts generally pass through product cost inflation, which leads to both revenue and margin gains. the continued benefits from our transformational value path initiatives also contributed to our gross margin expansion in the quarter, which was partly offset by a higher noncash lifo charge. excluding a benefit related to an adjustment to prior met withdrawal charge estimates, second quarter operating expense rate increased 23 basis points. as sandy and chris discussed, this quarter's results included greater levels of overtime and third-party labor to service our customers as well as higher fuel costs.
last year's second quarter included lower health and welfare costs, which amounted to about 17 basis points, and the cycling of that benefit was anticipated as part of our initial full year outlook. adjusted ebitda totaled $201 million, which included a $19 million lifo charge compared to a $7 million lifo charge in q2 of last year. our gaap earnings per share totaled $1.08, which included $0.05 in net charges. adjusted eps for the second quarter totaled $1.13 per share compared to $1.25 last year.
turning to the balance sheet. we finished the quarter with total outstanding net debt of $2.42 billion, a nearly $70 million decrease compared to the first quarter. our net debt-to-adjusted ebitda leverage ratio improved sequentially from the first quarter to 3.1 times. as for the capital structure, we continue to proactively manage our outstanding debt, including our maturity schedule.
as you know, our $2.1 billion asset-based revolver matures in just over 18 months, and we'll plan to extend its maturity before it becomes current this october. also, let me remind you of the nature of our outstanding debt considering the fed's recent commentary on its intent to increase interest rates. although our secured term loan and abl both have variable rate structures tied to libor, we have executed rate swaps that fix the interest rate on over $1.2 billion of the approximately $1.8 billion in borrowings as of the end of the second quarter. we believe the modest amount of risk we do face from rising interest rates is manageable.
our latest 10-k stated that a 100-basis-point increase in interest rates would add approximately $5 million to our annual interest expense, the equivalent of about $0.06 in eps. let's turn to our outlook for fiscal 2022. given our performance year to date, our momentum with new and existing customers, and our belief that inflation will remain at elevated levels, we are increasing our full year expectation for net sales to a new range of $28.2 billion to $28.7 billion, a $400 million increase to the top and bottom end of the range. due to the unpredictable operating environment and a potential for further operating investments to service our customers, we're not changing the ranges for adjusted ebitda, which remains at $760 million to $790 million, or for adjusted eps, which remains at $3.90 to $4.20 per share.
our outlook for full year capital spending has decreased by $50 million, from $300 million to $250 million, driven by supply chain challenges we're encountering in terms of receiving materials and equipment as well as the labor necessary for installation. as a result, we're increasing our debt reduction expectation by the same $50 million to a new range of $150 million to $200 million, which includes the net proceeds from the riverside purchase and sale leaseback transaction that was completed in february. our third quarter gaap results will include an estimated pre-tax gain of approximately $85 million, which equates to slightly more than $1 in after-tax eps. this is now included in our updated gaap guidance, but is excluded when calculating adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps.
with our higher full year outlook for debt reduction, we now expect our adjusted ebitda net leverage ratio to finish the year at approximately 2.7 times. as you've heard, today's operating backdrop remains challenging and unpredictable. yet, we remain confident in our ability to serve our customers and deliver on our updated outlook for the year. before we open up the call for questions, i want to reinforce the comment from both sandy and chris that unfi will remain agile and focused on helping our customers succeed, which is core to who we are as a company.
importantly, let me also reiterate our commitment to increasing shareholder value and delivering the long-term targets presented at june's investor day. we appreciate your continued confidence and support. operator, we're now ready to take questions.
",2022-Q2,UNFI
1.0,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of john heinbockel from guggenheim. your line is open.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey. first, guys. can you quantify a little bit or speak to the deterioration in fill rates? so what has been the magnitude of that slowdown? and do you think that we see a continued deterioration in the near term? and i guess, other than flexing scale, is there anything else you can do to mitigate that?
chris testa -- president of unfi
hey, john. this is chris. i'll start off with the answer on that one. so we saw improving fill rates right up until the end of the summer, right up until basically halfway through our fourth quarter last year, and then it's deteriorated sequentially since then.
we did not expect that. we definitely anticipated fill rates to improve. the impact of it is really, really hard to measure on net sales. i'll put it to you this way.
there are some cases where we're actually shipping more units of a particular sku than last year, but fill rate has been cut in half because demand is higher. and that's demand coming from new and existing customer base. so from a net sales impact, really tough to measure. i mean, you saw the sales growth over $5 billion -- i'm sorry, $500 million in the quarter, seven and a half percent.
so we're still growing sales despite the fill rate. where it is impactful is the customer experience, and we're doing everything we can to mitigate that with our merchandising teams to replace items with products that are in stock, including our own brands. and the second impact is on promotional dollars. although promotional dollars have increased year over year, and it's behind where we thought they would be, and that's because there just isn't the demand.
i'm sorry, there's just not the supply to put those promotional dollars against.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. and then maybe to follow that up, right, if you have fill rates that are better than the industry, that would help you on the pipeline side, right, attracting new customers. but is there a reticence on your part to bring in a lot of new customers in a fill rate environment like this for fear of sort of execution or service, nothing where you'd like it in the short run? or no, that's -- you think that's manageable?
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah, not at all. and what we're dealing with here is an industrywide thing. so the advantage that we have is for many suppliers, we're a top five customer to them. so from an allocation standpoint, we tend to get a fair share, a lot of that allocated inventory.
so no, it's an industrywide event, and it certainly does not at all prevent us from adding on new customers.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok, thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of bill kirk from mkm partners. your line is open.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
hey. good morning, everybody. so sandy, i think you called out the reliance on third-party labor in the quarter. from here, absenteeism is likely way down.
i think chris gave a stat on that. and then peak seasonality, peak demand seasonality, is also behind you. so i guess, my question would be with seasonality and absenteeism down, have you seen some cost improvements already in the first half of the third quarter here?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
well, obviously, we'll talk about the third quarter when the third quarter is over on our call. but i think a couple of facts, just to understand the second quarter, is that about two-thirds of our year-over-year operating expense increase was a function of what we had to invest over the holidays in third-party labor and overtime. and we did that because we're strategically and mission-focused on helping our customers. to the extent that we continue to make progress filling jobs, which chris outlined some of the numbers of our improvement there, and to the extent that absenteeism from covid or any other cause continues to go down, you can expect that we would see that improve, and that's certainly what we're working to accomplish.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok, perfect. and then how does cash use change with the new lower leverage expectation? i know it had been a goal to get under three. and your flexibility with cash opens up as you meet certain threshold. so how does it change at 2, 7?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's a great question, bill. this is john. we always look at how to best utilize our cash to the benefit of our shareholders. certainly, getting below 3x opens up the ability for us to consider returns to shareholders.
that door, as i've said before, that door cracks open a little bit below three, and has kicked wide open when we get below 2.5. and then it just becomes -- the returns to shareholders becomes one of many opportunities we have to use cash, along with m&a opportunities, additional capex, automation, expansion and as we optimize retail. and we look at all of those opportunities within that portfolio to use our cash, and we'll continue to assess those as we move forward.
bill kirk -- mkm partners -- analyst
awesome. thank you, everyone.
john howard -- chief financial officer
thanks, bill.
operator
your next question comes from the line of edward kelly from wells fargo. your line is open.
unknown speaker
yeah. hey, guys. anthony on for ed. thanks for taking our question.
i just wanted to ask about fuel prices. can you just talk through how we should be thinking about higher fuel prices going through the financials? to what extent are there hedges in place? and what is baked into customer contracts with surcharges? and then is there any lag for us to think about in passing that through?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
anthony, this is eric. our fuel prices, as john mentioned, are up 40% year over year for the second quarter. and we are anticipating that trend, given what's going on in the world here, to continue. we do have a program in place where we can hedge against certain inbound or are backhauling fuel that has been in place and will continue to be in place.
and then we have a fuel surcharge program with our customers that we pass through some of the increases, but we recognize, basically, a four-week lag in doing so. so what you're seeing is that 40% increase, and we're anticipating that, that will continue.
unknown speaker
got it. that's helpful. and then just on independents, it looks like there was a pretty impressive growth in the segment in the quarter, i think, in excess of 10% on a three-year geometric average basis. i was just hoping you could give us a little more color on what's driving that? how much did omicron play a part in the acceleration versus what we saw in q1? and how sustainable do you think that is in the coming quarters?
chris testa -- president of unfi
are you talking about the revenue growth, anthony?
unknown speaker
yes, sir.
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. so we'll start with the consumer. certainly, we're seeing food-at-home trends remain elevated by most estimates. it's around 52% of total food spend.
that's above pre-covid levels, and it seems to have plateaued there. in other words, it remains really, really strong. and you have a work-from-home dynamic going on where folks -- it's been -- there's been a fundamental shift there that we believe it's going to continue. and now with inflation, what the consumer is saying is they're going to spend less on discretionary categories and more in the essentials.
and of course, that's good for the food category. regarding the revenue, it is strong because of the demand we're seeing from our existing customers as long -- in addition to new business wins. and as i pointed out, those new business wins are accounting for almost half of the revenue growth. if you look at the units, we estimate somewhere around 40% of the growth is coming from just pure shipping more units with the balance coming from inflationary lift.
unknown speaker
got it. that's really helpful. thanks, guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of eric larson from seaport research partners. your line is open.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah. thank you. thanks for taking the question, everybody. so my question is on your revenue guidance.
and i think, chris, you may have touched base on this right now. so the increase in your revenue guidance, is this still -- is it a 40-60 blend of unit growth versus inflation? is that still kind of the mix for how your new guidance is looking?
chris testa -- president of unfi
it's -- hey, eric. it's a good question. we don't split it out that way. we look at the revenue growth coming from not only the inflation but the sustainability of servicing the customers that we have today and the customers that we see in the pipeline.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. and so if you achieved your goal in fiscal '22 of $1 billion of kind of new customer sales, what is that delta on a year-over-year basis? i know you had some big sales last year. what is the incremental increase this year if you achieve that $1 billion of new customer revenue?
chris testa -- president of unfi
i'm sorry, eric, i don't quite understand the question.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
so i think the $1 billion of new customer revenue is a cumulative number for the last year or two.
chris testa -- president of unfi
ok. you're talking about cross-selling. you're talking about the cross-selling number that i referenced?
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah, correct. yes, that's correct.
chris testa -- president of unfi
ok. i'm sorry, i got confused with the new customers. so cross-selling is existing customers, right, primarily existing customers. and that's... 
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
right. right. correct. 
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah, yeah, yeah. so that is, in the year, and if you look at our guidance for the year, if you -- we can attribute about $1 billion. we think we'll land about $1 billion as the direct result of the aggregation and the combination of bringing together the two companies that wouldn't have existed otherwise. that's what that cross-selling number is.
as far as going forward, we will continue to maintain that and add on to it with incremental cross-selling wins. so for example, in the second quarter, we added $100 million of incremental cross-selling wins. but in aggregate, cross-selling will contribute about $1 billion for fiscal '22. does that answer your question, eric?
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yah. yeah, it does. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of william reuter from bank of america. your line is open.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning. just following up on one of the questions about your fuel and the ability to pass it through. you mentioned you passed through some of this on a four-week lag.
does -- when you say some, is that the majority of those costs or is it some small component of those fuel costs?
john howard -- chief financial officer
it's -- we passed through less than 50% of the costs. but what we're anticipating, as we think about fuel costs and increases in the internal math that we've done, even in the back half of the year, some of those increases that we're anticipating won't be dramatically material to our financial results between the hedging programs and the fuel surcharge that we're able to pass on.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. is there any way to think about, in general, what your annual fuel costs were last year so we can get some context about the magnitude of what an increase represents?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. we haven't provided that information before, so it's not something we would start providing now.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then my last question is with regard to the lower fill rates that you experienced. i expect the majority of customers are seeing this from suppliers, and -- or they expect that they would see it if they had a supplier other than yourselves. do you anticipate that this will have any impact in terms of customer retention? i would expect the answer is no.
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. the answer is no. i mean, our customer base, if they're buying from a wholesaler, there's a big benefit to buy from a wholesaler with scale. and this is an area where scale is a benefit to help improve our ability and access to high-demand items.
so there -- this is an industry dynamic. and in this industry dynamic, you find that scale wins. in other words, we have access to these high-demand products because, like i said earlier, we're typically the top one, two, three, four, five customer for a lot of these suppliers.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
make sense. i'll pass it to others. thank you. 
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of kelly bania from bmo. your line is open.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking our questions. just wanted to ask about the market contraction that you were planning for this year.
and particularly, as you look at your volume trends across channels, if you are seeing or expect to see any divergences in volume by channel or retailer type as customers react to these higher levels of inflation.
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. good morning, kelly. this is chris. i'll take that one.
so i would call the market contraction about what we anticipated. and when i look at that, it's less on a per unit basis and how many units we're shipping, but more on like looking at share shifts that are happening with the industry. and we've seen some shift happening that seems to have plateaued. in other words, it's stopped.
and we're actually seeing some share come back to our customers in the third period of the quarter. so it seems to be stabilizing. and look, we have a strategy in place, and has always been our strategy in place, to outpace the market contraction with cross-selling and new business wins, in addition to developing custom programs by channel. and we're committed to helping each channel maintain success.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and a question -- another question on just the fill rates. just helpful commentary about the trends and the challenges there, but could that at all be a benefit to your cross-selling initiative as other suppliers deal with fill rate challenges? and does that maybe open up the doors for you in terms of cross-selling and items that maybe you have better in stock?
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah, it's a great question. the short answer is yes, and i'll point to an example, and that's our brands group. our brands portfolio does over $1 billion at wholesale. in other words, it's a very large portfolio.
and our fill rates on our brands are at 500 to 1,000 bps better than the national brands. so when we anticipate, or we see a long-term out-of-stock sku, we quickly try to pivot the customer to sku that is in -- higher in stock, and in many cases, that is our brands business. so look, it's a difficult environment. and the winners in this environment are the ones that can navigate quickly.
and we have a sales team and a merchandising team and our procurement team that's doing that. we've had to change our behavior to be quick and nimble to secure high-demand skus. and again, this is where having a very big team that is in constant daily contact with suppliers helps a lot.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, thank you.  and then maybe just a last one on key foods. is there any color you can help us model with the contribution that was to the quarter? and is the timing of that ramping as expected? and any start-up costs we should be thinking about?
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. we're not going to talk about any specific customer or the margin or revenue associated with them. but we're happy with the key food start-up. we're happy with the allentown distribution center.
that's just seven months into its start. we've onboarded a steady workforce there. we're making progress every day. and i will just tell you that allentown dc has met our expectations.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you.
chris testa -- president of unfi
sure.
operator
and your last question comes from the line of carla casella from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
carla casella -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. i have one follow-up on the prior question and one on my own as well. so when you're selling more of your own brand versus brand, is there a significant margin differential or a price point differential?
chris testa -- president of unfi
hey, carla. this is chris. our brands business are margin accretive.
carla casella -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, just like peers. ok, great. and then i know you did an exit for some of your multiemployer pension. is there any liability remaining? and have you heard anything -- or are your plans eligible for any of the arpa assistance that we should be hearing about, and your view -- maybe your timing there?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, carla. this is john. we are aware of that, and we do have a team that monitors that, and we do look for opportunities to capitalize on strategic plans to exit.
we did that in q4 of last year. we're monitoring the litigation, and we will continue to do so to look for those opportunities.
carla casella -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. have you disclosed the amount of multiemployer off-balance sheet liability that you have as of this quarter or as of last year?
john howard -- chief financial officer
no, i think we disclosed the appropriate amount in our k, so nothing that we would disclose for the quarter.
carla casella -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
john howard -- chief financial officer
thank you, carla.
operator
and there are no further questions at this time. i'd turn the call back over to unfi management for some closing remarks.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
i want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. i hope what you heard and take away from today's call is that unfi is growing and performing within a challenging environment by steadfastly focusing on the most important thing in our business, which is our customers. our fuel the future strategy is driving our performance in many ways. adding value to our customers' businesses remains at the heart of everything we do, and we're pleased with our performance, while acknowledging that we can continue to get better in almost every facet of the business.

good morning. my name is rob, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the unfi fiscal 2022 second quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] thank you.
steve bloomquist, vice president of investor relations, you may begin your conference.
steve bloomquist -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us on unfi's second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. by now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release issued this morning. the press release, webcast and the supplemental slide deck are available under the investors section of the company's website at www.unfi.com.
joining me for today's call are sandy douglas, our chief executive officer; john howard, our chief financial officer; chris testa, president of unfi; and eric dorne, our chief operating officer. sandy, chris and john will provide a business update, after which we'll take your questions. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that comments made by management during today's call may contain forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include plans, expectations, estimates and projections that might involve significant risks and uncertainties.
these risks are discussed in the company's earnings release and sec filings. actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements. and lastly, i'd like to point out that during today's call, management will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. definitions and reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures are included in our press release.
i'll now turn the call over to sandy. 
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
thanks, steve, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fiscal 2022 second quarter earnings call. as you saw in this morning's press release, unfi delivered the highest sales quarter in company history as we continue to build upon the key elements of our strategy. despite an environment that remains challenging, the six pillars of our fuel the future strategy all contributed to our results this quarter. at its core, fuel the future focuses on servicing customers and adding value to their businesses, which leads to profitable growth for our company and increased value for unfi shareholders.
we bring value to our customers in many ways, and we're continuously looking for new opportunities to do so. consolidating purchases of natural, conventional, fresh and specialty items with unfi simplifies their business. our own brands allow customers to offer a broad array of unique and innovative items that bring desired product attributes and affordability to their shoppers. professional services deliver solutions to our customers that solve a variety of needs and allow them to take advantage of unfi's scale to reduce costs or increase sales.
and as consumers seek out healthier and fresher products, we're investing resources to drive growth across these categories. chris will provide more details on each momentarily as well as the growth drivers of our retail stores. the opportunity to add value also applies to what we can do to help our suppliers grow their businesses. after seven months in numerous conversations with cpg companies, i believe that we have significant opportunity to help our suppliers learn more about our diverse customer base and their many different go-to-market strategies and to tap into the knowledge we possess from servicing 30,000 locations across all 50 states and canada.
by providing insights not available through traditional sources, we can assist suppliers in understanding the full opportunity in working with and through unfi, which we believe will add growth and value to their businesses as well as those of our customers. our performance this quarter came during a time of heightened uncertainty across the economy. continuing supply chain challenges are at the heart of the issues, which continue to create short- and long-term impacts on unfi and our customers. accelerating inflation, along with varying degrees of negative unit elasticity, lower inbound fill rates, increased fuel expense, labor shortages, increasing wages and increased use of third-party labor to manage stress points are all impacts on our business and our customers' businesses this past quarter.
the omicron variant led to significant numbers of associates not being able to work during periods of our second quarter. we proactively responded to the resulting higher associate absenteeisms with increased overtime and third-party labor investment to do the best job possible in servicing our customers. feedback over the important holiday selling period has been generally favorable as customers see how hard we're working to support them, but we know that we have significant opportunities for improvement, and we're committed to continuously doing so. moving on, unfi's associates and the company's culture are what make this a special place to work.
i'm proud we received a score of 100 on the human rights campaign foundation's 2022 corporate equality index, the nation's foremost report measuring policies and practices related to workplace equality. we also plan to issue our 2021 esg report later this month. again, this year, under the title better for all, this year's report asks the question, can businesses create value for customers and shareholders and build something better for people in the planet at the same time? the report outlines the many steps that unfi is taking to respond with our actions and our future plans. we've made progress in many important areas that benefit people, communities and the planet while recognizing areas in which we can do better.
overall, our strategic business decisions are guided by the pillars composing the fuel the future strategy, but it's also important that they align with our better for all goals. i would encourage you all to read about the strides we're making when the report is published later this month. we're encouraged with the second quarter and our performance to date in fiscal 2022. our first half results and operating momentum position us to increase our outlook for full year sales and maintain the ranges for adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps, acknowledging that the environment remains volatile.
despite the challenges we faced in the first half of fiscal 2022, our team's resilience, ingenuity and agility give us confidence that we will deliver our updated outlook. i want to reinforce that we will remain flexible to ensure that if conditions change, we'll take every action necessary as we did this past quarter to do the very best job possible for our customers. looking forward, some elements of today's operating environment are structural and likely to remain, while others will normalize over time. unfi has a history of finding new ways to help customers and suppliers grow across our ecosystem while driving efficiencies throughout our business, and we expect that will continue in the years to come.
we remain confident that we can and will deliver the fiscal 2024 financial targets provided at last june's investor day. finally, in recent months, we've augmented our strong senior management team and our board talent with individuals who bring skills and experiences that will strengthen unfi. to that end, we're pleased to have added shamim mohammad to our board of directors. shamim's proven track record and experience in technology and strategic leadership make him a valuable addition to our board.
in addition, i recently added two seasoned executives to our leadership team, who, i'm confident, will help us create value for our customers and help us execute on our fuel the future strategy. so now let me turn the call over to our president, chris testa, for his remarks. chris?
chris testa -- president of unfi
thanks, sandy, and good morning, everyone. on today's call, i'll provide further color on key drivers behind unfi's second quarter results, future growth, the trends and operating environment sandy touched on that are impacting our business and industry. sales for the quarter were $7.4 billion, a seven and a half percent increase over last year's q2, bringing the two-year stack to 14.6% and a 6% sequential increase over the year's first quarter. all sales channels experienced year-over-year growth, while modest anticipated market contraction and continued deterioration in fill rates partially offset these gains.
we're confident that our customer-centric approach is driving results. and are pleased that the growth in the quarter came from both selling more to existing customers as well as from business we're now doing with new customers, each a key growth component in our fuel the future strategy. let's start with gains made with our existing customers. looking at our top 25 customers and excluding the anchor customer in our new allentown dc, revenue grew nearly 7% in the quarter compared to last year's second quarter and over 5% sequentially compared to q1.
a portion of these gains were the result of continued success with cross-selling as we added an incremental $100 million of total revenue in the quarter. as customers consolidate their purchases with unfi, their operations become more efficient in multiple areas, including receiving, stocking and back-office functions. our year-to-date performance keeps us on pace to achieve $1 billion in cross-selling revenue by the end of fiscal 2022. our fuel the future strategy also looks to increase sales in our fresh portfolio, which includes meat, bakery, deli and produce.
we're pleased with the steady progress and growth we're seeing as we continue to invest in people, technology and infrastructure to win in the important perimeter departments of the store. specifically in produce, our customers expect a high quality and view produce as a defining part of their store. we have expanded our direct-from-farm relationships, which improves our ability to deliver fresher product across a wide portfolio of conventional and organic offerings. combined with the expertise of our merchandising specialists, i'm happy to report that our continued focus helped us grow second quarter produce sales at a rate that exceeded the broad u.s.
produce market by over 400 basis points. another differentiated benefit unfi brings to its customers is its own brands portfolio. in the second quarter, woodstock, our 30 year, beloved organic and non-gmo brand, grew over 17%, with share gains in several natural channel categories, including frozen fruit. we expanded own brand distribution with several larger customers, in part due to our higher inbound fill rates that are consistently 500 to 1,000 basis points above national brands, in addition to gains resulting from joint business planning with our customers.
the final growth platform that i'll address is professional services, where we continue to bring new ideas to our customers that provide value to their operations and growth for unfi. our services results yielded gains that were almost three times the growth rate of our wholesale business, resulting from our focus on providing solutions for our customers beyond selling them groceries. for example, our payments business added another 150 stores in the second quarter, which brings the total number of stores to about 3,500. collectively, these stores generate about 700 million transactions per year.
and because of partnering with unfi and leveraging our scale, we estimate their collective annual savings and processing fees to be about $40 million. that is meaningful savings to our customers that are trying to compete and find ways to improve their p&l, especially in an inflationary environment. as for new business, we're realizing sales gains across every channel from new business wins achieved last year in fiscal '21 and over the last six months. our sales pipeline remains robust, and we continue to be confident in our ability to onboard new customers based on our unmatched capabilities to help our customers be successful.
based on year-over-year unit sale increases, we estimate that roughly 40% of our top-line sales growth in the quarter came from volume gains, including cross-selling and new business, with the remainder coming from inflation. we're encouraged by the growth we're experiencing and the drivers behind the growth, but we continue to be constrained by deteriorating fill rates caused primarily for upstream supply chain challenges. deteriorating fill rates were driven by high demand, the impact of omicron and the availability of freight and labor, including in our own dcs, as well as continuing raw material and packaging shortages. daily conversations with our suppliers reinforce the unpredictable nature of the environment as the recovery time lines generally are getting pushed further into the future, which will adversely impact the level of promotions and innovation launches this year.
our merchandising teams continue to work on behalf of our customers to lessen, to the extent we can, the impact on their business. we're forecasting more frequently as supply challenges on one brand in a category can quickly cause demand spikes for similar brands. we're also making every effort to leverage our scale to maximize buying opportunities that include on-demand ordering to absorb any excess inventory or assisting with our own transportation resources. we are communicating regularly with customers to help find alternative products, including our own brands, so they can plan accordingly.
unfi's agility, resourcefulness and persistence is helping us navigate the environment, and we'll continue to do everything we can to help our customers. shifting to operations. although our second quarter operating expense rate declined 48 basis points sequentially from q1, it was still higher than expected due to elevated absenteeism brought on by omicron. as sandy mentioned, these unplanned absences led to greater reliance on overtime, third-party warehouse labor and outside drivers to best service our customers during the critical holiday shopping season.
it was further compounded by surging diesel prices, which were up about 40% in january compared to january of 2021. given the current state of global events, we anticipate fuel will continue to be a headwind for the near term. with our distribution centers, we continue to make meaningful progress on reducing the number of open positions. we finished the fiscal year 2021 with a dc vacancy rate of about 15%.
the initiatives i spoke about on the last call reduced that figure to 12% at the end of q1. despite the onset of omicron and the heightened absenteeism in december and january, we further reduced the vacancy rate to 9% at the end of the second quarter. on the transportation side, the market for drivers remains highly competitive. we're taking meaningful actions with similar initiatives to address open driver positions and have stabilized the base.
our goal over the coming quarters is to make similar progress toward reducing our driver vacancy rate. we're still not where we need to be, but the programs we've implemented to address worker concerns and lifestyle needs are clearly having a positive impact. they are also designed to increase associate retention, which drives improved productivity and consistent performance for our customers. turning to our retail stores.
we're pleased with both the top and bottom-line growth from our cub and shoppers banners. last quarter, i talked about bringing cub's e-commerce platform in-house, which has delivered strong results. average weekly e-com sales have increased about 25%, and additional marketing and analytics capabilities are coming soon that will add to the brand experience for our customers. we've also seen great performance in community involvement from our pharmacies, where scripts grew about 4% in the quarter, which is in addition to strong growth in seasonal flu vaccines and steady demand for covid vaccines and booster shots in q2.
we're also continuing to invest in and optimize our retail business, as last month, cub opened its 30th wine and spirits liquor store. plans are already in place for the next store as we look to optimize and strengthen the cub brand. as sandy said, we're pleased with our performance this quarter and optimistic about the balance of fiscal 2022. we expect food-at-home sales to remain strong as people continue to work from home and manage their household budgets in the face of high levels of food inflation.
the environment remains unpredictable in several ways, but we're confident in our ability to help our customers succeed through all that unfi has to offer. let me now turn the call over to john.
john howard -- chief financial officer
thank you, chris, and good morning, everyone. on today's call, i'll cover our second quarter financial performance, balance sheet, capital structure and our fiscal 2022 outlook. as sandy said, second quarter sales of $7.4 billion was a new high for unfi, surpassing the previous high in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 when the pandemic first began. second quarter gross margin rate increased 8 basis points compared to last year's second quarter.
our wholesale margin rate was again favorably impacted by our elevated level of cost inflation as our business model and customer contracts generally pass through product cost inflation, which leads to both revenue and margin gains. the continued benefits from our transformational value path initiatives also contributed to our gross margin expansion in the quarter, which was partly offset by a higher noncash lifo charge. excluding a benefit related to an adjustment to prior met withdrawal charge estimates, second quarter operating expense rate increased 23 basis points. as sandy and chris discussed, this quarter's results included greater levels of overtime and third-party labor to service our customers as well as higher fuel costs.
last year's second quarter included lower health and welfare costs, which amounted to about 17 basis points, and the cycling of that benefit was anticipated as part of our initial full year outlook. adjusted ebitda totaled $201 million, which included a $19 million lifo charge compared to a $7 million lifo charge in q2 of last year. our gaap earnings per share totaled $1.08, which included $0.05 in net charges. adjusted eps for the second quarter totaled $1.13 per share compared to $1.25 last year.
turning to the balance sheet. we finished the quarter with total outstanding net debt of $2.42 billion, a nearly $70 million decrease compared to the first quarter. our net debt-to-adjusted ebitda leverage ratio improved sequentially from the first quarter to 3.1 times. as for the capital structure, we continue to proactively manage our outstanding debt, including our maturity schedule.
as you know, our $2.1 billion asset-based revolver matures in just over 18 months, and we'll plan to extend its maturity before it becomes current this october. also, let me remind you of the nature of our outstanding debt considering the fed's recent commentary on its intent to increase interest rates. although our secured term loan and abl both have variable rate structures tied to libor, we have executed rate swaps that fix the interest rate on over $1.2 billion of the approximately $1.8 billion in borrowings as of the end of the second quarter. we believe the modest amount of risk we do face from rising interest rates is manageable.
our latest 10-k stated that a 100-basis-point increase in interest rates would add approximately $5 million to our annual interest expense, the equivalent of about $0.06 in eps. let's turn to our outlook for fiscal 2022. given our performance year to date, our momentum with new and existing customers, and our belief that inflation will remain at elevated levels, we are increasing our full year expectation for net sales to a new range of $28.2 billion to $28.7 billion, a $400 million increase to the top and bottom end of the range. due to the unpredictable operating environment and a potential for further operating investments to service our customers, we're not changing the ranges for adjusted ebitda, which remains at $760 million to $790 million, or for adjusted eps, which remains at $3.90 to $4.20 per share.
our outlook for full year capital spending has decreased by $50 million, from $300 million to $250 million, driven by supply chain challenges we're encountering in terms of receiving materials and equipment as well as the labor necessary for installation. as a result, we're increasing our debt reduction expectation by the same $50 million to a new range of $150 million to $200 million, which includes the net proceeds from the riverside purchase and sale leaseback transaction that was completed in february. our third quarter gaap results will include an estimated pre-tax gain of approximately $85 million, which equates to slightly more than $1 in after-tax eps. this is now included in our updated gaap guidance, but is excluded when calculating adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps.
with our higher full year outlook for debt reduction, we now expect our adjusted ebitda net leverage ratio to finish the year at approximately 2.7 times. as you've heard, today's operating backdrop remains challenging and unpredictable. yet, we remain confident in our ability to serve our customers and deliver on our updated outlook for the year. before we open up the call for questions, i want to reinforce the comment from both sandy and chris that unfi will remain agile and focused on helping our customers succeed, which is core to who we are as a company.
importantly, let me also reiterate our commitment to increasing shareholder value and delivering the long-term targets presented at june's investor day. we appreciate your continued confidence and support. operator, we're now ready to take questions.
",2022-Q2,UNFI

operator
[operator instructions] our first question is from andrew wolf with c.l. king. your line is open.
andrew wolf -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
thank you. good morning. i know you don't guide on specific quarters, but is it fair to assume that, you know, the quarter you just reported, you beat your internal expectations decently? and could you comment, you know, how that is carrying through in the fourth quarter and your sense of the quarter on a profitability basis? and, you know, any color you can give as we start to think about fiscal 2023 as well. thank you.
john howard -- chief financial officer
sure. no, i appreciate the question, andy. this is john. i'll start.
i think with your questions there, i think i would say we were in line with what we're expecting for q3 internally. as it relates to q4 guidance, you're absolutely right, we generally don't provide quarterly guidance. but this is the one quarter of the year where it actually is indirectly provided with our full year guidance change. and by increasing our full-year guidance, i think you can get into -- back into the q4 number for you.
and then -- and say it again. what was the third question, andy? i forgot. oh, for fy '23. yeah.
obviously, for fy '23 at this stage, we're not going to provide any guidance other than what we provided with the -- the long-range plan at the investor day that we did last year, showing what our three-year cagrs would be for '22, '23, and '24. and as i think, all three of us said in our prepared remarks, we are on track to achieve those.
andrew wolf -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
all right. on the lifo charge itself at $72 million, i mean the first half was $30 million. so, clearly, i guess the accrual rate went up a lot. could you comment on that how that relates to -- is it inflation jumped that much? or were you -- had to increase the -- did you increase your accrual rate? or is there catch-up in there? just give us some color on why the actual number is so high compared to what you were accruing at.
and also, i guess tie that to what's going on with inflation.
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. and you're absolutely right, andy. it is all tied to the inflation that we saw -- that uptick that we saw in q3. that's what's driving that number.
there's no other dramatic or fundamental change in the calculation or in the underlying business. our inventory balances are substantially where we thought they would be. it's all being driven by that uptick in inflation that started in q3 for that noncash increase that you're seeing. and you're absolutely right, the way the math works on lifo, there's a full year catch up as that inflation rate changes throughout the year.
we have to capture the full rate impact every time we go through the calculation and our quarterly results, and that does represent a little bit of a catch up in q3 on the noncash. sandy?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
yes. i was just going to comment on the second part of andy's question regarding inflation. obviously inflation continues to be elevated, and it's a complicated topic through the p&l, drives topline and margin, but it has a negative impact on sales elasticity. it's really a direct result of continuing fill rate issues and then you've got the whole dynamic with promotions.
our focus is really on how we can help our customers through it, help them stay competitive by working to ensure that they have the most possible lead time on price increases, and then, specifically, through the summer, working with our suppliers to give our customers good sharp promotional price points, particularly in key value items. i'd also mention owned brands. chris mentioned the consumer energy around owned brands and our focus on providing the best possible offer there. and then, finally, as it relates to any margin that's moving around, we have our valuepath initiative, which the company fielded to yield a gross amount of $70 million to $100 million of savings by 2023, so that we can make it all work as the different parts of the external environment move around.
andrew wolf -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
thanks. and i'll just ask a quick follow-up instead of my third question. sandy, you mentioned, trying to get promotions and kvas to your clients -- your customers. how challenging is that when the product is basically short and there's so much inflation? i mean, are you dipping into your own pocket to help out your customers in a sense?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
well, it's actually a process of working with our customers and our suppliers. our customer base is a really important source of growth for our suppliers. and as i mentioned, one of our initiatives is to help make them more visible and to connect the dots. and so, we're having, i think, good success with a number of our merchandising programs.
and, for example, we have a very big sales show that starts this afternoon in connecticut, where we have literally thousands of customers coming in to meet with suppliers to put in place programs, to buy products, set in place promotional plans for the rest of the year. and by working hard to make them visible to each other and connect the dots, i think we're having pretty good success in terms of doing everything we can to help them be as competitive as possible.
andrew wolf -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
great. thank you. i'll get back in line.
operator
the next question is from scott mushkin with r5 capital. your line is open.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. so, i wanted to explore a little bit more, the better, i guess, offering that you guys have to your customers and understand how quickly you think you can gain some market share. what i'm specifically referencing is the single truck, single invoice accompanying the services.
as we've written, those are -- you guys seem to have a fairly meaningful competitive advantage. how quickly can you move to maybe gain more market share with that?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, scott. this is sandy. one unfi is really a multi-year process.
it started and was made possible by the acquisition that the company made at supervalu a few years ago. actions have already been taken to align the salesforce to align how we show up for suppliers, but there are incremental opportunities that involve our supply chain that involve our network of distribution and how our it is set up invoicing, etc. and i described it as a roadmap of continuous improvement. the market share gains really come, and chris talked about it, by virtue of the immediate impact, which is that we have a really wide assortment.
and customers need different kinds of products for different kinds of strategies and different kinds of formats. and we've seen in the cross-selling results, that chris described, impact, impact to market share, impact to give customer flexibility. and then, finally, i would say that -- and this has been particularly important in the last couple years and when the network is as stressed as it is having backup and the ability to move distribution from one center to another has been helpful in times of stress. so, you know, as you look at our sales results and think about the industry, we're gaining share.
but i think the share opportunity is really more about serving a broader range of customer needs. and as the company mentioned, we think that total opportunity is around $140 billion of which we've captured a small part of it.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
so, as a follow-up -- thanks, sandy. there's a follow-up to that though. how many customers actually have the ability to have one truck, one invoice? i mean, how far along is it? i mean, is it like handful, or is that something you can offer to more? that's my first follow-up. and my second follow-up is if this is successful, how should we think about capex spending in your capacity if you start grabbing a lot of share, if you're able to execute this -- the one unfi.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
well, i would describe the transformation as early stage on some of the supply chain and distribution changes. from a capital standpoint and eric is here, and you can comment, eric, i think it offers us an opportunity to get both effective and more efficient as we redesign the supply chain. we have a big initiative right now to understand the network design and to plot that plan. and then, finally, as it relates to capital, to the extent that we're able to drive the capacity of the supply chain, that's obviously capital friendly, but it also creates the opportunity for us to make progressive estimates and technology and potentially automation.
that'll drive up our quality level and obviously with each investment a very disciplined rate of return. but, eric, do you want to talk a little bit about your plans there?
eric dorne -- chief operating officer
yeah. i mean, scott, thanks for that question. as sandy mentioned, we are looking at incredible options across the country to maximize the use of our current capacity, as well as capacity that we need to add to sustain growth. and as far as automation goes, we are actively pursuing options where it makes sense.
as a reminder, we just added automation in southern california and the pacific northwest, and we are expanding our automation capability in the mid-atlantic states in the coming months. so, i think we're making the right choices, and we're keeping pace with the options we have to support our growth.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
perfect. thanks guys.
operator
the next question is from john heinbockel with guggenheim. your line is open.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
so, first thing, guys, maybe you can address the power of scale in this environment, right, with inflation as high as it is, should be more valuable than ever. obviously, but then you've got to get the product, right? so, maybe talk about the ability to lean into scale. and is the benefit to come more down the road, right, when supply is a little more readily available? that's sort of number one. and then, two, right, if you think about the opportunities, right, versus new customers coming on to your platform versus picking up new items, right, from some of the existing players.
where is the opportunity bigger right now?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
hi. this is sandy, and i'm going to pass this over to chris in a second. but scale shows up for the company in a lot of ways. it shows up, as i mentioned, in flexibility, when we need to be able to move distribution around.
clearly, we're an important customer to our suppliers, so we're able to show our suppliers a large opportunity and make an important case to them that they should take good care of 32,000 customers that we have. and as the fill rates have, i think we mentioned in the script, started to stabilize and slightly improve here toward the end of the third quarter, what we hope will happen is that we'll start to see further acceleration and promotional activity from our customers -- sorry, from suppliers. and that, in turn will, drive value for our customers, and the flywheel that i mentioned will be started. but chris, why don't you drill into a few more specifics?
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. hey, john. so, absolutely our scale, if you look at our private brands business, we're able to have a very large private brands portfolio that we can pass on to our customers. we have buying power in our professional services business, where we're able to acquire services at rates of our scale that we can pass on to our customers.
and then if you look at just our buying power on our fresh business, you know, we're very, very large fresh national fresh player. and there's not many if any national fresh players. and we have some purchasing power with that as well. as far as the size of the opportunity, as we laid out, that's a $140 billion addressable market.
the largest portion of that $78 billion lays with new customers. but the reality is that the $38 billion opportunity with existing customers, those are the wins that we're putting on the board every week. if you think about a conventional customer that wants to get into natural products, we can flip the switch on that, a conventional customer that wants to expand its meat and produce with us. we can flip the switch on that very quickly because we've already set them up as an account, we already have the truck going from the warehouse.
and so, i would say we get more frequent wins through our existing customers, and we're very excited about more than doubling the business, the opportunity to more than double the business with existing customers. but from a pure scale standpoint, of course, there's more white space of customers that we're not currently serving.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
john, sandy here. one other comment about scale. the other thing is the flip of the coin. a couple weeks ago, i was on a northern midwest tour of local customer meetings, one in minneapolis, one in green bay.
and in those meetings, our merchants were working on local product supplier opportunities, promotional plans for the summer. i saw our deli and specialty team bring together a cheese merchandising opportunity that leverages local cheeses in those markets. and so, there's a lot of very, very local conversations going on between our regionally based sales and merchandising organization. and obviously, supply chain is very local as well.
so, on the one hand, there's scale, but the flip side is to stay really close to the independent customers in markets around the country, which is core to our culture.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
and maybe a quick follow-up. you talked about volume up 2.5%, right, which would include new customers. is there any way to tell on a comp basis what volume or cases are doing? and, you know, is it possible if inflation stays elevated that volume could be, i don't know, flat to down on a comp basis? and i guess as long as drop sizes up, it would really impact the economics right off the drop.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
yes. we're not going to talk on a forward basis about that, john. but what i would say is i think our volume growth has stayed pretty consistent through the second and third quarter that we just reported. and our focus, you know, as i mentioned, around inflation is to work really hard with suppliers to give our customers the right kind of merchandising opportunities and price points to support their unit volume as they compete.
so, we'll continue to watch that and report out each quarter, but it's been fairly consistent for the past couple quarters.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
the next question is from eric larson with seaport research partners. your line is open.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yes. thanks, everyone. thanks for the question. nice quarter.
john, maybe -- either john or sandy, you know, in this environment that we're in, obviously it's pretty fluid, you've got high inflation, you've got consumers scrambling to probably, you know, pay their bills and meet their -- and get their groceries at a reasonable price. are you seeing any meaningful shifts from branded to private label to different alternatives? and then when you put that into perspective, are the cpgs actually doing more merchandising here? are the values of the merchandising programs higher? and that's where you generally have a pretty good profit center is when you have high levels of merchandising. can you give me an update on what those two questions, you know, kind of what i'm asking there?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
sure. and i'll make a comment, this is sandy, and then i'll give it over to chris. i think we mentioned that we saw some acceleration in the quarter, strong acceleration in private label brands. i think the interesting thing about our customer base and our product line is that we actually show up wherever the customer and the consumer is positioned.
and so, you've really got both, you've got high-end customers who are still spending money on high-end things. and then there's an acceleration in own label. and then as it relates to suppliers, it's still kind of dynamic because fill rates are still stressed, but they're getting a little bit better. and the conversation with our suppliers that we had at various industry conferences, and i sat through about 30 meetings, is all about the opportunity that our customers bring them.
diverse channel structures are really important to cpgs, and unfi's customer base is nothing but that. and so, while there's still a dampening and promotional efforts versus where we wanted to be and where we expect it to be, we're i think being successful with our merchants that working with vendors, and we continue to focus on improvement to get promotional dollars to the proper places with our customers so they can be successful. chris, do you want to add any more detail?
chris testa -- president of unfi
yeah. just a quick addition is, look, we saw the fill rates decline from q4 to q1 and then again, q1 to q2, but they stabilized in q3, actually slight uptick sequentially. the promo dollars have a lag behind fill rate. so, it's not immediate to the fill rate improvement and we fully expect as fill rate continues to approve and we're hearing from manufacturers there's less temporary unavailable.
they're feeling optimistic about get healthy dates and the promo dollars will follow, but there's a lag called a three-month lag between the fill rate improvement and the promo dollar improvement. in the meantime, as sandy mentioned, we are seeing a shift toward private brands, and we had private brands acceleration, and we are working with our suppliers to get those key value items and all the promo dollars we could secure through our shareholders, for our customers to help them get through this period.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
so, without -- and thanks for those comments. so, without actually talking much about any kind of fiscal 2023 guidance or anything, it sounds like the promo environment could be a bigger tailwind for you in f '23 than in f '22. and can you quickly compare f '22 to f '21 on the promo rates and the programs? has it been a big benefit this year or no?
chris testa -- president of unfi
well, no. our promo dollars are slightly above flat year over year. and that frankly wasn't two expectations, right? we expect that fill rates to continue to improve like they were doing through the end of the last year at this time. but they're roughly flat year over year.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
got it. ok. thank you.
operator
the next question is from mark carden with ubs. your line is open.
mark carden -- ubs -- analyst
good morning. thanks a lot for taking my questions. i wanted to dig into the market contraction you mentioned that continued into 3q. so, we've heard from some of the large pronounced merchants, they've seen some wallet share shift from discretionary categories into consumables.
is this adding up with what you're seeing? and how does it impact your view on market contraction over the next few quarters? could the degree of contraction ease more than you were anticipating? thanks.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, as we mentioned, the volume that we saw in the quarter really was consistent from q2 to q3. and, in fact, we saw independence actually start to gain share a little bit in february and march and april. and i'm not sure whether the dynamic is that fuel prices are going up and therefore the drive to away from home is kept people closer, or just that independents are continuing to do a really good job of staying close to their customers with meal replacement and other unique offers. as i've traveled around the country, i have seen some extraordinarily agile and very, very creative approaches to customer attention in the independent customer base.
and so, the general outlook that we would have is that the winners are going to continue to win. and our job is to be front and center to try to help them, whether it's core execution or value added programming or connecting with suppliers. and that's exactly what we're going to do.
mark carden -- ubs -- analyst
great. and then another follow-up on inflation. i know there's a ton of variability, but if you plan out your business, how long are you now expecting for these kinds of elevated rates to last? and then if we do start to, a year from now, see deflation, how much of an impact could that have on your margin structure?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
yeah. we spend 100% of our billable hours looking at how we can get better for our customers and very little at playing amateur economist. they certainly are elevated right now, and we don't see a real change. having said that, as you would expect, we scenario plan multiple potential scenarios.
and interestingly enough, the actions that we would take in virtually every scenario are approximately the same. we have to make sure that we're showing up for our customers and buying right and keeping them competitive. we have to work hard on our execution so that we're a partner of choice. and then we've got to keep our cost structure tight so that we stay agile in the face of whatever the scenario is.
and that's been our focus as we prepare for next year. and i think we'll be in strong shape regardless of the scenario.
mark carden -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks so much guys, and good luck.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
thank you.

our final question comes from kelly bania with bmo. your line is open. kelly bania, your line is open. please go ahead.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking our questions. i wanted to ask a couple about retail. first, the retail growth of about 2% was just a little lower than the rest of your segments.
and i was wondering if you could just help us unpack that a little bit and understand the factors driving that, maybe cross-selling could explain some of that as that benefits your other segments. but any color you can comment on there?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
sure. i mean, our retail business has been performing really well since the acquisition and has held and i think in some cases grown share, particularly in twin cities. sales in the quarter were solid from a market perspective. it was very competitive up there.
we invested in promotional dollars. but more importantly, for that business, we invested in capability, in digital capability to craft more personalized promotions to understand pricing and revenue management capability and several operating initiatives. so, the net-net is we're pleased with our retail business. the volume in the quarter was market-competitive, but a number of initiatives that give us confidence that the outlook for our retail business is strong.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and can you also just expand on the factors driving the ebitda margin rate decline there? you mentioned some of these investments, but could you help unpack that between gross margin, sg&a? were these planned? or how reactionary were these two -- the need to maybe do some more promotions?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think in general, one of our kpis is to expand ebitda margin, and we expect to do that and have actually year-to-date. in the quarter, we invested in supply chain as we continue to make sure that we're giving our customers the best possible service in what continues to be a pretty dynamic operating environment. and the operating margin contraction was really minor.
that said, we have a number of initiatives through valuepath, and we expect as we look forward. and there's a little bit of a crystal ball, but our strategy to continue to make our operating expense more efficient should be back on track as we go ahead.
john howard -- chief financial officer
and, sandy, if i can build on that a little bit, there were some specific items that were cycling in '22 that we've talked about before, including that monetization of riverside, which creates a rent expense, which didn't exist last year. we knew health and wellness expense was going to come back on us in '22 as more people are going back for medical procedures. and we've been open about the save a lot transaction that that service fee that we were providing them for the past five years that also ended in fy2022.
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
yeah. john, thank you. and importantly, i guess the last point to share with everybody is that as the business is proceeded, it is performed in line with the expectations that we had in that regard.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. and i guess, i'm sorry if i missed this, but did you just provide the inflation rates? and any color you are seeing across the different customer segments, and if you can, are willing to just help us understand a little bit more what you're hearing from your supplier landscape in terms of more price increases on the horizon?
john howard -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, i'll start with the number on the inflation. so, as we talked about for q3, our 9.2% growth, roughly 2.5% of that was volume-driven. so, when you think about inflation making up the rest of that and that's net of elasticity and other aspects related to our pricing and business model, but volume was roughly 2.5%.
and then the rest of it would be attributed to the inflation. as it relates to some of the supplier information, i'm not sure if we have, or if we disclosed that before.
chris testa -- president of unfi
no, we haven't all. hey, kelly, this is chris. it's not -- inflation isn't really a channel thing. it's a product segment thing, right.
so, it's based on the suppliers. in the fresh business you're seeing, you know, changes happen daily, as the commodity prices go up and down, depending if we're talking about produce or proteins or so forth. with the center store, the thing that we are focused on is making sure we have enough lead time to inform and adapt to our customers and making sure we're doing everything we can to get corresponding promo dollars to keep our customers -- keep the volume and our customers going. i can't pinpoint any single category in the center store grocery where inflation is higher than the other.
as you've read and we've all heard, it's really across the entire segment. certainly, there's been some certain categories, sunflower oil, for example, that have been impacted by the war. but those are sort of really, really small targeted segments. but in general, it's been across the entire center store.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and i guess, as you look across your customer base between the different retail strategies that you have -- that they have between value or mainstream or premium, are you seeing some shifts in terms of trends, particularly on the volume standpoint or promotional standpoint, as you just communicate with your retailers?
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
yes. kelly, this is sandy. i think, again, we're seeing some macro trends on categories. we're seeing acceleration in owned brands in particular as almost in parallel to the spike up in inflation.
relative to retailers, they're really operating where they're positioned. and as i mentioned earlier, the situation with the customer base is bifurcated. upper-end consumers are still spending money, and they're spending money on upper-end things. now, there maybe a little shifting between restaurants, and there's dynamism between restaurants and meal replacement strategies with retailers and then as sort of mainstream retailers.
and then those that are more value oriented are certainly seeing that side of the customer base emphasize value for money. and there's a lot of price sensitivity and time-to-month sensitivity as folks move away from their snap payment. so, the net effect of all that is, is that we have to show up where the retail strategy -- retailer strategy is. and we're seeing the winners win.
and we are fortunate enough to be doing business with a lot of winners.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.

operator
good morning. my name is chris, and i'll be your conference operator today. at this time, i'd like to welcome everyone to the unfi fiscal 2022 third quarter earnings call. [operator instructions] steve bloomquist, vp of investor relations, you may begin.
steve bloomquist -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us in unfi's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. by now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release issued this morning. the press release and a supplemental slide deck are available under the investors section of the company's website at www.unfi.com.
joining me for today's call are sandy douglas, our chief executive officer; john howard, our chief financial officer; chris testa, president of unfi; and eric dorne, our chief operating officer. sandy, chris, and john will provide a business update. after which, we'll take your questions. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that comments made by management during today's call may contain forward-looking statements.
these forward-looking statements include plans, expectations, estimates, and projections that might involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks are discussed in the company's earnings release and sec filings. actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements. and lastly, i'd like to point out that during today's call, management will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures.
definitions and reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures are included in our press release. i'll now turn the call over to sandy. 
sandy douglas -- chief executive officer
thank you, steve, and good morning, everyone. we appreciate everyone joining us for today's call. our third quarter results again validate our team's ability to successfully perform in the face of a challenging and unpredictable environment, with capabilities that we believe will continue to create value for our various stakeholders. during the quarter, we continue to navigate industrywide challenges, including inflation, where the latest food-at-home reading was 10.8% higher than last year, record-high fuel costs, low but improving fill rates, and challenging labor shortages.
all of which continue to impact our business and our customers. while we expect many of these issues to persist through the fiscal year, we're encouraged by the improvements we're beginning to see. supply levels for many products are increasing, which led to our finishing the quarter with the second highest fill rate month of the fiscal year. in addition, we continue to make strides in stabilizing our workforce even against a constrained labor backdrop.
these improvements are in large part due to the actions that we're taking to proactively secure product on behalf of our customers and improving the associate experience, many of the associate-friendly programs we've spoken about before, including scheduling flexibility and accelerated pay options. and they're now positively affecting our driver vacancy rate, which decreased to 9% at quarter's end. in addition, we continue to make progress in lowering our dc vacancy rate, which improved to less than 7% at the end of the third quarter. while consumer mobility has undoubtedly improved from the early days of the pandemic, the fact is that more people continue to work from home and take advantage of more flexible ways of working.
coupled with tighter management of household budgets in the face of high levels of food inflation, we expect food-at-home sales to remain strong. our diverse customer base, paired with our expansive portfolio, positions us favorably to serve customers and consumers as they react to inflationary pressures and the macroeconomic trends. whether consumers stay upstream with more premium offerings, or downstream in the value segment in a downturn, we are there to serve both markets. in short, we have the breadth and agility to win and to help our customers succeed in a variety of macro environments, including one with shifting customer preferences.
we're pleased that our performance reflects continued sales gains from both existing and new customers, and allows us to increase our full year sales and earnings guidance under what we believe to be a more transparent and meaningful definition of adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps, which john will address shortly. our fuel the future strategy is working and is setting us up for long-term sustainable growth and positioning us to grow our share of $140 billion addressable market that we outlined last summer. as we improve our execution and move further along the spectrum from distributor to value-added partner for our customers and suppliers, we continue to see the benefits of several clear differentiators that we're working to build upon: our core customer service capabilities and the over 30,000 independent, innovative, and segmented retail food locations we service; the scale and capability of our north american supply chain; the breadth of our product and services assortment; and finally, our talented, experienced and incredibly dedicated associates. by leveraging these competitive advantages to better serve our customers and suppliers, we see significant opportunity to accelerate growth, expand margins, and create incremental value for shareholders.
to that end, we've identified four focus areas to guide our execution of the fuel the future strategy that we believe will enable us to successfully deliver the three-year fiscal year '24 financial targets that we outlined at last summer's investor day. these four priorities are: one, to deliver significant value to our customers; second, to improve the way we partner with our suppliers; third, to provide our associates with unmatched career opportunities; and fourth, to support our communities and the planet through our wide-ranging and ambitious esg initiatives. to deliver more value to our customers, we are focused on improving all aspects of our sales and supply chain execution to provide our customers the products and services they need when they need them so that they can compete and win in the marketplace. we're implementing a wide range of improvement initiatives to enhance our customer value proposition by making it easier to do business with us.
a cornerstone of this effort is our one unfi initiative, which aims to create a single point of contact for our customers, one ordering system for all purchases, a single delivery of all products on one truck, and a single invoice. in addition, we're bringing customers new and innovative ideas and solutions that go well beyond selling them traditional grocery products. bringing more value to new and existing customers will drive future success with cross-selling and help us convert our robust new business pipeline into actual sales. we've spoken before about the key growth platforms that sit at the heart of our ability to enhance our customer value proposition, fresh, owned brand, and professional services.
we're actively investing in people, technology, and infrastructure to deliver fresher produce and continued brand innovation at a time when customers and shoppers are increasingly seeing the value in these products and in services ranging from data analytics to revenue growth management that position us as more of a consultant to our customers. these platforms are a critical component of our plan to drive continued earnings improvement and are expected to deliver 25% of unfi's adjusted ebitda by the end of fiscal 2024. chris will speak to these platforms in more detail shortly. to improve the value we deliver to suppliers, we have a real opportunity to provide value-added insights to strengthen their segmented marketing efforts by helping our customers become more visible to our suppliers.
one example of this is the high-volume ethnic stores we service that may not report scanner information to traditional data analytic companies. the broad insights we can provide on an aggregated basis make unfi a more valuable partner to the supplier community, as companies are able to develop incremental programs to build their brands and, in the process, bring more investment and growth to our entire ecosystem. our clear focus is to be the best partner we can be to our customers and our suppliers through better execution and expanding our capabilities. our commitment to providing unmatched opportunities for our associates stems from the recognition that they are what truly sets us apart.
our associates are the key to our culture of innovation, our ability to execute, and our ability to deliver on our mission of helping make our customers and suppliers stronger, our supply chain better, and our food solutions more inspired. as a testament to how instrumental our associates are to our business, many of our customers that i visit with talk about our people as our greatest strength. and their dedication is evident in everything they do. we are therefore intensely focused on our people plan, which has been designed to ensure that unfi is a preferred employer that offers unique opportunities for career growth.
at the same time, our people plan aims to equip employees with the tools that they need to help the company achieve its goals. and finally, our efforts to support our communities and the planet builds on our long-standing commitment to doing what's right and the recognition that better food can only come from a healthy planet and that clean air and water are crucial to a safe and nutritious food supply. we view this as a critical opportunity to innovate and leverage our scale to address the impact that our company and our partners have on our people, our communities, and our world. under our better for all plan, we have ambitious goals to reduce waste, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and advance sustainable agriculture to ensure a lasting supply of high-quality, healthful, and nutritious food.
this plan helps us stay laser-focused on the issues where we can move the needle the most over the next decade. we are pleased that unfi is the first public food distributor and wholesaler to have its climate targets, which were announced last month, validated by the science based targets initiative. i am proud of the many initiatives we're undertaking and urge you to read our 2021 esg report that we issued this spring. as the report outlines, we are now in our second year of integrating both sasb and tcfd recommended disclosures, and we are continuing to evolve and improve our reporting.
for example, we reported that in fiscal '21, we saw a 2% improvement in fuel efficiency, which was largely the result of working with our customers to consolidate orders so we could further optimize deliveries and reduce fuel consumption and continue to make additional progress in fiscal 2022. before i turn it over to chris, let me underscore a common thread across my comments, which is to simplify and communicate the operating focus underpinning our fuel the future strategy. as i mentioned earlier, we have a very large and attractive addressable market opportunity. our strategy to capture the opportunity is simple.
we are focused on getting better at what we do. we're working toward enhancing our capabilities and improving our end-to-end execution for the benefit of our customers, suppliers, associates, and, by doing so, importantly, our shareholders. we will be taking a very disciplined approach to value creation through focusing on those strategic areas that will drive economic profit instead of growth simply for growth sake. we believe this will contribute most to shareholder value creation.
and as we get better, we expect this to create a flywheel effect in which the business will grow, will gain market share, and, in turn, enhance shareholder value. in summary, as pleased as i am with the progress we are making and our confidence in meeting or surpassing our three fiscal 2024 financial kpis for growth in sales, adjusted ebitda, and adjusted eps, i'm even more excited by the improvement opportunities that we see ahead. chris?
chris testa -- president of unfi
thanks, sandy. good morning, everyone. on today's call, i'll provide further color on our sales for the quarter and our sales pipeline that we expect will deliver future growth. i will also highlight the performance of our growth platforms and our wholesale operations, and comment on the operating environment and performance of our retail stores.
total net sales for the quarter were $7.2 billion, a 9.2% increase over last year's q3, with widespread growth across all channels. we continue to believe that our customer-centric approach is driving results, and we are pleased that growth in the quarter again came from both selling more to our existing customers, as well as the acceleration in business we're now doing with new customers, each a key growth component of our fuel the future strategy. cross-selling gains with existing customers added an incremental $95 million of revenue in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date incremental total to $260 million. this keeps us on pace to achieve nearly $1 billion in cross-selling revenue in fiscal 2022, volume that would have not happened without the supervalu acquisition.
our continued success in selling more to existing customers, coupled with new customer wins, contributed to volume gains of approximately 2.5%, with the balance coming from inflation. looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our ability to grow our business further based on our unmatched product and services portfolio. our new business pipeline remains robust, with opportunities that range from expanding category and product penetration with existing customers to new business wins with retailers who operate captive distribution centers. for both smaller volume wins as well as larger new customer business, we believe our customer-centric approach to growth will help us earn new business and allow us to help make our customers stronger.
a key part of our mission that lies at the heart of everything we do. the strength of our pipeline is largely attributable to the breadth of our assortment, as well as the growth platforms we've spoken about on past calls, including owned brands, fresh, and our professional services. i've spoken before about the scale of our owned brands portfolio, which includes over 5,000 skus across multiple categories and price points that give our customers a competitive advantage in the marketplace. we're pleased that owned brands are gaining momentum, as sales increases accelerated throughout the quarter.
we believe this reflects the strengthening of our program and increasing consumer demand in light of higher food and gas prices. we're also communicating to our customer opportunities to drive business where national brands are in allocation or fill rates into unfi are challenged. inbound service level on owned brands were again higher than those of national brands this quarter by approximately 700 basis points. on the product side, we've updated the packaging of our wild harvest free-from line.
our new plant-based meats were the first category to roll out featuring the new brand refresh, and we're excited for additional categories launching this summer. as for fresh, unfi's produce sales in the third quarter outpaced the u.s. produce market by more than 300 basis points, which we believe reflects the continued investments we're making in people, processes, and infrastructure to improve the quality and freshness of the produce we sell. this includes the addition of several new experienced leaders with backgrounds in large produce operations.
leveraging the growth of the perimeter to private label, we've recently expanded our wild harvest organic produce offering to include organic bananas. and we have over 110 more private label skus and process, all packaged with our new look and clear organic communication. lastly, is our professional services business that we've spoken about before and which we believe is a key differentiator for unfi. the growth rate and adjusted ebitda from our services business was more than double that of our wholesale business, as more and more customers recognize the value we bring to their operations by leveraging our scale and expertise.
among the wide variety of services and solutions we offer, our retail shelf services continues to be one of the most widely used. unfi has over 1,000 associates who manage a variety of in-store services on behalf of our customers. these services include ordering, item assortment, and packing out shelves. in addition, we regularly update a significant amount of planograms across our network and, last year, completed over 1,100 store resets that keep store offerings current and relevant to the consumer.
these services are in high demand for both customers and suppliers, especially considering today's labor market challenges. retailers love it because unfi experts manage their shelves, which allows them to focus more strategically on store operations, competition, and other parts of their business. we continue to add services to our portfolio based on customer feedback and the evolution of the industry. our professional services business is constantly evolving, building upon unfi's culture of innovation and embracing what's next to help our customers drive profitable, sustainable growth and gain market share.
touching briefly on operations, our third quarter operating costs again reflected the investments made to ensure we can service our customers in the very best way possible, as well as the continued improvement being made on the labor front. as sandy stated, our distribution center vacancy rate improved again this quarter, moving from 9% at the end of q2 to 7% at the end of q3. after stabilizing our driver pool in q2, we are pleased that the vacancy rate improved to 9%, a three-point gain that we view as a clear signal that the programs we've described before are taking hold. our results also included a modest net impact from higher fuel prices sandy spoke to despite the portion of the increase shared by our customers, as well as the fuel hedges we have in place.
finally, our retail stores continue to perform in a challenging environment. sales were up over last year, although margin investments led to lower adjusted ebita compared to last year's third quarter. our strategy continues to be optimizing our retail network, which includes appropriate levels of investment in facilities and technology. we're pleased with the performance of our recently remodeled stores, whose sales gains have significantly outpaced total retail, and technology investments have helped simplify the business and improve performance.
looking forward, we'll open our 31st cub wine & spirits store before the 4th of july and have approved the replacement of an older, outdated store that we expect will improve its already strong market position. we're also planning to invest in enhanced promotional planning tools that will bring us additional capabilities around customer-specific promotions based on individual buying habits. one of the benefits of having operating stores in two markets is we're able to test and refine merchandising and operational ideas that we can then share with our wholesale customers to help make them stronger. as sandy said, we're pleased with our performance this quarter and optimistic about the finish to fiscal '22.
the environment remains unpredictable in several ways, but we're confident in our agility and our resilience as we help our customers succeed through all that unfi has to offer. let me now turn the call over to john.
john howard -- chief financial officer
thank you, chris, and good morning, everyone. on today's call, i'll cover our third quarter financial performance, balance sheet capital structure, and our fiscal 2022 outlook. as chris stated, third quarter sales were $7.2 billion, an increase of 9.2% from last year's third quarter, which brings our year-to-date sales to $21.7 billion, a 7.1% increase compared to last year. as stated in this morning's press release, we've revised our definition of both adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps to exclude the impact of lifo expense.
lifo is a noncash item which impacts gross profit, as well as adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps as previously calculated. historically, the effective lifo has been relatively small, stable, and predictable, but the recent inflationary environment has driven it meaningfully higher because we believe the volatility in this year's noncash label expense meaningfully distorts our underlying operating performance. beginning with this quarter, we will adjust lifo expense out of gaap net income and the gaap eps in computing adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps. this revision has no impact on the economics, cash flows, or gaap results of our business, and more closely aligns unfi with how our industry peers treat lifo and, we believe, better reflects the company's underlying operating performance.
we also believe it will help investors assess our underlying performance in a manner consistent with how we make business decisions. on this revised basis, adjusted ebitda for the third quarter totaled $196 million, a 5.9% increase compared to the $185 million in last year's third quarter when computed on the same basis. on a year-to-date basis, adjusted ebitda totaled $616 million compared to $564 million last year, a 9.2% increase compared to last year. our third quarter gaap earnings per share totaled $1.10, including the impact of a noncash labor charge described above and a gain on sale from our riverside distribution center purchase and sale leaseback transaction that we've discussed before.
including several smaller items and the tax impact of the adjustments, adjusted eps on the revised basis also totaled $1.10 for the third quarter compared to $1 in last year's third quarter on a revised basis, an increase of 10%. on a year-to-date basis. adjusted eps totaled $3.56 per share, a 22% increase over fiscal 2021 year-to-date total of $2.93 per share. within the p&l, our gross profit rate, excluding lifo, increased approximately 30 basis points compared to last year's third quarter, driven by the impact from inflation and the ongoing benefits from our valuepath initiatives.
retail gross profit rate declined modestly in the quarter compared to last year. third quarter operating expense rate increased approximately 30 basis points over last year's third quarter. as chris discussed, our elevated operating expenses continue to reflect investments we're making to ensure the best possible service to our customers in a rapidly changing environment and the impact of inflation. turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with outstanding net debt of $2.38 billion, a $34 million reduction compared to the second quarter.
our adjusted ebitda net leverage ratio, which now also excludes the impact of lifo in the denominator improved to 2.9 times. our supplemental slides present the adjusted ebitda net leverage ratio for previously reported periods under the revised definition. we've successfully refinanced and extended the maturity on our $2.1 billion asset-based revolver by over three and a half years, which brings its maturity to june 2027. we're pleased to have completed this transaction, which leaves our secured term loan as the next material scheduled maturity in october 2025, over three years from now.
we've also upsized the abl to $2.6 billion, immediately increasing available liquidity by $500 million. we've reduced the rates on borrowings and the unused portions under the facility, and we've transitioned from libor to sofr as the benchmark rate for the borrowings under the abl in the term loan facilities. let's turn to our outlook for fiscal 2022. as outlined in our press release, we're raising our full year outlook for net sales to a new range of $28.8 billion to $29.1 billion, a 7% increase over fiscal 2021, reflecting the underlying performance of our business.
as for adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps, our original ranges were $760 million to $790 million and $3.90 to $4.20 per share, respectively. these included a lifo charge of $25 million, or $0.30 per share. under the revised definition i spoke to earlier, which excludes the lifo charge, our original guidance for full year adjusted ebitda would have been within a range of $785 million to $815 million and adjusted eps within the range of $4.20 to $4.50 per share. in light of our performance year to date, improved net sales outlook, and a careful assessment of the current operating environment, we're increasing our guidance for both adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps.
we now expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of $810 million to $830 million and adjusted eps to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.90 per share. for comparison purposes, the tables in our press release and slides 10 and 11 of our supplemental slides illustrate these changes. our outlook for full year capital spending remains unchanged at $250 million, as does our outlook for full year debt reduction, which continues to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million. using our revised definition for adjusted ebitda, we now expect the yearend leverage to be approximately 2.6 times.
as for the longer-term fiscal 2024 targets we provided at last june's investor day, we're affirming the average annual growth rates provided for net sales of 3% to 5%, adjusted ebitda of 6 to% 10% and, adjusted eps of 12% to 18%. under our revised definitions for adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps, which exclude lifo, our fiscal 2024 target for adjusted ebitda would be at least $950 million and adjusted eps would be at least $6. as sandy stated, we remain confident in our ability to achieve these targets. as you've heard, today's operating backdrop continues to be both challenging and unpredictable, yet we remain optimistic about serving our customers and delivering on our updated outlook for the year.
operator, we're now ready to take questions.
