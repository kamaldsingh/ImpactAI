[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of chris mcginnis. your line is open.
chris mcginnis -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. nice quarter. sort of ask you -- we're starting to see some price increases starting to come back into raw materials, how does that change the competitive landscape? and then i guess also as you head into the holiday season, how rough can you be in both take market share it maybe in this kind of an environment? thank you.
jeff sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
chris, can you repeat the question? i missed the first couple of sentences, sorry.
chris mcginnis -- analyst
no, no. yes. so just on, you're starting to see some raw material price on the nuts starting to increase, how does that change the competitive landscape that's out there? and then especially as you start to enter the holiday season, how much is there that give you sort of touch on that?
jeff sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
sure. yes. so a lot of the prices already are committed, not just from us, from most people in our space. holiday programs usually get committed in the middle of the year.
so not a lot of activity can take place beyond what's already been committed from a pricing standpoint. the big challenge is that these markets increase, like almonds, we're seeing in walnuts, is what kind of pricing commitments people had prior to new crop. we feel our inventory positions are very well balanced and so we're not going -- be able to -- we won't be in a position where that will negatively impact us, but rather it's difficult to take opportunities when prices are going up. on the other hand, when prices come down like we're seeing with cashews, just gives us some opportunities to do a little bit more promotions or deeper promotions where we have some flexibility from a pricing standpoint or offer different merchandising.
so -- yes.
chris mcginnis -- analyst
and i know you mentioned that it's early, but the new product offerings that you've developed with the butter and the chips, just -- can you maybe just talk a little bit about where you're starting that out and maybe how big versus maybe some of our your other brands, just where your distribution points are, just to kind of give us a scope of how big that could possibly be?
jeff sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
sure. so the both programs are in our orchard valley harvest brand portfolio. our current acv or distribution is about 45% for our orchard valley harvest brand. we believe this is -- it's a new product line, both the nut butters, it's going to be focused in the produce section.
we literally just launched it within the last four weeks, so we haven't seen velocity numbers per se that give us any basis on how well it's doing, but we're confident that the consumer feedback we've received is very positive and retailer feedback we've received is positive. so a lot of opportunities to expand, not only our current acv but get into a lot of new retailers. and then the chickpea chip, it's our first product launch outside of the nut category, we just see a lot of opportunities with other plant proteins and so brand new as well, just launched within the last couple of weeks, it's in a few test markets at this point. so a little bit early to tell, probably next quarter call we'll be able to give a little more color on how it's doing.
chris mcginnis -- analyst
ok. and just on the requirement of fisher recipe nuts, can you maybe just talk a little bit about how you're going to better maybe approach the volume decline that you saw, just kind of given kind of the competitive nature?
jeff sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
sure. so our official recipe from -- even there we're still at a 63% acv, so there's still a lot of opportunities to expand that product line at other retailers. obviously, we've had some headwinds with a major retailer expanding their private brand program, taking space away from our fisher recipe nuts. but at the same time, there's a lot of opportunities to make up a lot of their volume at other retailers and also we've got very strong promotional programs going into the holiday season with other retailers where we feel we potentially could expand and grow those retailers much faster.
so i'm very optimistic on what we can still do with fisher recipe going forward.
chris mcginnis -- analyst
ok. and then just two kind of last questions. just -- we've seen some solid growth on the top line, as you start to get to the back half of the year, it progress throughout the year, how do you think that holds up with kind of what you see today? and then same question, except just on the margin term, if anything's changed there since last time we talked?
jeff sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
from a volume standpoint, tim, i think we've got a lot of new programs that we're focused on, especially in the commercial ingredient channel, we believe there should be upside in the back half of the year with some of the things our teams are doing in that area. the consumer team continues to obviously expand our distribution with the nut butter launch and then the chickpea chip and then some of the other innovation products that we'll be looking at in the coming year. we also still feel there's private brand opportunities ahead of us that we're pursuing, and so just we believe there's opportunities in the back half of the year as well to keep up some strong volume. and as from margin standpoint, mike, do you want to touch on that?
mike valentine -- chief financial officer
sure. i'll take that chris. and then in respect to margins going forward after december, as we've said in the past, as we switch from old crop to new crop, of course, our crops and selling prices need to be realigned. and as always we -- it's our objective to try and maintain gross profit per pound as we do that realignment.
now of course we've got a lot of work to do there with -- as jeff mentioned, cashews and walnuts increasing -- i'm sorry, walnuts and almonds increasing and cashews decreasing, but we do expect to have that aligned pretty quickly early in the third quarter.
chris mcginnis -- analyst
gotcha. thanks for taking the time and appreciate all the answers. good luck.

your next question comes from the line of tim call from capital management corporation. your line is open
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
congratulations on another great quarter. i was wondering, when do the comparisons get easier on a year-over-year basis with the fisher recipe nut brand in that large retailer that changed its format?
jeff sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
can you repeat the question? sorry, i keep missing [indiscernible]
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
i'm wondering when the year-over-year comparison for sales get easier with that large customer that's changing their recipe nut.
jeff sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
sure. sorry about that. yes. so i would expect -- we've made up a lot of volume in other retailers going into the holiday season but it was still was a big piece of our business.
i would say it would probably -- it will level off by january. you might see a little bit of softness in the next two months, but like i said, the consumer team has done a great job replacing a lot of that volume, but definitely leveled off by january going forward.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
but that headwind started over a year ago, so it's -- the majority of the impact has been seen, is that right?
jeff sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
yes. correct.
mike valentine -- chief financial officer
chris, that's basically been almost a 2-year process. and that increasing private label distribution is essentially ramped up over that period. and then of course, this quarter was impacted by the fact that we did not -- we lost some space on the holiday display areas, but i think we've pretty much lost just about as much space as we're going to lose. so as jeff said, going forward, in january, should be a pretty fair comparison.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
and then when we -- when you look at that customer, are your sales to that customer below average margins for your consumer business?
jeff sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
we don't give specific customer margin information, but i would say it's in line with other retailers.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
well, congratulations again on a great quarter. thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the john b. sanfilippo & son inc. first quarter fiscal 2020 operating results conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr.
mike valentine, chief financial officer. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
mike valentine -- chief financial officer
thank you, margaline. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings conference call. thank you for joining us today. on the call with me today is jeffrey sanfilippo, our ceo; and jasper sanfilippo, our coo.
but before we start, we want to alert you to the fact that we may make some forward-looking statements today. these statements are based on our current expectations and they involve certain risks and uncertainties. the factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various sec filings that we have made, including form 10-k and on occasion form 10-q. we encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about the risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business.
starting with the income statement. net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by 6.6% to $217.8 million in comparison to $204.3 million from last year's first quarter. the increase in net sales resulted from a 9.1% increase in sales volume, which we define as pound sold to customers. the increase in net sales from volume was offset in part by lower selling prices, primarily for cashews, pecans and walnuts, which in turn resulted from lower commodity acquisition costs.
the increase in sales volume came from a 17.4% increase in sales volume in the consumer distribution channel. this was offset in part by a 13% decline in sales volume in the contract packaging distribution channel, and that was due to a reduction in unit ounce weights implemented by a customer for its entire product line in this channel and reduced promotional activity by another customer in this channel. sales volume was relatively unchanged in the commercial ingredients channel. the sales volume increase in consumer distribution channel was mainly due to increased sales of private brands snack nuts and trail mixes from distribution gains with existing and new customers.
now looking at sales volume for our brands in the consumer channel. sales volume for fisher recipe nuts fell by 30.3% as a result of loss of distribution for some items due to the continued expansion of private brand recipe nuts offerings at a major customer. sales volume for orchard valley harvest brand increased by 12.4% and that was mainly from increased sales with existing customers. fisher snack nut sales declined by 8% due to lost airline business and club business.
southern style nut brand sales volume increased by 40.3% due to distribution gains with new grocery customers, primarily. gross profit increased by 28.2% to $42.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $33 million in last year's first quarter. gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 19.4% in the current quarter from 16.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. the increases in both gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily due to the increase in sales volume and also the lower commodity cost for cashews, pecans and walnuts.
total operating expenses declined to 10.6% of net sales for the current first quarter from 11.2% of net sales for last year's first quarter, and total operating expenses increased by $300,000. the increase in total operating expenses resulted mainly from an increase in compensation expense, which was largely offset by declines in shipping, advertising and amortization expenses. interest expense in the quarterly comparison declined by $400,000 and that was due to lower average debt levels during the current first quarter. as a result of the above, net income was $12.9 million or $1.12 per share diluted compared to $6.6 million or $0.57 per share diluted for last year's first quarter.
now taking a quick look at inventory. the total value of inventories on hand at the end of the current first quarter declined by $24.6 million or 13.6% compared with the total value of inventories on hand at last year's first quarter. the decline in total inventory value was primarily attributable to lower acquisition cost for pecans, cashews and walnuts as well as lower quantities on hand for finished goods. the weighted average cost per pound of our walnut and dry food input stocks on hand at the end of the current first quarter decreased by 25.9% compared to the weighted average cost at the end of the first quarter of last year.
this decline was due to lower acquisitions cost for pecans, cashews and walnuts and a shift in product mix in our inventory to lower-cost peanuts. at this time, i will now turn the call over to jeff sanfilippo, our ceo, who will provide further additional on our operating results for the current first quarter. jeff? 
jeff sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning, everyone. the first quarter of fiscal 2020 marks the third consecutive quarter in which we reported record net income and record earnings per share. first quarter diluted eps nearly doubled to a record $1.12 per share.
we also continued our goal of returning profits to our stockholders by increasing our regular annual dividend by 9% to $0.60 per share and supplemented that with a special dividend of $2.40 per share, both of which were paid in the fiscal 2020 first quarter. i'm very proud of the entire jbss team for delivering such strong results to kick off the year. the 9.1% sales volume growth was driven by success in our consumer distribution channel, which accounted for approximately 70% of total sales volume in the current first quarter. a significant portion of this increase was attributed primarily from distribution gains for private brand products as mike mentioned.
the company has been successful in not only expanding items with existing customers but also gaining additional retail accounts. we continue to enhance our innovation pipeline across our big business segments and brands to support this growth. sales volume growth for our southern style nuts and orchard valley harvest brands also contributed to the sales volume growth in the consumer distribution channel. sales volume growth for our orchard valley harvest brand has been especially impressive with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 27% since we started reporting on sales volume performance for the brand in fiscal 2015.
we continue to face headwinds with our fisher recipe brand at a major customer due to a competitive private brand program, as i've discussed in past earnings calls. however, the sales and marketing teams have done an incredible job gaining expanded distribution at other retailers to offset potential volume declines going forward. we believe our holiday promotional and merchandising programs are very competitive and are intended to allow fisher to compete against private brands more effectively. as we enter the harvest season, we have seen acquisition cost for walnuts and almonds begin to increase in the 2019 crop year, which falls into our current 2020 fiscal year.
we also continue to see declining acquisition costs for cashews. peanut prices are relatively flat versus last year, and the pecan harvest has just begun, so we don't have visibility yet on how prices will compare to last year, but we believe our inventory positions are well aligned with our commitments and selling prices going into this busy holiday season. turning to sales by our business channels. net sales in the consumer distribution channel increased $11.7 million, or 12.7%, and sales volume increased 17.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.
the sales volume growth, as i mentioned earlier, was driven by increased sales of private brands snack nuts and trail mixes. the consumer teams have been successful in building valuable retailer partnerships to pursue private brand opportunities, but we also continue to invest in our brands. the consumer sales and marketing teams were busy launching and selling in several new branded product lines this past quarter. i will discuss this when i cover category updates.
as mike mentioned, net sales and sales volume in the commercial ingredients distribution channel was relatively unchanged in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. the commercial ingredient teams are focused on developing stronger customer relationships with key distributors and executing the placement and selling of our branded products at a major noncommercial business customer. net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel decreased by 13.9% in dollars and 13% in sales volume in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. we have reported declines in this channel for the past several quarters as a result of a key customer downsizing rates and other factors.
but we believe the volume going forward should level off with a few new pieces of business that will begin shipping in the remaining quarters of this fiscal year. turning to category updates in the snack, recipe and produce segment. let me share a review of our branded performance and consumption trends both for the quarter and for the fiscal year. as always, the market information i'm referring to is iri reported data, and for today it's for the period ending september 22, 2019.
when i refer to q1, i'm referring to 13 weeks of the quarter ending september 22. references to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period one year ago. we look at the category on iri's total u.s. definition, which includes food, drug, mass, walmart, military and other outlets.
unless otherwise specified, when we discuss pricing, we are referring to average price per pound. break out of the recipe, snack and produce categories are based on our custom definitions developed in conjunction with iri, and the term velocity refers to the sales point of distribution. first, let me review some category dynamics. the total nut category increased in sales dollars and pound volume by 1% in q1.
overall prices in q1 were flat versus the prior year. now i'll talk about each category more in-depth, starting with recipe nuts. in first quarter, the recipe net category decreased 4% in dollars and increased 4% in pound volume sales. prices decreased on walnuts and pecans by 11% and 6%, respectively, resulting in a 2% pound volume increase on walnuts and a 5% increase on pecans.
our fisher recipe nuts decreased 22% in dollars and 25% in pound sales for the quarter versus last year. as a result, fisher share in the category decreased 5.8 pound share points versus last year. the sales volume decline for fisher recipe nuts resulted from lost distribution, as i mentioned, on items in a retailer that continue to expand their private brand program. in the food grocery channel, fisher recipe increased 9% in pound volume, driven by an increase of total points of distribution of 18%.
now let me turn to the snack category. in q1, the snack category increased 2% in dollar sales and 1% in pound sales. fisher snack increased 8% in sales dollars and declined 3% in pound volume sales in q1. decrease in dollar sales is a result in shifting product mix from peanuts to cashews and mix nuts.
the brand increased in total distribution points by 21%, as fisher oven roasted never fried expanded beyond the core fisher geography. as we have discussed on previous calls, fisher over roast never fried offers consumers a full line of nuts that are dry roasted, not roasted in oil, including whole cashews, deluxe mix nuts, mix nuts with peanuts, almonds, pecans and a unique almond cashew blend as well as peanuts. we continue to support the brand with an integrated marketing plan of in-store merchandising and customer programming, radio targeted digital and social media marketing and fsis. the brand is performing well where we have achieved our shelf price objective, and we hope to expand to new markets in the future.
in q1, the produce nut category decreased 4% in dollar sales and 3% in pound volume sales. ovh, our produce nut brand, decreased 4% in dollars and increased 7% in pounds and iri reporting customers. ovh share pound increased 0.2% versus last year and were flat dollar sale share year versus year ago. total points of distribution increased by 2% versus last year.
orchard valley harvest launched two exciting new products in the first quarter, bringing pure and simple goodness to the specialty nut butter and chips categories. the brand's spread 'n dip peanut butter offers consumers a natural, non-gmo, peanut butter package in a tub for easy dipping as well as the more traditional use of spreading on bread. the butters are being sold into the produce section of stores to tap into the consumer behavior trends of snacking on fruits and vegetables with peanut butter. we also launched orchard valley harvest chickpea chips, which are light, crispy chips made from chickpeas.
consumers are increasingly looking for interesting salty snack alternatives to potato chips, and orchard valley harvest chickpea chips taste great while offering consumers three grams of protein per serving. it's too early to tell how the new products are doing, but initial feedback from retailers is encouraging. in closing, it takes a talented group of dedicated employees across an entire organization to deliver consistent, strong results as we have done here at jbss. i'm very proud of every person in our company, their leadership and commitment to providing outstanding service and value to our customers and consumers is best-in-class, and i believe the best in our industry.
success also requires smart strategies for sustainable growth, to maintain a competitive advantage, to be differentiated, to be a valuable partner and to remain relevant. the leadership team has spent the past few months reviewing our current strategies. we assessed what we are doing well and what we can improve upon, we've evaluated competitors, markets, our supply chain and consumer consumption trends. we are in the process of defining what our strategic plans will be for the next three years to continue to deliver consistent strong results.
the management team and all our dedicated employees have a steadfast commitment to develop business plans that create shareholder value and provide relevant, profitable, value-added products and services to our customers and consumers. we appreciate your participation in the call, and thank you for your interest in our company. i will now turn the call back over to mike.
mike valentine -- chief financial officer
all right. thank you, jeff. at this time, we will open the call to questions. margaline, would you please queue up the first question?
",2020-Q1,JBSS
-0.8196,1.0,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from chris mcginnis with sidoti.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
hey good morning. thanks for taking my questions and i just wanted to say sorry for your loss. my condolences.
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
thank you sir.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
great quarter though. i did want to just start to dig in maybe a little bit about -- maybe just on the top -- of the revenue around consumer. obviously the snack and trail mix has been pretty successful. just out of the growth from that, how much of that is maybe newer wins versus i guess, more recent wins versus prior wins? and i'm just trying to figure out how long of a runway do you have for that product? and are you still gaining new distribution contracts at this point?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
so chris, we -- some of it is business that is cycling against new business we picked up a little bit less than a year ago but some of it has been wins that were earned last year. we're still expecting against them because we picked them up prior to q2. but there is some new business that was built into q2. that is just starting to ship now.
so i don't have the percentage of what that looks like, but it's a combination of both business we picked up last year and business that we just were awarded in q2.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
great. ok. and maybe just to touch on fisher. you obviously, you ended your comments with a little bit of pressure in that segment.
i guess if you look over the next 12 months, is there a way to gain back some of that distribution? and how are you thinking of that in that ability to gain your share back? thanks.
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
yes. so our recipe, fisher recipe program is still underdeveloped in some areas. there are some retailers that we have very little to no distribution. our acv, although it is strong, there's still opportunities for growth.
it has become an extremely competitive category for both the branded side and for private brand recipe program. so it will be a challenge, i won't deny that. but at the same time, there are still growth opportunities to try to sustain and build that brand in the future.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
great. and then maybe just touch on orchard valley. i know volumes were up 7% for the quarter. but i think in your -- in the prepared remarks, you talked about a 22% decline in volume from one customer.
can you just maybe dig into that a little bit? and would your growth for the quarter have been that much more significant if not for that loss of the customer? thank you.
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
and that would be correct. so we don't have control over what retailers -- how they market, how they merchandise, where they put product, how much space they allot. the produce programs in the u.s., a lot of retailers are still trying to figure them out and how to make them successful. and so if we had the same distribution placement that we had the prior year, you would have seen much stronger results with orchard valley harvest.
at the same time, we've built a lot of new distribution with the brand. and so in spite of a major retailer not being successful with the produce program, we've got a lot of other new volume that is going to be sitting to make up some of that decline.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. and as they figure out i guess how to market it, is there possibility that that volume comes back to you?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
yes, it is. yeah. so we're working with retailers to help strengthen their produce departments and so there are opportunities to regain some of that distribution and volume.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
great. next is maybe just on the commercial side that increased. can you just maybe talk a little bit about -- of the increase in the volume, how much of that was from the new distribution points versus the peanut kind of byproduct?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
yes. mike, you probably know that number better than i do from a percent standpoint.
michael valentine -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. roughly about 75% of the pound growth came from new distribution gains with new foodservice customers.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
great. and so that number is pretty sustainable going forward in terms of kind of the improved environment?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
correct. yes. but we've been very focused strategically on building our noncommercial sales distribution in the commercial ingredient channel, and so we are really just starting to see the success of efforts in the past to build that business within noncommercial. so a lot of this is just beginning now.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. and then just two more questions. just one on the contract packaging business. i know it's a small piece of business now, but i guess just how big is that opportunity to turn things around? it sounds like it's obviously pretty near term with these new contract wins.
michael valentine -- chief financial officer
i can take that jeff. so the new volume that we picked up with an existing customer is probably going to result in something like maybe a 10% pickup in sales volume for the channel. we also have some other existing customers who have over a year ago introduced new products that were not successful, and they're about ready to launch some new products. so hopefully they'll be successful.
and we can get back in the black in that channel.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
great. and then just last question around the margin profile. obviously i think this year is the strongest gross margin in the last 12 months of your record earnings. can you maybe just dig in? it sounds like there are some operating efficiencies you gained or manufacturing efficiencies you gained.
can you just talk through a little bit of how sustainable it is versus the prior year obviously a pretty big increase?
jasper sanfilippo -- chief operating officer
sure. chris, this is jasper. i'll answer that. a lot of the operating efficiencies kind of came across broad areas that we focused on.
some were software implementations where we're measuring efficiencies throughout our warehouse which made us obviously more efficient in that supply chain handling which ultimately lowered both overtime and headcount. some of it was due to capex that we invested in, in previous quarters particularly around automation and removal of headcount. so we're pretty confident that we will continue to see those efficiencies going forward.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. and i guess just sustainable -- if you think about a long-term operating margin target that you feel comfortable at. can you maybe just give a little bit of kind of thought process around that?
michael valentine -- chief financial officer
ok. i'll take that call. this is mike. so obviously, we've had a great calendar year with some of the highest margins we've experienced in quite some time.
and a lot of that, really, the majority of that improvement is coming from substantial sales volume increases. so i think as long as we can continue this pace of growth in respect of pounds sold to customers, we can expect to have higher than historical average gross profit margins.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
great. great. thanks for taking the time today and good luck in your q3.
michael valentine -- chief financial officer
thank you chris.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from tim call with capital management corporation.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
i'm sorry for your loss. he certainly built a great company.
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
thank you tim.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
with the fisher recipe nuts lost distribution or lost promotion one year ago in the second quarter, you lost some distribution from a major customer in the same line. is this the same major customer?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
yeah, that would be correct. so they transitioned some of the branded business to private brand last year. and then this calendar year, they transitioned additional skus to private brand. so it is the same customer.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
are they still a major customer for you?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
they are. they are a major customer. but at the same time, our sales and marketing teams have done a great job building other distribution with other retailers and building strong fisher branded recipe programs with. so at this point i believe and i'm not sure if howard's in the room, our fisher recipe volume is actually greater with the other customers than they were with this one specific customer.
unknown speaker
jeffrey, this is howard. i'm in the room and that is a correct statement.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
ok. compared to original levels from three years ago, i guess, for this customer, are -- what are their relative sales? have they fallen for that customer by two-thirds? or have they fallen by half? or like how far are we through this process?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
so we don't anticipate many other changes in their program although we don't have any control over what retailers do. we believe we have a great success story. you go back to them with our results for this holiday season and we've got great success stories at other retailers that have supported the brand and that have worked with us to work on promotional activity. so we believe we've got a great success story to go back and try to regain some of that market share, market basket that we had with them.
and so -- but again, it's difficult to know exactly what retailers will do. the nut category overall -- sorry, go ahead.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
that was a great explanation. thank you very much. and then squirrel brand, you expect that to continue to grow at a high double-digit percentage?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
yes. squirrel brand is another brand. we have strong brands as i mentioned in our portfolio. we're really just getting started with squirrel brand.
the opportunity is there as our indulgent brand are significant. we've created a lot of new products around the brand. we've offered a lot to retailers. and i believe we're really just getting started with building distribution there.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
well thank you and congratulations on a great quarter.
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
thank you. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. i'm showing no further questions at this time. i will turn the call back over to mr. michael valentine for any further remarks.

thank you sherry. good morning everyone, and welcome to our 2020 second-quarter earnings conference call. thank you for joining us today. on the call with me are jeffrey sanfilippo, our ceo; and jasper sanfilippo, our coo.
before we start, we want to alert you to the fact that we may make some forward-looking statements today. these statements are based on our current expectations and they involve certain risks and uncertainties. the factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various sec filings that we have made, including form 10-k. we encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about these risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business.
starting with the income statement. net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased by 2.7% to $246.4 million in comparison to net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 of $253.3 million. the decline in net sales was primarily due to lower selling prices which resulted from a shift in sales volume from higher-priced pecans and walnuts to lower-priced trail and snack mixes, peanuts and cashews. lower selling prices for pecans and cashews which resulted from lower commodity acquisition costs for these nut types also contributed to the overall reduction in selling prices.
the decline in net sales from lower selling prices was largely offset by a 4.8% increase in sales volume which we define as pounds sold to customers. sales volume increased by 4.2% in our consumer distribution channel, mainly from increased sales of snack nuts and trail and snack mixes from distribution gains with new and existing private brand customers. increased sales for our orchard valley harvest and southern style nuts brands also contributed to the sales volume increase in the consumer channel. sales volume increased in the commercial ingredients channel by 14.5% and that was mainly due to distribution gains with new foodservice customers and increased sales of peanut crushing stock to peanut oil processors.
sales volume declined in the contract packaging channel by 2.5% primarily from a reduction in promotional and merchandising activity by some of our customers in this channel. looking at sales volume for our brands in our consumer channel, fisher recipe nut volume decreased by 29.8% as a result of lost holiday display distribution at a major customer in favor of their private brand recipe nuts. the 6.5% increase in sales volume for orchard valley harvest was primarily driven by distribution gains at new and existing customers as well as the introduction of new products. the 6.4% decrease in sales volume for fisher snack nuts resulted mainly from reduced promotional activity for inshell peanuts at a customer who does not report to iri.
the 42.9% increase in sales volume for southern style nuts came from increased promotional activity. net sales for the first two quarters of the current fiscal year increased to $464.3 million from $457.6 million for the first two quarters of last year. the increase in net sales was attributable to a 6.8% increase in sales volume in the year-to-date comparison. the increase in net sales from the sales volume increase was largely offset by lower selling prices.
and the reduction in lower selling prices resulted primarily from those factors that led to lower selling prices in the quarterly comparison. sales volume increased by 10% in the consumer distribution channel primarily from increased sales of snack nuts and trail and snack mixes from distribution gains with new and existing private brand customers. the increased sales for orchard valley harvest and southern style nuts brands also contributed to the sales volume increase in the consumer channel. sales volume increased by 6.3% in the commercial ingredients channel for the same reasons i noted in the quarterly comparison.
and sales volume declined in the contract packaging channel by 7.9% and that was primarily from a reduction in unit ounce weights implemented by a major customer roughly a year ago for its entire product line and a reduction in promotional and merchandising activity by some customers in this channel. second-quarter gross profit increased by $7.1 million and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 20.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 from 16.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin were mainly due to increased sales volume, manufacturing efficiencies, reduced manufacturing spending and lower acquisition costs for pecans and cashews. gross profit for the first two quarters of the current year increased by $16.4 million and gross profit margin again as a percentage of net sales increased to 19.9% from 16.6% for the same period last year.
the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin in the year-to-date comparison occurred primarily for the same reasons i cited in the quarterly comparison. total operating expenses for the current second quarter decreased by $700,000 in the quarterly comparison. and as a percentage of net sales, total operating expenses was unchanged at 10.4% compared to last year. the decrease in operating expenses was due to decreases in advertising and freight expenses, which were partially offset by increases in incentive compensation and commissions expenses.
total operating expenses for the current year-to-date period decreased to 10 and a half percent of net sales from 10.7% for the first two quarters of last year. and total operating expenses decreased by $400,000 in the year-to-date comparison. the decrease in total operating expenses for the current year-to-date comparison primarily was attributable to the same factors i cited in the quarterly comparison. interest expense was $400,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $800,000 last year and interest expense for the first two quarters of the current year decreased to $1 million from $1.7 million for the same period last year.
in both cases, the decreases in interest expense were attributable primarily to lower total average debt levels. net income was $17.5 million or $1.52 per share diluted for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $11.3 million or $0.98 per share for the second quarter of last year. and both net income and eps were record amounts for second quarter. net income for the first two quarters of 2020 was $30.4 million or $2.64 per share diluted compared to net income of $17.9 million or $1.56 per share diluted for the first two quarters of fiscal '19.
now, taking a quick look at our inventory numbers. the total value of our inventories on hand at the end of the current second quarter increased slightly compared to the total value of inventories at the end of last year's second quarter. and the weighted average cost per pound of our raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand at the end of the second quarter increased by 7.1% compared to the weighted average cost at the end of the second quarter last year for our input stocks. the increase in the weighted average cost per pound of our input stocks was mainly due to higher acquisition costs for walnuts which was offset in part by lower acquisition costs for pecans, cashews and peanuts.
and now, i will turn the call over to jeffrey sanfilippo, our ceo, to provide additional comments on our operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. jeffrey? 
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
thank you mike. good morning everyone. i'd like to start my comments by acknowledging the passing this week of our former chairman and ceo, jasper sanfilippo, sr. he led the company from 1963 to 2006 and was a strong mentor to many of us at jbss.
and jasper sr. was an amazing father to me and my brother, jasper. our dad loved this company and worked hard to build the foundation for a successful business along with family members and a team of talented associates. after he retired, like clockwork he would call and ask me or jasper almost every day, how is business, how is the company doing? tuesday, before he passed away, he asked that question again.
the answer was, dad, the second quarter of fiscal 2020 marks the fourth consecutive quarter in which we reported record net income and earnings per share. he had a big smile and was so proud of everyone in the company for achieving such strong, consistent results. i will miss those conversations and we will always remember jasper sanfilippo, sr.'s contributions to jbss. it's been a very strong first half of fiscal 2020.
we paid a second special dividend during the second quarter of $2 per share providing value to our stockholders. as has been the case in recent quarters, we saw strong sales volume growth in our consumer distribution channel from increased sales of private brand snack nuts and trail mixes. we also had significant sales volume growth in the foodservice sector of our commercial ingredients channel as new relationships with group buying organizations enabled us to expand our product lines into alternative channels. the entire organization is working hard to drive continuous improvement projects, optimize supply chain efficiencies and enhance jbss margins.
i would like to thank our operations team for generating meaningful savings from the various efficiency initiatives they completed during the current second quarter which helped drive our increase in gross profit. turning to sales review by jbss channel, net sales in the consumer distribution channel increased $7.4 million or 3.8% and sales volume increased 4.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. the company had strong success working with key partners to drive growth -- volume growth within their private brand programs, especially in the snack and trail mix categories. sales volume for fisher snack nuts decreased 6.4%, primarily as a result of reduced promotional activity for inshell peanuts.
sales volume of fisher recipe nuts decreased 29.8% from lost holiday distribution at a major customer as mike mentioned earlier, but our teams mitigated this volume decline with significant volume growth at other retailers. and sales volume of orchard valley harvest products increased 6.5% due to distribution gains at new and existing customers and the introduction of new products. sales volume of southern style nuts increased 42.9% due to increased promotional activity. in the commercial ingredient channel, net sales increased by 8.9% in dollars and 14.5% in sales volume.
the sales volume increase for the quarterly period was primarily due to distribution gains with new foodservice customers. the sales and marketing teams have done a great job expanding distribution with noncommercial accounts and winning business with new distributors. and there was also an increased sales volume of peanut crushing stock to peanut oil processors in the second quarter. net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel decreased by 8.7% in dollars and 2.5% in volume in the second quarter.
the decline in sales volume primarily came from reduction in promotional and merchandising activities again as mike mentioned. but the company was awarded new business in this channel from a major customer which will start shipping in our third quarter. we anticipate the new business will have a positive impact, overcoming the negative volume trends the company has experienced in this channel the past few years. turning to category updates.
i'm happy to share category and brand results with you this morning both for the quarter and for the fiscal year to date. as always, all market information i'll be referring to is iri reported data and for today it's for the period ending december 29, 2019. when i refer to q2, i'm referring to 13 weeks of the quarter ending december 29. references to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period one year ago.
we look at the category on iri's total u.s. definition, which includes food, drug, mass, walmart, military and other outlets, unless otherwise specified. and when we discuss pricing, we are referring to average price per pound. breakouts of the recipe, snack and produce categories are based on our custom definitions developed in conjunction with iri.
the term velocity refers to the sales per point of distribution. first, let me review some category dynamics. the total nut category decreased in sales dollars and pound volume by 1% in q2. overall, prices in q2 increased 1% versus the prior year.
now, i'll talk about each category in a little more depth. starting with recipe nuts. in q2, the recipe nut category decreased 5% in dollar sales, driven by a drop in average price per pound as pound volume sales were flat. prices decreased on walnuts and pecans by 5% and 7%, respectively.
our fisher recipe nuts decreased 32% in dollar sales and pound sales for the quarter versus last year. as a result, fisher's share in the category decreased 9.5 pound share points versus last year. the decrease in sales volume for fisher recipe nuts resulted from lost display distribution at a major customer in favor of private brand recipe nuts. in traditional grocery, which iri called the u.s.
food channel, fisher recipe increased 21% in pound volume behind an increase of total points of distribution of 21%. fisher continues to be the branded share leader in the recipe category when using a broader multioutlet definition or within the u.s. food channel. now, let me turn to the snack category.
in q2, the snack category increased 2% in dollars and was flat in pound sales driven by a 2% increase in average cost per pound. fisher snack increased 17% in sales dollars and 8% in pound volume sales in q2. the brand increased in total distribution points by 24%, as fisher oven roast, never fried expanded beyond the core fisher geography and increased in pound sales by 122% versus last year. the oven roasted, never fried subline also increased pound velocity by 12%.
in addition to the successful quarter, early reads on trial and repeat are solid. consumers are purchasing the product, enjoying their experience and repeat purchasing the item which is a good sign for long-term success. as we have discussed on previous calls, fisher oven roast, never fried offers consumers a full line of nuts that are dry roasted, not roasted in oil. these include whole cashews, deluxe mix nuts, mix nuts with peanuts, almonds, pecans and a unique almond cashew blend as well as straight peanuts.
as we expand into new markets, we continue to support the brand with an integrated marketing plan of in-store merchandising and customer programming, radio, targeted digital and social media marketing as well as fsis. in q2, the produce nut category decreased 5% in dollar sales and 9% in pound volume sales. ovh, our produce nut brand, decreased 22% in dollar sales and pound at ovh share pounds increased -- decreased 0.2 points versus last year. the volume decline was due to lost distribution related to the reduction of shelf space in the produce nut section at a major customer.
in q2, we continued to build distribution of our spread 'n dip line of nut butters by getting shippers out in the market to gain awareness and trial of this new product. likewise, we gained distribution of our chickpea chip line as well as the second -- in the second quarter. it's still early, but initial feedback from retailers on our new products is encouraging. in closing, we faced a number of challenges in the future which include, among others, potential acquisition cost volatility for almonds and increasing commodity cost for walnuts as well as intensified competition on pricing and for market share from both private brand and main brand nut products.
our fisher recipe nut sales have been negatively impacted recently due to this increased competition for market share, but we have strong brands in our portfolio with enormous opportunities for growth. we have a dedicated team of leaders throughout the company that are doing what matters most to deliver strong financial results. and we have the right strategies to continue to build our business and provide exceptional value and innovation for our customers and consumers. we appreciate your participation in the call and thank you for your interest in our company.
i will now turn the call back over to mike.
michael valentine -- chief financial officer
thank you jeffrey. we will now open the call to questions. sherry, please queue up the first question.
",2020-Q2,JBSS

[operator instructions] our first question comes from chris mcginnis of sidoti and company. please begin.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question and nice quarter. can you maybe just dig in a little bit just around covid and the pantry loading that you talked about. just maybe the impact you've seen on business in april, does that benefit continue, at least on the consumer side? and then i know you talked a little bit on the commercial side already.
but obviously, as restaurants are closed, that will be a negative impact. but we're starting to see states open. have those conversations started to change just on that side of the business? if you could just -- i know it's still early, but maybe just a little bit more update on what you saw in the more recent trends. thanks.
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
sure. good questions. so we did see a little bit of pantry loading and volume increase in the very beginning of april. there were still states that had just started closing in april, so we saw pantry loading at that time.
we see the trend leveling off. but i would say that as these stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions continue, you're seeing more consumers either eat at home and cook at home or they're ordering online for delivery. and so we expect to see that continue until these stay-at-home orders are lifted. so we should see a little bit of a bump in our consumer demand going forward.
as far as food service as states do open up, we are watching and monitoring them closely. and as they do open up, we are ready to start supplying those distributors and foodservice customers in most states with product. and we're starting to see a little -- but it's very early, because they're just starting to open up now and a lot of the restaurants have limited capacity, but they're allowed to let people in. and so we don't anticipate that foodservice channel coming back quickly anytime soon.
but the more states that lift restrictions, the better that will become in the future.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
sure. understood. and i guess just thinking about the commercial side, how much inventory -- i don't know how much that impacts the demand on your side that you think the distributors are holding. and maybe, i don't know, if you think about that in months.
is that a few months of maybe excess inventory that they have or do they move through that pretty quickly?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
typically, it's a month to month and a half of inventory. we are working with a lot of our distributors that, specific for our example, airline distributors, with their travel restrictions. we're working with them to try to move the inventory that they might have in-house to other locations such as food banks or places that are putting together meal kits for families.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. and then just thinking about the 9% growth that you were seeing just for that. can you maybe just dig in a little bit about what was driving that? is that newer account wins? is that a factor of pricing in the marketplace? can you maybe just dig in a little bit more? because that was obviously some pretty solid growth.
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
it's a combination, really. there was no one specific thing. some of it was new business that we picked up last year, especially in private brands. we've had good success with our oven roast never fried fisher distribution as i mentioned.
so we saw growth there. we saw some growth with new distribution in other areas of our business. so it really was a combination of a lot of different things.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. great. and then maybe if we can just move on to the margin front real quick. i don't know if there's a way to quantify maybe a margin benefit in the period, if there was one, just due to the extra volume coming through.
and then maybe on the reverse side of that, the higher compensation, safety measures are coming in, how do you see that playing out going forward? if you don't mind on that. thank you.
mike valentine -- chief financial officer
i'll start with the impact of volume on gross profit. so as you know, our gross profit dollars increased by -- let me just look out here, ok, by about $4 million and roughly 25% of that is just related to manufacturing efficiencies. and the other $3 million is just generated from the additional volume that we sold.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. so maybe a third of that, 75% is what, roughly i guess you would think?
mike valentine -- chief financial officer
a third of what?
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
of the covid, maybe the extra volume coming in from covid. i was just wondering if that played anything material on the margin front. so a little bit, i guess.
mike valentine -- chief financial officer
no, it's proportional to what we saw with sales.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
exactly. ok. great. and then maybe just going forward, just with the new measures in place and then also the pay increases.
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
so yeah, as far as the business going forward again we're going to watch foodservice. it's unfortunate because we had a lot of good new distribution in our foodservice channel leading up to covid-19, especially with noncommercial places that don't sell food as their main priority. and so a lot of that has stopped now with these travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders. so -- but we are going to watch what happens with these -- when these states lift their orders to follow-up on that piece of our business.
the team is looking at other opportunities, e-commerce, for example, in the consumer channel. we've seen enormous growth there. so we're going to follow what happens in e-commerce, both for our brands and for some of the private brand options that we produce, they are pursuing more e-commerce platforms. and then the cooking at home has become a big thing now that people are staying home.
and so we see growth in the recipe nut category and we see growth in this -- potential further growth in the snack category. and so -- and as far as employees, we're going to continue to monitor the situation with our employees. we extended our -- the increase in compensation through may 7, and we'll continue to monitor things. and if we need to do that further, we will do that to take care of our people.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
great. i appreciate it. thank you very much for taking my questions and good luck in q4.
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
ok chris. thanks.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from tim call of capital management corp. please begin.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
congratulations on a great quarter again. and your interest expense keeps going down partially as you pay down debt over time. do you think you might be debt-free within two or three years?
mike valentine -- chief financial officer
well, that's -- it depends what time of the year you're talking about, tim. we'll always be drawing on a revolver from time to time. and just as a reminder, that revolver usually peaks near the end of our third quarter. so at that time of the year, i'm sure there'll be some debt.
i think we have about three years left on our mortgages. and we have quite a few years left on our financing obligation for our selma facility.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
the special dividend, this is a little bit earlier in the year than when you usually announce a special dividend. does that -- and you have higher inventory now for seasonal reasons. so does that just mean you're that profitable of a company that you can pay a special dividend earlier in the year?
mike valentine -- chief financial officer
well, we want to be cautious about this. obviously, we had, as jeff mentioned, the second best quarter we've ever had in our history. and for that to be a third quarter, it's pretty unusual and remarkable. but we felt like given the performance in the quarter, it made sense for us to go ahead and pay a spring dividend.
but obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty going forward. and if it turns out that we may have to reduce our special dividend that we typically pay in august for this dividend, we're prepared to do so. hopefully, it won't come to that. and we certainly are committed to paying our regular annual dividend in august.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
the headwinds you face from losing a recipe nut customer, have those annualized now or is that no longer a headwind starting with this next quarter?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
yes, that's really annualized now. we're seeing some stable and actually growth in the recipe nut category, as i mentioned before, because people are staying at home and cooking. but we've cycled against the loss distribution on the shelf that we experienced. so you should see those numbers normalize for fisher going forward.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
some competitors like smucker's have put out announcements saying they're cutting promotional activity and just focusing on getting product on the shelves. are you considering a similar move? and how do you see the competitive environment changing in recent months?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
yes. so from a retail perspective, we're doing the same thing. a lot of it is actually being initiated by retailers who want to limit the number of people in their stores during this crisis. and so they're reducing their promotional activity and just focusing on the key staples and the key high-volume items that consumers are looking for as they come into the store.
so we have seen a decrease in trade spend and promotional spending as a result. also a little bit less shippers and different distribution vehicles that we used to use and promote our products, you're seeing some of that get mitigated as well as a result of more clean store environments and less people in the store.
tim call -- capital management corporation -- analyst
well thank you and congratulations on the new products and a great quarter.
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from bruce winter, investor. please begin.
unknown speaker
yes. thank you. when you sell ingredient nuts to -- for the use in power bars and stuff like that, do you sell fried ingredient nuts or oven roasted never fried ingredient nuts?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
for the ingredients, it's anything from raw materials to roasted products. the oven roast never fried is our -- is in our branded portfolio, our fisher branded portfolio. so we don't really use that or offer that type of product in the ingredient channel. it's not a focus for us.
but you're right, our businesses do use roasted or dry roasted nuts in their bars.
unknown speaker
are your oven roasted never fried healthier than what goes into those bars?
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
well, if it's a dry roasted nut that goes into a bar, it would be just -- it would be very similar to our oven roast never fried. correct.
unknown speaker
ok. got it. thank you.
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
sure.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the john b. sanfilippo & son, inc. third-quarter fiscal 2020 operating results conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mike valentino -- valentine, sorry, chief financial officer.
sir, please begin.
mike valentine -- chief financial officer
thank you norma. good morning everyone, and welcome to our 2020 third-quarter earnings conference call. we thank you for joining us today. on the call with me today is jeffrey sanfilippo, our ceo; and jasper sanfilippo, our coo.
before we start, we want to alert you to the fact that we may make some forward-looking statements today. these statements are based on our current expectations, and they involve certain risks and uncertainties. the factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various sec filings that we have made including forms 10-k and 10-q. we encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about these risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business.
starting with the income statement. net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by 4.9% to $211.6 million compared to net sales of $201.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. the increase in net sales was attributable to a 13.7% increase in sales volume which we define as pounds sold to customers. the increase in net sales from the sales volume increase was offset in part by a lower weighted average selling price per pound as the majority of the sales volume increase was driven by growth and lower-priced trail and snack mixes and peanuts.
lower selling prices for pecans and cashews which resulted from lower acquisition costs, also contributed to the decline in the weighted average selling price per pound. sales volume increased in the consumer channel by 19.3% which came primarily from increased sales of trail and snack mixes and peanuts and to a lesser extent, increased sales of cashews, almonds and mixed nuts, to existing private brand customers. sales volume increases for fisher snack nuts orchard valley harvest produce products and southern style nuts snack mix products also contributed to the sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel. now looking at sales volume for our brands in the consumer channel.
sales volume for fisher recipe nuts fell by 21.7% primarily from lost distribution at a major customer in favor of private brand recipe nuts. the 5.8% increase in sales volume for orchard valley harvest produce products resulted from distribution gains with a new customer, and the introduction of new items with an existing customer. and additionally, it also was attributable to increased promotional activity. fisher snack nut sales volume increased by 14.2%, and that was primarily due to increased promotional activity.
sales volume for southern style nuts increased by 41.4%, and that was due to distribution gains with new customers and increased promotional activity. sales volume increased by 9% in the commercial ingredients channel primarily from the sale of lower quality farmer stock peanuts to peanut oil processors in china. and sales volume decreased by 6.4% in the contract packaging channel primarily due to some lost business with one customer that increased its internal nut processing capacity. looking at the impact of covid-19 on our total sales volume for the third quarter, the 13.7% sales volume growth in the current quarter was attributable in part to pantry loading by consumers in anticipation of the shelter-in-place directives that ultimately occurred.
for january and february, sales volume increased by a total of 9.1%. we believe the increase in sales volume in january and february was primarily related to the factors i cited in our sales volume discussion earlier. in march 2020, sales volume increased by 23.6% compared to march 2019. after considering our sales volume growth rate for the first two months of the current quarter, we estimate that approximately one-third of the sales volume increase for the current third quarter was attributable to pantry loading.
within the commercial ingredients channel, foodservice sales volume was relatively unchanged from fiscal 2019 third quarter. sales volume increases in january and february were fully offset by a significant amount of order cancellations in march by foodservice distributors, and that was due to restaurant closures primarily. net sales for the first three quarters of the current fiscal year increased to $675.9 million from $659.4 million for the first three quarters of fiscal '19. the increase in net sales was attributable to a 9% increase in sales volume.
this increase in net sales from sales volume was offset in part by lower selling prices primarily due to the factors i discussed in the quarterly comparison. sales volume increased by 12.9% in the consumer distribution channel primarily for the same reasons i cited in the quarterly comparison as well. sales volume increased by 7.2% in the commercial ingredients distribution channel primarily from increased sales of peanuts to peanut oil processors including the ones i mentioned in the quarterly comparison. sales volume declined in the contract packaging distribution channel by 7.4% primarily for the reasons i cited in the quarterly comparison and also a reduction in promotional and merchandising activity by some other customers in this channel.
third-quarter gross profit increased by $4 million and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 20.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 from 19.2% for the third quarter of last year. the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily attributable to increased sales volume, manufacturing efficiencies and reduced manufacturing spending per produced pound. gross profit for the first three quarters of the current year increased by $20.4 million and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 20% from 17.4% for the same period last year. the increases in both gross profit and gross profit margin were mainly due to the reasons i cited in the quarterly comparison as well as lower acquisition costs for cashews and pecans.
total operating expenses for the current third quarter decreased to 11.1% of net sales from 11.6% for last year's third quarter primarily due to a higher net sales base. total operating expenses were unchanged as increases for incentive compensation, product donations to food banks and broker commissions were fully offset by decreases in legal expenses, consulting, freight and advertising expenses. additionally, we recognized a $700,000 gain from an insurance recovery. net recovery was related to a fire we had in our garysburg, north carolina facility which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
total operating expenses for the current year-to-date period decreased to 10.7% of net sales from 11% for the first three quarters of last year. and again, that was due to a higher net sales base. total operating expenses decreased by $400,000 as increases in expenses for incentive compensation, product donation to food banks and broker commissions were more than offset by decreases in legal consulting, freight and advertising expenses as well as the gain i mentioned from the insurance recovery earlier. interest expense for the current third quarter decreased to $600,000 from $800,000 in last year's third quarter.
and interest expense for the first three quarters of the current year decreased to $1.5 million from $2.5 million for the first three quarters of last year. the decrease in interest expense in the quarterly comparison resulted from lower interest rates. the decrease in interest expense in the year-to-date comparison came from lower average debt levels and also lower interest rates. net income for the quarter was $13.5 million or $1.17 per share diluted for the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to $10.3 million or $0.90 per share diluted for last year's third quarter.
and net income for the first three quarters of 2020 was $43.9 million or $3.80 per share diluted compared to net income of $28.2 million or $2.45 per share diluted for the first three quarters of last year. now taking a quick look at inventory. the total value of our inventories on hand at the end of the current third quarter increased by $9.6 million or 5.4% compared to the total value of inventory in last year's third quarter. the increase in the value of total inventories was primarily due to increased quantities of peanuts, cashews, almonds, pistachios and work in process inventory.
the weighted average cost per pound of our raw nut and dried fruit input stocks increased by 3.4%, and that was due primarily to increased acquisition costs for walnuts, and higher quantities of tree nuts compared to quantities of lower cost peanuts on hand. and now, i'll turn the call over to jeffrey sanfilippo, our ceo, to provide additional comments on our operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. jeffrey? 
jeffrey sanfilippo -- chief executive officer
thank you mike. good morning, everyone. the third quarter of fiscal 2020 marks the fifth consecutive quarter in which we reported record net income and diluted earnings per share. this quarter's results were the second highest for any quarter in the company's history.
this solid performance was driven by strong volume growth in our consumer distribution channel. we've talked a lot in the past about our strategies to make our consumer sales channel a larger portion of our overall business. i'm happy to report that sales volume in the consumer distribution channel accounted for approximately 70% of our total sales volume in the current third quarter. the increase in sales volume, as mike mentioned, was driven mainly by increased sales of private brand products complemented by increased sales for our fisher snack nuts orchard valley harvest produce products and southern style nuts snack mixes.
prior to the covid-19 impact on sales volume, we had strong volume with 6.8% growth in the first half of the current fiscal year, a 9.1% growth for january and february. our employees were already working very hard to deliver these results when the march sales volume surge occurred. during march, our business required even more effort, and our employees delivered with the majority of our orders shipping on time and complete. this truly demonstrates how committed our team members are in fulfilling our obligation to provide food to american consumers during these difficult times.
while we are meeting these unprecedented challenges, we took many measures to improve the safety of our employees. the company established a covid-19 crisis management team that meets daily to discuss risks faced by the company and mitigation strategies. we quickly began implementing work-from-home requirements for the majority of our office employees, staggering shifts and breaks for our production employees, installing partitions on lines where social distancing could not be affected, performing daily temperature screening for all employees upon arrival and providing face masks for all employees and requiring their use throughout our facilities. we also recognize the need to take a different approach to our employee compensation during this period.
consequently, we temporarily increased manufacturing employee compensation by 10% based on hours worked, extended personal time off weeks for those who are self -- in self-quarantine or ill and provided weekly allowances to cover costs incurred by those employees working from home. we also committed to supporting our communities and donated products valued at over $0.5 million to provide peanut butter and snacks to food banks located near major customers or facilities in the current third quarter. and we continued to donate food in these areas to help families in need. going forward, we expect sales volume in our consumer distribution channel to normalize as consumers adjust to their current circumstances.
food service sales which are within our commercial ingredient channel, had been growing this fiscal year and are within our -- and such sales represented 10% of our total sales volume in the current year-to-date period. however, we expect our foodservice sales to decline significantly in the coming months until its travel restrictions and restaurant closings are lifted. our procurement team is working closely with our domestic and global suppliers to source and maintain consistent inventories of raw materials, ingredients and packaging to provide a steady supply of our products to our customers and consumers. turning to a sales review by jbs channel.
in the consumer channel, as mike mentioned, it increased by 11.9% in dollars and 19.3% in volume in the third quarter. sales on -- was driven mainly by increased sales of trail and snack mixes and peanuts and to a lesser extent, from increased sales of cashews, almonds and mixed nuts with existing private brand customers. we did see a spike as a result of pantry loading in march, and we anticipate our consumer volume will remain steady going forward as consumers will eat more at home and order online with the state home and travel restrictions in place. net sales in commercial ingredient distribution channel decreased by 6.6% in dollars and increased by 9% in sales volume.
as i previously mentioned, we anticipate foodservice sales volume to decline in the coming quarter as a result of covid-19, but our teams are working hard to manage our inventories and look for growth opportunities, and they will be ready for business when travel restrictions and state home orders are lifted. net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel decreased by 17.8% in dollars and 6.4% in sales volume. one of our major customers in this channel provides a lot of products for convenience stores. and with covid-19 restrictions in place, we believe this business will continue to be flat to declining in the coming months until travel restrictions are lifted.
turning to category updates for the quarter and for the fiscal year. as always, the market information i'll be referring to is iri reported data, and for today is for the period ending march 22, 2020. when i refer to q3, i'm referring to 13 weeks of the quarter ending march 22. references to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period one year ago.
we look at the category and iri's total u.s. definition which includes food, drug, mass, walmart, military and other outlets, and when we discuss pricing, we are referring to average price per pound. breakouts of the recipe, snack and produce categories are based on our custom definitions developed in conjunction with iri, and the term velocity refers to the sales per point of distribution. first, let's review some category dynamics.
the total nut category increased in sales dollars and pound volume by 5% and 6%, respectively, in the third quarter. overall prices for the quarter decreased 1% versus the prior year. the volume growth in the current third quarter was attributed in part to pantry loading by consumers in anticipation of the shelter-in-place directives that ultimately occurred. the last two weeks of the quarter, sales for the overall category increased 36% in dollar sales and 41% in pound volume versus last year.
the previous 11 weeks saw the category flat in sales versus a year ago. now, i'll talk about each category in a little more in depth, starting with recipe nuts. in q3, the recipe nut category increased 8% in dollars and 13% in pound volume. prices for the category decreased 4% versus last year.
walnut and pecan pricing decreased by 4% and 7%, respectively. our fisher recipe nuts decreased 24% in dollar sales and 23% in pound sales for the quarter. as a result, fisher's share in the category decreased 7 points -- pound share points versus last year. the decrease in sales volume for fisher resulted from loss distribution at a major customer that we've talked about in the past.
in traditional grocery which iri calls the u.s. food channel, fisher recipe increased 29% in pound volume behind an increase of total points of distribution of 22%. fisher continues to be the brand share leader in the recipe category when using the broader multi-outlet definition and within the u.s. food channel.
now, let's turn to the snack category. in q3, the snack category increased 7% in dollar sales, 10% in pound sales. pricing declined 2% versus last year in the snack category. fisher snack increased 25% in sales dollars and 18% in pound volume in q3.
promotional sales for the brand increased by 17% and total distribution increased by 19% driving sales. fisher oven roast never fried continues to expand beyond the core fisher geography and increased in pound sales by 85%. pound velocity and total points of distribution increased by 5% and 6%, respectively, versus last year. oven roast never fried contributed 64% of the growth of the fisher snack business.
in addition to the successful quarter, trial and repeat continued to be solid. consumers are purchasing the product, enjoying their experience and repeat purchasing the item which is a good sign for long-term success. in q3, the produce category was flat in dollars and decreased 5% in pound volume sales and prices increased 5%. orchard valley harvest decreased 17% in dollars and 15% pounds and ovh pound share decreased 0.2 point versus last year.
the volume decline was due to loss distribution related to the reduction in shelf space in the produce section at a major customer. ovh shipments are up which is attributable to distribution of new items with a current customer that does not report data to iri and new brand distribution within traditional grocery. two recent orchard valley harvest line extensions are spread into peanut butter and our chickpea chips are available at a limited number of retailers. the spread 'n dip peanut butter taps into the popular consumer behavior of dipping fruits and vegetables and nut butters for healthy snacking.
ovh spread 'n dip makes it -- makes that easy with a wide mouth humus-like tub. both line and ovh chickpea chips offers -- offering taps into the consumer's desire for more plant-based snacks. both line extensions are being supported with in-store merchandising and social and digital consumer support. it's still too early to report on their specific performances, but we are excited about the potential to expand the brand into the nut butter and the chip categories.
in closing, it is extraordinary how the world has changed since our last earnings call just three months ago at the end of january. we will face challenges in the remaining periods of fiscal 2020, and there will be headwinds going into fiscal 2021 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. but our company and our team of dedicated leaders and frontline associates throughout our organization are steadfast and strong. we will adapt quickly to the dramatic changes in consumer behavior and sees opportunities where they arise.
the company has strong brands in our portfolio with enormous opportunities for growth. and we have a manufacturing footprint that can meet new consumer demand for retailer private brands and our branded business in e-commerce. we will continue to prioritize the health and productivity of our associates and follow the most up-to-date guidance from health authorities to ensure we are doing all that we can in our manufacturing facilities and offices to keep everyone safe. lastly, we have the right strategies and business model to continue to grow and provide exceptional value and innovation for our customers and consumers and our shareholders.
and i was proud that we announced last night that the company will be paying a $1 per share dividend which will be paid out in june. we appreciate your participation in the call, and thank you for your interest in our company. i will now turn the call back over to mike.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of chris mcginnis from sidoti. your line is open.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on another good quarter.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
good morning, chris.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, chris.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
i was wondering if we could just maybe start at the growth -- gross margin line. and just talk about, i guess, one, maybe the benefits over the prior year, how much of that is maybe consumer? now that that's a heavier portion of the mix versus the lower nut prices. and can you just maybe dig into that a little bit more? and then maybe as you think about whether it's the next quarter or the next 12 months, how that plays out in the lower tree nut prices into that margin line for the next year?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
i'll take that, chris. so as we mentioned in the release, virtually all the improvement on that line came from lower commodity costs. and as we mentioned, it's just about all the major tree nuts that we process, probably with the exception maybe hazelnuts. so it's pretty interesting. it's not something we can recall seeing in recent years where every tree nut is down pretty significantly year-over-year, and that's really what drove that. going forward, we're pretty much locked in for the remainder of the crop year for the north american tree nuts. and that would pretty much take us through next summer. so our costs are fixed. we do have some more pricing actions to take in january as we typically do. and -- but overall, we think we'll see some margin expansion simply because of the lower acquisition costs.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
great. all right. so this is in for some time then, this gross margin level, i guess, if you want to call it?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
right.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. and you said it's unprecedented, can you maybe just shed your insight? obviously, you've been around it for a long time. just maybe your thoughts around what's driving kind of the decline in the pricing? and how sustainable that is?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
chris, it's jeffrey. so it's a combination of things. it's just been an extraordinary year -- a couple of years for growers. so there's been so much more planting of almonds, of walnuts, pecans in some places. so you've just seen an increase in the supply side because the growers have made so much money and it's been such a profitable industry to invest in over the last 10 years. and so now you're seeing the results of those increases in acreage planting. so you've got close to three billion-pound almond crop. you've got a record -- close to record walnut crop, record pistachio crop. pecan crop in mexico continues to grow as well as places like south africa. and so you've seen just increases in supply. and -- but it takes a while for demand to catch up with that. so that's part of the reason you're seeing some of this price deflation today as a result of just larger crops around the world.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
that makes sense. and can you just -- thinking about the pandemic on your business, obviously, consumer, you've obviously benefited from -- i guess as things start to come back on the other two segments of the company, how do you see that playing out on the margin front? and do you want that to come back? or -- i know it's still important, but this beneficial kind of -- it's obviously benefited the consumer more for you. can you hold the gains on the other side, too, and a comeback you think in the economy? just thinking about your portfolio, do you want to change it at all during the pandemic?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so as we've talked about, we've seen a shift to e-commerce. we've seen a shift to people eating and cooking at home. i believe as states reopen, you're going to see some of that shift back to, and we hope to see to shift back to food service, where people are going out to eat and traveling again. we expect to see that. i think some of the gains you've seen in consumers, some of that will stick. we're hopeful that we've -- consumers are now used to cooking at home and they've learned to cook at home. that increase we saw in our -- in the recipe program and even down that recipe aisle. and we're hoping that we can maintain some of that volume, even though the pandemic is -- once the pandemic subsides. and so we're hopeful that we can keep that recipe category growing strong, continue to educate consumers on how they can use nuts to cook and what to do with them. and i think the food service piece, our team has been really laser-focused on building distribution so that when states do reopen, we have our product portfolios in place to optimize the volume again in that channel. that's why i'm really confident once we do get back to some new level of normalcy, you'll see that food service piece come back again. it's just a matter of time when states start to reopen, and people are confident and comfortable to go back out to eat again and travel.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
chris, this is mike. i would add that if we were to see a decline in, say, private label snack nuts and trail mixes in favor of food service, walnuts and pecans, where we're seeing a lot of decline right now, that would actually be a very positive development for us because, as you know, we're vertically integrated in those two nuts. we tend to have better gross profit per pound measures with the nuts that we shell. and that actually, i think, would be a positive for us if we saw that shift.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. i really appreciate it. and just with some of the lost business on the recipe side, is there an opportunity to go back and get that? i know there has been some talk about that at times and just your confidence around that brand. and obviously, still -- obviously a strong position in that marketplace, but just the ability to go out and gain some more store space.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. chris, this is jeffrey. so we absolutely believe there are opportunities to regain that distribution or some of it. obviously, retailers are looking at brands every year, and they bid some out every couple of years. if you look at our velocity versus some of our competitors in the marketplace, it's so much higher. and i believe we really invest in our consumers, we invest in educating people on recipe nuts. i just think we have a very strong -- we have very strong brand equity with fisher. and i think with the marketing efforts that we're making and some of the changes in our brand positioning, we're bringing value to retailers that carry fisher. i really believe that some of the lost distribution, we can get -- we can regain that with some of the success stories we're having in other places.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
about maybe -- is there opportunities for m&a in this environment for you? and maybe just your thoughts around what maybe the confidence of the competitive landscape as well?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. sure. so we always look at m&a. we've talked about it periodically on this call. so we're always looking at companies. nothing that has been that important or we felt was that strategic that made sense for us at this point, or perhaps pricing wasn't right. but we are continually looking at opportunities in m&a, whether it's a new capability that we currently don't have, it's a new product platform or it's got a brand that reaches a consumer that we currently don't reach. a lot of opportunities and strategies we have in m&a, and we'll continue to look at them. just nothing that made sense up till now.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
and maybe can you just talk on the competitive landscape at this point? or i guess just the -- all the different changes, moving parts within the industry. just how are they attacking maybe the consumer side?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so obviously, competitors are responding to the pandemic and just trying to understand the dynamics with consumption trends and consumer behavior. so we've seen some of our competitors, diamond, for example, being very aggressive on building their recipe nut distribution. planners has been aggressive investing in their brands and trying to continue to expand distribution. and so the brands are still there trying to play a stronger role at retail and on the shelves and try to mitigate some of the impact that these big private brand programs are having with shelf space. but we don't anticipate major changes with competitors. i just think you're going to see people watching what happens with the pandemic and continued changes in consumer behavior and respond accordingly.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
sure. okay. thanks for taking my questions and good luck in q3.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of timothy call from capital management. your line is open.
timothy call -- capital management. -- analyst
congratulations on another great quarter. i look forward to the new products.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
thanks, tim.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim.
timothy call -- capital management. -- analyst
do you expect interest expense to decline over upcoming years as you pay down long-term debt to close to 0?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
yes. basically, our average interest rate on long-term debt is about twice as much as it is on short-term debt. and all of our debt amortizes. so yes, we do.
timothy call -- capital management. -- analyst
there were some capital expenditures with the pandemic. do you expect capital expenditures to go down over time post pandemic?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
the capital expenditures we made for the pandemic actually were a pretty small percentage of our total capex in fiscal 2020. our plant was actually pretty well laid out. that allowed us to create a safer working environment without a lot of capex. the big increase in capex that you're seeing for fiscal '21, that we disclosed in our 10-k at the end of 2020, is really attributable to product line expansion.
timothy call -- capital management. -- analyst
that's great. you had near record sales and earnings and consumer sales were 82% of the base, which is huge. as the economy reopens, i think you said you believe you have enough capacity when food service and specialty retail sales and other areas open up and demand nuts from you. i believe you said you have enough capacity to handle that from these levels. is that right?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
that is correct. yes. we've got an amazing infrastructure at all our facilities, tim, and we've invested over the years. and as our business grew, we invested in new packaging, new capabilities, robotics. it just extraordinary investments we've made in manufacturing. so as we -- even if product line shift or volume shifts, we've got available capacity to meet those demands. so as food service comes back and we see that growth return, we've got the capacity to handle that additional growth, in addition to keeping the volume growth we've seen in the consumer channel.
timothy call -- capital management. -- analyst
that's terrific. do you expect to sell the garysburg facility?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
we haven't made a final decision on that yet. but currently, we do have inventory there. we are doing some shipping and receiving. more than likely, we probably will put it up for sale in the fourth quarter, but we're still studying our options.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, if you have a buyer, tim, let us know.
timothy call -- capital management. -- analyst
yes. on their last call, smucker indicated they had a solid jif price increases due to higher costs and they thought those price increases would stick long term. meanwhile, we have conagra buying -- or selling peter pan and other nut lines to post. how does this competitor activity affect your company?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, the peanut butter business -- the majority of our peanut butter business is private brands. we took some pricing activity early -- mid last year remember the timing?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
because of the crop.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, because of the crop. so we did take some pricing in mid last year because of the pricing just as smucker's and some other brands did. we anticipate -- i don't anticipate huge changes in the peanut butter segment. it's still a strong segment. i think you're seeing growth there as a result of kind of the current economy today. it is a low price, high-protein item for families. and so we've seen a lift with our current private brand peanut butter customers as well as obviously, the food pantries around the country. huge growth and demand there.
timothy call -- capital management. -- analyst
well, thank you for all your hard work and success we appreciate it.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim, for your support.

operator
good morning. my name is dexter, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the john b. sanfilippo & son, inc. second quarter fiscal 2021 operating results conference call. [operator instructions]
mr. mike valentine, chief financial officer, will begin your conference. please go ahead, sir.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
thank you, dexter. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 2021 second quarter earnings conference call. thank you for joining us today. on the call with me today is jeffrey sanfilippo, our ceo; and jasper sanfilippo, our coo. before we start, we want to remind you that we may make some forward-looking statements today. these statements are based on our current expectations and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business. the factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various sec filings that we have made, including forms 10-k and 10-q. we encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about these risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business. starting with the top line. net sales for the second quarter of fiscal '21 decreased 5.2% to $233.6 million in comparison to net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 of $246.4 million. the decline in net sales was primarily due to lower selling prices for tree nuts, which in turn resulted from lower commodity acquisition costs. the decline in net sales from lower selling prices was offset in part by a 1.8% increase in sales volume, which we define as pounds sold to customers. sales volume increased 9.9% in our consumer distribution channel, and that was mainly due to a 13.3% increase in sales volume for private brand peanuts, trail mixes and snack mixes. current economic conditions have resulted in a shift in consumer preferences to lower-priced private label products and lower-priced products that we make. increased sales for fisher snack nuts also contributed to the sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel.
sales volume decreased in our commercial ingredients channel by 23.6%, and that was due to a 29.4% decline in sales volume in our food service business. the decline in food service sales volume was due to a decline in air travel, nationwide restrictions on indoor restaurant dining and restaurant closures, all of which were attributable to covid-19. sales volume declined in the contract packaging distribution channel by 14.1%, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of lower convenience store foot traffic in one customer's business, again from covid-19. turning to sales volume for our branded products. in the current second quarter, branded sales volume accounted for 25.5% of total consumer channel sales volume. sales volume for our fisher recipe nuts declined 18.4% as a result of lost distribution at some grocery customers, which was offset in part by increased sales with our internet retailer customers. the 13% decrease in sales volume for orchard valley harvest was primarily driven by lower foot traffic at a major customer in the non-food sector due to covid-19, reduced promotional activity and lost distribution at some other customers. the 30.2% increase in sales volume for fisher snack nuts resulted mainly from increased promotional activity. and southern style nuts sales volume declined by 4.2%, and that was due to reduced merchandising and promotional activity compared to last year's second quarter, and that was offset in part by distribution gains with new customers. net sales for the first two quarters of the current fiscal year decreased to $443.8 million from $464.3 million for the first two quarters of fiscal '20. this decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to lower selling prices for the same reason i discussed in the quarterly comparison.
the decrease in net sales was also attributable to a 0.7% decline in sales volume. sales volume increased 7% in the consumer distribution channel, primarily for the same reasons i cited in the quarterly comparison. sales volume decreased 25.6% in the commercial ingredients distribution channel, mainly as a result of a 35.5% decline in sales volume in our food service business for the first two quarters. the decline in food service sales volume occurred for the same reasons i cited in the quarterly comparisons. sales volume declined in the contract packaging distribution channel by 13.2% for the same reason i also cited in the quarterly comparison as well as the loss of some peanut butter business with another customer, and that was attributable to a temporary peanut supply shortage that existed in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. second quarter gross profit increased $2.8 million or 5.6%, and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 22.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 from 20.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin were mainly due to lower commodity acquisition costs for tree nuts and increased sales volume. gross profit for the first two quarters of the current fiscal year declined by $100,000 in gross profit margin as percentage of net sales increased to 20.8% from 19.9% for the same period last year. the increase in gross profit margin in the year-to-date comparison primarily was due to lower commodity acquisition costs for tree nuts. total operating expenses for the current second quarter decreased $500,000 in the quarterly comparison. the decrease in operating expense was due to the recognition of a $2.3 million gain on the estimated final insurance settlement related to the fire that occurred in our garysburg, north carolina facility, that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
the gain from the insurance settlement was largely offset by increases in freight, compensation and advertising expenses. total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 10.7% from 10.4% compared to last year's second quarter due to a lower net sales base. total operating expenses for the current year-to-date period decreased $3.2 million. and as a percentage of net sales, total operating expenses declined to 10.2% from 10.5% compared to the first two quarters of fiscal 2020. the decrease in total operating expenses was mainly due to the insurance settlement gain i cited in the quarterly comparison. declines in compensation and travel expenses also contributed to the decline in total operating expenses in the year-to-date comparison. interest expense for the second quarter and year-to-date period of fiscal '21 declined slightly compared to interest expense for both periods in fiscal 2020. the decreases in interest expense in both comparisons were due to a lower weighted average interest rate from the reduction of long-term debt. the benefit from a lower weighted average interest rate was largely offset by higher average short-term debt levels in both periods. net income was $19.9 million or $1.72 per share diluted for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $17.5 million or $1.52 per share diluted for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. net income for the first two quarters of fiscal 2021 was $32.7 million or $2.83 per share diluted compared to net income of $30.4 million or $2.64 per share diluted for the first two quarters of fiscal 2020. now taking a quick look at inventory. the total value of our inventories on hand at the end of the current second quarter decreased 9.8% compared to the total value of inventories on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020. the decrease in inventory value was due to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts and lower quantities of peanuts on hand. the weighted average cost per pound of our raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021 decreased 4.6% compared to the weighted average cost per pound of these input stocks at the end of the second quarter of last year. the decrease in the weighted average cost per pound of our input stocks was attributable to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts. this was offset in part by a shift in product mix from lower-priced peanuts to higher-priced walnuts and pecans.
i will now turn the call over to jeffrey sanfilippo, our ceo, to provide additional comments on operating results for the second quarter of fiscal '21. jeffrey?

thank you, mike. good morning, everyone. jbss reported record net income and diluted earnings per share in our second quarter, coming off of a record second quarter last year. i am so proud of our management team and all of our associates for overcoming enormous headwinds to achieve record results for our second quarter of fiscal 2021. this is a considerable accomplishment given the trio of challenges we faced in our food service business, in our contract packaging distribution channel and with our orchard valley harvest brand from the impact of covid-19. as has been the case in recent quarters, we saw strong sales volume growth in our consumer distribution channel from increased sales of private brand snack nuts, trail mixes, snack mixes and fisher snack nuts. sales volume in the consumer distribution channel accounted for 78.2% of total sales volume in the current second quarter. the pandemic has had an unfavorable impact on our food service business, as mike alluded to. however, food service results have continued to improve in fiscal '21 as a decline in food service sales volume in the current second quarter was 29.4% compared to 63.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. it has been a very strong first half of fiscal 2021. as you may have seen from our press release last night, our board of directors approved the payment of a special dividend of $2.50 per share. this special dividend will be paid on march 16, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 26, 2021. these dividends reinforce our goal of creating long-term stockholder value through the responsible use of cash. these dividends would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of all of our employees. we demonstrated exceptional results despite having to overcome many challenges, including a shortage of capacity in the transportation industry, which our service providers believe is due to driver concerns related to the impact of covid-19 and an increase in demand driven by additional spending on consumer goods.
from the start of the pandemic, our entire organization came together to keep each other safe while still focusing on building our business. our teams have not stopped working to drive continuous improvement projects, optimize supply chain efficiencies and maintain best-in-class quality and service levels for our customers and consumers. turning to sales review by jbss business channel. the consumer channel distribution increased $3.9 million or 2.1%, and sales volume increased 9.9% in the second quarter of fiscal '21. our sales, marketing, innovation and r&d teams have been working hard on new product development and distribution. we recently launched fisher recipe nut flours in the marketplace at the end of our second quarter. preliminary customer and consumer feedback has been positive, and we are finalizing plans to gain retail distribution. you can already purchase our fisher nut flours at amazon.com. in addition, our company will be gatecrashing this valentine's day with our new ruby royale premium gift nut launch. social media and marketing plans have already been executed, and the product was recently launched on amazon.com as well. so look for it. in the commercial ingredient channel, distribution decreased by 40% in dollars and 23.6% in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal '21. the decline in sales volume was due to a 29.4% decrease in volume in our food service business. the sales volume decline in our food service business resulted in a decline in air travel and nationwide restrictions on indoor restaurant dining and closures of restaurants, all of which were attributable to the pandemic. in our first quarter of fiscal '21, volume declines were 40%. in this quarter, volume declines were only 30%. although demand has been suppressed from our food service customers, the rate of decline is recovering from its low point in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.
and we believe that as the covid-19 vaccines become more widely distributed and accepted by the public and restrictions are again loosen, sales volume with our food service restaurant and non-commercial customers will continue to improve, and we expect to eventually return to pre-pandemic levels. i know the food service sales team has been laser-focused on getting expanded distribution in place for our products in preparation for reopenings and reengagement with their customers. in the contract packaging channel, distribution decreased by 12.8% in dollars and 14.1% in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal '21, compared to the second quarter of fiscal '20. as mike mentioned, the decline in volume was primarily attributable to the unfavorable impact of lower convenience store foot traffic on our customers' business as a result of the pandemic. here, too, in the contract packaging channel, we anticipate a slow, but eventual return to pre-pandemic levels of volume as vaccines become more widely distributed and accepted by the public and restrictions are again loosened. turning to category updates. i will serve some of the insights from this past quarter. as always, all the market information i'll be referring to is the iri reported data, and for today, it is the period ending december 27, 2020. when i refer to q2, i'm referring to 13 weeks of the quarter ending december 27. references to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period one year ago. we look at the category on iri's total u.s. definition, which includes food, drug, mass, walmart, military and other outlets, unless otherwise specified. and when we discuss pricing, we are referring to average price per pound. breakouts of the recipe, snack and produce categories are based on our customer -- custom definitions developed in conjunction with iri. and the term velocity refers to the sales per point of distribution. as has been mentioned, covid-19 had positive and negative impacts upon our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021.
we continue to see evidence of a shift in consumer preferences to shop in smaller store formats like grocery and online. growth in private label and moves to larger value sizes continue to drive category growth. the total nut category increased in both sales dollars and pound volume by 4% and 5%, respectively, in q2. this was slightly behind pound growth we saw in q1, but ahead in dollar growth. both pound and dollar growth rates are ahead of the category growth rate last year at this time. overall prices for the quarter were down 1% versus the prior year. now i will cover each category in more depth starting with recipe nuts. based on iri's total u.s. multi-outlet market data, consumers continue to do much more cooking and baking at home. however, consumers also changed holiday behavior with smaller gatherings for thanksgiving and christmas, given travel bans and lockdowns. the recipe nut category grew 4% in dollar sales and 6% in pound sales. this is down from the previous quarter of 16% in dollar growth and 13% in pound growth. despite category growth, our overall fisher brand continues to be challenged by a decline in distribution with two key retailers. our fisher recipe nuts decreased 20% in dollar sales and 19% in pound sales for the quarter versus last year. we did show gains in velocity where we have distribution. this was not enough to offset distribution declines. as a result, fisher's share in the category decreased 4.9 point -- share points versus last year. fisher continues to be the branded share leader in the recipe category when using the broader multi-outlet definition or within the u.s. food channel. now let me turn to the snack category. in q4, the snack category increased 4% in dollar sales and 6% in pound sales. fisher snack also grew 4% in dollars and 10% in pound volume sales in q2, with a 17% increase in pound velocity on core fisher snack nuts, driven by increased promotional activity and an 8% pound growth rate on our oven roasted never fried line. pound volume for our southern style nuts brand at retail decreased by 19% in the quarter due to decreases in merchandising and promotional activity, while pound volume for the total trail and snack mix category decreased by 2% in the quarter.
in q4, the produce net category increased 6% in dollar sales and 4% in pound volume. orchard valley harvest, our produce nut brand decreased 14% in pound sales, resulting in a pound share decline of 0.2 points versus last year. the volume decline was due to reduced promotional activity and lost distribution at some customers. in closing, we face a number of future challenges with the uncertainty of the pandemic and its continued impact on our business, but we also see significant opportunities for growth. our management team and all our associates are not wasting any time waiting to expand our business. the teams are working incredibly hard to build stronger brands to build more innovative product platforms and to provide higher levels of quality and service. we have a stronger foundation today than we did at the start of the pandemic. and jbss is positioned well for a bigger and brighter future. we have a dedicated team of leaders throughout the company who are doing what matters most to deliver strong financial results. we are investing in new talent. we are investing in new capabilities. and we are investing in our brands. fisher recipe, fisher snack, orchard valley harvest, squirrel and southern style nuts are all relevant brands in our portfolio with enormous opportunities for growth. and we have the right strategies and human capital to continue to build our business and provide exceptional value and innovation for our customers, our consumers and our stockholders. we appreciate your participation in the call, and thank you for your interest in our company.
i'll now turn the call back over to mike.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
thank you, jeff. we will now open the call to questions from participants. dexter, please queue up the first question.
",2021-Q2,JBSS

operator
yes. your first question comes from the line of chris mcginnis of sidoti and company.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
thank you for taking my question and nice quarter. i know you mentioned increases in freight, and it sounds like pallet, but outside of that, the raw material is coming down. i think you're probably the only industry i cover that sees deflationary raw material cost. can you just talk about maybe the outlook there? how confident or what you think in terms of raw material costs over the next maybe 12 months as you see it, ag has obviously seen increase in some pricing. so i'm wondering how that could possibly impact you longer term?
jasper b. sanfilippo jr. -- chief operating officer, president and assistant secretary
yes. chris, this is jasper. as it stands now, we're covered through the fall. obviously, we bought our crops last year. so our positions are very good through fall. certain crops have not really developed yet. for example, pecans and walnuts are just coming off of bloom. it looks like we have a decent almond crop. cashews are pretty tight. so we're not necessarily seeing that there's going to be anything that could be really impactful from a major price increase unless we have some disasters as these crops are developing. from a labor standpoint, there's nothing really that we're seeing as well that's going to cause any effect there. so i think commodities will stay stable for the first half of our year. and then depending on harvest and crop sizes, we'll determine the back half of the year.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
yes. and chris, i would also add that we have some pretty significant carryovers on just about all the tree nuts, except cashews. so that should also keep a lid on those market prices.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
great. and i guess just that -- i don't want to call it elevated because it's been here for a while, but just that margin profile that you've been hitting that on the growth side. should that be sustainable for the next few quarters given the commentary you just gave me?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. chris, this is jeffrey. i would expect that at home demand to still continue. i think people are still slowly getting back into traveling and eating out. but i expect this next probably two quarters, you'll see that slowly. i think you're going to see that maintain, but you'll slowly see that increase, as i talked about in the foodservice channel and the contract packaging channel as people are more comfortable going out again.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
okay. and just on the impact of that margin profile. okay. i understand that. and i guess just in thinking about some of the loss, i guess, the changes with maybe fisher, maybe the recipe. can you just talk about some of the lost channels, how you're going to approach that? you made some commentary that you're kind of refocusing a little bit on some of the loss share. can you just talk about how you're going to change that strategy going forward and take that back over the next six to 12 months?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. so if you look at -- start with fisher recipe, so that business was up for bid at two major retailers. and unfortunately, we lost that distribution to another brand. but that business comes up again in the next year. i think both of them come up in the next year or so. so we're working hard to build our brand equity, looking at the product innovation in the category. i mentioned the nut flower, which we're having great success in getting new distribution there. so really doing better at positioning the brand equity and the product portfolio. so when those bids come back up, again, we're positioned really well to pursue that business. at the same time, i talked about velocity. and so when you need velocity, it's how much you're turning in a store where you have distribution. and we've done a great job at building that velocity through promotional activity, through consumer engagement. so we've got great success stories at other retailers where we have fisher distribution and our goal is to take those success stories and demonstrate to retailers where we don't have distribution why they should have fisher in their sets. so that's fisher recipe. orchard valley harvest, our health and wellness brand and produce brand. a lot of work being done there on understanding our consumer and how we can differentiate that brand and product portfolio. so the team is working hard on something you'll see in the coming months.
we've been in the test market with something called chickpea chips with our ovh brand. our r and d team has developed some great new flavor profiles for that brand. so you'll see us enter that market in a stronger way in the salty snack section. and then squirrel is our indulgent brand. a lot of work being done there. we did a great valentine's promotional program with a brand, a product called ruby royal; very successful on qvc. and so we're looking at that product portfolio as well and elevating the type of products that we put in under our squirrel portfolio to engage new consumers and build that brand. so a lot of opportunities on the branded side. heavy lifting being done now, as i mentioned, to build those brand positioning and develop consumer engagement, but very excited about what we're going to do with the brands in the future.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
i really appreciate it. that's very helpful. just to touch on the trail and snack mix, obviously, pretty strong the last few quarters. how much room does that still have to grow? is that more of the change in consumer, the expansion with the distribution customers. can you just talk about that because that's been a really strong channel for you for a while now.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. yes. so trail mix has always been a very strong segment in the category. we did see some shift to lower cost trail mixes, especially with peanuts as consumers looked at the economy and just income in general. so we did see a shift to lower cost trail mixes. but we also see growth in the health and wellness trail max. if you look at something like a keto mix, which is relatively new to the category, we're seeing substantial growth with that type of health and wellness, trail mix. and i think you'll continue to see more development in that segment of trail mixes with more health and wellness type of products.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
i appreciate that. and then you just mentioned the competitive landscape increasing a little bit in some components. can you just maybe discuss that broadly across any of the portfolio? have you seen any real change in strategy in terms of pricing?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
not really. i think people have been very, i think, really just trying to manage through the pandemic. we haven't seen any huge competitive price changes. obviously, as the -- we saw price deflation, a lot of that was passed on to consumers through lower retail prices. but also what it's allowed us to do is create more meaningful promotions when we saw these lower commodity costs coming through, trying to attract new consumers to the nut category and hit price points that we were never able to hit before. and so i think all of the competitors have been very focused on getting through the pandemic, but also managing their pricing and making sure that they're driving promotions like we are. we've got -- obviously, with competitive activity, we know of hormel's acquisition with planters. we haven't seen any changes yet. obviously, it's relatively new, and that process is still going through. but we would monitor that and expect to see some things come out of that transition once hormel takes over the brand.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
yeah, thank you. and then just, obviously, a strong balance sheet. just your thoughts around capital and any m and a opportunities out there that you see? thanks.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. chris, we're always looking at m and a. it's important to look at what's outside of just our current product portfolio or capabilities. so we've looked at a few companies. we're constantly looking at businesses. i think this past year, our focus has really been on our base business, our core products, reimagining our brands, taking care of our workforce. but m and a definitely will be something -- it's something we always look at and something that will continue to be part of our strategic growth plan.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
and then, chris, we're also making a major investment to enter a new product category, that investment has already started and will continue through fiscal 2022, and then we'll start to see some benefits of that investment in fiscal 2023. it's a major project for us.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
is that a new product offering that has been announced? or is that a new product offer not -- not yet announced.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
it has not been announced.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
soon.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
yes.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
okay. well, thank you very much. that's very important. i appreciate that. good luck in the next quarter and thank you very much for answering my questions. i appreciate that.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
okay chris. thanks.
operator
your next question comes from the line of tim call with capital management.
tim call -- capital management -- analyst
congratulations on a strong quarter.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks tim.
tim call -- capital management -- analyst
this seemed to be your last quarter with hard comparisons. and yet you reported strong quarterly results. and so with easier comparisons and volumes down in quarters in the previous year. should we expect to see an acceleration of fundamentals?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
well, actually, our fourth quarter was a monster quarter last year because of pantry building. so we still have one more quarter of a challenging comp. but i agree with you after that, we should be able to build some momentum there.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
and also add, tim, that we -- as i mentioned during the call, we are seeing a strong recovery, especially in our foodservice channel. our industrial channel is coming back. the consumer group -- really, all of our sales and marketing teams have done an extraordinary job, putting us in a strong position with distribution and new product placement and strategic partnerships that will really matter as the economy changes and as the market changes post pandemic. you're starting to see those results flow through, as i mentioned, the back order log now.
tim call -- capital management -- analyst
so contract manufacturing might come back. food service used to be 10% of your overall sales and your branded products are sold through a lot of stores that were closed during the pandemic. so should we -- are you able to handle all the increased demand that might occur from all those areas at the same time. and when we think of companies that could greatly benefit from the reopening of america, should we think of your firm?
jasper b. sanfilippo jr. -- chief operating officer, president and assistant secretary
yes, tim, this is jasper. from a capacity standpoint, we're well prepared to be able to handle the increased demand. some of those product lines like food service, for example, have dedicated equipment. so if we get back to normal levels, the equipment that we have will be sufficient to meet that demand. and we've always been continually investing on our retail side, either through rigid packaging like pet jars, cans or stand-up bag. so i think we'll be -- we're in good shape on capacity.
tim call -- capital management -- analyst
and you mentioned planters, and hopefully, there's some disruption there, but their last calendar year had sales of roughly $1 billion of those planters product lines that were sold. and the sales price was around $3.35 billion, cash. your last fiscal year, you had sales of around $0.9 billion. and your market cap and the stock market is around $1 billion; very little debt. is there -- there seems to be a vast difference in valuation of what the market was paying for planters and what the market is paying for your firm, what do you think can be done to narrow that gap? do you think just more investors need to find out about john b. sanfilippo?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so tim, one of the big things, and we were surprised at the multiple was paid for planters. it's a great brand. it's the heritage brand. i think hormel will do a nice job with it. but i think when you look at our comparison in profit, but in valuation, brands are important to investors, as we all know, high margin, much better control in some cases over -- or the future growth of the brand. and so as we continue to build our brands across our portfolio, in addition to complementing our private brand and industrial business and contract packaging business. i think that's where we'll see that multiple start to grow. the stronger brands that we can have, the stronger market share, the bigger distribution we have across the country, i think the stronger multiple you'll see in the company.
tim call -- capital management -- analyst
well, thank you for all your hard work. it's great seeing it pay off. congratulations on a great quarter.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. appreciate it tim.
jasper b. sanfilippo jr. -- chief operating officer, president and assistant secretary

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to john b. sanfilippo and son, inc., third quarter fiscal 2021 operating results conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mike valentine, chief financial officer. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
thank you, dee. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 2021 third quarter earnings conference call. we thank you all for joining us today. on the call with me is jeffrey sanfilippo, our chief executive officer and jasper sanfilippo, our chief operating officer. before we start, we want to alert you to the fact that we may make some forward-looking statements today. these statements are based on our current expectations, and they involve certain risks and uncertainties. the factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various sec filings that we have made, including forms 10-k and 10-q. we encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about these risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business.
starting with the income statement, net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 decreased 1.8% to $207.9 million from net sales of $211.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. the decrease in net sales was mainly attributable to a 1.2% decrease in sales volume, which we define as pounds sold to customers. sales volume declined primarily due to a reduction in sales volume for almonds and peanuts. this was offset in part by increased sales volume for trail and snack mixes. sales volume increased in our consumer distribution channel by 9.1%, and that was due to an 11.8% increase in sales volume for private brand snack nuts and trail and snack mixes. the increase in sales volume for these private brand products came from new distribution at existing customers, a shift in consumer preferences to lower-priced private brand products and growth in snacking as many consumers continue to purchase food for consumption at home while they work at home. sales volume in the consumer distribution channel accounted for 77.7% of our total sales volume in the current third quarter.
now looking at sales volume for our brands and our consumer channel, sales volume for fisher recipe nuts fell 6.4%, and that was primarily due to loss distribution at two grocery customers. the 21.4% decrease in sales volume for our orchard valley harvest brand was attributable to lower foot traffic and a major customer in the nonfood sector due to covid 19. fisher snack nut sales volume decreased 3.1%, primarily due to reduced merchandising activity for fisher and shell peanuts as we are in the process of discontinuing that product line. and we expect to have that completed by the end of the upcoming fourth quarter. sales volume for southern style nuts decreased 14.2% due to the discontinuance of an item at a major customer. sales volume decreased in the commercial ingredients channel by 29.8% due to a 25.7% decline in sales volume in our foodservice business and a decline in sales of peanut crushing stock to peanut oil processors. the decline in foodservice sales volume was mainly due to a decline in air travel and continued nationwide restrictions on indoor restaurant dining as a result of covid-19.
sales volume declined in the contract packaging distribution channel by 19.2%, and that was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of lower convenience store foot traffic on one customer's business, again as a result of covid-19. the net sales for the first three quarters of the current fiscal year decreased to $651.7 million from $675.9 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2020. the decrease in net sales was attributable primarily to a 2.7% decrease in our weighted average selling price for our products, which, in turn, was due to a decline in commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts. sales volume decreased 0.9%, primarily due to a reduction in sales volume for almonds and peanuts, and that was partially offset by increased sales for trail and snack mixes. the decline in sales volume, especially for almonds, also contributed to the decline in net sales. sales volume increased 7.7% in the consumer distribution channel, primarily for the same reason i discussed in the quarterly comparison. sales volume decreased 27.1% in the commercial ingredients distribution channel, mainly as a result of a 32.5% decline in sales volume in our foodservice business. and again, the food -- the decline in food service sales volume occurred for the same reasons i discussed in the quarterly comparison. sales volume declined in the contract packaging distribution channel by 15.1%, primarily for the reason i cited in the quarterly comparison as well as the loss of peanut butter business with another customer, which was attributable to a temporary peanut supply shortage that existed in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
third quarter gross profit increased $3.2 million and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 22.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 from 20.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin were attributable primarily to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts. gross profit for the first three quarters of the current year increased $3.1 million and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 21.2% from 20% for the same period last year. again, the increases in both gross profit and gross profit margin were due to the lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts. total operating expenses for the current third quarter increased to 12% of net sales from 11.1% for last year's third quarter. in total, operating expenses for the current third quarter increased to $24.9 million from $23.4 million in the quarterly comparison. the increase in total operating expenses was due to a $1.5 million increase in freight expense, and that resulted from significantly higher freight rates compared to freight rates in last year's third quarter and to a lesser extent, an increase in sales volume for sales made on a delivered basis to our customers. total operating expenses for the current year-to-date period increased slightly to 10.8% from 10.7% of net sales for the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, and total operating expenses decreased $1.7 million.
the decline in total operating expenses was due to a $2.3 million gain from the final insurance recovery that was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. this insurance recovery related to the garysburg, north carolina facility fire that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. the impact of that insurance recovery gain was offset in part by increases in freight, insurance and consulting expenses, net of decreases in advertising, incentive compensation and travel expenses. interest expense for the current third quarter decreased to $300,000 from $600,000 in last year's third quarter, and interest expense for the first three quarters of the current year decreased to $1.1 million from $1.5 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2020. the decrease in interest expense in both comparisons primarily resulted from lower average debt levels. net income was $14.7 million or $1.27 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $13.5 million or $1.17 per share diluted for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. both net income and eps were records for a third quarter. net income for the first three quarters of fiscal 2021 was $47.4 million or $4.1 per share diluted compared to net income of $43.9 million or $3.80 per share diluted for the first three quarters of fiscal 2020.
now taking a quick look at our inventory, the total value of our inventories on hand at the end of the current third quarter decreased $36.8 million or 19.5% compared to the total inventory value at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020. the decrease in the value of total inventories was primarily due to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts. also lower quantities of peanuts, almonds and pecans, contributed to the decline in the total value of inventories on hand. the weighted average cost per pound of our raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand decreased 17.8%, again due to lower acquisition costs for all major tree nuts.
and now, i will turn the call over to jeffrey sanfilippo, our chief executive officer, to provide additional comments on our operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. jeffrey?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning, everyone. as was the case in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we reported record net income and diluted earnings per share despite the continuing challenges we faced in our food service business and our contract packaging distribution channel and with our orchard valley harvest brand due to the impact of covid-19. these record results were, again, driven in large part by lower commodity acquisition costs, as mike mentioned, for all major tree nuts and strong sales volume growth for private brand products in our consumer distribution channel. and we continue to see improvement in our foodservice business as we did in the first two quarters of fiscal 2021, with dining out and air travel having increased. our record performance over the last two quarters put us in a strong position to pay a $2.50 per share special dividend during the current third quarter. team members from every department across our organization worked hard and led with dedication and commitment to deliver these strong results and service our customers and consumers.
at this time last year, our company established a covid-19 crisis management team that had met daily to discuss risks faced by the company and mitigation strategies. here we are one year later, continuing to follow recommendations made by state and federal regulators and health agencies to ensure the safety and health of our employees as those recommendations change and evolve. but i'm happy to share that the crisis team has now pivoted to being a recovery team with a focus on getting our team members vaccinated. a few weeks ago, we organized a free voluntary covid-19 immunization clinic, which was held on-site at our elgin, illinois facility. the company in partnership with jewel-osco administered 1064 pfizer vaccinations to employees and their families. the second dose will be administered next week. jbss is in the process now of facilitating clinics at each of our manufacturing locations. in addition to this important initiative, the recovery team is coordinating our reimagined workforce, which will provide for flexibility on when and where people work in our organization to support our business and take care of our customers and consumers. one key learning from the pandemic is that many of our associates prove they could work remotely and still meet goals and objectives while continuing to nurture collaboration and connection. at the same time, being apart from each other has also made us realize how much we value being together in person. and there is often no substitute for live collaboration, connection and celebration to maintain a strong jbss culture.
in our operations, there are short-term external headwinds to manage driving up costs as we navigate and transition into a post pandemic environment. for example, the wood and pallet industry has been impacted for several months now with low inventory levels due in part to labor and lumber shortages. the pallet shortage has impacted our operations, primarily at our elgin facility and led to some cost increases. we anticipate the industry to see some relief in the coming quarters. in the interim, we are working with our vendors, customers and jbss facilities in other regions of the country to source additional supply. also during fiscal 2021, there is a shortage in capacity in the transportation industry. compounding this driver shortage is an increase in demand driven by additional spending on consumer goods. this tightening in transportation capacity, including rail and ocean freight is expected to continue in fiscal 2022, has led to increased transportation costs. despite these headwinds, there are bright signs of demand recovery in specific business segments. i've shared the negative impact on our food service and contract manufacturing business and volume demand declines in convenience stores and nonessential retail customers due to reduced foot traffic, while people continue to work from home. the good news is that the rate of decline is recovering from its low point in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and we believe that as the covid-19 vaccine becomes more widely distributed and accepted by the public and restrictions are again loosened, sales volume will -- with our foodservice, restaurant, convenience store and nonessential retail customers will continue to improve. and we've already started seeing significant growth in our backlog these past few weeks.
turning to sales review by channel. net sales in the consumer distribution channel increased 6.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. as mike mentioned, the increase was driven by growth in private brands from several of our key retail partners. they continue to benefit from elevated at home food demand driven by the pandemic. for our branded business, there is much work to be done. the marketing, innovation, r and d and insights teams have been working extremely hard on brand positioning, product differentiation and consumer engagement. a lot of heavy lifting is taking place right now to build stronger brands and sales distribution plans for the coming year. the teams are prioritizing core brand initiatives and enhancing product portfolios. for example, the fisher nut flower program is gaining momentum with new distribution gains as we capitalize on the ongoing increased demand for food at home as well as the rise in cooking and baking. net sales in the commercial ingredient distribution channel decreased 30.5% in dollars.
as we've shared previously, reduced away-from-home demand is a significant driver of these declines. but throughout this past year, our foodservice and industrial teams have set us up for a strong recovery by developing strategic partnerships and getting product placement in locations where it matters. and we are seeing positive leading indicators in our order backlog that business demand is coming back in this channel. net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel decreased 23.2% in dollars. again, one of the negative impacts of covid-19 is the decline in people visiting convenience stores throughout the country, where our largest customer in this channel has significant sales concentration, but this too is beginning to recover as we see growing demand in this channel.
turning to category updates. i will share some of the brand results with you and category updates for the quarter. as always, all the market information i'll be referring to is iri reported data, and for today, it is for the period ending march 2021. when i refer to q3, i'm referring to 13 weeks of the quarter ending march 21. references to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period one year ago. we look at the category on iri's total u.s. definition, which includes food, drug, mass, walmart, military and other outlets, unless otherwise specified. and when we discuss pricing, we are referring to average price per pound. breakouts of the recipe, snack and produce nut categories are based on our custom definitions developed in conjunction with iri. and the term velocity refers to the sales per point of distribution. as we've mentioned for the past year, covid-19 had positive and negative impacts upon our results for fiscal 2021. in the last four weeks of q3, however, we started to lap the beginning of the pandemic and the large pantry bill that happened in march of 2020. the total nut category and jbss volume both declined in the last four weeks versus prior year; while results for the quarter are mixed. the total nut category was flat in both sales dollars and pounds in q3. this is down versus the dollars and pound growth we saw in the first half of the year. this is primarily driven by the lap of the march pantry build from last year, as mentioned previously. overall prices for the quarter were flat versus the prior year.
now i'll cover each category in much more depth, starting with recipe nuts. the recipe category grew 5% in dollar sales and 7% in pound sales. this is consistent with the growth that we saw in q2. the category saw significant growth throughout the pandemic, driven by more consumers cooking and baking at home. despite category growth, our overall fisher brand continues to be challenged by declining distribution with two key retailers. our fisher recipe nuts decreased 15% in dollar sales and 10% in pound sales for the quarter versus last year. we did see gains in velocity, but this was not enough to offset distribution declines. as a result, fisher's share in the category decreased 2.4 pound share points versus last year. fisher continues to be the branded share leader in the recipe category when using a broader multi outlet definition or within the u.s. food channel. now, let me turn to the snack category. in q3, the snack category declined dollar sales 2% will remain flat in pound sales. fisher snack grew faster than the category, up 1% in dollar sales and up 9% in pound sales in q3, driven by strong pound velocity on core fisher snack nuts; up 19.5%, driven by increased promotional activity. the trail and snack mix category declined dollars and pounds in q3 by 6% and 8%, respectively. our southern style nut brand performed better than the category, though still declined 4% in pounds and dollars due to lost distribution on a flavor variant at a major retailer. in q3, the produce nut category increased 6% in dollars and 5% in pound volume. orchard valley harvest, our produce nut brand, decreased 16% in dollar sales and 18% in pound sales, driven by lost distribution and aggressive competition -- competitive action.
in closing, it is extraordinary how the world has changed since our third quarter last year, but our company and our team of dedicated leaders and frontline associates throughout our organization remains steadfast and strong. we adapted quickly to the dramatic changes in consumer behavior and seized opportunities to follow consumption growth in e-commerce and elevated demand with our private brand retail partners. we've made good progress on our fiscal 2021 priorities; building a stronger commercial team and fueling investment in our brands and manufacturing capabilities. looking ahead, we remain focused on strengthening our momentum and emerging from the pandemic, a stronger company, even better positioned to drive long-term shareholder value. we will continue to prioritize the health and productivity of our associates and follow the most up-to-date guidance from health authorities to ensure we are doing all we can in our manufacturing facilities and offices to keep everyone safe. lastly, we have the right strategies, the right talent and the right business model to continue to grow and provide exceptional value and innovation for our customers and consumers. we appreciate your participation in the call, and thank you for your interest in our company.
i will now turn the call back over to mike.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
okay. thank you, jeffrey. at this time, dee, can you please queue up the first question?
",2021-Q3,JBSS
0.9921,,,0.9993,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from chris mcginnis with sidoti & company. your line is open.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. nice quarter. and mike, thanks for all the help and look forward to working with you in different capacity as well.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
thank you, chris. my pleasure.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
thank you. i guess maybe to start, acquisition costs have been pretty advantageous for you. can you just talk about your outlook for '22, and purchase pricing of tree nuts for the year, and your thought process around it?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
sure. so, as we pointed out in the last few quarters, we've seen some significantly low commodity acquisition costs. i'd say probably in about all cases, they dipped below historical averages. looking forward at new crop, and we don't have complete visibility on that yet, but in most cases, we think many of those costs are going to return to something close to historical averages, with the exception of cashews, which may run a little bit higher than that. and then almonds, just because of the droughts that we're seeing in the central valley of california, maybe above historical averages.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and i guess just thinking about very successful on the consumer side, can you just talk about the opportunities for growth when you look out to '22 both on the private label and the branded sides where your opportunities are?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. chris, this is jeff. thanks for the question. so, really fiscal '22 opportunities, looking at private brands first, focusing on our key partners. there's still opportunities to build and work with them on expanding their private brand programs. and we touched on the trail mix segment, which continues to grow, especially as states start to open up and people are on the go again. but also just product innovation, in general, there's still a shift to plant proteins. and so we're seeing retailers look at other opportunities to expand their nut program as they look at opportunities and changes in consumer behavior.
the other thing that we are focused on is bringing new consumers to the categories, both for private brands and for our brands. if we get the gen z and the millennial population, there, nuts are not always first top of mind when they go out for to purchase a snack. and so, part of our reason for investing in consumer insights is to truly understand those purchasing dynamics and that behavior to help understand how we can pursue those consumers and bring them to both the snack and recipe category.
on the branded side, the team is, as i talked about, we brought in a lot of new key talent from outside our organization with great experience at other major cpg companies. and the focus is on really building stronger brands, building better brand positioning statements, better engagement with consumers, a stronger product portfolio, because we still see a lot of opportunities in growth in snack nuts and in recipe and ingredients as well.
the last thing i will add is we are expanding our product portfolio. i talked about launching outside of the nut category. we have a chickpea chip under our orchard valley harvest brand, which was launched. we did some test marketing last year. and you'll see that rollout into first half -- or first -- second quarter of fiscal '22 and you'll start to see that product. you can find it already on amazon as a test, but you'll see that product rollout nationally in the beginning of second quarter of fiscal '22.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. and i appreciate that. and i guess just thinking about the investment you're making, both in personnel, but also the consumer research, what are your early signs that the kind of indications of the opportunity there? can you maybe just expand on what you're seeing? i know it's still early stage, but...
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so, i touched on a little bit about the millennials and the gen zs and their consumption behavior, it's one of the first insights that we've seen. also, the investment in the consumer insights allows us to find other gaps. and we've talked a lot about expanding consumption, looking at alternative channels and we truly understanding where consumers are buying food products. this new technology allows us to tap into places where we didn't realize people were consuming nuts before. the last thing it does is it helps us to really understand trends faster than we've ever been able to. so as we start to develop new product innovation, both for our brands and for private brand customers, we'll have much better intelligence to develop the right products that consumers are looking for. so, very exciting. it's initial stages, but we're building that foundation to have a really strong consumer insights team and have better visibility of future trends and what's happening today.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. and just two more, and i'll jump back in queue. maybe just around commercial ingredients, obviously, a nice rebound. can you maybe just discuss where your volumes are versus prior to the pandemic level, and how much more room in it for growth there?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, the team -- throughout the pandemic, as restaurants started to close, our food service team was working so hard to maintain relationships with our food service account, making sure that we gain new distribution so that when the states did open up, we had our products ready and available for our food service customers. and so, i really believe that we're starting to see that rebound. food service has come back with the roar. our backlog is strong in food service. customers are ordering. they're replenishing. consumers are going out to eat. and so i think we're in a much better place at the end of the pandemic with our distribution and our relationships and where we're focused on to really build a stronger, more robust food service channel that we had prior to the pandemic.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. and then just one on the capex. i think it's $18 million expected for '22. anything specific there in terms of growth versus maintenance to call out?
jasper b. sanfilippo -- chief operating officer, president and assistant secretary
yeah. chris, this is jasper. i would say, a good portion of it really is toward automation. there is a quite a bit of maintenance as we have every year. i would not say it's anything more than unusual. there is some upgrades to make lines go quicker, so i guess you could argue that would be going toward growth. but quite a bit of it really is finishing a big capex project from last year and continuing to invest in automation.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i appreciate the time today. i'll jump back in queue for now. thanks.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, chris.
operator
our next question comes from timothy call with capital management corporation. your line is open.
timothy call -- the capital management corporation -- analyst
thank you. congratulations on another strong quarter and year. it's good to see mike hand of this role from such strength, that shows a lot. and i was wondering with interest expense falling by 40%, do you think in the fourth quarter of -- in two or three years that you might actually have net interest income, not net interest expense?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
i don't think so. i mean, this year is a little bit unique in respect to lower commodity costs. as we return to normal, i think you can expect to see normal borrowing levels through company there [phonetic].
timothy call -- the capital management corporation -- analyst
and when you sell the garysburg facility, should that sale be completed in this fiscal year?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
yeah, we expect that to be completed in this current first quarter.
timothy call -- the capital management corporation -- analyst
and with new product launches, do you expect new brand names? do you expect to use current manufacturing facilities in idle capacity? and you mentioned the launch of the chips, will there be other launches this fiscal year, or do you expect a new product once a year?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, tim, good question. so, we've invested a lot in innovation and research and development. we've got really good brands. the challenge is we don't have very good distribution in acv. and so we feel like we've got good brands today that we can focus on the health and wellness with orchard valley harvest. we have our squirrel indulgent brand. and then we have fisher recipe and snack as our core nut brand. so, we've got the brands. i think today i don't know if we would add sub-brands at this point, although it's an opportunity. and as we drive further into these consumer insights research, that will guide us on whether we should have a whole different brand or not.
so, we've got good brands. it's really getting new products out there and really engaging consumers. we've had a tough time engaging consumers and getting new distribution. so, we've got to put together a better story, a more value benefit type of brand performance and an opportunity for consumers to pursue. so we've got a lot of good innovation in the pipeline. the chickpea chip, we wanted to get something outside of the nut category. we feel like we can -- we know the salty snack section really well with our nuts, so why not pursue something in salty snacks. and it ties in well with health and wellness and time will tell. but we feel like we've got a really great product and we've got a great position, and so we'll see how that goes. i'm very optimistic about that.
and then, for squirrel, we're looking at launching a bunch of new things in the back half of fiscal '22. you'll see some things in the market. ruby royale is a brand that we launched, that would be considered a sub-brand i guess, that we launched it valentine's last year, and we're doing another promotion in the fall of this year. so, possibility for additional brands, but at this point, we're really focused on our current brands.
as far as capabilities, you asked about capex -- manufacturing.
jasper b. sanfilippo -- chief operating officer, president and assistant secretary
yeah. so, tim, in terms of manufacturing, the one to two year old innovation projects that we have will be currently manufactured in-house. but as we look to what innovation looks like three to five years, i would highly expect the company will be using co-packers to some of our product for us.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
and one more thing i didn't touch on, tim, was our recipe program we've launched a product line of flours, nut flours, almond flour, pecan flour, and almond coconut flour. an extremely successful launch. we've got a lot of great distribution. consumers are looking for, again, that plant protein, something that they can use for cooking outside of other items. and so we're really optimistic about the success of that program and expanding it. so, a lot of opportunities in the ingredient category as well for fisher.
timothy call -- the capital management corporation -- analyst
thank you. congratulations again.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim.
operator
thank you. our next question is a follow-up from chris mcginnis with sidoti & company. your line is open.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
thanks. i just wanted to maybe just ask about the competitive landscape and how it's shaping up. it seemed like maybe in fisher recipe it was a little bit more than maybe historically i guess. you just maybe -- just talk about what's happening in the marketplace? thanks.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. so, on the snack side, obviously, hormel with its acquisition of planters makes them extremely strong competitor. the transition is still taking place now. we expect to see more investments in the planters brand in the snack category. so, time will tell. but we're, like i said, trying to build our position for fisher snack and squirrel and ovh, and find that right positioning to compete with planters.
on the recipe side, diamond is our largest competitor there, as well as private brands. most of our distribution losses came -- a lot of it came from private brands, building their own private brand recipe programs, but we still feel there's opportunities in the ingredient category. during the pandemic, we've brought a lot of -- the pandemic brought a lot of new consumers to the recipe category. as i mentioned, people were staying home. they cooked at home. they entertained at home. and so we saw a huge increase in our recipe consumption across the country. and so we feel there's a lot of opportunities there.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. and then just with the strength of the balance sheet, can you maybe just discuss any outlook for possible m&a versus, i guess, enhancement innovation [phonetic]?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, m&a, i always talked about m&a, we always look at it. we've looked at a couple of companies even this last quarter. nothing that really made sense for us to pursue. but as we build our path to $2 billion, which is a long-range plan that we're working on now, m&a is going to definitely be part of that. so you've got opportunities for small brands or small company capabilities or, obviously, a transformational opportunity that comes up. but it's always part of our strategic plan for growth in m&a. just nothing that we saw today that we really wanted to have.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. thanks very much again for taking my questions and good luck in q1.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the john b. sanfilippo & son fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 year end operating results conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mike valentine, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
thank you, shannon. good morning everyone and welcome to our 2021 fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings call. thank you for joining us today. on the call with me today are jeffrey sanfilippo, our chief executive officer; and jasper sanfilippo, our chief operating officer.
before we start, we remind you that we may make some forward-looking statements today. these statements are based on our current expectations and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business. the factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various sec filings we have made, including forms 10-k and 10-q. we encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about these risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business.
i'll start the call by covering financial highlights for the 2021 fourth quarter and fiscal year.
the current fourth quarter net sales increased 1.2% to $206.7 million compared to net sales of $204.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. the increase in net sales was due to a 9.6% increase in sales volume, which we define as pounds sold to customers. the increase in net sales was offset in large part by a 7.6% decrease in the weighted average selling price per pound. the decline in the weighted average selling price per pound resulted from a decline in commodity acquisition costs for all of the major tree nuts that we buy.
sales volume increased in the consumer distribution channel by 2.5%. the volume increase in the consumer channel was primarily driven by increased sales of private brand snack and trail mix products from new distribution earned with existing customers. sales volume increases for our orchard valley harvest products and fisher snack nuts also contributed to the sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel. sales volume in the consumer channel accounted for 73.2% of our total sales volume in the current fourth quarter.
sales volume increased 49.5% in the commercial ingredients distribution channel and that was primarily due to a 117.1% increase in sales volume to food service customers. the increase in food service volume was attributable primarily to the lifting of indoor dining restrictions in restaurants throughout the us.
now, looking at sales volume for brands in our consumer channel. fisher recipe nut volume decreased 38.9%, and that was in large part due to lost shelf space in favor of private brand products at one customer and competitive pricing pressure at another customer. the 23.1% increase in sales volume for our orchard valley harvest brand primarily came from increased foot traffic in stores at a major customer in the apparel and home goods sector and also increased promotional activity at another customer. fisher snack nut volume increased 6.9%, and that was mainly due to increased sales of inshell peanuts to a major customer in preparation for our discontinuance of that product line. sales volume for southern style nuts decreased 3.6%, and that was as a result of the discontinuance of an item at a major customer.
fiscal 2021 net sales decreased 2.5% to $858.5 million compared to fiscal 2020 net sales of $880.1 million, while sales volume increased 1.6%. the decline in net sales was attributable to a 4% decline in the weighted average selling price per pound of our products. as was the case in the quarterly comparison, the decline in the weighted average selling price for the fiscal year resulted from a decline in commodity acquisition costs for all of the major tree nuts that we buy.
sales volume increased 6.4% in the consumer channel. the volume increase was driven by increased sales of private brand trail mixes, snack mixes and snack nuts from new distribution earned at existing customers, also a shift in preference to lower priced private brand products and growth in snacking as many consumers continue to purchase food for consumption at home. increased sales of fisher snack nuts also contributed to the sales volume increase in the consumer channel.
sales volume declined 13.9% in the commercial ingredients channel and that was due to a 13.6% decline in sales volume in our food service business and a decline in sales of peanut crushing stock to peanut oil processors. the decline in food service sales volume was attributable to nationwide restrictions on indoor dining at restaurants and a decline in air travel due to covid-19, primarily in our first three quarters.
sales volume decreased 8.2% in the contract packaging channel, primarily as a result of the impact of lower foot traffic in convenience stores on a major customer's business, and again, that was due to covid-19.
gross profit increased to $46.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to $40.7 million in last year's fourth quarter. and gross profit margin was 22.6% of net sales compared to 20% in the prior year's fourth quarter. the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin were due primarily to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts and also increased sales volume.
gross profit for fiscal '21 increased to $185 million from $175.8 million in fiscal 2020. gross profit margin increased to 21.5% of net sales from 20% for fiscal '20. the increases in gross profit margin and gross profit were again due to lower commodity acquisition costs for all the major tree nuts that we buy, and also increased sales volume.
total operating expenses in the quarterly comparison increased $4.3 million and total operating percentages -- i'm sorry, total operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 14.2% from 12.3% in the quarterly comparison. the increase in total operating expenses in the quarterly comparison was mainly attributable to increases in freight, incentive compensation and consumer insight research and related consulting expenses. and these expense increases were offset in part by a decrease in advertising expense.
total operating expenses for fiscal '21 increased $2.6 million and total operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 11.6% from 11% in fiscal '20. the increase in total operating expenses came from increased freight expense and increased spending on consumer insight research and related consulting expenses. partially offsetting these was a reduction in advertising expense and a gain of $2.3 million from the final insurance recovery that was related to a fire at our garysburg, north carolina facility, and that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal '20.
interest expense decreased to $300,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 from $500,000 in last year's fourth quarter. and interest expense for the current fiscal year decreased to $1.4 million from $2 million in fiscal '20. the decreases in both comparisons came from lower average debt levels.
net income was a record $12.3 million or $1.07 per share diluted for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and net income for fiscal '21 was a record $59.7 million or $5.17 per share diluted.
taking a quick look at inventory, the total value of inventories on hand at the end of the current fiscal year decreased $24.1 million or 14% compared to the total value of inventories at the end of fiscal '20. the decrease in the value of total inventories was primarily due to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts and lower quantities of peanuts, pecans and finished goods. the weighted average cost per pound of our raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand at the end of the current fourth quarter fell by 11.9%. and this decline, again, was due to lower commodity acquisition costs.
now, before i turn the call over to jeffrey, i'd like to remind investors that this is my last earnings call as cfo. and frank pellegrino, our executive vice president of finance and administration, will take on that role as cfo. i leave this critical responsibility in very good hands. i'll still be involved in our ir efforts with frank, and i will remain available for investor calls at any time.
now, i'll turn the call over to jeffrey sanfilippo, our ceo, to provide additional comments on our performance for the current fourth quarter and fiscal year. jeffrey?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning everyone.
as was the case in the previous two quarters, we again reported record net income and diluted earnings per share for the current fourth quarter. the record results were driven primarily by rebound in our food service business and contract packaging distribution channel. we also experienced sales volume growth in the consumer distribution channel in this quarterly comparison, which built on the significant sales growth we enjoyed in last year's fourth quarter. this growth came from distribution gains at some of our private brand customers as we demonstrated our ability to maintain superior service and quality levels while facing challenges related to the pandemic in fiscal 2020 and 2021 and numerous constraints in the global supply chain in the latter half of fiscal '21. this is the third consecutive year jbss has delivered record net income and record eps. in addition, we shipped over 294 million pounds to customers, which is another record for the company.
the significant operating results we have achieved these past few years demonstrate the underlying strength and resilience of our organization despite competitive pressures and the impact of covid-19. it is also a testament to the fortitude of our business model, the commitment of our people and the mutual trust and depth of our customer and supplier partnerships.
due to our strong financial results over the last three quarters, we raised our annual regular dividend 7.7% to $0.70 per share and supplemented that with a special dividend of $2.30 per share, both of which will be paid to our stockholders on august 25, 2021. these most recent dividend payments mark the 10th consecutive year that we have paid dividends and we are pleased to return cash to our stockholders.
and we are paying bonuses to each and every one of our exceptional jbss employees who worked together this past year. i am so proud of the hard work, dedication and leadership of our 1,300 team members throughout the company. they amaze me with their commitment to service our customers. and they continue to work hard to support their families and support each other. a special thanks to our manufacturing teams who are so focused on operational efficiencies in production to reduce spending per pound produced while still providing best-in-class quality and service levels.
in addition to achieving record results and maintaining best in quality class service levels, we also invested in people and added many new members from large food and beverage companies to our sales, brand marketing, innovation and consumer insights teams, as we start our journey to reinvent and reinvigorate our brands. we also increased our investment in consumer insights, as mike mentioned, in the current fourth quarter. with these teams largely in place, we plan on making additional investments in consumer insights, consumer research and product innovation and development in fiscal '22.
the increased investment in consumer insights will help fuel our growth and embed insights across the organization. we're investing in people and capabilities to unlock insights that address changing consumer needs and behaviors that will drive growth by enabling our marketing efforts to win the hearts and minds of new and existing customers. notably, we're increasing our foresight capabilities that will help future-proof jbss by using ai and social media listening tools to help us capitalize on trends and changes in consumer behavior more quickly. we have witnessed extraordinary shifts in consumption these past 17 months, and the investments we are making will establish a stronger foundation to identify opportunities faster to develop innovative products, build stronger brands and expand consumption with new consumers.
now, there are headwinds that all companies face now in the coming year as we look at current trends in the world and in this country. our management team is working hard to execute action plans to mitigate risks to our business. i will share some of the expected challenges and what we are doing.
first and foremost is people. we are operating in a very tight labor market. human capital, health and wellness and overcoming labor shortages are a top priority. to address labor shortages, the company has increased wages for our manufacturing employees. we also increased shift differentials and starting wages for hard-to-fill positions and we began seeing improvement in our fill rates. we offer referral and sign-on bonuses to our new hires and employees. in addition, we are enhancing our total team performance bonus program by introducing a payout modifier that will allow our employees to double their bonus payouts. another major project to mitigate labor challenges is our investment in robotics for our packaging lines and material handling positions. and lastly, we expanded our use of temporary labor agencies to source and recruit people to fill positions in our operations.
we also recognize that in order for our company to be successful, our employees must be healthy, well trained and motivated to do their best every day. we are thus relentlessly focused on attracting, retaining and managing talent across organization. due to recent surges in covid-19 in some areas of the country, we are adjusting our safety policies and practices in accordance with guidance from the us centers for disease control, federal, state and local governments and other health authorities.
we also recognize that our business is stronger and more successful if supported by a diverse workforce. our goal is to be more intentional in hiring, maintaining and promoting diversity among our employees and fostering an inclusive environment where differences are celebrated. in fiscal 2021, we launched our diversity, equity and inclusion council, consisting of a team of employees from different functional areas to provide oversight and enhance our diversity and inclusion initiatives.
we believe that training, developing and promoting our employees is another important part of our vibrant employee culture. these measures enhance our performance and are important component of employee satisfaction. we offer training to our employees on a variety of subjects related to professional development, workplace fundamentals, business, computer applications and industry-specific subjects. i believe we are doing the right things to retain our team members and mitigate the impact of a tight labor market.
the second headwind we face is challenges with supply chain. most manufacturers are dealing with raw material and freight cost increases and with deliveries for those materials. beginning with the summer of 2020, we already started experiencing variability in transportation costs due to additional demand in shipping, a general shortage of drivers, increased fuel costs and federal regulations. in addition to transportation costs, we experienced increased commodity and raw material costs, increased packaging material prices, higher general water, energy and fuel costs, and increased labor costs.
we have worked closely with our domestic and global suppliers to source and maintain a consistent supply of raw materials, ingredients and packaging. to date, none of our manufacturing facilities have been significantly impacted by this pandemic. however, recent surges in covid-19 cases, especially in southern vietnam from where most of our cashews are sourced and extensive lockdowns are in place, could have a negative impact on our operations if shipments of raw materials are delayed. but we have contingency plans in place to help reduce the negative impact if one or more of our manufacturing facilities encounters a partial or full shutdown.
we closely monitor these supply chain costs and challenges and we are very transparent with our key partners about their potential impact. our sales and marketing leaders are having difficult but necessary conversations now about price increases, lead times and service level expectations. and our operations team is laser-focused on driving cost out of manufacturing in other areas of the supply chain we can control where we can reduce our cost to mitigate price inflation and service level challenges.
now, i'll shift to consumption activity and category updates. i will share some of the category and brand results with you for the quarter. as always, all the market information i'll be referring to is iri reported data and for today, it is for the period ending june 20, 2021. when i refer to q4, i'm referring to 13 weeks of the quarter ending june 20, 2021. references to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period one year ago. and when we discuss pricing, we are referring to average price per pound. the term velocity refers to the sales per point of distribution. we look at the category on iri's total us definition, which includes food, drug, mass, walmart, military and other outlets, unless otherwise specified. breakouts of the recipe, snack, trail mix and produce nut categories are based on our custom definitions developed in conjunction with iri.
as we've mentioned for the past year, covid-19 had positive and negative impacts upon our results for fiscal '21. in this last quarter, we saw that total nut category grow 1% in both dollars and pounds, with pricing flat. however, different dynamics happened in each of the recipe, snack, trail mix and produce subcategories, which i'll cover now.
starting with recipe nuts. the recipe nut category declined 20% in dollars and 14% in pounds in q4. the decline is due to the lapping of key lockdown months of april to june of 2020, where consumers were cooking and baking more at-home compared to eating out. the fisher brand continue to be challenge in the recipe category, with declines of 38% in dollars and 33% in pounds in q4. fisher not only suffered from the same lapping trend as a category, but was also challenged by distribution declines at two key retailers. while we did see some nice momentum in velocity, these gains were not sufficient to offset the distribution losses. as a result, fisher pound share decreased by 3.4 points, ending the quarter with a pound share of 11.9%. fisher continues to be the number one share leader in the recipe nut category.
i'll now move on to the snack and trail mix categories. in q4, the snack nut category was down 1% in both dollars and pound volume. fisher snack brand saw declines of 2% in dollars and pound volume during the same period, driven by distribution declines. we did see some nice gains in volume for our fisher snack oven roasted never fried product portfolio and pet packaging structure, but it did not offset the losses in other parts of the brand. the trail mix category grew in the fourth quarter with a 10% increase in dollar volume and an 8% increase in pound volume. a large portion of consumer consumption of trail mix is away from home. so as we lap the key lockdown periods last year, this category grew in the fourth quarter, as more people are spending time away from home. our southern style nuts and trail mix brand increased 3% in dollars and 7% in pounds. while we increased promotional activity at a key retailer, discontinuation of an item at another retailer mitigated the overall performance compared to the category.
finally, i'll share [phonetic] the performance for produce nuts. in q4, produce nuts category increased 9% in dollars and 4% in pound volume sales. our orchard valley harvest produce brand saw a 6% increase in pound volume with dollar volume being flat. the brand's performance was driven by increased trade and promotional activity across our multi-packs products.
in closing, fiscal '21 was a strong year, especially considering the dynamic changes we've all experienced. this success is possible because we have talented people across our organization and we invest in them to do what matters most to drive results. we are executing our growth strategies, implementing continuous improvement projects throughout the organization to optimize our cost structure and we continue to invest in our people, our brands and our processes to better serve our customers and consumers and create value for our shareholders.
i would like to take this time now to thank mike valentine for his many years as our cfo and for guiding our company through both challenging years and enormously successful years. his leadership and commitment to the company have been extraordinary. for the past few years, mike has mentored frank pellegrino, who will take on the role as our new cfo, starting at the close of business tomorrow. i look forward to working with frank on these earnings calls and with investors. and as mike mentioned, he will continue with the company and focus on his other important responsibilities with procurement, regulatory compliance, ir and leading our contract manufacturing division.
we appreciate your participation in the call and thank you for your interest in our company. i will now turn the call back over to mike one last time.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
okay. thank you, jeff. pretty exciting there. at this time, we will open the call to questions. shannon, can you please queue up the first question?
",2021-Q2,JBSS

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from chris mcginnis with sidoti & company. your line is open.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. nice quarter. and mike, thanks for all the help and look forward to working with you in different capacity as well.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
thank you, chris. my pleasure.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
thank you. i guess maybe to start, acquisition costs have been pretty advantageous for you. can you just talk about your outlook for '22, and purchase pricing of tree nuts for the year, and your thought process around it?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
sure. so, as we pointed out in the last few quarters, we've seen some significantly low commodity acquisition costs. i'd say probably in about all cases, they dipped below historical averages. looking forward at new crop, and we don't have complete visibility on that yet, but in most cases, we think many of those costs are going to return to something close to historical averages, with the exception of cashews, which may run a little bit higher than that. and then almonds, just because of the droughts that we're seeing in the central valley of california, maybe above historical averages.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and i guess just thinking about very successful on the consumer side, can you just talk about the opportunities for growth when you look out to '22 both on the private label and the branded sides where your opportunities are?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. chris, this is jeff. thanks for the question. so, really fiscal '22 opportunities, looking at private brands first, focusing on our key partners. there's still opportunities to build and work with them on expanding their private brand programs. and we touched on the trail mix segment, which continues to grow, especially as states start to open up and people are on the go again. but also just product innovation, in general, there's still a shift to plant proteins. and so we're seeing retailers look at other opportunities to expand their nut program as they look at opportunities and changes in consumer behavior.
the other thing that we are focused on is bringing new consumers to the categories, both for private brands and for our brands. if we get the gen z and the millennial population, there, nuts are not always first top of mind when they go out for to purchase a snack. and so, part of our reason for investing in consumer insights is to truly understand those purchasing dynamics and that behavior to help understand how we can pursue those consumers and bring them to both the snack and recipe category.
on the branded side, the team is, as i talked about, we brought in a lot of new key talent from outside our organization with great experience at other major cpg companies. and the focus is on really building stronger brands, building better brand positioning statements, better engagement with consumers, a stronger product portfolio, because we still see a lot of opportunities in growth in snack nuts and in recipe and ingredients as well.
the last thing i will add is we are expanding our product portfolio. i talked about launching outside of the nut category. we have a chickpea chip under our orchard valley harvest brand, which was launched. we did some test marketing last year. and you'll see that rollout into first half -- or first -- second quarter of fiscal '22 and you'll start to see that product. you can find it already on amazon as a test, but you'll see that product rollout nationally in the beginning of second quarter of fiscal '22.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. and i appreciate that. and i guess just thinking about the investment you're making, both in personnel, but also the consumer research, what are your early signs that the kind of indications of the opportunity there? can you maybe just expand on what you're seeing? i know it's still early stage, but...
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so, i touched on a little bit about the millennials and the gen zs and their consumption behavior, it's one of the first insights that we've seen. also, the investment in the consumer insights allows us to find other gaps. and we've talked a lot about expanding consumption, looking at alternative channels and we truly understanding where consumers are buying food products. this new technology allows us to tap into places where we didn't realize people were consuming nuts before. the last thing it does is it helps us to really understand trends faster than we've ever been able to. so as we start to develop new product innovation, both for our brands and for private brand customers, we'll have much better intelligence to develop the right products that consumers are looking for. so, very exciting. it's initial stages, but we're building that foundation to have a really strong consumer insights team and have better visibility of future trends and what's happening today.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. and just two more, and i'll jump back in queue. maybe just around commercial ingredients, obviously, a nice rebound. can you maybe just discuss where your volumes are versus prior to the pandemic level, and how much more room in it for growth there?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, the team -- throughout the pandemic, as restaurants started to close, our food service team was working so hard to maintain relationships with our food service account, making sure that we gain new distribution so that when the states did open up, we had our products ready and available for our food service customers. and so, i really believe that we're starting to see that rebound. food service has come back with the roar. our backlog is strong in food service. customers are ordering. they're replenishing. consumers are going out to eat. and so i think we're in a much better place at the end of the pandemic with our distribution and our relationships and where we're focused on to really build a stronger, more robust food service channel that we had prior to the pandemic.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. and then just one on the capex. i think it's $18 million expected for '22. anything specific there in terms of growth versus maintenance to call out?
jasper b. sanfilippo -- chief operating officer, president and assistant secretary
yeah. chris, this is jasper. i would say, a good portion of it really is toward automation. there is a quite a bit of maintenance as we have every year. i would not say it's anything more than unusual. there is some upgrades to make lines go quicker, so i guess you could argue that would be going toward growth. but quite a bit of it really is finishing a big capex project from last year and continuing to invest in automation.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i appreciate the time today. i'll jump back in queue for now. thanks.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, chris.
operator
our next question comes from timothy call with capital management corporation. your line is open.
timothy call -- the capital management corporation -- analyst
thank you. congratulations on another strong quarter and year. it's good to see mike hand of this role from such strength, that shows a lot. and i was wondering with interest expense falling by 40%, do you think in the fourth quarter of -- in two or three years that you might actually have net interest income, not net interest expense?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
i don't think so. i mean, this year is a little bit unique in respect to lower commodity costs. as we return to normal, i think you can expect to see normal borrowing levels through company there [phonetic].
timothy call -- the capital management corporation -- analyst
and when you sell the garysburg facility, should that sale be completed in this fiscal year?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
yeah, we expect that to be completed in this current first quarter.
timothy call -- the capital management corporation -- analyst
and with new product launches, do you expect new brand names? do you expect to use current manufacturing facilities in idle capacity? and you mentioned the launch of the chips, will there be other launches this fiscal year, or do you expect a new product once a year?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, tim, good question. so, we've invested a lot in innovation and research and development. we've got really good brands. the challenge is we don't have very good distribution in acv. and so we feel like we've got good brands today that we can focus on the health and wellness with orchard valley harvest. we have our squirrel indulgent brand. and then we have fisher recipe and snack as our core nut brand. so, we've got the brands. i think today i don't know if we would add sub-brands at this point, although it's an opportunity. and as we drive further into these consumer insights research, that will guide us on whether we should have a whole different brand or not.
so, we've got good brands. it's really getting new products out there and really engaging consumers. we've had a tough time engaging consumers and getting new distribution. so, we've got to put together a better story, a more value benefit type of brand performance and an opportunity for consumers to pursue. so we've got a lot of good innovation in the pipeline. the chickpea chip, we wanted to get something outside of the nut category. we feel like we can -- we know the salty snack section really well with our nuts, so why not pursue something in salty snacks. and it ties in well with health and wellness and time will tell. but we feel like we've got a really great product and we've got a great position, and so we'll see how that goes. i'm very optimistic about that.
and then, for squirrel, we're looking at launching a bunch of new things in the back half of fiscal '22. you'll see some things in the market. ruby royale is a brand that we launched, that would be considered a sub-brand i guess, that we launched it valentine's last year, and we're doing another promotion in the fall of this year. so, possibility for additional brands, but at this point, we're really focused on our current brands.
as far as capabilities, you asked about capex -- manufacturing.
jasper b. sanfilippo -- chief operating officer, president and assistant secretary
yeah. so, tim, in terms of manufacturing, the one to two year old innovation projects that we have will be currently manufactured in-house. but as we look to what innovation looks like three to five years, i would highly expect the company will be using co-packers to some of our product for us.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
and one more thing i didn't touch on, tim, was our recipe program we've launched a product line of flours, nut flours, almond flour, pecan flour, and almond coconut flour. an extremely successful launch. we've got a lot of great distribution. consumers are looking for, again, that plant protein, something that they can use for cooking outside of other items. and so we're really optimistic about the success of that program and expanding it. so, a lot of opportunities in the ingredient category as well for fisher.
timothy call -- the capital management corporation -- analyst
thank you. congratulations again.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim.
operator
thank you. our next question is a follow-up from chris mcginnis with sidoti & company. your line is open.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
thanks. i just wanted to maybe just ask about the competitive landscape and how it's shaping up. it seemed like maybe in fisher recipe it was a little bit more than maybe historically i guess. you just maybe -- just talk about what's happening in the marketplace? thanks.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. so, on the snack side, obviously, hormel with its acquisition of planters makes them extremely strong competitor. the transition is still taking place now. we expect to see more investments in the planters brand in the snack category. so, time will tell. but we're, like i said, trying to build our position for fisher snack and squirrel and ovh, and find that right positioning to compete with planters.
on the recipe side, diamond is our largest competitor there, as well as private brands. most of our distribution losses came -- a lot of it came from private brands, building their own private brand recipe programs, but we still feel there's opportunities in the ingredient category. during the pandemic, we've brought a lot of -- the pandemic brought a lot of new consumers to the recipe category. as i mentioned, people were staying home. they cooked at home. they entertained at home. and so we saw a huge increase in our recipe consumption across the country. and so we feel there's a lot of opportunities there.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. and then just with the strength of the balance sheet, can you maybe just discuss any outlook for possible m&a versus, i guess, enhancement innovation [phonetic]?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, m&a, i always talked about m&a, we always look at it. we've looked at a couple of companies even this last quarter. nothing that really made sense for us to pursue. but as we build our path to $2 billion, which is a long-range plan that we're working on now, m&a is going to definitely be part of that. so you've got opportunities for small brands or small company capabilities or, obviously, a transformational opportunity that comes up. but it's always part of our strategic plan for growth in m&a. just nothing that we saw today that we really wanted to have.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. thanks very much again for taking my questions and good luck in q1.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the john b. sanfilippo & son fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 year end operating results conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mike valentine, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
thank you, shannon. good morning everyone and welcome to our 2021 fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings call. thank you for joining us today. on the call with me today are jeffrey sanfilippo, our chief executive officer; and jasper sanfilippo, our chief operating officer.
before we start, we remind you that we may make some forward-looking statements today. these statements are based on our current expectations and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business. the factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various sec filings we have made, including forms 10-k and 10-q. we encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about these risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business.
i'll start the call by covering financial highlights for the 2021 fourth quarter and fiscal year.
the current fourth quarter net sales increased 1.2% to $206.7 million compared to net sales of $204.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. the increase in net sales was due to a 9.6% increase in sales volume, which we define as pounds sold to customers. the increase in net sales was offset in large part by a 7.6% decrease in the weighted average selling price per pound. the decline in the weighted average selling price per pound resulted from a decline in commodity acquisition costs for all of the major tree nuts that we buy.
sales volume increased in the consumer distribution channel by 2.5%. the volume increase in the consumer channel was primarily driven by increased sales of private brand snack and trail mix products from new distribution earned with existing customers. sales volume increases for our orchard valley harvest products and fisher snack nuts also contributed to the sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel. sales volume in the consumer channel accounted for 73.2% of our total sales volume in the current fourth quarter.
sales volume increased 49.5% in the commercial ingredients distribution channel and that was primarily due to a 117.1% increase in sales volume to food service customers. the increase in food service volume was attributable primarily to the lifting of indoor dining restrictions in restaurants throughout the us.
now, looking at sales volume for brands in our consumer channel. fisher recipe nut volume decreased 38.9%, and that was in large part due to lost shelf space in favor of private brand products at one customer and competitive pricing pressure at another customer. the 23.1% increase in sales volume for our orchard valley harvest brand primarily came from increased foot traffic in stores at a major customer in the apparel and home goods sector and also increased promotional activity at another customer. fisher snack nut volume increased 6.9%, and that was mainly due to increased sales of inshell peanuts to a major customer in preparation for our discontinuance of that product line. sales volume for southern style nuts decreased 3.6%, and that was as a result of the discontinuance of an item at a major customer.
fiscal 2021 net sales decreased 2.5% to $858.5 million compared to fiscal 2020 net sales of $880.1 million, while sales volume increased 1.6%. the decline in net sales was attributable to a 4% decline in the weighted average selling price per pound of our products. as was the case in the quarterly comparison, the decline in the weighted average selling price for the fiscal year resulted from a decline in commodity acquisition costs for all of the major tree nuts that we buy.
sales volume increased 6.4% in the consumer channel. the volume increase was driven by increased sales of private brand trail mixes, snack mixes and snack nuts from new distribution earned at existing customers, also a shift in preference to lower priced private brand products and growth in snacking as many consumers continue to purchase food for consumption at home. increased sales of fisher snack nuts also contributed to the sales volume increase in the consumer channel.
sales volume declined 13.9% in the commercial ingredients channel and that was due to a 13.6% decline in sales volume in our food service business and a decline in sales of peanut crushing stock to peanut oil processors. the decline in food service sales volume was attributable to nationwide restrictions on indoor dining at restaurants and a decline in air travel due to covid-19, primarily in our first three quarters.
sales volume decreased 8.2% in the contract packaging channel, primarily as a result of the impact of lower foot traffic in convenience stores on a major customer's business, and again, that was due to covid-19.
gross profit increased to $46.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to $40.7 million in last year's fourth quarter. and gross profit margin was 22.6% of net sales compared to 20% in the prior year's fourth quarter. the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin were due primarily to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts and also increased sales volume.
gross profit for fiscal '21 increased to $185 million from $175.8 million in fiscal 2020. gross profit margin increased to 21.5% of net sales from 20% for fiscal '20. the increases in gross profit margin and gross profit were again due to lower commodity acquisition costs for all the major tree nuts that we buy, and also increased sales volume.
total operating expenses in the quarterly comparison increased $4.3 million and total operating percentages -- i'm sorry, total operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 14.2% from 12.3% in the quarterly comparison. the increase in total operating expenses in the quarterly comparison was mainly attributable to increases in freight, incentive compensation and consumer insight research and related consulting expenses. and these expense increases were offset in part by a decrease in advertising expense.
total operating expenses for fiscal '21 increased $2.6 million and total operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 11.6% from 11% in fiscal '20. the increase in total operating expenses came from increased freight expense and increased spending on consumer insight research and related consulting expenses. partially offsetting these was a reduction in advertising expense and a gain of $2.3 million from the final insurance recovery that was related to a fire at our garysburg, north carolina facility, and that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal '20.
interest expense decreased to $300,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 from $500,000 in last year's fourth quarter. and interest expense for the current fiscal year decreased to $1.4 million from $2 million in fiscal '20. the decreases in both comparisons came from lower average debt levels.
net income was a record $12.3 million or $1.07 per share diluted for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and net income for fiscal '21 was a record $59.7 million or $5.17 per share diluted.
taking a quick look at inventory, the total value of inventories on hand at the end of the current fiscal year decreased $24.1 million or 14% compared to the total value of inventories at the end of fiscal '20. the decrease in the value of total inventories was primarily due to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts and lower quantities of peanuts, pecans and finished goods. the weighted average cost per pound of our raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand at the end of the current fourth quarter fell by 11.9%. and this decline, again, was due to lower commodity acquisition costs.
now, before i turn the call over to jeffrey, i'd like to remind investors that this is my last earnings call as cfo. and frank pellegrino, our executive vice president of finance and administration, will take on that role as cfo. i leave this critical responsibility in very good hands. i'll still be involved in our ir efforts with frank, and i will remain available for investor calls at any time.
now, i'll turn the call over to jeffrey sanfilippo, our ceo, to provide additional comments on our performance for the current fourth quarter and fiscal year. jeffrey?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning everyone.
as was the case in the previous two quarters, we again reported record net income and diluted earnings per share for the current fourth quarter. the record results were driven primarily by rebound in our food service business and contract packaging distribution channel. we also experienced sales volume growth in the consumer distribution channel in this quarterly comparison, which built on the significant sales growth we enjoyed in last year's fourth quarter. this growth came from distribution gains at some of our private brand customers as we demonstrated our ability to maintain superior service and quality levels while facing challenges related to the pandemic in fiscal 2020 and 2021 and numerous constraints in the global supply chain in the latter half of fiscal '21. this is the third consecutive year jbss has delivered record net income and record eps. in addition, we shipped over 294 million pounds to customers, which is another record for the company.
the significant operating results we have achieved these past few years demonstrate the underlying strength and resilience of our organization despite competitive pressures and the impact of covid-19. it is also a testament to the fortitude of our business model, the commitment of our people and the mutual trust and depth of our customer and supplier partnerships.
due to our strong financial results over the last three quarters, we raised our annual regular dividend 7.7% to $0.70 per share and supplemented that with a special dividend of $2.30 per share, both of which will be paid to our stockholders on august 25, 2021. these most recent dividend payments mark the 10th consecutive year that we have paid dividends and we are pleased to return cash to our stockholders.
and we are paying bonuses to each and every one of our exceptional jbss employees who worked together this past year. i am so proud of the hard work, dedication and leadership of our 1,300 team members throughout the company. they amaze me with their commitment to service our customers. and they continue to work hard to support their families and support each other. a special thanks to our manufacturing teams who are so focused on operational efficiencies in production to reduce spending per pound produced while still providing best-in-class quality and service levels.
in addition to achieving record results and maintaining best in quality class service levels, we also invested in people and added many new members from large food and beverage companies to our sales, brand marketing, innovation and consumer insights teams, as we start our journey to reinvent and reinvigorate our brands. we also increased our investment in consumer insights, as mike mentioned, in the current fourth quarter. with these teams largely in place, we plan on making additional investments in consumer insights, consumer research and product innovation and development in fiscal '22.
the increased investment in consumer insights will help fuel our growth and embed insights across the organization. we're investing in people and capabilities to unlock insights that address changing consumer needs and behaviors that will drive growth by enabling our marketing efforts to win the hearts and minds of new and existing customers. notably, we're increasing our foresight capabilities that will help future-proof jbss by using ai and social media listening tools to help us capitalize on trends and changes in consumer behavior more quickly. we have witnessed extraordinary shifts in consumption these past 17 months, and the investments we are making will establish a stronger foundation to identify opportunities faster to develop innovative products, build stronger brands and expand consumption with new consumers.
now, there are headwinds that all companies face now in the coming year as we look at current trends in the world and in this country. our management team is working hard to execute action plans to mitigate risks to our business. i will share some of the expected challenges and what we are doing.
first and foremost is people. we are operating in a very tight labor market. human capital, health and wellness and overcoming labor shortages are a top priority. to address labor shortages, the company has increased wages for our manufacturing employees. we also increased shift differentials and starting wages for hard-to-fill positions and we began seeing improvement in our fill rates. we offer referral and sign-on bonuses to our new hires and employees. in addition, we are enhancing our total team performance bonus program by introducing a payout modifier that will allow our employees to double their bonus payouts. another major project to mitigate labor challenges is our investment in robotics for our packaging lines and material handling positions. and lastly, we expanded our use of temporary labor agencies to source and recruit people to fill positions in our operations.
we also recognize that in order for our company to be successful, our employees must be healthy, well trained and motivated to do their best every day. we are thus relentlessly focused on attracting, retaining and managing talent across organization. due to recent surges in covid-19 in some areas of the country, we are adjusting our safety policies and practices in accordance with guidance from the us centers for disease control, federal, state and local governments and other health authorities.
we also recognize that our business is stronger and more successful if supported by a diverse workforce. our goal is to be more intentional in hiring, maintaining and promoting diversity among our employees and fostering an inclusive environment where differences are celebrated. in fiscal 2021, we launched our diversity, equity and inclusion council, consisting of a team of employees from different functional areas to provide oversight and enhance our diversity and inclusion initiatives.
we believe that training, developing and promoting our employees is another important part of our vibrant employee culture. these measures enhance our performance and are important component of employee satisfaction. we offer training to our employees on a variety of subjects related to professional development, workplace fundamentals, business, computer applications and industry-specific subjects. i believe we are doing the right things to retain our team members and mitigate the impact of a tight labor market.
the second headwind we face is challenges with supply chain. most manufacturers are dealing with raw material and freight cost increases and with deliveries for those materials. beginning with the summer of 2020, we already started experiencing variability in transportation costs due to additional demand in shipping, a general shortage of drivers, increased fuel costs and federal regulations. in addition to transportation costs, we experienced increased commodity and raw material costs, increased packaging material prices, higher general water, energy and fuel costs, and increased labor costs.
we have worked closely with our domestic and global suppliers to source and maintain a consistent supply of raw materials, ingredients and packaging. to date, none of our manufacturing facilities have been significantly impacted by this pandemic. however, recent surges in covid-19 cases, especially in southern vietnam from where most of our cashews are sourced and extensive lockdowns are in place, could have a negative impact on our operations if shipments of raw materials are delayed. but we have contingency plans in place to help reduce the negative impact if one or more of our manufacturing facilities encounters a partial or full shutdown.
we closely monitor these supply chain costs and challenges and we are very transparent with our key partners about their potential impact. our sales and marketing leaders are having difficult but necessary conversations now about price increases, lead times and service level expectations. and our operations team is laser-focused on driving cost out of manufacturing in other areas of the supply chain we can control where we can reduce our cost to mitigate price inflation and service level challenges.
now, i'll shift to consumption activity and category updates. i will share some of the category and brand results with you for the quarter. as always, all the market information i'll be referring to is iri reported data and for today, it is for the period ending june 20, 2021. when i refer to q4, i'm referring to 13 weeks of the quarter ending june 20, 2021. references to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period one year ago. and when we discuss pricing, we are referring to average price per pound. the term velocity refers to the sales per point of distribution. we look at the category on iri's total us definition, which includes food, drug, mass, walmart, military and other outlets, unless otherwise specified. breakouts of the recipe, snack, trail mix and produce nut categories are based on our custom definitions developed in conjunction with iri.
as we've mentioned for the past year, covid-19 had positive and negative impacts upon our results for fiscal '21. in this last quarter, we saw that total nut category grow 1% in both dollars and pounds, with pricing flat. however, different dynamics happened in each of the recipe, snack, trail mix and produce subcategories, which i'll cover now.
starting with recipe nuts. the recipe nut category declined 20% in dollars and 14% in pounds in q4. the decline is due to the lapping of key lockdown months of april to june of 2020, where consumers were cooking and baking more at-home compared to eating out. the fisher brand continue to be challenge in the recipe category, with declines of 38% in dollars and 33% in pounds in q4. fisher not only suffered from the same lapping trend as a category, but was also challenged by distribution declines at two key retailers. while we did see some nice momentum in velocity, these gains were not sufficient to offset the distribution losses. as a result, fisher pound share decreased by 3.4 points, ending the quarter with a pound share of 11.9%. fisher continues to be the number one share leader in the recipe nut category.
i'll now move on to the snack and trail mix categories. in q4, the snack nut category was down 1% in both dollars and pound volume. fisher snack brand saw declines of 2% in dollars and pound volume during the same period, driven by distribution declines. we did see some nice gains in volume for our fisher snack oven roasted never fried product portfolio and pet packaging structure, but it did not offset the losses in other parts of the brand. the trail mix category grew in the fourth quarter with a 10% increase in dollar volume and an 8% increase in pound volume. a large portion of consumer consumption of trail mix is away from home. so as we lap the key lockdown periods last year, this category grew in the fourth quarter, as more people are spending time away from home. our southern style nuts and trail mix brand increased 3% in dollars and 7% in pounds. while we increased promotional activity at a key retailer, discontinuation of an item at another retailer mitigated the overall performance compared to the category.
finally, i'll share [phonetic] the performance for produce nuts. in q4, produce nuts category increased 9% in dollars and 4% in pound volume sales. our orchard valley harvest produce brand saw a 6% increase in pound volume with dollar volume being flat. the brand's performance was driven by increased trade and promotional activity across our multi-packs products.
in closing, fiscal '21 was a strong year, especially considering the dynamic changes we've all experienced. this success is possible because we have talented people across our organization and we invest in them to do what matters most to drive results. we are executing our growth strategies, implementing continuous improvement projects throughout the organization to optimize our cost structure and we continue to invest in our people, our brands and our processes to better serve our customers and consumers and create value for our shareholders.
i would like to take this time now to thank mike valentine for his many years as our cfo and for guiding our company through both challenging years and enormously successful years. his leadership and commitment to the company have been extraordinary. for the past few years, mike has mentored frank pellegrino, who will take on the role as our new cfo, starting at the close of business tomorrow. i look forward to working with frank on these earnings calls and with investors. and as mike mentioned, he will continue with the company and focus on his other important responsibilities with procurement, regulatory compliance, ir and leading our contract manufacturing division.
we appreciate your participation in the call and thank you for your interest in our company. i will now turn the call back over to mike one last time.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
okay. thank you, jeff. pretty exciting there. at this time, we will open the call to questions. shannon, can you please queue up the first question?
",2021-Q2,JBSS

operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of chris mcginnis from sidoti & company. your line is now open.
christopher paul mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i just wonder if maybe we could start off with just obviously a lot of talk around just the inflationary environment but also some of the other kind of external factors that are that should pressure sounds like profitability in the near term. can you just walk through some of the magnitude that you expect there? it's been a while since you've been in inflationary environment. and can you just walk us through how that could impact the model?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
well i'll start it off chris thanks for the question. obviously we are in a challenging situation with inflationary pricing not just commodities this time but it's labor it's freight. and so we are having those difficult conversations with customers. we've actually started that a few weeks ago. not easy but at the same time it's the right thing for the business and we need to make sure that we keep these customers in supply both being able to procure product for them package it and ship it. and so difficult conversations but they're necessary. we are getting back to actually normalized levels with some commodities. so it's not like we are increasing commodity costs way beyond where they've ever been. so retail prices should still be very competitive with what consumers have paid for in the past.
christopher paul mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and is there any issue around getting supply at this point?
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
so chris this is mike valentine. so we see shortages periodically on various different things. for example in packaging we're seeing lead times that could be as much as three months where they used to be weeks. occasionally we'll see some materials that will get very tight. like for example recently it's been living stock for our clear cans. we've talked about pallets before. and then of course anything imported can be a little bit dicey just due to the situation on west coast ports.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
and i would add chris that because of our procurement expertise and our visibility at the supply chain we anticipated some challenges we've watched how they've extended lead times on deliveries and our procurement team has done an extraordinary job making sure that we have been kept in stock as best as possible.
christopher paul mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i guess just turning on the demand side. on the within consumer just around that snack mix can you just talk about what's happening? you've obviously done a great job around that kind of in that product line. is this a new program and expansion with the existing customer? because it sounds like it was a pretty robust pickup in the quarter.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so you're referring to the fisher oven roast never fried program?
christopher paul mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
is that i thought it was a branded product or expansion with a customer around the snack nuts or the trail mix.
michael j. valentine -- chief financial officer, group president and secretary
trail mix.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so we've seen obviously snack and trail mixes. there's competitive pricing for mixes like that. so we've seen consumers shift to snack mixes. but it's been a growing category for a long time. we've really expanded our manufacturing of some private brand items with key customers in that trail mix category and snack mix category. so part of it is new products that we're supplying that we didn't in previous years. part of it is growth in that segment within the category.
frank s. pellegrino -- chief financial officer executive vice president of finance and treasurer
chris this is frank. a big factor in that is also and now we began to ship some new product to our private brand customers in q2 of last year. so the q1-over-q1 impact is much more significant in q1.
christopher paul mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. the comp is plays into it. okay. all right. that makes sense. and it sounds like fisher recipe you have some holiday you're coming up on the holiday. can you just talk about it. it sounds like you may approach it differently. is that correct in terms of how you're looking at the holiday season for fisher recipe?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
chris we've just our sales and marketing teams have done a great job building more relevant messaging for the holiday season. we've gained some new distribution. we focus on velocity the holiday season is the most important time period for recipe nuts. and our team has just positioned us really well both from a consumer messaging product placement pricing we're very competitive in the market from a pricing perspective. and so we just anticipate a really strong holiday season this year.
christopher paul mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. and anything you can share from the i know it's still early but just on the consumer side and some of the talent addition? what have they seen about the brands? what are they looking to introduce? can you just talk a little bit? i know you can't share too much probably on the new product introductions but whatever you could share would be helpful.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we're hopeful at least for the new product. we've made some investments in new technology that we'll discuss probably in the back half of the fiscal year. the consumer insights team has been focusing on just really understanding gen z and millennial generation consumers. they don't typically put nuts on their shopping list a lot of times when they go to the store. so we've got to understand that dynamic. they're looking at category trends and the changing consumer behavior as a result of the pandemic. e-commerce is critical. and just the social messaging and how you engage consumers has changed dramatically. so those investments we're making consumer insights are helping us to understand the consumer where they're shopping the type of messaging that impacts them. and we'll still have a much better level of intelligence to then look at our brands position them better message them better and engage consumers in the future.
christopher paul mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. and any update on the pea chips or some of the new product introductions and how they're contributing at this point?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. so the chickpea chips and orchard valley harvest we are we launched in e-commerce. we've got distribution on amazon. we're it's really a test market at this point but our goal is to have a full launch in spring of '22. so q3 of '22 we'll have a full launch of fisher of orchard valley harvest chickpea chips. it's a great product.
christopher paul mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. and then just looking on the commercial side is that the growth that we're seeing is as we reopen the economies reopen are you at are you do you think you're taking market share? is there ability to go out and take market share as the economy starts to open back up? and how far below are you from where i guess pre-covid levels are you at this point?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so it's we're still trying to get back to 2019 levels. obviously not all restaurants have full capacity not all restaurants are open. there's been some impact on restaurant closures as a result of the pandemic the past 19 months. so it will take time i believe for the entire foodservice channel to get back and very robust. what i will tell you is our foodservice team has worked so hard to build distribution. we've got better distribution today than we did in 2019 pre-pandemic. we have better products in the marketplace. and we have better relationships with some of the key foodservice players in the market. and so i'm very confident that our team is well positioned to take advantage and optimize this return to going out to dinners and lunches and breakfast and the return of foodservice and also traveling as well.
frank s. pellegrino -- chief financial officer executive vice president of finance and treasurer
chris this is frank again. and as far as your second part of that question at q1 we're approximately 87% pre-covid levels on volume in foodservice. and we expect to get back to pre-covid levels sometime during the year fiscal year.
christopher paul mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
fiscal year throughout the remainder of this year. okay. great. and then just last question m&a. it sounded like the last time we talked on the last quarter you're maybe looking into some m&a but just didn't make sense. can you maybe just update us on the m&a market?
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure chris. it's a very competitive market out there. now we are actively looking for potential targets. we have an m&a committee that's actively looking and analyzing any potential targets. so again it's hard to predict when those may materialize but we are looking pretty consistently.
christopher paul mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. well, thanks again for taking my questions. good luck in q2, and i'll jump back in the queue.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks chris.

operator
good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to the john b. sanfilippo & son inc. first quarter fiscal 2022 operating results conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today cfo frank pellegrino. please go ahead sir.
frank s. pellegrino -- chief financial officer executive vice president of finance and treasurer
thank you charlotte. good morning everyone and welcome to our fiscal 2022 first quarter earnings conference call. thank you for joining us today. on the call with me today is jeffrey sanfilippo our ceo; jasper sanfilippo our coo; and mike valentine our group president. before we start i would like to remind everyone that we may make some forward-looking statements today. these statements are based on our current expectations and they involve certain risks and uncertainties. the factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various sec filings that we have made including forms 10-k and 10-q.
we encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about these risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business. starting with the income statement. net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 7.6% to $226.3 million compared to net sales of $210.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. the increase in net sales was mainly attributable to a 14% increase in sales volume which is defined as pounds sold to customers. increased sales volume was partially offset by a 5.6% decrease in the weighted average selling price per pound which was caused by a decline in commodity prices for all major tree nuts except cashews. sales volume increased in the consumer distribution channel by 13%. due to a 20.4% increase in private brand sales volume for trail and snack mixes. the increase in sales volume for these private brand products came from new distribution at existing customers.
the increase in private brand sales volume was partially offset by sales volume decline in our branded products. sales volume in the consumer distribution channel accounted for 75.1% of total sales volume in the first quarter. sales volume increased in the commercial ingredients channel by 37.2% due to a 47.8% increase in sales volume to our food service customers. the increase in foodservice sales volume was attributable to improved conditions in the restaurant industry from the covid-19 restrictions. sales volume declined in the contract packaging distribution channel by 3.9% primarily due to promotional activity by a customer in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 that did not repeat in the current first quarter.
looking at sales volume for our brands and our consumer channel fisher recipe nuts decreased 9.7% primarily as a result of merchandising timing shifts lost distribution at a customer and lapping of increased at-home cooking and baking nut consumption compared to last year's first quarter due to covid-19. the 6.3% decrease in sales volume for orchard valley harvest was primarily due to a temporary distribution loss at a customer in the club channel. this was partially offset by a 29.1% increase at a major customer in the non-food sector as this retailer continues to recover from covid-19 restrictions.
fisher snack nuts sales volume excluding the impact of our discontinued inshell product line which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 7% due to new distribution and increased merchandise in existing customers. including the impact of the discontinued product line fisher snack nut volume decreased by 30.3%. sales volume for southern style nuts decreased 1% due to reduced merchandising and promotional activity. gross profit increased by 31.7% and to $51.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $39.3 million in last year's first quarter. gross profit margin increased to 22.9% of net sales in the current quarter of fiscal 2022 from 18.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. the increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was attributable primarily to lower commodity acquisition costs for all major tree nuts except cashews and increased sales volume.
total operating expenses for the current first quarter increased to 10.8% of net sales from 9.7% from last year's first quarter. total operating expenses for the current first quarter increased $4 million in the quarterly comparison. this increase included a gain of approximately $2.3 million from the sale of our garysburg north carolina facility. the increase in total operating expenses was due to increased in freight expense an increase in consumer insight research and related consulting increased advertising and increased compensation expenses. the increase in freight accounted for 60% of total increase in operating expense.
deferred expense increase resulted mainly from higher freight rates and increase in sales volume made on a delivered basis. interest expense for the current first quarter decreased to $371000 from $450000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to lower average debt levels. as a result of what we previously mentioned net income was $19.2 million or $1.66 per share diluted for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $12.8 million or $1.11 per share diluted for the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
now taking a look at inventory. the total value of inventories on hand at the end of the current first quarter increased $2.2 million or 1.5% compared to total inventory value at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021. the increase in value of total inventories were primarily due to higher quantities of almonds ingredients and packaging. this was partially offset by lower quantities of farmer stock peanuts pecans and cashews on hand. the weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dry fruit input stocks on hand at the end of the quarter increased 11.1% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
this increase in weighted average cost is attributed to the quantity of lower-priced peanuts decreasing much more significantly than the decrease in total quantity of higher-priced tree nut and dried fruit input stocks in the quarterly comparison. the decrease in the quantity of peanuts on hand was due to the closure of our garysburg facility.
i will now turn the call over to jeffrey sanfilippo our ceo to provide additional comments on our operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
jeffrey t. sanfilippo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you frank. good morning everyone. a great start to the current first quarter of fiscal 2022. we reported record net income and diluted earnings per share for the fourth consecutive quarter. the record results were driven by strong double-digit volume growth in our consumer distribution channel the continued recovery of our foodservice business in our commercial ingredients channel and lower commodity acquisition costs for most major tree nuts. the strong sales volume growth in our consumer distribution channel was mainly attributable to the efforts of our entire team to maintain superior service and quality levels as we navigated through the numerous global supply chain challenges that existed during this quarter.
the consumer channel accounted for approximately 79.4% of total sales dollars in the current first quarter. our relentless commitment to providing best-in-class service quality and value to our customers and consumers is a significant factor in our company's success. it takes a talented group of dedicated individuals across an entire organization to deliver consistent strong results as we have done here at jbss especially during these unprecedented times with the pandemic and the impact it has had on economic and social behavior. i am proud of every person in our company whose leadership and commitment to our customers and consumers is unwavering especially our manufacturing shipping and procurement teams. as we enter the harvest season we anticipate higher acquisition costs for many of our raw nut and dried fruit input stock. notably in respect to cashews almonds and walnuts where we expect to see significant increases in acquisition costs as a return to average historical market prices. in addition we are experiencing cost increases in freight and labor and we expect that trend to continue.
we have begun implementing pricing actions across our entire business to help mitigate these increasing costs. our team is also working diligently to identify and implement cost savings initiatives to offset some of these rising expenses. this current unprecedented inflationary environment and global supply chain constraints are presenting numerous challenges. but i'm confident our management team and dedicated employees will respond to these challenges and deliver exceptional performance for our customers and consumers.
in the current first quarter we continued to invest in our people production capabilities and brands to lay the foundation for future growth. i mentioned in our last call the increased investments the company is making in consumer insights. this is important to help fuel our growth and embed insights across the organization. we're investing in people and capabilities to unlock insights that address changing consumer needs and behaviors that will drive growth by enabling our marketing efforts to win the hearts and minds of new and existing consumers.
we have witnessed extraordinary shifts in consumption in these past 19 months and the investments we are making will establish a stronger foundation to identify opportunities faster develop more relevant innovative products build stronger brands and expand consumption particularly with gen z and millennial generations. in addition we continue to redirect our promotional and advertising activity with respect to our brands to focus on more digital and e-commerce platforms to match consumer behavior and we believe there are additional opportunities to connect these brands to consumers' desires for more functional snacking baking and cooking products.
turning to channel distribution updates. net sales in the consumer channel increased $13 million or 7.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '22. the increase was driven by increased sales of private brand trail and snack mixes which was partially offset by a decline in branded product sales during the current quarter. frank mentioned that the company discontinued its inshell peanut product line which will negatively impact our sales volume for fisher snacks. however the sales and marketing teams have done a great job building new distribution with our fisher oven roast product portfolio to offset some of this volume decline.
a similar story goes with our fisher recipe sales. while we have faced challenges from private brand and branded competition our sales and marketing teams have made progress building new distribution and we are planning for a strong holiday season in november and december. net sales in the commercial ingredient channel increased 23.4% in dollars for the first quarter of fiscal '22. the foodservice and industrial teams have done an extraordinary job throughout the past 19 months positioning jbss for a strong recovery once restaurants started opening and expanding capacity and people started traveling and going out again.
we are in a strong position now for the growth in this channel as a result of their efforts. net dollar sales in the contract packaging distribution channel decreased 11.1% in dollars. the decline in sales volume was primarily attributed to lower promotional activity as frank mentioned at a key customer. we anticipated stronger performance in this channel but have not seen an increase in convenience store volume yet which makes up a significant portion of a major customer sales in this channel. turning to category updates. i'll share some of the brand results and category results for the quarter.
as always all the market information i'll be referring to is iri reported data and for today it is for the period ending september 19 2021. when i refer to q1 i'm referring to 13 weeks of the quarter ending september 19 2021. references to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period one year ago. we look at the category on iri's total u.s. definition which includes food drug mass walmart military and other outlets unless otherwise specified. and when we speak of pricing we are referring to the average price per pound. breakouts of the recipe snack and produce categories are based on our custom definitions developed in conjunction with iri. the term velocity refers to the sales per point of distribution.
the total nut category was up 1% in both sales dollars and pound volume in q1. this is consistent with the growth rate we saw last year. we saw strong growth in the produce and trail mix categories offsetting declines in the recipe and snack nut categories. overall prices across the category were flat in q1 versus the price prior year with some nuts increasing while others declined. now i will cover each category in more depth starting with recipe nuts. the recipe nut category declined 11% in dollars and 7% in pound sales. this is a slight improvement versus the decline that we saw in q4 of 2021. the declines were consistent across all major recipe nut types.
the category had seen significant growth throughout the pandemic driven by more consumers cooking and baking at home. the latest data suggests that while some consumers have reduced at-home consumption levels are still above 2019. our fisher brand continues to be challenged by declining distribution with two key retailers in q1. our fisher recipe nuts decreased 70% in dollars and 13% in pounds for the first quarter versus last year. we did see we did see gains in velocity across food and mass channels but this was not enough to offset distribution declines. as a result fisher dollar sales decreased one point versus last year.
this fisher continues to be the branded share leader in the recipe category when using the broader multi-outlet definition or within the u.s. food channel. we are actively working to return fisher recipe to growth and have invested in consumer research innovation and marketing which you will see hit in the market this holiday season. now let's turn to the snack category. in q1 the snack category declined 2% in dollars and 1% in pound sales. this is consistent with the decline that we saw in q4 of last year. the snack category has held out to most category gains that it experienced during the pandemic.
we are seeing switching among nut types with declines in almonds and peanuts being mostly offset with growth in cashews and pistachios. fisher snack continued to grow dollar share in q1 and was up 7% in dollar sales driven by strong distribution and velocity growth. and as i mentioned we are seeing strong results in the oven roasted never fried line across our large sizes as consumers continue to look for better-for-you snacks at a better value. and we are focused on continuing to build distribution and drive velocities against this line. the trail and snack mix category grew dollar sales and pounds in q1 7% and 6% respectively.
this segment continues to grow as it laps out of modest performance during the pandemic. our southern style nuts brands declined 2% in dollars and was flat on pounds due to slower velocities versus last year in mass and club. in grocery southern style nuts grew 69% behind increases in distribution and velocity. our latest category our last category produce nuts increased 8% in dollar sales and 5% in pound volume. this was primarily driven by pistachios which were up 43% almost $30 million versus last year. our produce nut brand orchard valley harvest was down 11% in dollar sales and 6% in pound sales driven by lost distribution and aggressive competitive action.
we are actively working on plans to turn this brand around inclusive of new product pac and communication news coming toward the end of the fiscal year. in closing success requires smart strategies and the right business model for sustainable growth. it also requires a talented and committed team of associates. we have all those elements of success here and the record results over the past four quarters demonstrate the success of our business. no doubt we will face strong headwinds in the coming quarters with commodity labor and freight cost increases and supply chain challenges.
and there is still some uncertainty regarding covid-19 and future local state and federal restrictions aim to mitigate and control the pandemic. in spite of these challenges i'm confident we have the people the processes the brands the expertise and the financial strength in place to be flexible and successfully navigate our company through these volatile times and to continue to grow our business. our teams are working on exciting new products that will be launched in the back half of fiscal '22 and we are building a robust pipeline of innovation for fiscal '23 and beyond. jbss will continue to maintain a competitive advantage to be differentiated and to be an innovative and valuable partner to our customers and consumers.
