thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo. your line is open.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, thanks, good morning. my first question is on the mortgage segment. so i heard you guys say that kind of still difficulty difficult to put your hands around what the total loss could be within mi. but you did say that you expect no underwriting income for the next three quarters. so if i look at what you guys might have been expecting, it seems like and look at what you've generated right in the back few quarters of 2019, and that translates maybe into about an $800 million of vicinity loss. now the reason why i go there is your rds that you guys disclosed at the end of last year for that business was around 8% of your tangible equity. so the numbers seem within the same ballpark of each other. so am i triangulating correct, that you're assuming that this loss could be equivalent to your rds? or am i missing something in putting those thoughts together?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think thanks, elyse, for the question. i think that the two numbers appear to be the same level, but they're actually coming from a different source. the $800 million that you referred to that could be, let's say, it's a great number for the next three quarters, will be incurred losses. and against that, you have to put premium. and if you look at our rds scenario, we actually look at the rollout of all the claims paid in the future and we offset it by all the premiums that we would receive, and this is what constitutes the pml. so they're very different. one is a net p&l impact. the other one is the incurred loss of the $800 million you mentioned, the first time around.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
so the $800 million is the losses that you expect over the balance of the next three quarters, not the i thought you had said it wouldn't generate any underwriting income?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i mean, just to clarify, i think, it's really a difference between the next nine months versus the full runoff of the in-force portfolio. as we think of the remainder of 2020, what the comment i made was really underwriting income, meaning premiums minus losses, minus expenses. and we're saying we don't expect a whole lot of underwriting income for the remainder of 2020. when we think about the rds, fundamentally, to get to a similar, let's say, an $800 million number that you quote of rds. what that would mean was really would be a much larger incurred loss because we expect to have material premium flows or premium income coming to us in future calendar years, which may be five, seven, 10 years. so it's just the rds is really a full comprehensive premium and gain/loss underwriting income across the full runoff of the in-force portfolio.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then within the rds, can you remind us what are the assumptions for delinquency rates as well as like housing price depreciation and how we think about you guys coming to that 8% loss figure?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. there are many assumptions, but at a high level, decrease in-house price, 25% below fundamental, so 25% from now going down and staying there for two to three years. interest rates shooting up 7% or 8%, that these are major the two major ones that unemployment, of course, lasting longer. the length of time that our rds is stressing our portfolio, when we go through it, is a much longer period than even the 2007 crisis would have generated. to the delinquency equivalent, it's something more like 9% ultimate claims rate. it's hard for me to parse out what is delinquency versus conversion to claims. so at a high level, we prefer to think in terms of claims rate. so the portfolio, as it stands right now, if you run it off and 9% of it were to default, that will be equivalent to the rds net that we have, which is significantly above what we expect right now, just to just for your benefit, which is significantly above what we expect to happen for the next 12 months.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
and then one last one on the guide for the lack of underwriting income for the year-end mortgage. does and you do you guys are you guys assuming that you're going to have to use some of your ils, the bellemeade securities? or at this point, you do not think you might attach into any of those covers?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, two things that just for i think good points of clarification for you guys. first of all, the bellemeade protections, as you probably do know, amortize over time. but there's a trigger on them that, basically, once you exceed a certain level of delinquencies, they stop amortizing. and that we think we expect will happen most likely sometime in 2020 and maybe in the second quarter, maybe in the third quarter, maybe later. and that will basically freeze, at least for some period, the amount of covereds that is available to us and would remain most likely for the duration of each of those structures. but to answer, i think, more directly to your question, we do not expect under most scenarios that we would trigger the coverage of the provided by the bellemeade protection. so the $3 billion of excess of loss cover that we talk about we know is available, we know it's there. but at this time, under most scenarios, we don't expect to pierce the attachment that we would where we would actually fully well, we'd start to receive coverage or cede some of our exposures.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, thank you. thank you for the color.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan. your line is open.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. so just first a question on the mi business. your assumption of no underwriting income for the rest of the year, does that reflect primarily you having to reserve at the level that reflects sort of delinquencies given gaap rules? or does it also and not and you from your comments, it seems like you think ultimate defaults will be lower than that, given that people are taking advantage of forbearance and stuff and then the cure rates will be higher. but it's more because of just you having to reserve at a higher at the level that reflects delinquencies? or is it also a reflection of your views on ultimate defaults?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i it's certainly more of the former. so, right, we do expect the reality, given the forbearance programs that have been in place, we expect a higher-than-normal flow of delinquencies to be reported to us. some people are just taking advantage of the programs, just to be safe, and they'd rather just play safe and not take the risk of falling behind on their mortgage payments. so what we expect will happen, we haven't seen much of it yet, but we do expect i mean, that will pick up in q2 and q3 is that we will have to we will receive these delinquencies. when we come to the end of q2, we'll have to assess what kind of reserves we'll set on those delinquencies. we'll make determinations on the probability that those will actually cure based on the information we'll have in front of us at that time. it's too early today to tell you what that will look like. but certainly, based on the fact that we expect just an elevated number of delinquencies to be reported to us, that will just, by nature, trigger us. we will reserve for those delinquencies, and we'll incur some losses. whether those will translate into claims paid, ultimately, we don't know. time will tell, but that's really just how we think that the accounting will work, at least in the year i mean, the certainly, for the next few quarters.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and then on business interruption, you mentioned provisions in most of your contracts that actually exclude losses because of pandemics or viruses. i'm assuming you're talking about primary contracts. on the reinsurance side, should we assume that if your clients are paying either because there wasn't a provision or because they lose a case and then and a lawsuit, then you would have to be on the hook to the extent you provided coverage as well?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think yes, the comment had to do with insurance, which, as you can appreciate, the vast majority, or more than the vast majority of what we do has an exclusion for viral it is a virus exclusion. on the reinsurance, it's still early, right? we still have to figure out what the bi losses are going to be if they come to fruition for our clients. and then they'll have to go through and say whether there's protection on the risk or quota share, or for that matter, excess of loss on a cat basis. so this is going to play out over the next several quarters. a lot of contracts have hours clause for those kinds of events. there'll be a lot of discussions back and forth as to when do we start counting, how do we count them. so there's a lot more uncertainty and some other folks in the industry, i've echoed the same comments that it's going to be a little bit longer to figure out what it means. because in general, the contracts are not written to cater for those kinds of event. there's not a specific virus protection. it's really meant primarily to be a property coverage, by and large, from i'm talking from cat-excessive loss perspective. so people will have to sift through the language and see what it means to each and every one of them.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly, on the acceleration of growth in your insurance and reinsurance premiums, how much of this is pricing versus you potentially gaining share or just increased demand for some of the lines that you're in?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. at a high level, about 15%, 1-5, of the increase in premium came through acquisition. barbican is definitely one of them. we also had acquired a team on credit and surety from aspen toward the second half of last year. that's about 1-5, 15%. 25% is due to rate. the rate increase this quarter across our p&c was between 5% and 10%. so it's actually better than the fourth quarter of 2019. and the rest, 60%, is truly growth in exposure, new business one-offs or unique situations or opportunities, one of which francois mentioned in his comments.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mike zaremski with credit suisse. your line is open.
mike zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. sticking, moving back to mi. can we talk about capital requirements? capital charges for loans and nonpayment are usually materially higher than for performing loans. i know i saw it in the prepared remarks, you said that the pmiers efficiency ratio is well in excess of 100%.is the fema designation kicked in? it means that it will allow arch and other mis to potentially hold less capital? or just kind of how should we as investors think about the capital requirements and how that could play out over the next three to 12 months as nonperforming loan levels or deferred loan levels increase?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i mean, to answer your question, the answer is, yes, the it's actually in the wording in pmiers that when there's a fema-designated zone, the capital requirements of for delinquencies are reduced by 70%.so and given that all 50 states have actually declared have been declared a fema disaster zone. currently, we are adjusting at the end starting at the end of march and going forward, we're adjusting the pmiers capital requirements to reflect that haircut, i'd say, on the capital charges for delinquent loans. there's a bit of a discussion going on with fhfa around how long that will be available. i think the industry and fhfa are working together on that and the gses to come up to clarify everything. i think there's a bit of some technicalities and maybe it wasn't, i'd say, perfectly considered or awarded in the wording of the pmiers, but still, we think that they'll we expect that the, call it, the haircut on the capital charges will remain in place until we're we have a bit more visibility on how some of those loans will cure and go back to performing.
mike zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
and just the final part, francois, that you mentioned in terms of the clarification on how long, does that play into why arch has decided to most likely not repurchase stock for the remaining of the year? i guess maybe this is a broader question. i it feels like prior to covid, you guys were playing kind of more, i'd call it, offense than most carriers. does covid change the playbook? i know this is a broader question. and is the lack of mi earnings and maybe some of the clarification of capital kind of why you're not purchasing stock when it's trading below book value?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. well, i'd flip it a little bit on you. i'd like to think we played a fair amount of offense in q1 on the p&c side. so i think our view is that we again, we said it before, we like optionality. and the fact that we have a strong balance sheet, we want to keep it that way. we want to be able to take advantage of opportunities that may surface. so does covid change the playbook? not per se, but we think there will be probably a fair amount of disruption that's going to emerge in through the end of 2020 and maybe beyond. so that's really that's the arch playbook, and marc can chime in, but that's really how we think about having the opportunity or the ability to execute on those opportunities.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. clearly, we had played the mi market. we still are in the market, very involved. we were, by and large, a lot more allocation of capital to the mi always with the lookout, as you guys know us, but it's something were to develop and get better on the other side and more the very important piece of what we do every day, the p&c that we would shift and allocate more capital there. and i think as we look through the first quarter and the perspectives, we have business reviews with everyone and understanding and hearing even after covid-19. even though there might be a little bit of a dip in premium in the second and third quarter, it's clear that opportunities are there. and our first mission, as francois mentioned, is to deploy capital. this is what i believe our shareholders want us to do, is to deploy capital toward insurance underwriting. and i think we have an increased level of opportunities that wasn't there six months or nine months ago. so capital. and as i said, capital becomes very important as we go through the next year or so. so we'll be able to deploy it and make, hopefully, great returns for our shareholders.
mike zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
so i guess, marc, what you would then we should continue to expect the non-mi operations to continue playing offense and growing at a fairly fast pace?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
well, right now, based on what we see in terms and conditions and opportunities, the answer is yes, we should expect that to happen. absent, as i said, the market getting a bit softer in terms of gdp because of exposure stagnating for a while. but, yes, by and large, our focus is to play more offense on the p&c side, both insurance and reinsurance.
mike zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from yaron kinar with goldman sachs. your line is open. sir, your line is open, please check in mute button so the answer your question.
our next question from ron bobman with capital returns. your line is open.
ron bobman -- capital returns -- analyst
nice to hear a voice. and i hope everyone's well, of course. i had a couple of questions. the mortgage business and the reinsurance purchases, and in particular, the bellemeade notes. i'm wondering prospectively, do you think that the capacity will be there to sort of continue to be put in place? and is the game plan to sort of continue to, as best you can, buy sort of like-sized and like-structured protections for the mortgage book, and in effect, put that through into primary pricing on the mortgage book?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
so the first question is i don't know when it's going to come back. we expect this to come back. i think there was a healthy market, a healthy level of interest before covid-19. so we would expect that to come back when things gone back to some more normalcy of sort. but time is ahead of us. we don't know when that's going to happen. and if it were to come back, i guess the question will be an economic decision, right? if it does fit within our return and risk profile, we would continue doing those transactions the way we did. we might do more, we might do a bit less. so it will be depending on our view of the pricing and what kind of recovery we get from this. i do believe as a general rule that our risk management mantra is still important. we like to have some downside protection. and i think this proves very useful in these events of late that they would come in and play a big part in supporting us if things were to go a little bit worse than we would expect them to do so. so i would argue that there's definitely a price at which things or conditions at which things are a bit difficult to do, but i would expect us to still do them within reason for this reason i just mentioned.
ron bobman -- capital returns -- analyst
i have a cat reinsurance sort of market question. are there going to be a lot of instances in the context of covid and losses and ceded losses, are there going to be a lot of instances where primaries have cat towers and cat protections that are peril-defined as being sort of natural catastrophes or is this a narrow peril listings in the reinsurance treaties that because the pandemic isn't, i guess, deemed or classified as a natural cat, there would not be stated coverage in a reinsurance treaty?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean just sorting the case. what i would add to this, though, ron, is you have followed the fortunes in many contracts on a quota share and risk excess. so and on natural perils, i don't think it's a majority of the covers the coverage that are purchased right now. i think it's a little bit different. i think the it's also different in the u.s. versus international. but i think that we'll expect a lot of discussions because i'm not sure it's as natural peril specific as you think it could be. it was a softer reinsurance market for a while. so when that happens, conditions tend to be a bit broader than one would expect.
ron bobman -- capital returns -- analyst
okay, thanks a lot. good luck, gentlemen.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from yaron kinar with goldman sachs. your line is open.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thank you. hopefully you can hear me now.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes we can.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. first question on mi. have you been able to book the u.s. mi using a consistent methodology that was used by the rest of the mi book? what would the loss ratio look like this quarter?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, i mean, roughly speaking, if we i mean, if we extrapolate for the year for the we're saying the remainder of the year is going to be, call it, 100 combined ratio just to be on the safe. so if you annualize the minus 25% expense ratio, ballpark, it gets you a 75% loss ratio plus or minus.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. and maybe that also answers my next question, which was would the gaap accounting basically make the results in the mi business progressively worse quarter-over-quarter? or do you expect it to be kind of flattish in the breakeven range through the rest of the year?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
very hard to know. i mean we i mean, it depends on how quickly the delinquencies are going to show up. if all the delinquencies show up in q2 when they start, right you could see a scenario where people missed their first mortgage payment on april 1. they missed their second payment on may 1. and along the way, they kind of told their servicer that they want to take advantage of the forbearance program, we could expect a significant amount of delinquencies to show up in q2, not as much as q3. it might be a flip-flop. people might try to keep making payments and call their servicer in july. i don't know. so it's very much a function of how quickly we think the delinquencies are going to show up that will dictate a bit more the volatility from quarter-to-quarter in 2020 on how the, call it, the calendar quarter loss ratios are going to look like.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. okay. and if i turn to insurance, can you maybe talk about the programs business, how you'd expect that to perform both from top line and margin perspective in the face of covid?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
well, yes, that's a good question. it's not really workers comp exposed. so that piece we can take off. it doesn't really have maturity of credit lines. the lines that we could think it's it would be exposed to is property. and almost the totality of all the policies exclude have a viral virus exclusion. so that should not be a significant contributor to the loss experience on the programs business.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
welcome.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from phil stefano with deutsche bank. your line is open.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. i was hoping you could give some commentary on your thoughts around the flow of new business for mi this year. how does this feel like purchase originations versus refi originations are going to shake out? and maybe within that, you can embed a commentary around what you see with pricing. i guess in my mind, the risk-based pricing and rates are would react in real time to the extent that there were changes in the economic environment. and this might be one of those instances where you could actually flex pricing up. does it feel like we're starting to see that come through as the flow of business yes?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
three questions in there. that's pretty cool. i'm trying to keep it up, so you tell me if i'm wrong on this one. the number one had to do with the origination going forward, right? so the what we can tell you with the industry, we don't know but the industry consensus seems to be 20% less production this year. what that means for us and the market, i mean, we sort of follow along. we have about 1/3 if you look at the mba, 35% penetration of more of mortgage insurance, 45% private mi, so you can follow through. so about 18% to 20% decrease. so if all else being equal, we should expect lesser production from that perspective. and you're right, i think we are still continuing we're continuing to see a lot of refinancing, although there's a glut and there's a lot of movement and a lot of things that are blocked actually at the origination of the mortgage originators because there's so much demand for that due to the historically very low mortgage rates. but we do actually see some purchasing happening. but i think it's going to be probably more along the lines of the last rolling rate over the last three quarters, i think, is what we should expect.
so again, it's hard to tell if the purchase market is going to come back in wild fashion. but certainly, there is a lot of pent-up demand out there, which also helps the house price index. we believe the house prices are going to go down not as much as you might think, maybe in a single-digit percentage over this year because of all the pent-up demand, so which talks to the purchasing market being still there, not gone altogether. i think the article this morning in wall street journal that there's a lot of there's a good pricing sustained as a result of higher demand for housing. that's the second part. the third part, which was about the pricing. of course, right, we look at i mean, the things have changed. we look at things in a different light with the risk different risk characteristics. we went through more than once through our portfolio on our risk-based pricing and our various assumptions and parameters. and we're making adjustments as we see it appropriate across the industry. i do want to think that the mi industry sees it as a, hey, there's a bit more risk, there's a bit more losses. so maybe we should do something about it. and i do expect them to follow suit in general. we do have indication that people are have increased their expected loss in their pricing.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
when we think about the expected returns that you're seeing in mi, have they changed materially? and maybe insurance is a better place or a better lever to be exercising at this point to put capital to use. can you just any thoughts around that?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
no. it's very, very well put. i think this is exactly i mean, i think two years ago, i would have said to you that, except for a few spots on the on p&c insurance and reinsurance, that the mi provided by far superior return. so when we rank order things, francois and i go through it and our executive team go through it, we rank order the three business, the investment in repurchasing shares, mi was up there and it has been there for quite a while. and i think it's our loss expectation is probably not as low. it's probably modified somewhat. so depending on the pricing going forward, we'll see how that falls out. but clearly, the returns from the pmc unit has been inflating and then putting them higher in the positioning the relative positioning for capital allocation without a doubt.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. thank you.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question is from meyer shields with kbw. your line is open sir.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
great, thanks. i do feel like i'm beating a dead horse here, but does your first quarter covid reserve in p&c, does that assume that fda policy requires direct physical damage but doesn't have a virus occlusion? does that assume that that's an absolute defense?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, i'll start, and i'm sure marc will chime in. as you know, it's again, we said it's very early, but where we have taken some books and reserves on particularly, i mean, on property, right, is there are certainly a very small subset of our policies that don't have an exclusion. so for those, we felt it's prudent to we expect losses to come through, and we booked the id&r to go against those policies. and those are generally outside of the u.s. i mean, they are outside of the u.s. so it's in the u.k., it's in canada on the insurance side. and we also have a small amount in some property fact deals that may specifically cover pandemic, and we expect that some of these some of the certificates will have to respond. so it's a bit mostly in insurance, a little bit in reinsurance, but that's where we that's kind of how we thought about booking the reserves on bi. yes, i mean, in the u.s., no question that you need property damage to have the bi respond. that's a fact. yes. there's proposals out there that people want to make it retroactive and challenge that. we'll see how far how that goes. but for the time being, we don't have reserves on those. we don't think it's correct. we want to think it's right. so we we've relied on the policy wording to make our assessments of reserves on those policies.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
and the other piece i would add to this, francois, is that there are other lines of business, meyer, we have these three data that we can point to and say this is what we think we would expect this to develop to. and one example is trade credit. we have a small portfolio, but we did actually do proactively reflect the fact that we might we're expecting an increased level of claims for the based on what we write this year. so that's something that we pick our loss ratio specifically. so most of them, on the property side, i agree absolutely what francois said, we did more granularly at a level, the claims level, the portfolio level. and i think we've taken a loss ratio approach to the other lines of business where we've seen historically losses emerge as a result of events such as this one.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. the second related question, i'm just trying get my arms around what sort of events would constitute second quarter covid-related p&c losses.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
i think the development of bi losses will firstly, we have to go through the insurance business, the insurance companies, telling their losses, evaluating every claim. i mean, this is not an easy thing to do from a 30,000 feet position. meyer, you have to go through the claims process, evaluate things, talk to clients, brokers and whatnot. so it's going to take a while before things get sorted out. a couple of things on presumption of workers comp coverage, that's also part of that. i think it was lot of things developing. so i'm not even sure second quarter we're going to have the ultimate picture. that's for sure. it's going to take a bit longer to go through all these losses, how they accumulate and also in line with the question i just had earlier in how it if it does, and how and if it does accumulate toward a reinsurance recovery. so that also might happen toward the end of this year. so this is going to take a little while to sort out. and that's not even talking about potential litigation and whatever else could happen out there. so it's going to be a while.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
this is going to be a slow developing cat loss.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
very well and thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brian meredith with ubs. your line is open.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
yes, thanks. so one or two quick questions here. first, marc, can you tell us what is the status of the coface investment? and if indeed, the transaction goes through, should we anticipate some type of impairment charge on close given where coface stock is relative to your agreed investment?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
so everything is a lot too early at this point in time, right? they themselves are going through evaluating and looking at this and our as you know, we made that investment with a long-term strategic vision. we also know that they are they have been proactive in many things. and we also know that the credit that the credit quality of what they had underwritten through the end of last year was is also different as well than what it was in 2008. so we're trying to triangulate all these things. we still have a lot of process to go through from a regulatory perspective. we expect to receive this toward the end of the year. so that's all i'm going to say about coface is we are sort of monitoring, staying close to it and see what we're going to do about it, if we do anything about it.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. and then my second one, just going back to the mi. if i think about the lawsuits you guys are seeing potentially for the rest of this year that you're going to have. what does that mean for 2021 as far as the mi results? how far are we into the deductible on the bellemeade transactions? how much additional could there potentially be in 2021?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, again, it's very premature. i think the answer to that question, again, will very much depend on the level of delinquencies and how quickly they get come to us. and now we see the economy going back, opening up a little bit. so the people will go back to work. and by fourth quarter of 2020, we see already some people carrying going back to having current loans, etc. but yes, i would think that a reasonable expectation for 2021 is that, yes, we should do better than 2020. the loss ratio should be coming down. i don't think to the level it was in 2019, but as because let's we would think that no question that some people will there'll be some jobs lost and there may be some actual claims that actually convert to actually or delinquencies that convert to real claims and pay claims that may be late in 2021, as you know, with a 12-month forbearance program and then the time to really go through all the process to go to to paying the claim will take quite some time. so i would at a high level, i would think that the 2021 loss ratio would be better or lower than 2020, but not at the same level as low as it has been in as it was in 2019 for sure.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. that makes sense. and so i think what i'm trying to do is just scale this, like how much additional loss could we potentially have here in the mi book before you hit the bellemeade deductibles, right? just what's kind of a worst-case there?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, let me try this, and maybe marc will chime in. we've looked at a bunch of a variety of economic scenarios. some are based on our own internal analysis, like the rds stress test that we run through our portfolio. some are based on external economic scenarios such as the moody's what's published by moody's, the severe, the s3 and s4 economic scenario. and under most scenarios, again, we don't expect to we get close, but we don't expect to attach with the bellemeade transactions. and those are, in particular, like the s4 where we get very close. we might start attaching a few years down the road, but it's those are severe stresses. so how we think about it is, does it even impact 2021? the answer is probably not. it probably starts to really we really start to recover a few years down the road. and i mean to us, it's a i don't want to say necessarily sleep-at-night insurance or coverage, but it's really there to say we think we've run some very severe stresses. they don't seem to attach with the bellemeade, but we're often they get to be worse a little bit worse than what we're thinking, what the scenarios could look like. we tell ourselves, well, we got $3 billion of coverage that is available to us if things get much worse.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
at a very high level, brian, if you think of the bellemeade retention, and we talk about this among ourselves, is that we have about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion of retention. so that sort of gives you a sense for how many how much losses we would need to go through to start to get some recovery. so that i think that should give you $1 billion a year premium earned. so that gives you some kind of benchmark. i think we're trying to figure a way we'll talk to don, obviously, and francois. we'll try to find a way to make it a bit more clear to everyone because it's not an easy thing to explain. but i think at a high level, what we just said to you is true, that the level of retention is high enough that we don't expect it in the next couple of years.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great, thank you.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mark dwelle with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
mark dwelle -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes, good morning. just to continue with the mi discussion. as you're contemplating within the guidance of no earnings for the balance of the year, are you assuming a case average per reserve similar to what you've been reserving at or something more similar to the like after hurricanes or something of that nature?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
we're just assuming we apply a forbearance rate and then we apply conversion from forbearance to claims that we would do. and the severity is pretty close to 100% on most of those cases. so it's really more binary than you might think it is. so there's not much i mean, the two big variables are really the forbearance and our view of the conversion from forbearance to claim, ultimately, which is very uncertain at that point in time.
mark dwelle -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
within that, then, are these being evaluated on literally a case-by-case basis? or is it the or are you applying just sort of a formula to all of the losses that whatever some particular bank presents you over some period of time?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, i think it's a bit early to know exactly how everything is going to play out. i mean, no question that as i said earlier, we're we expect more delinquencies to come through. no question that we would expect a higher cure rate on those than we would see from a typical delinquency in a, call it, normal economic environment. so but we don't know yet how we're going to book our reserves at the end of the second quarter, and let alone, third and fourth quarter. so the answer is, yes, probably, i mean, if you compare a regular delinquency to what we're we expect, the delinquencies we get through forbearance programs, there's no question that there's a higher cure rate. and then associated with that, the severity, etc. so i mean, it's the product of those gives you the total incurred loss in the quarter. but it's i think we will look at them a bit differently for sure than we would otherwise in a, call it, a regular quarter.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
but mark, just to make sure it's clear to you because you did ask specifically how do we develop our scenario. and we have we do go at the individual loan level with the risk characteristics and applying assumptions and shock on the unemployment and whatever else you have around, house price index. and we go through the lifetime of that loan and see what's going to result. you can think of it as the ladders series series of ladders going forward, decision tree of sort. and then at the end, we come up with the ultimate projection of the claims based on the assumption that we had. so that was a bottom-up approach we did. and we verified this, at least try to get some perspective from a top-down approach, which francois mentioned, the moody's s3 and s4. so and those seem to converge very nicely, and by coincidence, i would add to a similar number for ultimate claims.
mark dwelle -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and then just the last question, and again, this is another sort of process question. but i mean, suppose i'm an individual and i default beginning in april and may, as francois described before. and then i get recorded as a delinquency in forbearance, let's say, sometime in june. and i take advantage of the 6-month requirement. you'll put up some type of reserve for me in probably the second quarter. will you be able to release that reserve back then as quickly as, let's say, october, which would be the end of the six months, which would then provide offset against any additional adds that you would otherwise be taking in, say, the fourth quarter for people who are newly delinquent or further delinquent?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
correct. i mean, if the borrower cures, and i think there's a little bit of work that has to be done exactly on how borrowers are going to exit the program. i mean, initially, there's, i wouldn't say confusion, but people thought, well, they have to make a balloon payment, do i just defer my payments, etc. i think the government is stepping in to make sure that there is no i mean, the expectations are clear on both sides. but correct, if somebody after six months in october or november, december, they everybody's back. i mean, for that particular borrower, they're back to work, and they go back to current and they strike a they reach an agreement with their borrower to just effectively let's say, they missed four or five payments, and they agreed to just add those on at the end of their mortgage period, they would whatever reserves we had put up on that particular loan would get eliminated, reduced to 0, and they would be available if we think there's new coming in that we yes, so it's a reduction in current...
mark dwelle -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
just to clarify, second and third quarter, you would think of kind of as reserve accumulation and then beginning in perhaps the fourth quarter, you would start to see offsets develop, assuming people follow that type of a pattern.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
assuming yes, but again, what we don't know yet is everybody or is the vast majority of people are going to use the forbearance programs in q2 or are they going to try to make a couple of payments and then maybe there'll be more in q2 and q3 and q4. i mean, the timing of it is uncertain. but assuming i think which is what i mean, assuming i think what you were assuming is for somebody who starts on the forbearance program earlier, and then, let's say, it's just temporary where they do go back to work and they go back to current. they cure their delinquency in the fourth quarter, correct. i mean, there would be we would be see potentially see a reversal of the accumulation of reserves that we saw in q2 and q3.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so mark, i would add to this, to be cautious, to be very cautious when we compare the development of the gses versus now, again, having more of a front-loading of reported delinquencies that could from there to your point, go plus or minus, but a lot more front-loading of delinquencies recognized at the beginning than it was in 2007 and '08, where it took a while for the claim took like two, three years for real delinquencies to really pick up and peak. so it takes a while to get there. i don't think we're going to see that this time around. i think we should expect more of a front-loading, which means a little bit more activity from a loss perspective in the first in the next couple of quarters.
mark dwelle -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
understood. thank you.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from geoff dunn with dowling & partners. your line is open.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
thanks, good morning. first, a technical question on pmiers. are forbearance loans treated the same way from an aging standpoint, meaning, that you'll get that asset charge progression as well? or is it just that initial point in time asset charge? it seems there's kind of confusing interpretations out there on that front.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
sorry, geoff, i we couldn't quite hear. i mean, you're not coming through very loudly, so.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
what i was asking is are forbearance loans subject to the aging asset charges on the pmiers or are they just held at a point in time, that initial charge? it seems like some of the language out there has been confusing and up to interpretation.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes, true. i think that it's unchartered territories as well for the gses. i think there are a lot of discussions between the mis and the gses and the fhfa to try to figure out. so i don't have an answer to this one, geoff.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
okay. and then i'm still trying to piece together your underwriting outlook for the remainder of the year. it sounds clear that incidents assumptions will be below a normalized level because of the potential for cure activity. and it seems like the implication is that your forbearance expectation is a lot higher than the near 6% number we've seen from april 26. it's not maybe two or three times that, if i'm looking at the math right. so obviously, you have a cumulative loss expectation for the year, maybe not all the pieces that generated. but what are some of the higher level assumptions that get you to that kind of level of loss activity, whether it be unemployment, home right? what are some of your macro assumptions that support the cumulative loss outlook for the remainder of the year?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think yes, that's a good question. i think you were right on the forbearance comment. i don't think we don't think it's going to 5% or 6%. i think if you ask us, we're our modeling is pretty much like 15%. that's sort of what we would expect forbearance to peak at. and then the question remains to your point about the conversion, which is the one that is so hard, as you know, to pin down. but we can use something between one in seven to one in 10. there's no real reason to that other than it seems to be in the ballpark of what we would expect. if we look at the current annuities or the current delinquencies, as you know, geoff, the ultimate claims rate that we ascribed as an industry is closer to 7% or 8%. so to go to a 14% or 15% does not seem too crazy right now. the biggest one so we the sort of what we use, i think if you look at the s3, that's sort of where our assumption sort of would converge to, if you will. you all know that model. so this is pretty much where we are. i think the biggest thing that we'll have to debate for the next several quarters is how do we convert from forbearance to claim. that's going to be, as you know, the biggest question mark that we'll have to go through.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
i'm sorry. and are you suggesting the you said 14% or 15%, are you suggesting that the incident assumption will be higher than normal or lower than normal?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
i'm sorry, i can't hear you. can you repeat it, please, geoff?
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
are you suggesting that the incident assumption will be higher than normal or lower than normal? you're saying 14%...
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
higher, higher than normal. if normal is 7% of one in 14 right now, one in 13 on new delinquencies, i would expect it to be one in seven or one in six, one in eight. that's what sort of what the model implies. i'm not saying this is what's going to happen, but you're asking about the parameters of the deal, and this is what of the modeling.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
okay. well, all right. and then my last question has to do with your reinsurance strategy. obviously, the iln market is hot right now. does that create any interest with the company of looking at a traditional qsr to supplement your iln strategy longer term?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
we haven't really looked at it.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
i mean, we have i mean, everything is on the table, right? i mean, it's all based on the economics. no question that in the last couple of years, to us, the bellemeade transactions were very efficient, provide a lot of capital relief, and we thought it was a good protection to get for a variety of reasons. again, we expect them to come back, but assuming that they're not back for, let's say, the end of the until the end of the year or maybe beyond, no question that we will probably think of other ways to protect the portfolio. and a traditional reinsurance agreement is something that would be on the table for sure.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
geoff, i think you've asked about msrs as well. so i think we're starting to evaluate all these things. nothing is but everything, again, is on the table. we're looking at everything.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
goeff said qsr, right?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, is that correct, geoff? i mean, i heard qsr. did we answer your question, geoff? i just want to make sure we answered it correctly.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
you did. thank you. okay. good luck.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ryan tunis with autonomous research. your line is open.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
okay, thanks. so yes, i guess i'm trying to unpack that, the answer to the last question on the forbearance to claims rate being higher than if i heard that correctly, your modeling that gets to breakeven is assuming that that's actually higher than, say, a random notice that you have received in december.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. that's true.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
this is the model. you're stress testing it while you stress you're pushing for the scenarios because it's so uncertain. but who knows, right? it's an opinion.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
right. it's certainly not quite how i think most people are thinking about it. but yes, that does sound somewhat conservative. and i guess in terms of thinking about the rest of the year, like one thing i noticed that gave you eyes is you've got these three buckets, like i think it's like three or four months delinquent, and it's, i think, five to 11 months and 12 plus. is there expected pressure as these delinquencies age? like is there like do you kind of recondition what the expected loss might be? is that potentially a source of pressure later on in the year?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
well, it's not a high number of claims, so that's not a massive amount. we have about $250 million of reserves or something like this. and francois will correct me if i'm wrong on this one. but i do believe that there is a lot of them also are older, vintage, so have been in and out of delinquency. some of them are coming back in and out of cure. so we're if there is pressure going forward, typically, it will impact not only the more recent bookings. it will it would impact all prior book years that you have. and specifically, those are currently in delinquency because it does they may not be the ones that can avail themselves of the forbearance program. they may have been in default before that event occurred. and they might be in a worse position than most borrowers if they're currently they were delinquent at the end of 2019. so yes, it would tend to ascribe a higher possible incidents to those claims.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
understood. and then i guess the last one is kind of housekeeping. but on the premium yield number, first of all, how much was that helped this quarter by any of the single premium stuff? and then has the outlook for that changed at all, just given the, i guess, elevated refinancing activity? i'm not sure the composition of book changes.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
it felt about 10% to 15% of premium for the quarter because of the refinancing.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
thank you.

i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, mr. marc grandisson and mr. francois morin. sirs, you may begin.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, shannon, and good morning to you. it would not be an understatement to say that the coronavirus has changed the world since our last call with you just three months ago. fortunately, at arch, we are entering this period with the investments we have made in our p&c business beginning to pay off, while our mortgage group navigates through the current turbulence. if you work long enough in the insurance business, like i have, you are bound to experience the industry cycle, its highs and its lows. as management, we have to keep our eye on the goal, which for arch, is generating sustainable growth in book value per share. the current stress in the financial and insurance markets reminds us of changes that can occur to which we need to adapt. while we are still early in the assessment of our direct and indirect claims exposure to the coronavirus, it is clear that this event will be a significant industry loss and will result in profound changes. however, dislocation often leads to opportunity. as you know, one of arch's strategic principles from inception has been cycle management. we are embarking in this new market environment with both a strong financial foundation and the creative ability of our more than 4,200 employees that position us for the opportunities that will emerge. turning to the quarter.
we saw improving conditions in our p&c businesses, while our mortgage operations continued to produce good results. strengthening p&c market conditions remain evident, even as the economy contracts. we have seen a rise in our submission activity along with accelerating rate increases across multiple lines of business in q1, and it is continuing here in q2. our belief in the continuing hardening of the p&c market is due to the need our industry has to address the accumulation of risk factors over the last five years of soft market conditions. these risk elements are: one, future claims and covered litigation related to covid-19; two, a heightened perception of risk in general; three, economic uncertainty; four, a continuation of low-interest rates and the dampening effect on investment returns; five, a potential for shortfalls in casualty reserves; and six, reduced availability of retro and alternative capital in general. these risk elements are all in play today and are likely to lead insurance companies to be more cautious in allocating capital to risk. in our insurance group, our strategy remains to be selective and pick our spots in this improving market. the rising rates environment and dislocation in the markets have allowed us to grow profitably in the past two years in many sectors, such as e&s property, d&o and e&s casualty.
on a reported basis, we saw our margins improve this current quarter as our accident combined ratio, ex-cat of covid and pyd, improved to 97%.in our reinsurance business, pricing is also improving, and we continue to observe tightening of terms and conditions in many lines. the value of reinsurance as a capital protection tool has been enhanced by the recent events. the hallmark of our reinsurance group remains the dynamic allocation of capital to contracts that will provide appropriate risk-adjusted returns while helping clients with solutions that are tailored to their needs and was a large factor in our growth this quarter. switching now to our mortgage insurance segment. the industry is facing its first significant test since the fundamental reforms and product improvements that were adopted following the global financial crisis, or gfc. as you know, arch mi is a data and analytics-driven company, and our investment in the sector was predicated on a new and better mi operating model than the industry employed prior to 2008. now pricing is more precise, products and documentation are better, and the mi industry buys protection against downside. in addition, another change in the industry can be; seen in the aggressive government actions taken in the early stages of the pandemic directed at helping borrowers stay in their homes.
the gse's forbearance program and the unemployment benefits programs provide unprecedented support that should enable borrowers to cure delinquent delinquencies as the economy improves and will result in fewer losses. as noted in our quarterly hammr report, the mi industry is far better positioned for a recession than they were in 2008. at that time, mortgage insurance portfolios were facing a housing market that was significantly overbuilt, risky mortgage products and less creditworthy borrowers. more than 2/3 of mortgage insurance written in 2007 would have been uninsurable during the last 10 years. and finally, there was a speculative bubble in home prices. mortgages filed under the fhfa's forbearance programs were estimated at 5.85% on of the gse mortgages as of april 26. this program allows homeowners to suspend mortgage payment for six months, which can then be extended for up to another six months. while initially recorded as delinquencies under gaap, our data on forbearance programs utilized in recent natural catastrophes indicates that almost all of these loans cure by providing borrowers time to return to work. over the next few quarters, rising delinquency rates under gaap should lead to elevated loss ratios in the mi segment. furthermore, once the forbearance programs expire, the gses have instituted a sturdy list of remedial solutions that, once again, will enable loans to be back-performing.
we realize that this pandemic-led recession will be different than a gfc. but based on what we can see today, our view is this is an earnings, not a capital event for arch. it is worth noting again that even if this recession is worse than we currently expect, we hold significant reinsurance protection on our risk in force that would moderate our net losses even in a more severe recession. while some of our reinsurers' quota share attaches at first-dollar loss that would provide up to an additional $3 billion of excess and loss protection if this becomes a recession worse than what the industry experienced in a gfc. lastly, turning to our investment operations. we believe that interest rates are likely to stay at historically low levels for the foreseeable future, and that will, over time, require insurers to improve their underwriting margins through price increases. in our investment strategy, as in our underwriting approach, we have maintained our focus on risk-adjusted total return, while enabled us which enabled us to avoid much of the negative impact of the pandemic on our investments this quarter. as perception of risk increases, so does the cost of capital and underwriting discipline becomes important. again, recent world events reminds us that risk is always present, that insurance premiums must include an adequate margin of safety, and that reinsurance plays an important role in protecting capital and returns. in summary, through to arch's cycle and risk management principles and fortified by our conservative balance sheet, arch is prepared for this crisis and is well positioned to continue to build on its track record of book value growth. in closing, i want to thank all of our employees around the world as they are responsible for the success of arch and are working tirelessly throughout the world to meet the needs of our insureds.
thank you. with that, i'll turn the call over to francois.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, marc, and good morning to all. we at arch, hope that you are in good health in these difficult and uncertain times. this quarter, in anticipation of some of the questions you may have, i will try to elaborate in more detail on some notable items in addition to the regular discussion of financial items. i recognize this may take a bit longer than usual, so please bear with me. now on to the first quarter results. as a reminder, and consistent with prior practice, the following comments are on a core basis, which corresponds to arch's financial results, excluding the other segment, i.e. the operations of watford holdings ltd. in our filings, the term consolidated includes watford. after-tax operating income for the quarter was $189.8 million, which translates to an annualized 7.1% operating return on average common equity and $0.46 per share. book value per share decreased to $26.10 at march 31, a slight reduction of 1.2% from last quarter and a 12.9% increase from one year ago. the defensive posture of our investment portfolio ahead of the covid-19 crisis served us extremely well in preserving our capital base relatively intact during the stressed economic environment of recent months. i will elaborate on this in more detail later on. outside of the losses related to the covid-19 pandemic, which impacted on our first quarter results, our underwriting groups fared very well this quarter with strong growth and generally improving underwriting results through our property casualty insurance and reinsurance operations. given the unusual circumstances and breadth of the pandemic, we have classified covid-19 losses as a catastrophe.
however, as you saw in the financial supplement, we have also provided the segment level detail of our current estimates to assist with the analysis of the underlying performance of our book of business. we expect to follow this approach until the end of 2020 at a minimum. losses from 2020 catastrophic events in the quarter, not including covid-19, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums, stood at $31.8 million or 2.0 combined ratio points compared to 0.6 combined ratio points in the first quarter of 2019. the losses impacted both our insurance and reinsurance segments and were primarily due to various u.s. severe convective storms, u.k. storms and floods and australian bushfires. we recorded approximately $87 million of covid-19 losses across our p&c operations, split 41% to insurance and 59% to reinsurance. while it is still very early and we have extremely limited information to accurately quantify our potential exposure to the pandemic, we believe that it was prudent to establish a certain level of ibnr reserves for occurrences through march 31 based on policy terms and conditions, including limits, sublimits and deductibles. these reserves were recorded across a limited number of lines of business, such as property, where we have a very small number of policies that do not contain a specific pandemic exclusion and/or explicitly afford business interruption coverage under a pandemic, and trade credit.
as regards the potential impact of covid-19 on our mortgage segment and our estimation process at this time, we believe it's important to make a distinction between our u.s. primary mortgage insurance unit, which we refer to as usmi and the rest of this segment, which includes our international book and our portfolio of gse credit risk transfer policies. for usmi, pursuant to gaap, our estimates are based only on reported delinquencies as of march 31, 2020. however, given the potential effect of the pandemic, we elected to book reserves at a higher level of confidence within our range of reserve estimates for such known delinquencies. the financial impact of this increased level of conservatism was approximately 5.2 loss ratio points across the segment. for the rest of this segment, the loss-reserving approach we use is more consistent with traditional property casualty techniques, where loss ratio picks are set at the policy level and are able to consider future delinquencies on business already earned. this quarter, in response to the potential impact from the pandemic across our portfolio, we adjusted our loss-ratio picks for some policies, which resulted in an increase of 6.8 loss-ratio points to the overall segment results.
based on the information known to date and economic forecast, we believe the adjustment across the non-usmi book is prudent and consistent with a moderately severe stress level. as we look toward the remainder of 2020 for our usmi unit, we are expecting the delinquency rate to increase progressively from the current level as more borrowers request forbearance on their mortgage loans under the cares act. as mandated by gaap, we expect to record loss reserves on these delinquencies, which will most likely translate into an increase in our levels of incurred losses over the coming quarters. over time, we would expect many of these delinquencies to cure and revert back to performing loans as the economy returns to a more normal state. at this time, we do not have enough visibility to predictably forecast the rate at which forbearance delinquencies will be reported to us. cure are ultimately turned into claims on an annual, let alone a quarterly basis. that said, based on our current analysis, which tells us that the pandemic will represent an earnings event for our mortgage segment and not a capital event, our current expectation is that our pre-tax underwriting income for the entire mortgage segment will be minimal for the remainder of 2020, i.e., from the second through the fourth quarter of 2020.
however, there is likely to be variability in underwriting income between quarters based on the timing of receipt of notice of defaults. turning to prior period net loss reserve development. we recognized $17.8 million of favorable development in the first quarter, net of related adjustments, or 1.1 combined ratio points compared to three combined ratio points in the first quarter of 2019. all three of our segments experienced favorable development at $0.8 million, $11 million and $6.1 million for the insurance, reinsurance and mortgage segments, respectively. we had excellent net written premium growth in the insurance segment of 33.4% over the same quarter one year ago. the insurance segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, which, as a reminder, include covid-19 losses, was 97.1%, lower by 310 basis points from the same period one year ago. approximately 190 basis points of the difference is due to a lower expense ratio, primarily from the growth in the premium base over one year ago. the lower ex-cat accident quarter loss ratio primarily reflects the benefits of rate increases achieved throughout most of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.
as for our reinsurance operations, we had a significant transaction in the quarter, which affected the comparability of our underwriting results, an $88 million loss portfolio transfer written and fully earned in the period in the other specialty line of business. absent this transaction, net premiums written would have been 57.2% higher than the same quarter one year ago. this net written premium growth was observed around sorry, across most of our lines and includes a combination of new business opportunities, rate increases and the integration of the barbican reinsurance business. while the loss portfolio transfer had a minimal impact on the overall combined ratio for this segment, a decrease of approximately 50 basis points, its impact on each of the loss and expense ratio components was more observable with a resulting increase of 400 basis points to the loss ratio and a decrease of 450 basis points to the expense ratio. overall, the growth and underlying performance of our reinsurance segment was very good this quarter. the mortgage segment's combined ratio was at 44.1% including the 12-point loss ratio loss ratio impact resulting from the increased level of conservatism in our overall segment reserve estimates discussed earlier. the expense ratio was higher by 240 basis points over the same quarter one year ago, reflecting reductions in profit commissions on ceded business and higher compensation costs and employee benefits.
total investment return for the quarter was negative 80 basis points on a u.s. dollar basis as the defensive positioning of our portfolio served us extremely well in this difficult period. given some of our fund investments are reported on a lag, typically three months, their first quarter performance will be included in our second quarter financials. the duration of our investment portfolio was slightly lower than last quarter at 3.19 years compared to 3.40 years at december 31, but remain overweight relative to our target allocation by approximately 0.35 years. most financial markets had a positive return in april, which should help reverse some of the results we're we observed in the first quarter. the effective tax rate in the quarter on pre-tax operating income was 10.5% and reflects the geographic mix of our pre-tax income and a 110-basis-point benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. as always, the effective tax rate could vary, depending on the level and location of income or loss and varying tax rates in each jurisdiction. turning briefly to risk management. our natural cat pml on a net basis increased to $680 million as of april 1, which had approximately 7% of tangible common equity, remains well below our internal limits at the single event, 1-in-250-year return level. with respect to capital management, we remain committed to maintaining a strong and liquid balance sheet. during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of $75.5 million.
while we have a meaningful remaining share authorization under our current program, we do not expect to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2020. at usmi, our capital position remained strong with our pmiers sufficiency ratio at 165% at the end of march 31, 2020, which reflects the coverage afforded by a bellemeade mortgage insurance link notes. these structures provide approximately $3.1 billion of aggregate reinsurance coverage as of march 31, 2020. finally, to echo marc's comments, i'd like to give a special shout out to our more than 4,000 colleagues around the world that have demonstrated a tremendous amount of creativity, patience, resilience and compassion with clients and business partners, the communities they live in, their families and loved ones and each other over the last 7-plus weeks. they are the essence of what arch is all about, and i couldn't be prouder to be part of such a great team of individuals.
thank you. with these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo. hi, thanks, good morning. my first question, on the property casualty side, you guys seem pretty optimistic and started to see saw a continuation of pretty good growth in the quarter. and so you guys don't disclose the capital supporting your property casualty versus the mortgage business, but if we're sitting outside the company and we just want to get a sense of the opportunity at hand and the capital that you have, given the recent debt raise, could you potentially, if it really is a strong market, double the size of your insurance book of business on your current capital base?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's a fair assessment. i think in general, you could think of capital allocation on premium from the p&c as a 1:1, that sort of gives you a range for capital usage, but certainly, the ability is there. and i would say that is also informed by how you develop it, right? elyse, if you property care is a different and capital requirements, and then other lines of business such as quota share, let's say, on the reinsurance side, on liability. so there's a lot there's plenty of room for us to grow.
elyse beth greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. and then on the mortgage side of things, you guys see some pretty helpful color that the current delinquency rate is about 30% to 40% lower than where you thought it would have been. so as you set the new guide for the outlook for the underwriting positive underwriting mortgage income for the rest of the year in that 70% to 80% combined ratio, can you give us a sense of where you expect delinquency rates to trend in the third and the fourth quarter?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, we don't really we had the quarterly movements are a bit harder to predict. but i mean we had forecasted last quarter, somewhere around a 10% or so delinquency rate by the end of the year. we think right now, we're thinking that it will be more like around 8%. so obviously, we're monitoring weekly and we get data that comes in from all our servicers, etc, but that's kind of where we're at. there's about 8% delinquency rate by the end of the year.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think to add to this, elyse. i would just to add to this, elyse. i would say that this is it's a one quarter data point, so it will take us we still take a longer-term view and are not fully all reflecting the decrease or the lesser delinquency that we had. we had reported versus what we expected, where you get 30% to 40% and then francois told you a 20% increase. that tells you sort of a level where we're thoughtful and measured in the way we want to recognize any immediate improvement.
elyse beth greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that's helpful. and then my last question. you guys have pointed to the severity per claim. i believe you said it was about 50% higher than some of the claims you settled in the quarter, just given the higher housing values, i believe. if i look in your supplement on the mortgage page, the average case reserve per default went down to 6,900 in the quarter, and it has been 14,400. why would that number have gone down if you're actually setting up more for the current claims? i'm just trying to reconcile those numbers.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. the average is very much a function of the percentage of the delinquencies that are effectively in early stages of delinquency. so if you think of all these newly reported delinquencies in the quarter, they carry, again, effectively a five or-so percent claim rate versus the older-stage delinquencies and the percentages go up as the more mature, the later-stage mature delinquencies we have. so it's really there's no changes in assumptions. i'd say it's really just the way the mix of the portfolio or the mix of the delinquencies that we currently have changes over time. and this was really, as you know, the first quarter where we had a large surge of delinquencies coming from the pandemic.
operator
our next question comes from mike zaremski with credit suisse.
michael david zaremski -- analyst
i guess sticking with mi, so clearly there feels like there's some conservatism kind of built in that you expect the delinquency rate to continue moving north. is the government stimulus kind of a big x factor in terms of like the how the $600 weekly unemployment insurance subsidy, whether that continues or not? just trying to think about or i mean you can just should we just probably be looking at unemployment levels as well? just trying to think about how to gauge because clearly, results have been good, so far much better than expected, which is great.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
so mike, i think the easy question is, unemployment matters, it is a contributing factor that would precipitate, if you will, in delinquency and in claims, ultimately. the number 1, the leading indicators, as i said in my notes, that will tell you whether there's a heightened increased risk of delinquencies is really the house price in there. so to the extent that the house prices are stable or keep on going up or that there is which is another way to say, as long as there's reasonable amount of equity in the house, we have found that borrowers do not tend to walk away from their obligation to mortgages. i know. so if you saw the great financial crisis, what happened is we had a combination of house price decreases and unemployment, so it sort of contributed to the acceleration and a more of an acute delinquency rate that we saw in the great financial crisis, which we are not seeing right now. so what we're focusing on of course, we look at what the government is doing, that's going to be helpful. and i think we'll see more of this impact at the end of the forbearance period. but for now, the house price index is extremely encouraging to us and really is a leading indicator on the propensity for homeowners to default.
michael david zaremski -- analyst
okay. that makes sense and that's helpful. then in terms of we get a number of questions about the court cases in the united kingdom, the fca has kind of been writing about that. is that contemplated in your covid ibnr, whether those court cases go for or against the industry?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we've taken a conservative approach, and we actually had reserves for it as the end of march. so we have reserved for it appropriately with fairly good level of reinsurance against it, so we're pretty much reserved there. if things it could presumably could be good news going forward for us there.
michael david zaremski -- analyst
okay. and just lastly, quickly, i'm sure other people will ask about kind of the segments. any thoughts on new capital entering the broader insurance and reinsurance marketplaces? do you feel that capital will continue then or is it having an impact on your ability to play offense at this point or is it still just a drop in the bucket? any color would be helpful.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
so mike, it's a little bit of everything you mentioned. i would say that the capital needs that are out there that we see in terms of client trying to find solutions and towers of coverage is meaning a place, a new place, a new home, we would need a significant amount of capital to neutralize that impact, if you will. so we're seeing actually acceleration, even though there are there's more capital being raised and new entrants, as we speak, thinking about coming in. we're not seeing any ebbing of the rate pressure that we see right now. and i think the demand for capital are pretty high. there's a couple of large players that were really providing a lot of capacity, acute capacity in very, very high capacity mongers in the industry have pulled out significantly, so that means that there's a lot of other capital that needs to find its way around to support it. so i would say that we are not seeing we hear what's out there, what's happening. we're encouraged by we raised some more capital, and there's other folks such as ourselves who have access to the business, access to the clients and relationships. we're able to raise capital. it bodes well for the health of those companies. but any new entrants, it will take them a while to get ramped up, and i don't think it's impossible. i think it's totally doable, but it's certainly not something that we're losing sleep over.
operator
our next question comes from yaron kinar with goldman sachs.
yaron joseph kinar -- goldman sachs group -- analyst
first question on mi and then a couple on the covid losses. so in mi, i haven't really seen any significant pullback from that market. so i guess should i take that to mean that even with all the covid economic uncertainty, you still view it as a pretty attractive business?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it is still very attractive. i would even argue on that the production in the second quarter and as we speak is actually better than it was six months or a year ago, where the rates that's rate pressures and also quality of underwriting, quality of the originations is a lot better than it was even a year ago. so yes, there is a lot more activity. the activity, yaron, to be fair, is also driven by the refinancing market, which was not there and by dropping the mortgage rate below 3%, that does create more business back into the market. as a result of that, there's a lot of prepay, right? there's a higher level of the lower level of persistency, which means that there's more churn, if you will, in the portfolio of business. so i think it's just a reflection of people coming out of their current they're coming out of their higher mortgage rate, and it's just refinancing at a low level, which still makes economic sense. now we're on the receiving end to grow. that's what we have such, we believe, much higher niws than otherwise would have been in a more stable marketplace.
yaron joseph kinar -- goldman sachs group -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then with regards to the covid losses, maybe a couple of questions there. one, when you talk about ibnr, do you include only events or losses from events that have already occurred or do you also include events in the future that are probable very probable to occur?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, i mean, that's a i mean a good question, which, as you know, people are i think companies are may be answering that, i don't want to say differently, but i think the words we have to be careful with how we use the words, right? so i'd say, no question that we can only reserve for incidents or occurrences that have happened before june 30. i mean that's under gaap. and anybody that tells you they're reserving for occurrences that are going to happen in the third or fourth quarter, i just don't know how you can do that. what we have done is set, again, a high level, i think, a prudent level of ibnr on both insurance and reinsurance on things that we know happened or think have happened, right? i mean the whole concept of ibnr. so we have certain claims that have been reported. we don't know. and certainly, when you get into structures or when you're in an excess position, you're somewhat making a judgment on whether the claim will attach in your layer, etc, and that's where there's a bit more there's a bit of art that goes on and not necessarily tons of data or science around it. so i think the answer to us is we've reserved for everything through june 30, and we would say there's an ultimate, right? so the truly, our best estimate of what we think the exposure is, and that's where we are. i mean we can't really do more than that at this point given the accounting rules and guidelines.
yaron joseph kinar -- goldman sachs group -- analyst
got it. and then final question also with regards to covid. between first quarter and second quarter, the increase in loss and covid losses, is some of that coming from ibnrs that you had already set up in 1q but then took a second look and realized they need to be higher or is that from really new lines of business and new areas that had not been not previously reserved for?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, i'd say it's a bit of both. i mean i would say, on the insurance side, for example, at q1, we had reserved primarily in set ibnr, primarily in our international book because again, back to the in the u.k. in particular, property book or regional property book there, we were of the opinion that there was exposure there. we took action and we booked ibnr on that. i'd say in the second quarter, for example, we booked, and i mentioned it on national accounts, that's where we have workers' comp exposure, again, if you want to be very technical at one point, i mean the deaths or the occurrences hadn't happened at the end of march, they started to take place, especially with healthcare workers, as an example, in april and may. so that's when we that's what we reserved for in the second quarter. i'd say on the reinsurance side, it's a bit murkier. it's not we're somewhat at the mercy or have to have discussions with our scenes and on the property cat book, for example. we had booked a little bit of ibnr at the end of q1. but through additional discussions and investigations and file reviews in the second quarter, we booked a bit more on that front and the same is true in trade credit. so hopefully, that answers it, but it's a bit of both, i'd say.
yaron joseph kinar -- goldman sachs group -- analyst
that is helpful. and maybe one other one, if i could sneak it in. on the bi front in reinsurance, the increases in covid losses that you're reserving for today, are those coming more from international accounts or more from the u.s.?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
correct, more international. absolutely. as you know, we have exposure. i mean continental europe, in particular, there's france here, there's certain countries where the bi coverage is more implicit and provided by the primary policies, so those are some of the examples that we or policies that we or treaties that we're reserving for at this point.

our next question comes from josh shanker with bank of america.
joshua david shanker -- bofa merrill lynch -- analyst
can we talk a little bit about july and how it compared with noticing for mortgage defaults?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
can you repeat the question, please, josh?
joshua david shanker -- bofa merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. can we talk about compare may, june, july the and of you receiving notices for forbearance and defaults?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think, we i think the one place the one thing that we could say, i mean, it's the data is probably lagging a little bit from our perspective. but the good one to look at is the there's information back now, i think, and the mba is providing information as to what is their estimate surveying the market and their clients as to who what's the forbearance percentage. i think it was pretty much plateauing as we got into may toward the end of may into june, and through the second first or second week of july, and it's gotten down since then. so we're about 6.1% based on that metric in percent of forbearance from the gse portfolio, from the industry data, and now it's at 5.49% as of july 13, i believe, this last week. so we've seen a decrease right now, josh. whether it continues that way or goes back up again. as you know, a lot of people pay on the first of the month, but we'll probably have more information and a better clear picture as to what august look july looks like in the middle of august.
joshua david shanker -- bofa merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and do you have any evidence, one way or the other, what ratestar has had any discernible difference in claim behavior i should say, claim-noticing behavior compared to how a lot of your competitors were pricing risk prior to your to adopting your methods?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think it does. it has had an impact. i think when we talk about cycle management. we also were doing it possibly a little bit more under the radar screen and mi. i think that our ratestar approach with all the parameters, actually took us away from a higher than 95 ltv, higher dtis in certain geographical areas. so yes, we do believe if we adjust for all the variation. i mean it's not a huge differential, but there is a slight improvement or a slight difference going to our advantage in terms of our delinquencies based on our portfolio and the risk that we underwrote for the last 4, five years.
joshua david shanker -- bofa merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. and one last one. i think you mentioned the change in aml. i don't think you mentioned the rds change or maybe i missed it. where is rds as a percent of directly as of the end of the quarter?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
still right at 8%, pretty flat. we've a couple of movements across the kind of contributions, but yes, 8% of tangible book.
operator
our next question comes from ryan tunis with autonomous research.
ryan james tunis -- autonomous research llp -- analyst
appreciate the mi guidance, i realize all this is like literally impossible to nail down, but i'll go ahead and i'll push on it a little bit more because it is interesting. so when you think about the full year delinquency rate, in your mind, what are you thinking the percentage of forbearances are going to be of, i think you said, what was it, 8%? how much of that is forbearance versus what you think of as like a real delinquency?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
well, the forbearance that we will declare that we will report that we're reporting to you are delinquencies by definition, right? so it's very hard to see, i know what you're asking. and i think the one thing that we will tell you about projecting forbearance rates and delinquency rates in this forbearance world is that data is very, very hard to get, and it's lagging a fair amount, so very difficult for us to tell you.
ryan james tunis -- autonomous research llp -- analyst
and i guess my follow-up, too, is how are you planning on treating these delinquencies as they age? like you're obviously using a pretty conservative incidence rate of 5%. i mean as those move into the as those age to six months or whatever, like are you going to keep it at 5% or are you going to assume something bigger than that?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's there are two moving parts of that 5%, ryan. one is the it comes up really as our pre-covid nods to ultimate, which was 7.9%, and we gave a discount about 33% haircut by virtue of being a forbearance. so as we move forward, that 7.9%, which is a claim that's aged three months versus a claim that's aged two years or nine months even though it's a forbearance, we might have to increase those rates. but at the same time, if the forbearance programs are getting better, we might give a bit more discount or less discount. so it's a really, really and you're right, you just pointed at the beginning of your comments. i think i should have probably let you answer your own question, which is it's pretty much impossible to answer at this point in time. but right and we have all we have is a 7.9% pre-covid ultimate nods which was starting point getting some discount, recognizing that the regular forbearance program on hurricanes, which it is not right now is as low as 2%. so we're try to find our way around that environment, also recognizing that the delinquencies out of this crisis, this covid-19, will be longer to resolve because the forbearance program, as we all know, will last for 12 months. so it's going to be it's going to take us a while to really understand the underlying fundamental characteristics of those risks. and to add all this to all of this, if that wasn't enough, we'll have remediation programs put in place by the gses, which presumably should help a tremendous amount. but again, it remains very early to see to say.
ryan james tunis -- autonomous research llp -- analyst
understood. and then lastly, mark, this is purely hypothetical, but if you had $1 of capital for the next year or two years, and you can only allocate it to reinsurance or primary insurance, is there a clear preference for which one you allocate it to?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
how many years?
ryan james tunis -- autonomous research llp -- analyst
two years.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
man, so to me, you're asking me to choose among my kids. i got three kids, i love dearly. i would split it in three three ways or i mean which way i would like to i mean to me, it's not an all or nothing. but i do believe right now at this point in time, which is i think what you're getting into, which i mentioned in my comments, the returns on the reinsurance are quicker to a high level get quicker. but in terms of value creation over the longer time, insurance will get there and get traction. it just takes a longer time to accumulate business at a higher level, so but the problem with the reinsurance, it's great for a couple of years, but then you might lose that business. so it's not an all or nothing kind of situation. i wouldn't want to go, let's say, all in, in reinsurance, even though they have higher roes sooner at the cost of losing long-term value creation from the insurance unit.
operator
our next question comes from meyer shields with kbw.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette -- analyst
i wanted to follow-up on that question but in a different direction. you talked about reinsurance maybe recovering faster than insurance. how is the current hardening cycle playing out in terms of speed relative to past cycles? is there any observable difference?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
not really. i would say that we meyer, we may have that discussion before. a hard market never happens overnight. it takes five signal 2, three quarters. losses have to develop. management team have to figure out what they want to do and put pressure on their underwriting team. so it's no it's not unlike others that we've seen before. i would say that we were going to a strengthening of the market conditions even before covid-19, i think that covid is probably accelerating the reaction and the willingness and the boldness that we see in the underwriting teams around the industry. but there are still pockets, meyer, where people seem to be a little bit aloof in what's going around. and these are the areas we're not growing as much as we should. but i know every cycle turn is different, but i'm not seeing significant difference. it does take-up and well, one last thing i will tell you. the one thing about this one is that we have yet to see is the 1/1 renewal on reinsurance is a really important renewal date, so we'll have a lot more sense as to how quickly and how reactive the market will be as we head into this one.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette -- analyst
okay. no, that's very helpful. in the past, we've been, i guess, targeting improvements within insurance that would get to a 95% combined. and when we look to the lens of current pricing, is there an update in terms of what that 95% can become?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
i hope it's lower. but all kidding aside, meyer, i think that the 95% was put in place as an aspirational number two, three years ago now, two years ago now, in an interest environment that was different. so i think right now, what we're processing it through this was sort of an aspirational as a guiding sort of target for our insurance group. i think right now, what we're seeing is we're going through every different line of business and business units and attributing capital and return on investment, and we're pitching everything to get to the right level. so 95% is an oversimplistic way of looking at this. but all things being equal, i think i would expect it to be lower, right, for the industry, and that's also why you'll probably see a bit more pressure on the pricing around us in the industry.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette -- analyst
okay. perfect. and then final question, if i can, just in terms of whether you've had to take into account, whether it's covid or something like that, that's so remote or other pressures, whether you've dialed up your overall last year numbers in insurance or reinsurance?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
not in a meaningful way. i think i mean we've been pretty cautious. and i think i've been, i'd say, realistic about what the loss trends have been and what we expect them to be going forward. as you know, we haven't relied exclusively on kind of the last five or 10 years of data. we superimposed our own views on what a more normalized view of loss trends is or should be. and i think we're still very comfortable with where we were at and recognizing that yes, covid is a bit of an outlier. but at this point, haven't really factored in any material changes in our loss trends in how we price the business.
operator
our next question comes from brian meredith with ubs.
brian robert meredith -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
a couple here for you. first one, i don't think you mentioned it, but was there any benefit at all in the quarter from just lower frequency of economic activity, kind of from a claims perspective, in any lines of business?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
i mean there are some indications that in some places, yes, there's lower economic activity, which will translate to lower losses or claims. we really haven't reflected that yet. i mean we want to take a cautious approach on that, so i'd like to think that maybe there's some to come down the road, but for now, we haven't factored that in anywhere in our numbers.
brian robert meredith -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
great. and then second question, i'm just curious, mark, as you look at, i guess, the heals act here, there's a component into it of kind of liability, call it indemnification. as you think about it, if that doesn't go through, is that a potential issue here for you and the insurance industry? and how do you kind of think about it from an underwriting perspective here going forward?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
i missed the word you said, brian. could you repeat the early part of your question?
brian robert meredith -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
well, it's basically, curious about protection or what you think about as far as the economy reopening here and potential liability associated with kind of covid-19. the current, i think it's called the heals act or the cares two act, has got some language in there trying to grant businesses and immunity for it, right? i'm just curious of your thoughts around that. and if you're interested for insurance?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, it's not good.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
they're going to allocate more liability to us or presumption to us is not good. but i think in this sense, these laws are always there. there's always things that are happening. we're going to have to react to what we see when we see it. that's all i can tell you, brian. it's very hard to sit here and go through what impact it is. if we were to react and do this full drill about everything that goes and a bill that's proposed, it would take a lot of our time. so we'll react to it when we'll react to it. right?
brian robert meredith -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
yes. and mark, i think you get it wrong. i think you mistake my question. my question more is, from your insurance policies perspective as you look going forward, as the economy reopens up, there's clearly epli exposures or gl exposures, all sorts of exposures to potentially present themselves as benefits. how do you how are you thinking about that from an underwriting perspective?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
well, we have written policies that have epli exposure, we have gl exposures, but we are not a large risk writer. we don't write the large insurers, so that's certainly something that would be helpful to us. we would argue that a lot of the larger claims, a lot of the focus from the low risk plaintiff bar would be focused on the larger, deeper pocket insurer, so that's one thing we have for us. we also have a fairly amount a good healthy amount of reinsurance, so we're not overly concerned with the sideways change.
brian robert meredith -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
yes. got you. okay. and then another just quick one here. your travel insurance, i'm just curious, how big of a book is that? and obviously, we're probably going to see some continued pressures there for the rest of the year.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it was originally about a couple of hundred million dollars of premium, and now it's down i mean, you could see the numbers, you can multiply by 4. i don't need to 250 actually for the year. so that's it's been it's taken a big dent, and that also explains why the growth was more tested this quarter than otherwise could have been.
brian robert meredith -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
great. and then one other just quick one here for you. i know you guys launched the sidecar guesses in the first quarter. any thoughts about additional kind of alternative capacity here to potentially capture some of the good attractive opportunities in reinsurance?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
it's a good question, brian. you're trying to get us to say something we don't want to say, we can't say and we won't say. we don't mention about we certainly are always on the lookout to raise capital to deploy it with third party, a lot of discussions are happening all over. we'll have probably more update as we see it happen, and we'll be communicating to you to the extent it's appropriate, but how much more it is clearly yes.
brian robert meredith -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
great. great. great. and last one, just quickly, any updates on coface?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
coface, strategically, is still something we really very much think is valuable for the shareholders. there's a lot going on. we're still going through the process of approval process, and we're keeping a keen eye on what's happening. i think they reported results yesterday, which were better than the street expected. so hopefully, if that goes. it's also there as well a developing situation with them.
operator
our next question comes from phil stefano with deutsche bank.
philip michael stefano -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
just a quick one on the bellemeade transaction. i'm thinking about the potential for these moving forward. i guess it seems like the bellemeade deal that was done in the past quarter, just given its attachment was probably more for s&p capital credit than pmiers. when we saw an mi pure play come out with their own iln transaction, which is, in my mind, more of a traditional attachment point in the low single digits, but the spreads on that and the pricing was significantly higher. how are you thinking about the managing of tail risk that bellemeade provides versus just the capital credit that could be from playing i would think something that could be considered well above the working layers for the mi reinsurance coverage and the capital relief that something like that might provide?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's a good question. i think it's always something we evaluate when and if we place or look at options that are in front of us. you're correct, this one attaches the last one attaches above the pmiers credit, but we're still very much in we have a healthy pmiers ratio, so that didn't really concern us too much at this point, not to say that next time or down the road, we may not go back to a lower attachment point. but yes, the focus was really yes, it's an available source of capital. from a rating agency point of view, s&p, you're correct, it covers that. it provides us coverage there. and also, we felt as being the first one out of the gate, even before the gses to go back and access the capital markets was, we thought, a very strong message, demonstrated again, i touched on it, the quality, the book and the investor base is still very has a lot of interest and appetite for the product, so i think we were happy with the placement. no question, it's always too expensive. we'd like to see the price to come down. we hope they do down the road. but for the time being, given the economics in front of us, we were i think it was a good move on our part.
philip michael stefano -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
got it. and to the extent that you guys have a disclosure wish list that you keep in the background, i think it might be helpful to see the usmi disaggregated from the international and the mortgage reinsurance book just been the significant differences in how those businesses are reserved for.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
see you. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from geoffrey dunn with dowling & partners.
geoffrey murray dunn -- dowling & partners securities -- analyst
i guess first, just a quick number question. can you quantify the impact of the accelerated singles in the quarter?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
did we do that? i think it's about $50 million.
geoffrey murray dunn -- dowling & partners securities -- analyst
$50 million, ok. and then let's think forward past the end of new forbearance, so early next year, so given what you know about the economy now, obviously, very different from a couple of months ago, how would you think about claim rates on new notices without forbearance? because again, you pointed out, it's very different with home prices, remains to be seen if we're going into a recession or not. and i think, mark, last quarter, you suggested we might be looking at 13%, 14% given what you knew then. so what do you think about that type of number as you get into early 2021 based on what you know today?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
i think the 5% is probably this is like on nods or you're talking about ultimate claims rate for the portfolio?
geoffrey murray dunn -- dowling & partners securities -- analyst
on nods. so new notices coming in, forbearance goes away.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
nods, yes. right. i think we were at 7.9% pre-covid. i think that the forbearance should be pretty helpful and to bring it up not bring up to the 13%, 14%, you just mentioned i mentioned first quarter. that's probably my gut would tell me a slight increase for a little while until we see things shake out and things came back to more normalcy. and i think reverting back to some kind of level. i think the forbearance program were to play out to the way it should play out. it's still very uncertain, as you know, geoff. i think that we should get back to it might stay elevated for a while, maybe 12%, 13% for a little while, but it should go back down at some point for next year, i would say.
geoffrey murray dunn -- dowling & partners securities -- analyst
okay. all right. so you do think, given what you know about the economy and built-up equity that you could still see 12% type of incidence assumption?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. the yes, on nods, right? on new nods for regular piece, not for the forbearance piece? the forbearance piece, we gave we did give a discount, right? there's a discount to that. so yes, then just got it from right congrats, yes.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
quick i mean before you go on to the next one, geoff, quick update for you. the actual impact of the singles was $27 million in the quarter. just correction to mark's $50 million.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
okay. go with $51 million.
operator
our next question comes from jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan.
jamminder singh bhullar -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
i just had a question on pricing and just how you think about the interplay between the decline in exposures if the economy remains weak and how that could affect demand and pricing? and relatedly, what else is out there that you think could potentially derail the momentum that you've seen in pricing, both in insurance and reinsurance?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
i mean it's hard to predict the future. as you know oh my god. i think if everything resolves i mean even if things resolved for the better, i think the momentum that we've seen in the first quarter, late 2019, early 2020, i think we would still see some momentum. i think it would be just a matter of degree, how much higher the rates could go. but i do believe the momentum was there for a turnover market way before pre-covid-19. covid-19, like i said before, exacerbated the need for rate and accelerate the need for rate.
jamminder singh bhullar -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
and then there's been a lot of talk about sort of ils and trapped capacity, and what do you think about when either some of the capacity gets relieved or potentially gets absorbed? and once there's clarity on that, do you think by this time next year, like a lot of the trapped capital would actually be out?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
it's a possibility. i mean that's also assuming there's no more cat occurring this year. but this is a long-lasting cat event, so it's not as clear as having a quake, let's say, in march. and i guess in a year out, it's still developing, but you have a better sense for wanting to or would be willing to release capital. this one will take a bit longer to process through, right? for instance, you could have arguments in courts and new ways and new push back on the insurance industry to pay claims in a property cycle. and that would take that could take another 1.5 years or two years to resolve. so there's a lot more uncertainty in terms of timing, finding resolution of the ultimate prices. so it's a lot less certain that it will take only a year to get through it.
operator
our next question comes from jamie inglis with philo smith.
james inglis -- philo smith & co. -- analyst
i wanted to follow-up on the conversation we've been having about forbearance programs and to what extent delinquencies get cured, get claims turn into claims sort of, etc. and i appreciate that we don't know what's going to happen going forward, but i'm wondering if you could speak to what you learned in previous forbearance programs and how that affects your thinking about your current book? and if and what you learned in there? was it did you learn anything about ltvs, geographies, sort of, etc? and how does that apply to your existing book today?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
i think we have done reserving in the past, considering all the dimensions you just talked about, i think that we had the the beautiful thing about the prior hurricanes or the beautiful thing in a way is that we have prior hurricanes and prior events that we can go back to and look at the experience. this definitely help us put, i guess, boundaries around what could happen, but this one is very unusual in the length of the forbearance program and the breadth and how widely spread it is. and i think we also have to throw in there the $600 per week unemployment benefits and the distribution that we talked about. some regions are more heavily affected than others. so i think everything gets in the mix, jimmy jamie. it's not just one dimension. and i think what we've learned is that we sort of can use the historical forbearance experience as sort of as a range of possible outcome. but we actually are digging heavily, heavily into developing a much more refined view of a forbearance-specific programs, such as the one we're facing right now. and we may never use it again, but at least we're in the process of readjusting our development claims model called armor that we have internally. so we're it's still very much developing, and we're learning on the fly.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. two things i'll add quickly to that. as mark mentioned, the historically forbearance delinquencies, most of them cure. i mean and we made comment that the 2% kind of claim rate, so that's obviously a very positive sign, but that's, again, more localized, and it's a short-term issue. so i mean understandable that these delinquencies, most of them would cure. so that would be one extreme, that would be a very good result in this situation. maybe a little counter to that, as you may know, many of the claims or the mortgages or loans and forbearance, up to 40% were actually still current up until recently. so in the early days of the second quarter, many loans had accessed the forbearance programs but remained current and made their mortgage payments. the data now suggests that, that percentage has come down. so the reality is now we'll get a few more loans that have turned delinquent that were historically current or had been current in forbearance but now have turned delinquent. so that's a bit of a data point that we're monitoring, but that kind of gives us a bit of not necessarily concerned, but we have to understand better so that we can refine our estimates as we move forward because the 2% ultimate claim rate may not be achievable or probably won't be what we end up with in this current situation.

i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, mr. marc grandisson and mr. francois morin. sirs, you may begin.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, liz. good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. on a reported basis, arch had an acceptable quarter despite covid-19-related economic disruptions. our operating results were good from the underlying accident year ex-cat combined ratio perspective as each segment that benefited from the recent rate improvements. all three segments are poised to see the opportunities to grow based on the underwriting returns outlook. consequently, this quarter, rate improvements continue to enable us to expand our writings in our property casualty units as we increasingly achieve acceptable risk-adjusted returns. we know from experience that this environment is an appropriate time to raise additional capital so that we can more significantly take advantage of this hardening p&c market. as we have discussed in previous earnings calls, we continuously rank order our capital allocation opportunities among and within the units. and today, p&c insurance and reinsurance prospects have moved up the scale, even as mi returns improved at the same time. to be sure, we are experiencing unprecedented times across our world and the insurance industry. there is still much uncertainty from the pandemic and its ultimate impact. the p&c industry faces emerging claims trends, the possibility of long-lasting lower investment returns and a strain from on-model cat losses and chronic underpricing from the soft market years. this new reality points to the need for further premium rate increases for the foreseeable future. while not all lines are fully attractive on an absolute basis, the positive momentum is evident and has accelerated through the second quarter.
turning to our operating segments. i'd like to begin with the mortgage insurance segment. reported delinquencies were 5.1% at june 30, 2020, and came in better than our expectation last quarter, which was at the early onset of the covid-19 pandemic. as you may recall from our call last quarter, given the uncertainty surrounding covid-19, we were forecasting more pressure on the housing market and a more pessimistic view of the economy that is than is indicated by the latest delinquency data. as we stand today, we believe that the u.s. mi industry has been benefiting from a combination of solid credit quality of the post-2008 crisis originations; two, favorable supply and demand imbalance in housing inventory as well as; three, strong and swift government intervention to help homeowners. as a result, we're seeing better-than-expected delinquency rates emerging this quarter even as rates are at elevated levels, reflecting the recessionary environment. our current incurred loss view equates to a claim rate slightly above 5% on newly reported delinquencies. while this claim rate is significantly higher than what we have seen from claim rates on the previous hurricane forbearance programs, it is also significantly lower than what the industry experienced in the gfc and reflects the better underlying conditions i mentioned earlier. because of the current economic conditions, the credit quality of our new insurance written business, as measured by average fico scores and loan to value, is stronger than a year ago. mortgage lenders have tightened underwriting standards and a higher quality of loans originated is a direct benefit to us. we saw record mortgage originations fueled by the historically low mortgage rate, and that has created surges in both refinancing and purchase activity.
this favorable financing environment is supporting home prices. we see prices rising around 5% on an annual basis across the u.s. despite the weakened economy, we estimate that the mark-to-market homeowners' equity and the vast majority of our policies is in excess of 10%. the level of equity, as a reminder, has proven to be a strong indicator of a borrower's propensity to default, i.e., the higher the equity, the less likely a default will happen and turn into a claim. turning now to our p&c businesses. first, let's talk about covid-19, which is affecting many lines at the same time and developing much more slowly than a natural catastrophe. adding to the uncertainty is the fact that many coverage issues have yet to be resolved, all of this informed how we approached our reserving for covid-19 within our p&c segment based on a bottom-up approach to develop our view of ultimate losses. francois will cover this in more detail in a few minutes.
moving on to the p&c business environment, starting with insurance. we see a growing number of opportunities as net premium written grew 7% in the quarter for the unit despite the fact that our travel premiums decreased materially due to the pandemic. excluding travel, our insurance npw growth would have been approximately 17%. most of our growth was generated in the e&s casualty, e&s property, professional lines and the specialty lines written out of london. about 2/3 of that increase came from exposure growth and the balance from rate. our overall insurance renewal rate change was plus 8.5%, up significantly from plus 5.5% in the first quarter. earned premium that we wrote at higher rate levels over the last several quarters helped lower our quarterly accident year combined ratio ex-cat to 96.1% from 99.4% for the same quarter in 2019. in summary, our insurance group's main mission right now is to grow in those lines where conditions improve enough to allow for an appropriate risk-adjusted return, and the market is allowing this ever more.
over to the reinsurance segment now. we had very strong premiums growth at plus 50%, reflecting ongoing dislocations and improvements in the marketplace. growth opportunities presented themselves across a vast majority of our business lines. property cat npw was up 153%, other properties was up 70%, and casualty was up 35%. partially offsetting this growth were declines in our motor quota share net premium written due to the impacts of covid-19 exposure decreases. generally, our reinsurance segment is able to seize on opportunities earlier than our insurance segment. we're also incrementally increasing our capital allocation to our property cat sector. however, our pml usage is still substantially below what we could deploy if return expectations were to get to the levels we saw in 2006. our reinsurance accident quarter combined ratio ex-cat improved to 87.5% from 92.2% over the same period in 2019. this partly reflects our opportunistic underwriting strategy and capital allocation over the last two years, but also is a reflection of the benign attritional loss experience relative to the prior year's quarter. to summarize for our p&c operations, after several years of cycle managing our portfolio, we are well positioned to deploy more capital at attractive returns. with respect to our investment returns, our outlook remains cautious as we believe the economic recovery could be slow and take several quarters to develop. accordingly, underwriting performance should be the driver of earnings for the industry in the near term, which we believe should help sustain the momentum of increasing premium rates. from a capital standpoint, we are in a strong position, and we have room to grow with our clients after many years of playing defense. in other words, our core principle, again, of active cycle management, exercised by our team, has positioned us to move much more aggressively into a growing number of improving lines. last but not least, we want our shareholders to know that our employees' hard work and our clients strong relationships over the last three months were critical in getting us through these tough times. and for that, a huge thanks to all of them.
with that, francois will take you through the financials.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, mark, and good morning to all. we, at arch, hope that you are in good health. on to the second quarter results. as a reminder and consistent with prior practice, the following comments are on a core basis, which corresponds to arch's financial results, excluding the other segment, i.e. the operations of watford holdings ltd. in our filings, the term consolidated includes watford. after-tax operating income for the quarter was $16.6 million, which translates to an annualized 0.6% operating return on average common equity and $0.04 per share. book value per share increased to $27.62 at june 30, up 5.8% from last quarter and 12.1% from one year ago. the increase in the quarter was fueled by the strong recovery in the capital markets.
outside of the losses related to the covid-19 pandemic, our underwriting groups continued on their path of solid growth and improving results as we benefited from the generally improving property casualty markets. losses from 2020 catastrophic events in the quarter, including covid-19, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums, stood at $207.2 million or 13.5 combined ratio points compared to 0.5 combined ratio points in the second quarter of 2019. the losses impacted both our insurance and reinsurance segments and include $173.1 million from the covid-19 pandemic as well as $34.1 million for other catastrophic events, including losses related to civil unrest claims across the u.s. the losses we recorded in the quarter for covid-19 across our p&c operations were split 45% insurance and 55% reinsurance. these loss estimates incorporate additional information that became available during the quarter and represent our current assessment and best estimate of the ultimate losses for occurrences through june 30, based on policy terms and conditions, including limits, sublimits and deductibles.
we are confident that the approach we took to develop these estimates is conservative and are comfortable with our estimates as they currently stand, but needless to say, we continue to monitor the pandemic in its effects as they play out, and we will adjust our estimates as necessary in the coming quarters. as of june 30, the vast majority of our covid-19 claims are yet to be settled or paid, as approximately 90% of the incurred loss amount has been recorded as ibnr, incurred but not reported reserves, or as additional case reserves within our insurance and reinsurance segments. in the insurance segment, the loss reserves we recorded this quarter for the pandemic were primarily attributable to exposures in our north american unit across the national accounts, programs and travel lines of business. in the reinsurance segment, the majority of the losses came from the property catastrophe, accident and health and trade credit lines of business.
as regards the potential impact of covid-19 on our mortgage segment, it is important to mention that our estimates for our u.s. primary mortgage insurance book are based only on reported delinquencies as of june 30, 2020, as mandated by gaap. as we discussed on the last call, our expectation at the end of the first quarter was for the delinquency rate to progressively increase throughout the remainder of the year, with a resulting expectation that underwriting income for the overall segment would be minimal for the remainder of 2020. while we did see such an increase in reported delinquencies in the second quarter, the current delinquency rate of 5.14% is approximately 30% to 40% lower than what we expected it would be when we developed our forecast at the end of the first quarter. while that is a positive sign for the ultimate performance of the book, we are also aware that many uncertainties remain, including the rate of conversion from delinquency to cure or claim, which we expect to be different than under more normal conditions.
in addition, it is extremely difficult to predict how reported delinquencies and forbearance, which represent approximately 2/3 of total current delinquencies, will behave over time given the lack of historical data that is directly applicable to the current economic reality, which includes elevated unemployment rates, historically low interest rates, solid home price levels and unprecedented government intervention. as we look toward the remainder of 2020 for our u.s. mi business, in light of the developments we have observed during the second quarter, our current expectation is that pre-tax underwriting income for the remainder of 2020 for the entire mortgage segment will remain positive, with a combined ratio in the 70% to 80% range, slightly better than the result we reported this quarter.
in summary, while we are still faced with significant economic uncertainty, our expectations for the mortgage segment are definitely more positive than what we thought only a few weeks back. in the insurance segment, net written premium grew 7.1% over the same quarter one year ago, a strong result given the material impact covid-19 has had on some of our businesses, such as our travel and accident unit. as mark said, if we exclude this line, the year-over-year growth in net written premium would have been 16.9%. the insurance segment's accident quarter combined ratio excluding cat's was 96.1%, lower by 330 basis points from the same period one year ago. approximately 90 basis points of the difference is due to our lower expense ratio, primarily from the growth in the premium base from one year ago and reduced levels of travel and entertainment expenses this quarter. the lower ex-cat accident quarter loss ratio primarily reflects the benefits of rate increases achieved over the last 12 months. prior period net loss reserve development, net of related adjustments, was favorable at $2.1 million, generally consistent with the level recorded in the second quarter of 2019. as for our reinsurance operations, we had strong growth of 50.3% in net written premiums on a year-over-year basis, which was observed across most of our lines and includes a combination of new business opportunities, rate increases and the integration of the barbican reinsurance business.
the segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, stood at 87.5% compared to 92.2% on the same basis one year ago, a 470 basis point reduction. the year-over-year movement is primarily driven by a more normal level of large attritional losses compared to a year ago, which explains approximately 330 basis points of the difference and the impact of the nonrenewal of a large transaction from a year ago, which contributed approximately 50 basis points. most of the remaining difference is explained by operating expense ratio improvements resulting from the growth in earned premium. favorable prior period net loss reserve development, net of related adjustments, was strong at $28.9 million or six combined ratio points compared to 3.1 combined ratio points in the second quarter of 2019. the benefit was mostly in short-tail lines. the mortgage segment's combined ratio was 80.9%, reflecting the increased level of reported delinquencies in the quarter, as mentioned earlier.
the loss ratio in the quarter is based on an assumed claim rate of on newly reported delinquencies for our u.s. mi book of slightly above 5%, combined with an average expected future claim value for severity, that is approximately 50% higher than claims we settled and paid in the quarter. this difference is explained by the fact that the distribution of the newly reported delinquencies carry a higher average outstanding loan balance as a higher proportion is for mortgages from the more recent origination years and from states that have higher loan values, such as california, florida and new york. the expense ratio was lower by 100 basis points over the same quarter one year ago, reflecting lower operating costs, including reduced levels of travel and entertainment expenses. prior period net loss reserve development was minimal this quarter at $0.2 million favorable.
total investment return for the quarter was positive 372 basis points on a u.s. dollar basis, as the strong recovery in the capital markets produced healthy returns across our entire portfolio. the duration of our investment portfolio remained basically unchanged from the prior quarter at 3.18 years. the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income resulted in a benefit of 0.9% in the quarter, reflecting a change in the full year estimated tax rate, the geographic mix of our pre-tax income and 110 basis point expense from discrete tax items in the quarter. as always, the effective tax rate could vary depending on the level and location of income or loss and varying tax rates in each jurisdiction. we currently estimate the full year tax rate to be in the 9% to 12% range for 2020. turning briefly to risk management.
our natural cat pml on a net basis increased to $832 million as of july 1, which had approximately 8% of tangible common equity, remains well below our internal limits at the single event 1-in-250-year return level. the growth in the pml this quarter is attributable to both e&s property within our insurance segment and property lines within the reinsurance segment, reflecting our ability to deploy more capacity to opportunities that safely exceeded our return thresholds, some of which were slightly tempered by additional reinsurance purchases. as you know, we issued $1 billion of 30-year senior notes at the end of the second quarter, enhancing our capital base and furthering our objective of maintaining a strong and liquid balance sheet. our debt plus preferred leverage ratio of 23.8% remains within a reasonable range.
as discussed on the prior call, we paused our share repurchase activity since the start of the pandemic, and we do not expect to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2020. at usmi, our capital position remains strong with our pmiers sufficiency ratio at 161% at the end of june, which reflects the coverage afforded by our bellemeade mortgage insurance-linked notes. in late june, we were able to obtain $528 million of coverage on our in-force book for the second half of 2019. our ability to execute this transaction highlights the credit quality of our in-force book and further protects our balance sheet should an extreme tail event materialize. the bellemeade structures provide approximately $3.1 billion of aggregate reinsurance coverage at june 30, 2020.
with these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo. your line is now open.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi, thank you. good morning.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
good morning.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
my first question is on the capital allocation. so, marc, you laid out five pillars. i just want to confirm, i guess, based on how you were talking, it sounds like share repurchase is last kind of on the chain right now and i guess -- because it seems like you have such good growth opportunities that you could put your capital to use, just basically to incrementally add to your insurance and reinsurance writings. am i understanding that correct?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
so yeah. i didn't mean to put them in ranking order. i think that they are probably all fairly equally attractive at this point in time. i think that we are investigating, as you know, on a quarterly basis as to what the opportunities are in various lines of business. i didn't mean to name stock repurchase as the last one of the rank ordering mechanism. i think that is also part and parcel of the discussion. i think that, for the first time in a while, i would argue that the five players actually are, you know, actively making the point for receiving ball, the ball and play -- be part of the game. so i would definitely say that. and we're evaluating, but certainly, our game, number one -- focus number one is to allocate capital to the underwriting units if the returns are there. and that certainly is a -- relatively easier place to deploy, an easier way to see it at this point in time. but everything is up, every -- everybody's playing on the field, on the court, so.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then my second question. your insurance underlying margin 94% in the quarter. arch had targeted to get to kind of a mid-90s, yet, you guys are kind of there, but there is more, you mentioned a lot of rate, i think, 11% that you're getting in your book of business, which you haven't earned that in yet. so as we think about the earning end the rate you're getting today, plus what seems like incremental rate you could get into 2021, do you have any target for that business? or is there a way that we can think about the margin profile there, especially since you've kind of hit that target that you laid out?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so let me go back to 95 combine, which i mentioned, i think, three years ago now. i think it was meant to be there as an aspirational target and to shoot for, at that point in time, based on the mix of business and the opportunities that we had in our marketplace. i think this has changed, right. i think now that we are obviously going in that direction very nicely and the market is certainly helping us, i think we still look very heavily into line by line and roe by line of business. and i would argue, elyse, that some lines of business would need less than a 95 combine and some might be still ok at above 95. but certainly, what i would tell you is, the combined ratio was aspirational. we have to keep in mind that there's still -- covid-19 is still ongoing. and second, the interest rates have also been decreased -- have decreased significantly since three years ago. so rate increase might be needed beyond the combine ratio just to make the returns equivalent to what they should be or would have been at a 95 historically. so it's really an ongoing process of reflecting current investment yield. so there are no targets on the combined ratio. but certainly targets on a return basis. and i would argue with the 140 bps to 150 bps decrease in interest rate that the combined ratio would, presumably, mathematically need to go down to make an equivalent return.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and my last question, you mentioned taking a cautious approach to reserving within your mortgage book. and then i think you also laid out the default rate to get to 5% to 5.5% by the end of the year. and so i'm just trying to understand like, as the default rate, i guess recognition is -- it will go up a little bit from where it sits today. and i'm assuming that you'll continue with the same conservative approach that we saw in the third quarter. so how should we think about kind of the combined ratio, you've been giving some metrics for how that business could trend, and you've obviously come in better than expected in the second and the third quarter. do you have an expectation for how that could ultimately trend into q4? i'm not sure if you want to provide initial color on 2021.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, i'll take that, elyse. i mean, just to be pretty clear, as you guys all know, i'll take the blame. i did a pretty poor job of forecasting combined ratios or delinquency rates over the last two calls. so i think we're trying to minimize those kind of bad forecasts. but listen, as we know, there is a lot of uncertainty out there. yes, we're extremely pleased that the delinquency rates have come down, right. we had talked about even just last quarter, we had said like somewhere around 8% by the end of the year, it doesn't look like we're gonna -- it's going to be as bad as that based on what we know today. still few months to go, but definitely saw some encouraging signs this quarter. so that's all well and good. does it translate to -- what kind of combined ratio does it translate to, i mean, it's hard to know, because again, what we're facing is really we just don't know how long this pandemic is going to last. and, the fact that the forbearance programs are, at this point, scheduled to end, but who knows if they get extended or not and how do people convert from forbearance to a regular delinquency, there's a lot of unknowns at this point that we feel are extremely hard to predict and estimate. so listen, we're taking it one quarter at a time. we're happy with where things are at right now. again, it's reassuring. but we're not -- as i said, the game's far from over. and who knows, maybe, hopefully, even my 5% to 5.5% forecast or expectation for delinquency ends up being a bit high. but we'll find out in a few months, and we'll reassess at that point.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay, thank you very much. i appreciate all the color.

our next question comes from jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. first, i just had a question on how you're thinking about pricing, reinsurance pricing as a buyer of reinsurance and how should we think about sort of overall exposure, especially to cat as you're entering 2021? are you giving better pricing? are you going to hold more exposure or may be should we assume that you'll keep your retention sort of similar and be a buyer of record regardless of prices?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
the short answer is we don't know yet, right. i think we'll have to see what the 1-1 brings to our reinsurance folks on the inward side and certainly on our e&s property. we'll have to evaluate and assess what kind of exposure and what kind of margins we're getting there. and then look back and say, ok, now what is the, -- because buying reinsurance, as you know, is like raising -- it's like using capital, it's like we have to pay for that. so we're going to go through a very straightforward analysis of capital usage and what we pay for it. and we take a very, very, first economic view of the whole world and specifically as it relates to the insurance exposure we take on a property cat exposure specifically, but i think, said all this, we are also -- balancing it or adding to that information process is that we also are careful and not overstretching the capital. so we'll always be buying reinsurance to some extent. the question is what level and how much and at what price. but clearly, we are -- we like stability, and we're always trading stability for sometimes lesser margin. and that's going to be part of the mix. but clearly, both markets, where we can be on the advantage -- we can gain both sides, can actually get rate increases on the insurance side, find a way to buy reinsurance in a good way. and on the assumed basis, we actually are benefiting from the improvement in the market there as well. so it's really a holistic view of the cat exposure. too early to tell what exactly is going to transpire, but everything is always up for discussion.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and then on what watford, you raised the price, there's pressure on you to raise it again. and at what point does the deal become sort of uneconomic and or are you already there? or any comments on how you're thinking about that situation?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean, we didn't raise our price. we did not raise the price, right. we have an agreement. we have a signed agreement with watford that we're starting the process to get regulatory approvals, etc. but yeah, i mean there's another party that has come in that watford feels they have to look into their potential offer and what it all means to them. but at this point, what's been announced is what is still valid. depending on what they end up deciding, we may choose to do something different. but at this point, we can't really say much more than that.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, thank you.

our next question comes from mike zaremski with credit suisse.
michael zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, thanks. good afternoon. focusing on the reinsurance segment, robust growth. thanks for the commentary, bullish commentary. if we look at the underlying accident year loss ratio, i mean actually expense ratio too, so just a lot of improvement. anything we should be thinking about, anything you want to call out or, a lot of this is just market conditions and operating leverage that you're benefiting from.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so the reinsurance group has grown tremendously to the expense ratio going down or what it did certainly is explained by that in large part. i think in terms of the loss ratio, what i would like -- and we said that in prior calls as well is we tend to look at reinsurance performance on a 12-month to 18-month basis. there's a lot more volatility in that segment, in that sector, there's also a lot of shift in the mix over time. our reinsurance folks do not tend to have a -- they have stable relationships, obviously, but there's a lot of things moving on in terms of seizing the opportunities in the marketplace. so what i would look at the loss ratio is more like. this is -- some quarters is much better than others, and it's really due to the volatility in the reinsurance results, i would say.
michael zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. okay, got it. so the expense ratio, some of that's going to...
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
grow.
michael zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. follow-up on the mortgage side. i think i heard you say earlier that iln pricing kind of had improved a lot. i guess i'm looking at or trying to -- we've been trying to track overall iln pricing and we kind of still see it as double what it was pre-pandemic. but maybe i'm just looking -- maybe arch's pricing is better or maybe i'm just incorrect.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean there's two parts to it, right. there's the structure meaning, in particular, attachment points and then the pricing, right. so this is our third one. our first one of the year, really, we were the first ones out of the gate after the pandemic. the reality of that point is, appetite from the investors was not as good as it was in the past and our attachment point was much higher. second one, attachment point came down with slightly better pricing. and with this new latest one, we're effectively back to the same -- the 2.5% attachment point that we had seen pre-covid. so that's certainly a very good sign. pricing, if you risk-adjust for everything, it's still up, no question. it's not at the same level that it was pre-covid, but it's not double, for sure. so it's much better than that, much lower than that. and quality of the book is better, so how does that get factored in. and so there's a couple other things that it's hard to make it perfectly apples to apples, but directionally, on an absolute basis as well, we're very happy with where things are going.
michael zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. got it. that's helpful. i think you're describing it to be better than what we have thought. okay. and lastly, sticking on mortgage, hopefully, you said you -- the delinquency rate doesn't tick up as much as you thought. but are you -- it's almost november now, are you -- have you seen over the last few weeks delinquency rate tick up?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
so last few weeks has been -- it's been actually keeping in the same general direction that we saw in the third quarter. so it hasn't ticked up, flattish i'd call it. and we got a couple of months to go. we'll see how things play out, but that's kind of what we're seeing.
michael zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
understood. thanks for the color.

our next question comes from josh shanker with bank of america.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah, thank you. two questions. one just understand accounting and the other one is about watford. on the accounting, you had a decline in delinquencies due to cures of 6,000 approximately. but you took up reserves. i know you can't really reserve for a loss that hasn't happened yet, but it looks like your reserving for these new claims at about $12,000, $13,000 per claim compared to a historical average of $4,000 to $5,000 per claim. am i doing the math correctly? and can you explain sort of how you think about that in the books? i think, in the first quarter, you also took up reserves more than typical because you can only take them up when you have claims. can you walk through that a little bit?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no question that we bumped up reserves this quarter on effectively the delinquencies that we saw in the second quarter. so your math is correct. i mean the reserves per delinquency, you did the math right. but what you need to adjust for, i would say, is call it a reserve strengthening exercise that we went through just to reassess where we were, take a hard -- every quarter, we take a hard look, and our view is that might as well not -- be cautious knowing what we know and knowing what we don't know. so, think of about a $45 million adjustment on reserves in the third quarter for effectively q2 delinquencies. so once you adjust for that, i think you get back to claim levels or severity that you would be more in line with what maybe you would have expected.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
so, along those lines, is there a reason to believe that the severity of the losses are going to be different than historical severities. i can understand, these are all frequencies and you can't really take frequencies, and so you get a claim. but is there a reason to be more cautious surrounding severity in this pandemic?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
we don't see it. the only adjustment, obviously, that we're reporting in our supplement in terms of paid severities is lower than what we're seeing from the new delinquencies, right. new delinquencies, we mentioned it last quarter, at about a $65,000 or so per nod. this quarter, it's right around $60,000. so i mean it's certainly higher because it's more recent -- more recent loans that are going delinquent versus the loans we paid on in the quarter. so that's the only adjustment. but in terms of percentage of the insured value or the insurance in force or the risk in force, we don't -- at this point, don't have a reason to think that it's going to be materially different than what it's in the past.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then on watford, we don't know how it's going to turn out. but your own stock trade's around book value, the offers for watford were around 0.8 times book. i'm not sure, maybe you've done some thoughts on whether watford is a better investment at 0.8 times book than arch's at one time book. but if you don't buy in watford, it would suggest that you have a chunk of excess capital that you were already allocating toward financial uses. can we expect that your interest in buying business you already know is attractive, even given the market opportunities here?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
i think we made the point clear by putting our offer up there, and that's pretty much what we'll leave it as, josh. i think we are -- we still think that watford is a good platform, a valuable platform. we'll see how things shape out.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
but clearly, arch is more valuable platform than watford. if you're willing to buy in watford stock, shouldn't you be willing to buy in arch stock as well?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
i think the answer is always yes. we're always looking at the possibility of buying our stock and certainly, like i said before, on the five players on the court, i think that the share repurchase is really -- is attractive. as you would expect me to say as the ceo of the company.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
all right. we'll keep watching. thank you.

our next question comes from yaron kinar with goldman sachs.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i do want to start by thanking you for giving a basketball analogy. so i can actually understand what's going on. i was worried you'd give a hockey analogy. my first question goes to the slight increase in covid losses in the quarter. can you maybe talk about what drove that, specifically, i guess, specifically what i want to get at is, do we have anything to do with the fca court case over in the u.k. and how you're thinking about your overseas business interruption exposures?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean it's really in two parts. i think on the insurance side, it's very much -- it's all basically related to our travel book in the u.s. so no connection to the fca ruling. and a little bit, we added in the reinsurance side is around property exposure is mostly out of europe. so it's a little bit of a -- a little bit of a bi angle to it. but that's pretty much it. i mean its, i call it a bit of new information coming in, nothing, -- no material new information that came through that would have caused us to revisit our picks. [speech overlap] and the fca, as we said, we didn't change it. and the ruling, where it stands, we're still very much -- we had fully reserved for it, and there's, again the ruling doesn't change our position on that.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
the rest of the portfolio, yaron, for what it's worth, and we mentioned on a prior call is that we have the vast majority, almost the totality of our policies have the exclusions that would protect us somewhat a deviation. so this is nothing in there to really think about.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. and then my second question. when you talked about the improvement in the accident loss ratio for insurance, you didn't talk about favorable frequency. so is it because you didn't see that or is it because you didn't book that?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
it's a little bit of both actually. we saw some of it, some improvement on the frequency of claims possibly in the second quarter. there was definitely a difference. but if you neutralize for the obvious lines of business, where claims would actually naturally go down for such as travel for instance with a lot less exposure or go up. then if you're neutralize all this, we didn't see a discernible change through the nine months of this year. it's hard to see what the natural rate would be. but we don't see a discernible change in the frequency to speak up. and really, we'd put our reserve back in a loss pick based on long-term trend, -- long-term averages. we're not looking at specifically one quarter at a time and one even actually year at a time, we do get in the mix of multiple years and project out much more on a longer-term expected. so we'll take a little while before we would recognize any significant improvement in frequency of claims if at all.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and then maybe one final very quick one on watford. if the deal does go through, i just want to confirm that the company wouldn't lose the fee income, if watford is consolidated, right?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer

ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
the only question i had was just on nii and thinking about low rate headwinds. looks like you guys have almost 30% of your assets in -- essentially government bonds. looks like your portfolio yield is sub-two. we just heard another bermuda competitors today, say that their new money yield is 2%. it would seem to me given how you're allocated and given your current portfolio yield that there actually wouldn't be that much incremental yield headwind moving forward, actually, arguably, for you to move out of some of the govvies and take some credit risk will actually seem like maybe to expand your portfolio yield. it doesn't sound like that's right, given your commentary. i'm just kind of trying to understand, why is arch continuing to be incrementally exposed to this low rate environment, given the fact that you guys really take it on the chin in terms of where your [indecipherable]?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, we've -- no question, we've been defensive on credit. so yeah, we have a bit more on the treasury side that you're right. i mean, unless rates keep going down, but they seem to have stabilized, i guess, for the time being. our play in the last few quarters has been trying to, as many others, i'm sure have done the same is try to find other opportunities that are more in the alternative space, that provide us still some level of investment income without taking on too much risk. so something we keep looking at, but it's a bit of a challenge. there's not a ton of opportunities out there. we're not -- we're worried a little bit. we're defensive on credit still, and that's something that we look at carefully. don't want to over-source ourselves there either.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
do you do you guys have a new money investment yield you call out handy that you did in the third quarter?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
well, the last call, in the last month, what we've been -- where we've, -- call it, putting our money to work is just about 2%. so that's kind of where the latest information that we get -- that we got from our investment guys.

francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
good morning.
geoffrey dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
first question, and i appreciate the added color around the mi reserving. if we make the adjustment, is the math correct that you changed your incidence assumption up to about 9%?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
close enough, 8% to 9%. yes. yeah. and our view on that is that we feel like the more recent nods are may be prone to a bit more stress. so the fact that these people took a bit longer to go into delinquency may tell us that there may be, again, subject to more stress. but again, time will tell.
geoffrey dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
and is that 9%, is that just an overall number or is it a blend of just, as an example, 6% on forbearance, and 13% on non-forbearance notices? can you delineate between the two or is it just more of a holistic approach?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
it's more of an aggregate approach that we take. yeah, we don't separate the two per -- as cleanly as you're suggesting. [speech overlap]
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
geoff, i want to make sure you understand that. we also do look at prior events, prior cat events, prior program of the sort, so, but its -- as you could appreciate, geoff, it's probably art than science at this point in time.
geoffrey dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
all right. with the new iln, a little confusing in the documentation. it looks like it applies for policies after jan '19. but it looks primarily more recent loans, over the last three, four months, what is it designed to do? is it really for the last quarter or so? or is it part of the design to come underneath 20-1?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's -- the latest, the 20-3 is very much -- i mean, the vast majority is covering june, july, and august. so that's three months of production. there is a little bit of kind of spillage of the 20-2 that, and also some 2019 loans that had kind of been late being processed, whatever. it's just a little bit of a catch up on a few small things, but think of it as really june, july, august production.

our next question comes from meyer shields with kbw.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
thanks. marc, i'm a little confused about something that you said. you were talking about the five capital deployment opportunities, and you said of the investment portfolio, and i guess i would have thought that if you're going to be writing more p&c or mortgage insurance, then the supporting capital will be in the investment portfolio anyway.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so you're saying that we should -- just repeat the question, meyer, please.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
so i'm trying to figure out how capital deployment in the investment portfolio is distinct from capital deployment into either p&c or mortgage.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. okay, now i see what you mean. so the way we look at the underwriting returns is we attribute to the units, the treasury return or the risk-free return. and we try and separate church and state, what we call it internally, we actually credit the float on the insurance on the underwriting pieces at the treasury rate level, and then we allocate the capital for the excess over that to the investment portfolio. so this is how we separate the capital usage between those -- between the underwriting units and the investment unit.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
okay, that makes sense. got it. i'm trying to get a general sense of how you see either profitability in property catastrophe in retro or your view as to whether the vendor catastrophe models are conservative enough based on recent years cat activity and the underlying trends.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a good question, meyer. i think that our position on this, we have no weather scientist upstairs. and we have a lot of the lengthy experience and information to look at. listen, we actually augment and modify the vendor models as we see fit. so the vendor model represents to us a solid starting point from where we can -- this definitely has a lot of science into this one. so we've been historically using them as a starting point and augmenting it and modifying it with our own view of the world. but i would caution everyone by saying that, yeah, we do have a view of [indecipherable] and various exposure around the world, and we also try to factor in shorter-term versus longer-term, possibly modification and what could happen out there. but, you know, it's hard to predict those things. so what we tend to do is to hold ourselves to a higher return for those risks that are inherent in the way we underwrite the business. that also helps explain why we've taken possibly somewhat of a more conservative approach to property cat exposure over the last four, five years as you've seen in our numbers. so i think, it's a year-on-year analysis. but we would look at it and we'll evaluate. i think -- in some of our discussion, we had el nino, el nina and all these various discussions happening all the time. and we're not the largest writer of property cat. but we do have a very solid team looking into this. but i think we make it up -- try to make it up with holding ourselves up to a higher level of returns.

our next question comes from phil stefano with deutsche bank.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank securities -- analyst
yeah. good morning. just one -- most have been asked and answered. one follow-up on the mi piece, and thinking about the increase in the default rate. i guess, in my mind, there are three mechanisms to get there. it's either new defaults are increasing, cures are slowing down, or the denominator policies in force is shrinking. i mean, i'm just curious how you're contemplating which of those levers is contributing to the increase in the default rate. i think it helps us think about. does this come through as losses or premiums or maybe a development as the cures arrive?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
okay. so, phil. let me try and take this. there's a lot of questions -- it's a big question with a lot of parts. so first and foremost, the denominator is not changing a whole lot, right. it's about $1,250 billion [phonetic], that's what it is in terms of policy. the dq rate has decreased this quarter, right. went from 5.1% to 4.7% this quarter. so this is like what's the number of policies, the numerator that are in default, and you divide by a similar number. so it did go down. i think what we're saying in terms of reserving, you reserve for the new notices that you received in the quarter, right. we received 58,000 in the second quarter, we received 20,000 this quarter. and what we're telling you is we take the book or these 20,000 new notices, the cures are the cure, they go away from the overall balance, if you will, that we just mentioned, which is at 4.7%. but the new notices, we reserve for those in the quarter. so we have to reserve, in the quarter, on those that were newly notified. this is what typically you would do in our reserving. what we did in addition to this is, we modified our view of what we should have booked for the second quarter for the new notices in that quarter. so i'm not sure -- i trying to help give you a picture, a bigger picture, hopefully, that helps you understand how the...
phil stefano -- deutsche bank securities -- analyst
that makes sense from the reserving side, but the default rate is loans in default, that population, over policies in force. and if the policies in force isn't changing and the default rate is going up, then presumably there is an expectation that new defaults is going to increase this quarter. and i guess i just wanted to make sure that i was thinking about it correctly, because to get from 4.7% to 5%, 5.5%, there must be an acceleration in new default or cures are slowing down. i don't know. that's kind of the question.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
i mean, listen, it's a big, kind of top-down view. it's hard to know. we can't predict. you don't have the crystal ball on whether cures are going to accelerate or not or slow down and same thing with new notices. again, we're trying to, i think just provide a bit of color that we think, obviously, knock on wood, we're not going to be at 8% delinquency rate by the end of the year. we're certainly well below 5%. does it go back to above 5% by the end of the year, that's what we think could happen. but again, we don't know. so i think if everything stays the same, the odds are probably that it won't be at 5%. but we -- that'...
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
but phil, you're right, you're right on your assessment, that if we go from 4.7% and we tell you it's going to be 5.5% at the end, that we will have to have an increase in nods or less of cure. i'm not sure we have made enough assessment as to which is which. i would argue that we have tended to -- since may, we have tended to -- these last two quarters, we've overstated the amount, the number of new nods that we received. and that probably is what will drive the potential. we just still don't know. francois said that we haven't been as good as we would have liked to be in predicting. so i think the new nods would be more of the place to look at. having said this, phil, you also know that we had two things going on, less new nods and higher cure rate. so that both actually help to manage them, and they help accelerate and actually go -- help explain why we had a projection of about over 10% and earlier in the year too much less right now. they are two moving parts.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank securities -- analyst
yeah, no, understood. i guess, in my mind, this default rate might continue to come down. but i guess that -- the crystal ball is very cloudy at this point. thank you, guys.

brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
okay, good. that's helpful. second question. on the reinsurance space, i'm just curious, your property mix is definitely increasing as a percentage of your overall book. how much of the underlying combined ratio improvement that you're seeing there is actually driven by that mix shift versus just better loss picks?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
well-i don't think we parse out this way. it's still early in the game to see what is going to look like. i would say that, it's probably more mixed at this point in time, because our growth is largely in property other than cat itself. so we have a lot of play in that sector right now. just more and more mix, i would say, brian. yeah.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
yeah. so it's not so much of the rate activity we're seeing, it's the mix shift that's driving it.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
well, the way we are, brian, for all these years is we'll tend to go where the rates are the better ones, so we have a better increase in margin. so that sort of goes hand in hand.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. that makes sense. another one, just quickly on watford. i'm just curious, is it your guys' intentions to significantly increase your ownership in that ultimately? are you going to buy the whole thing in, just because volatility of the investment portfolio, it's kind of just a different strategy?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
well, what we said publicly is that we are certainly talking to other parties to bring into the fold to support us in this vehicle if it moves forward, if we close on the acquisition. so the answer is, we would most likely increase our participation, but not to a 100% and be much less than that. so increase a little bit, but recognize that it's a different model that we -- others would want to participate on with us as well.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. so the net capital outlay for this transaction wouldn't be this big as it could. okay, that makes sense.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
correct. correct.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. and then last question, i am just curious, any updates with respect to the coface investment, where that stands? the regulator is going to ultimately make a decision on this?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think it's in process. we are going through the regular process. it's on track. we're hopeful that we could get something done, potentially in the first quarter or second quarter of next year. it takes a while, as you know, in this covid environment, government and regulators take a little while longer than otherwise. but yeah, it's on track, and they produce, as you know, the results, i believe, earlier this week, or early late last week. so, it's also looking much better for them, which is good for us.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
yep. great. thank you.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer

our next question comes from jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, i just wanted to clarify your comment on not losing the fee income on watford. is that just because of the five years remaining on the contract? so there's a sort of a finite life to it? or was there something else that was behind that comment?
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean, the question was asked if we buy the vehicle, do we still retain the fees. the answer is yes. i mean...
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah, it's an internal validation, but in case it goes to somebody else, then that fee arrangement paid in fact through the length of the [speech overlap]
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
yes, correct.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. and then, does your approach to underwriting overall and how much sort of capacity you have and take on a given change, if you own more of watford versus maybe if it does end up being bought by a third party at a higher offer.
marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
i think that in a third-party environment, jim, i think it's pretty clear that we need to take care of our brethren as well as we could take of ourselves. so our view is always to do the similar underwriting. watford had a different investment profile, which allowed us to do slightly different things. but at a high level, the underwriting is very, very similar. and then i would remind everyone that whatever we do on watford, we take 15% of it on a quota share basis in the back. we also are participating on a capital -- we had like -- we're up to about 13%, i believe in our shareholding. so we collectively own 20% of the underwriting. so we do -- cooking there as well. it's really important to us.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay.

i'm not showing any further questions. i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. marc grandisson for closing remarks.

marc grandisson -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, liz, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call on halloween eve. you're in for a treat. in our results, you can see tangible evidence of the advantages of the arch model. by protecting our capital during the soft market years, we are well positioned as each of our segments leans into improving market conditions. our underwriters are making the most of the hardening property and casualty market, while our mortgage insurance segment is benefiting from record mortgage origination activity this quarter.
this year, for the first time in nearly a decade, we've been able to grow significantly and deploy more capital in our p&c businesses that provide acceptable expected returns. and due to our strong financial position, we have accomplished this while maintaining a strong presence in mi, which continues to deliver meaningful returns.
our ability to continually rebalance capital among our diverse businesses enhances our total underwriting returns. it also should decrease earnings volatility over time. since our inception, we have believed in cycle management, and this strategy brings an added margin of safety to our collective underwriting activity.
allow me to elaborate on our third quarter results by touching on three key themes; one, growth; two, margin improvement; and three, capital allocation. first, let's talk about growth. in this quarter, net written premiums in our p&c units grew 25% in total, 17% in insurance and 38% in reinsurance over the same period a year ago. this growth was driven by rate improvements, but also reflects our ability to increase our participation where clients needed additional capacity. in the insurance segment, we continue to obtain strong rate increases in areas like property, d&o, and casualty. groupwide, our rate increase for the third quarter averaged over 11%, and we believe this trend of increasing rates should continue through 2021.
at arch, we have always followed the simple rule, our participation in the business should follow the direction of premium rates. as rates improve, we write more business. when rates decrease, as they did over the past several years, we write less. this strategy takes courage. you will often appear an outlier to the market. but being intellectually honest, disciplined, and applying our cycle management techniques is what we're all about at arch.
obviously, the p&c market is broad, and all opportunities are not created equal. there are areas such as workers' comp, where premium rates or conditions are not improving to the levels we believe are needed for an adequate return, and in those instances, we manage our appetite accordingly. despite headwinds from the pandemic, our growth in insurance lines like e&s, property, casualty, and professional lines are great examples of our platform's ability to flex into improved underwriting conditions.
our reinsurance unit has been able to lean into this hardening market both earlier and with more vigor than our primary operations. there are two main reasons for this. first, when a market transitions, needed rate increases compound up the insurance supply chain. reinsurance is often a leading indicator of what's to come more broadly. second, reinsurance can provide capacity quicker and in larger amounts, since it can put capital to work through clients' platforms. of course, sheer growth is only one part of the equation of growing returns.
let's turn now to margin improvement. we all know that, mathematically, rate increases in excess of loss trends lead to margin improvement. the marketplace seems to be supporting the momentum of continued rate increases. we are in the early stages of seeing the benefits of rate-on-rate increases in our operating results. simply stated, adding the two parts, growth and margin, will lead to better returns.
many factors are driving today's p&c markets. these include elevated natural cat loss activity in each of the past four years, weakened reserve positions from soft market years, lower investment yield, and a rise in claims inflation. add in a global pandemic that is still ongoing, and it's not surprising that market conditions are changing.
now pivoting to mi. our $33 billion of niw in the u.s. in the quarter was a record for arch. low interest rates are producing huge refinance activity and, unsurprisingly, some churn in our in-force business. however, mi premium rates remain above pre-covid levels and the continued high credit quality of borrowers is generally better than it was pre-pandemic. we continue to face uncertainties such as the economy's health and how the pandemic may ultimately affect individual borrowers. however, we are optimistic that, among other positive factors, recent trends in the u.s. housing market will mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
finally, arch's ability and willingness to allocate and manage capital remains a key competitive advantage. we always think about balancing our capital deployment over five pillars, into the insurance, reinsurance, mi, into our investment portfolio, and lastly, into our stock repurchase. our job is to optimize risk adjusted returns through capital allocation across these pillars. we see managing the five pillars being similar to coaching a basketball team. we're constantly looking at how we can distribute the ball, i.e., our capital, to the right players.
for the past several years, we've been able to feed the big 7'7"" mi guy down low [phonetic] and rely on him to get easy dunks. now as the playing field, i.e., the market changes, we've adjusted our tactics slightly and are increasingly relying on our two hot shooters, reinsurance and insurance. mi will still score its fair share of points, but the p&c players are getting more open three-point looks and layups. in short, our game is becoming more complete and diversified. our ability to adapt to the new conditions is what makes us stronger as a team.
the market dynamics take me back in time. we have talked about paul ingrey's underwriting clock that helps track and measure the phases of the insurance cycle. it's been central to our management philosophy since the beginning and is a helpful reference to understand the underwriting lifecycle and assist us in gouging our risk appetite. i recently asked our underwriting teams where we were on the ingrey clock, and the most common response was around 8 o'clock. if you take a look at the clock in our most recent annual report, you will see that it's a very nice time to be at arch. there's a buzz among our underwriters because we've become the first call for so many of our clients. they know that we have the capacity, the expertise and the desire to serve them.
now, i'll turn the coach's whistle over to francois as he goes into more detail on our quarterly results. and i look forward to responding to your questions afterwards. francois?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, marc. and good morning to all. we at arch hope that you are in good health. on to the third quarter results. as a reminder and consistent with prior practice, the following comments are on a core basis, which corresponds to arch's financial results, excluding the other segment, i.e., the operations of watford holdings limited. in our filings, the term consolidated includes watford.
after-tax operating income for the quarter was $120.3 million, which translates to an annualized 4.2% operating return on average common equity and $0.29 per share. book value per share increased to $28.75 at september 30, up 4.1% from last quarter and 12.2% from one year ago. the increase in the quarter was fueled by the continued strong performance of our investment portfolio and good underwriting results, taking into consideration the elevated catastrophe activity in the quarter and the uncertainty surrounding the current pandemic.
our property casualty teams continued on their path of solid growth and improved performance as we continue to see strong, positive pricing momentum in their markets.
losses from 2020 catastrophic events in the quarter, including covid-19, net of reinsurance recoverables and the reinstatement premiums stood at $203.3 million or 12.5 combined ratio points compared to 5.2 combined ratio points in the third quarter of 2019. the losses impacted both our insurance and reinsurance segments and include $191.4 million from a series of natural catastrophes in the quarter, including hurricanes isaias, laura and sally, the midwestern derecho, california wildfires, and other smaller events, as well as $11.9 million for losses related to the covid-19 pandemic.
the covid-19 losses we recorded in the quarter were small, reflecting additional information that became available during the quarter and represent our current assessment and best estimate of the ultimate losses for occurrences through september 30, based on policy terms and conditions including limits, sub-limits, and deductibles. as of september 30, the vast majority of our covid-19 claims are yet to be settled or paid, with close to 80% of the inception-to-date incurred loss amount recorded as incurred but not reported, i.e., ibnr reserves or as additional case reserves within our insurance and reinsurance segments.
as regards the potential impact covid-19 on our mortgage segment, we note that the delinquency rate at the end of the quarter was 4.69%, down from 5.14% at june 30. our current expectation is that the delinquency rate should be in the 5% to 5.5% range at year-end 2020. while we have seen many positive signs over the last few months that point us to a more favorable view of the ultimate performance of the u.s. mi book, many of the uncertainties we identified on our last call remain. in particular, the potential impact from a second wave of infections, potential lockdowns, and the lack of an additional fiscal stimulus package or risk factors that we continue to monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis. for these reasons and consistent with our corporate reserving philosophy, we believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach in setting loss reserves across our mi book.
in the insurance segment, net written premium grew 17.1% over the same quarter one year ago, a strong result demonstrating our ability to achieve profitable growth in this environment. adjusting for the net written premium decrease observed in our travel, accident, and health unit, the year-over-year growth in net written premium would have been 26.5%. the insurance segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats was 94.1%, lower by 620 basis points from the same period one year ago. approximately 300 basis points of the difference is due to a lower expense ratio, primarily from the growth in the premium base from one year ago and reduced levels of travel and entertainment expenses this quarter.
the lower ex-cat accident quarter loss ratio reflects mix change and the benefits of rate increases achieved over the last 12 months. prior period net loss reserve development, net of related adjustments was favorable at $1.1 million, generally consistent with the level recorded in the third quarter of 2019.
as for our reinsurance operations, we had strong growth of 38.4% in net written premiums on a year-over-year basis, which was observed across most of our lines and includes a combination of new business opportunities, rate increases, and the integration of the barbican reinsurance business. the segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cat stood at 83.1% compared to 92.8% on the same basis one year ago. the year-over-year movement is primarily driven by a more normal level of large attritional losses compared to a year ago and rate change activity over the last 12 months. most of the remaining difference is explained by operating expense ratio improvements, primarily resulting from the growth in earned premium.
favorable prior period net loss reserve development, net of related adjustments, was $40.8 million or 7.4 combined ratio points compared to 4.0 combined ratio points in the third quarter of 2019. the development was mostly in short tail lines.
the mortgage industry had a record-breaking quarter in terms of niw, and we certainly followed suit with this quarter's niw of $32.8 billion, a full 30% higher than our prior high watermark. offsetting this record level production was the high level of refinancing activity across our portfolio with the net result being a slight reduction in our insurance in-force. the combined ratio was 64.2%, reflecting the lower delinquency rate observed during the quarter. the trends we saw in this quarter were favorable relative to last quarter, but the game is far from over. the expense ratio was slightly lower over the same quarter one year ago and prior period net loss reserve development was favorable at $4.5 million this quarter.
total investment return for the quarter was positive 230 basis points on a u.s. dollar basis as the strong recovery in the capital markets produced healthy returns across our entire portfolio. returns on our equity and alternative investments contributed approximately 40% of the total return for the quarter. the duration of our investment portfolio remained basically unchanged from the prior quarter at 3.21 years.
the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 4.8% in the quarter, reflecting a change in the full year estimated tax rate, the geographic mix of our pre-tax income, and a 10-basis point benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. as always, the effective tax rate could vary depending on the level and location of income or loss and varying tax rates in each jurisdiction. we currently estimate the full year tax rate to be in the 8% to 10% range for 2020.
turning briefly to risk management, our natural cat pml on a net basis increased to $918 million as of october 1, which, at approximately 8.4% of tangible common equity, remains well below our internal limits at the single event 1-in-250-year return level. the growth in the pml this quarter is attributable to our e&s property unit within the insurance segment, which increased its writings in an improving marketplace.
on the capital front, the increased interest expense this quarter was mainly the result of the issuance of the $1 billion senior notes we issued in june 2020. so far, we have been able to fund our recent growth with our existing capital base, and our balance sheet remains strong with a debt plus preferred leverage ratio of 23.1% that remains well within the reasonable range.
as for our u.s. mi operations, the mortgage insurance linked notes market has recovered to a great extent from the lows we saw at the onset of the pandemic. earlier this week, we priced our third bellemeade transaction of the year at terms that are getting closer to what we saw in 2019 both in structure and price. our latest transaction will provide 6.5% of in coverage in excess of a 2.5% attachment point both expressed as a percentage of the risk in-force. including this transaction, the bellemeade structures currently provide approximately $3.9 billion of aggregate reinsurance coverage. the fact that this market has recovered as extensively as it has in just over six months with investors more and more comfortable with the exposure they are assuming is quite telling and provides support to our current assessment of the health of the u.s. housing market.
with these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning. my first question is on -- related to your returns on -- marc, i think in the prepared remarks you associated with mortgage business going back to return on capital levels from 2018 and i'm hoping just for all three businesses, insurance, reinsurance and mortgage, can you give us a sense of return profile of the business you are writing today versus what you would have said, if i had asked the same question 12 months ago?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think the -- well, nice talking to you, elyse. i think the high level of 2018 sort of long-term expected return on the mi was roughly in the mid teens. so we are not going back to that level, which is really good place for us to be. on the insurance, i think that we had a bit of a decrease in expected returns even though the combined ratio did not get much better for the industry. but right now, if you factor in all the rate changes and everything we think we're in the double-digit in insurance return. and we think that reinsurance is a little bit in between those two. so we have a really, really different risk return -- risk adjusted return profile in our portfolio. it has improved and largely as a result of the price increase not solely as a result of the investment return, as you know elyse.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah. and then my second question on, i think you alluded to this a little bit in your prepared remarks marc, when you were mentioning on a few issues that would help from the pricing momentum side like persisting from here. a big question that i get is does this momentum persist through 2021 and perhaps beyond? can you obviously, different dynamics in the insurance and reinsurance p&c markets, but can you just give us a sense based on what you know today, do you think that the pricing momentum can persist through 2021 in insurance and also reinsurance?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
we expect it to be the case elyse because of all the factors i mentioned, the social inflation, there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of loss ratio pick for years, specifically 2015 through '19 as we all know. it sort of makes for correcting some of the ongoing pricing, so that's definitely sustainable. we do not have as much protection from the investment returns. so that puts a lot of pressure on the returns for the industry and uncertainty and lack of -- fewer coverage. we also had a fair amount of cat losses in the last three or four years. so there's a lot going on, lot more risk out there. so i think overall collectively as an industry we all collectively think and know and believe that we need to get better rate and better pricing because the risk is not being rewarded accordingly.
as in every hardening market the [indecipherable] column is a piece of string, but i think that there a hardening market does not only last four of five quarters. i think that you have this initial stages of the initial reaction of rate increases. then you get momentum building in the underwriters' mentality, the brokers are sort of accepting as being sort of a new way to deal and do the business. and eventually, that builds upon itself. i would fully expect to be lasting till 2021 and into 2022. this is what we believe at this point in time.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay and one last numbers question. you guys mentioned the pml going up a little bit, but in terms of your cat load, i think in the past arch used to talk to like a $40 million of quarterly cats. obviously, we've seen growth in cat reinsurance, and in other property-related lines like you mentioned. how should we think the about cat load from here?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, no question that we've written a lot more property premium in the last, i want to say, four to six quarters we've really ramped up our property exposures. i mean, there is a lot of -- in different areas as you know, in different lines of business, u.s., international, etc. yeah, so that the cat load, i think on a quarterly basis has definitely gone up from what we were in the old days, thinking about like $40 million a quarter. it's still evolving. but i'd say it's probably more in the $60 million to $70 million range right now.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thanks for the color.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
thanks elyse.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer

our next question comes from mike zaremski with credit suisse.
michael zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, good morning. follow-up on mortgage insurance and a elyse's question -- if you're talking about kind of be encouraged about the downward delinquency rates and assuming the economy progressively improves and you -- i think you mentioned mortgage which can draw returns similar to 2018 levels. so are you saying kind of directionally we should be thinking about a combined ratio that continues to move south to kind of toward 2018 levels or have the capital assumptions changed since then?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, mike, in terms of combined ratio to capital is a different story because it's a bit of a lagging indicator based on the delinquencies we have. but if you look at the combined ratio, yeah, we think that we're turning to go toward more to the run rate that we had in 2018. i would just caveat that there was some prior development, favorable development in 2018. so, we'll probably adjust for that, but certainly the long-term range of 35% to 45% is not something that is out of the realm of real possibility if you look at 2018. and i think depending on what, how the economy recovers, they could be in the lower end of that and if a couple of things still develop in a different direction, it might be on the higher side. but you're right. it should be getting closer to where we were in 2018 in terms of combined ratio.
michael zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
that's helpful. switching gears to the non-mi insurance segments. you've been -- the expense ratio has been better than expected for a number of quarters. i know you guys have called out some items, maybe you can kind of remind us and talk to kind of what you think is kind of cyclical and what's kind of structural in terms of the expense ratio improvements?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, i think this is more structural, i would say, because right now, you have to factor in the fact that our platform grew both sides both in the sense of growing the top line for -- in our organic lines of business and we also have the acquisition in london and really push to be much more relevant, much more bigger in london. so our international operations also gained scale. so if you now look at the overall structure -- the company has laid out in terms of top line and the way the expense is constructed between the unit, i think it's much more of a structural change.
i would say that it's probably 50-50, but the growth is certainly something that's really important in terms of helping that growth. so that could also get presumably a bit better over time, but i would also tell you that the growth in our operating expense on the insurance side has lagged the growth in our top line, which is what we should expect, right, because a lot of the increase is not more work, even though we are writing more business. a lot of the increase in premium is just rate in and of itself. so i think that the company is flexing itself in terms of top line growth and expense deployment very, very nicely. so a bit more structural than i would have told you probably two years ago.
michael zaremski -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from yaron kinar with goldman sachs.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good morning everybody.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
good morning.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i guess my first question revolves around mi. do you have any comments or thoughts around the potential changes fha fees and its potential and for their potential impact on the mi business?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i can -- and it's still early on as the new administration change, there's a couple of things going on all over the place, washington, i'm sure they're very busy right now trying to changing things. we hear the same things that you guys hear about the 25 bps potential price [indecipherable] put in there. and as a reminder for everyone, if you take a step back, the fha was a large market share provider of mi insurance in the years where the pmi, the private mortgage insurers were not in that great of a shape and frankly that was needed to fill the gap and fill the board, if you will, of the need for the homeowners and the mortgage providers. so this has changed. i think that the fha also ultimate role -- core role is to provide mortgage insurance for the ones, those are probably could be perceived a bit more risky for the private sector.
and so, we've done the analysis, which means that if you look at our portfolio around -- high fico, very high quality. most of our, the borrowers that we have on our portfolio, do not really need to consider fha. so from our perspective, we'll react obviously to whatever is out there, but we believe that this -- if it come to fruition at 25 bps rate cut and fha will help in the lower fico and higher ltv borrower, which is really not the ones effecting and the one that we are currently having success with because our pricing is actually better if you compare pricing versus the fha in that sector. our pricing is better and execution is cheaper for the borrower. so we're not losing sleep over that.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then my second question, you previously talked i think about shifting capital deployment from mi more into p&c. i think last call you used more of a basketball analogy that was easier for me to follow than -- but thank you for explaining. but i guess as market conditions kind of your views on market conditions change a bit, it seems like reinsurance may be a little less exciting than maybe a quarter or two -- the outlook was a quarter or two ago and mi maybe a little better than the outlook was a quarter or two ago. does your appetite for capital deployment between the three segments, has that shifted or will it shift into 2021?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
i wouldn't say it shifts in any major way. i think we see all three segments with very good opportunities in front of them and maybe we'd argue somewhere overdue, especially on the p&c side. so we're bullish there. mortgage has always been -- in basketball, a seven foot six guy down low and ready for dunks and that hasn't really changed in our view. so yeah, i mean we got certainly have more visibility into what the ultimate or what the current market conditions are especially in mortgage given what we -- the second half of the year, how things progressed. and that's good. i mean, that's something that we take -- i think it works in our favor. so, but in a big picture, we don't see major changes in how we deploy capital.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
then yaron, one thing i would mention to you that have -- it's always, it's hard for people not to see us being a bermuda, being a property cat writer on the reinsurance side, but i would argue that yes, property cat side is not as good. and you've heard it from other people, and we certainly agree with that. but we're still growing in areas that are non-property cat, right, exposed. so we are seeing a lot of other lines, to be honest, between united [phonetic] are actually better now or the prospects that we own better than they were in 2020. it's just that, if we're not growing necessarily in the one that get the better headline, if you will, from your perspective. but by and large, i think that our prospects is very, very well on the reinsurance side, very much so.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you and thanks for translating hockey into basketball for me.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
you're welcome.

hi, good morning. i had a couple of questions; first, if you could just talk about your sort of comfort level with your bi reserves given the developments in the u.s. seem to be favoring the industry for the most part. so do you feel like you're overly conservative on your reserves and obviously internationally things haven't gone as well? and then i had another one as well.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think we're -- we never would say that we're overly conservative. we want to be prudent and conservative for sure in how we set reserves. i'd say starting again with international which may be has gotten a bit more headlight -- made the headlines a bit more. our position hasn't changed in the uk, again the book we have is a small regional book. we are well protected by reinsurance protection. so we feel that the reserves we have there even after the call it slightly adverse ruling from the courts in the uk were -- aren't going to affect our bottom line. so we're -- no changes from our point of view there.
and in the u.s. for the most part, as you said, all the rulings have kind of been in favor of the industry. couple of places where there is maybe some that didn't go as expected but on those our view is that the policies that were being challenged were manuscript policy, so not the standard iso form that we typically use without necessarily the strong wording around virus exclusions and property damage that trigger coverage. so on both those fronts we got, as we said before, vast majority of our policies well north of 90% across the book that has these -- both of these call it, protection. so we're very confident that our results and our reserves at this point won't develop adversely and we will keep working at it, but it's -- we're in a good spot.
jimmy bhullar -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and i think you said about two-thirds or three-fourths were ibnr as of last quarter. what's that number now?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
two-thirds. it went down a little bit. so we sit roughly from 75 to 67 roughly and it hasn't changed much. and it's -- so and some of that is around -- as you can expect mostly on the reinsurance side, right, where we -- a lot of our reserves are still on the reinsurance side with significant ibnr and acrs on that book.
jimmy bhullar -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and then on buyback, you did a decent amount in -- you've done a lot of this year. so what's driving your sort of action there? is it the stock price? is it -- i'm assuming there is decent opportunity to deploy capital in your businesses given pricing, but what drove the big uptick in buybacks versus what you've done the last few quarters?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yeah, it's certainly more visibility, right? i think that we said that from the start, we -- at the end of the first quarter last year, we said, listen, we're going to take a little bit of a pause, because we need to know where things are going to -- how things are going to play out and mortgage being a major driver in that performance. you've seen the results, so we were a lot more confident where the economy is going, vaccines are rolling out. so there is a lot of things that, yes, will take some time, but as we look forward, i think that gives us a lot more comfort that the worst is behind us and that gives us more clarity on how do we deploy capital. we're still -- in our mind we're fully capable of doing both. we want to grow the book and also buy back shares. there is no reason why they have to be exclusive. we think our growth is still very strong. we expect to keep growing in '21 and across the book. but we also see a good opportunity at the current level of pricing levels for the stock to buy back at this point.
jimmy bhullar -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
you're welcome. so before we go to the next one, i think i have to stop the broadcast. i think i believe we have a breaking news that has hit the wire. so i think we have to go to francois for some commentary that you want to share with us. francois?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, and it's long overdue marc, but just wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to fill everybody on the call on the latest developments with our proposed acquisition of a 29.5% ownership stake in coface, the global trade credit insurer. to confirm what some of you may have seen across the business wire over the last few minutes, if they weren't paying attention to what we were saying, but we closed on this transaction with natixis earlier today, and the reason for the timing is that we have to wait for their markets to close, which they have. so the consideration paid by arch was eur9.95 per share for an aggregate eur453 million in aggregate, including related fees.
in connection with our minority stake in the company arch now has four representatives on the coface board of directors. as we stated before, we continue to view this transaction as an investment and we currently do not intend to increase our ownership position in coface. from a financial reporting perspective, you should all expect us to include our proportionate share of coface's results in our financials, starting next quarter. we intend to report the contribution in a new separate line titled equity method earnings from operating affiliates, which will be included in our definition of operating earnings. this line will also include the contributions from other non-consolidated affiliates such as premia holdings. so that's the breaking news marc.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
thank you francois for the update. and liz, if we can go back to mr. dunn who is waiting in line i believe.
operator
geoff dunn with dowling & partners, your line is now open.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners securities llc -- analyst
thanks, good morning. a couple of questions on the mi; first of all, what was the incidence assumption for the current period provision, as well as the average severity factor this quarter?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. so 9.4% for the new annuities in the quarter and the average reserve for dq was a little bit over 5,000 pretty much in line with the third quarter geoff, because the risk that came in was a little bit less coverage in this quarter. so that would explain the average being a bit lower or bit more in line.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners securities llc -- analyst
okay. and so as you think about '20 or the first part of '21 there to my knowledge, they extended the forbearance period out 15 months. but you can't enter new forbearance activity. so what did you or provision for non-forbearance loans or your incidents assumptions for non-forbearance loans look like in the fourth quarter?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, i don't think we -- we did not, the way we reserve, we sort of trying to make an overall all encompassing assessment and put that in that number. so i think that's what you might have said might have thought in the past. our number could have been a bit higher. so we think that we have enough in the reserving in totality, the factors we've used.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners securities llc -- analyst
okay. but with forbearance options going away, is it fair to assume that that incidence assumption will probably climb in the first half?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. geoff, we might, but we'll have to evaluate when we get there. i think you're right, i mean, you have to till february 28 to actually as for this -- be under the forbearance program. so we'll see how that develops. we had a surge in a couple of weeks of people asking for forbearance that might help again more, we'll have to readjust geoff as we see the end of the quarter. we'll have another month of non-forbearance effective new, not new forbearance, we will have to reevaluate when we get there.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners securities llc -- analyst
okay. and then within the p&l can you talk a little bit about what drove the pretty notable sequential drop in earned premium as well as some of the movement on both the expense lines? was there any reallocation on the expense there?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
specific to any segment or i mean?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
all in mi, right, geoff.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners securities llc -- analyst
all mi; i think premium line was down $50 million sequentially. and then you had some just -- looks like a little bit of an abnormal movement, particularly in the acquisition expense line relative to the third quarter, but just a little bit more volatility than we tend to see.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yeah, the first one, i'd say, a, was a call it an accounting catch up or true up on our australian business, how we -- on the written side. so that -- i'd say that's more of a one-off kind of a blip that we had to adjust for or was actually was present last quarter and wasn't this quarter. so that's how we -- that explains that movement. on the acquisition there is, we entered into a quota share agreement starting last -- at the middle of the year covering our u.s. mi book and that actually gives us a benefit in terms of the acquisition. it's a reduction to the acquisition to the ceding commission. so that that is what is starting to flow through in our numbers.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners securities llc -- analyst
yeah. all right, great. thank you.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
sure. you're welcome.
operator
our next question comes from phil stefano with deutsche bank.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank securities -- analyst
yeah, thanks. just continuing the mi questions i guess. so you had mentioned that roughly two-thirds of the defaults are in forbearance. i was hoping you could give us a flavor for how many people are nearing the end of their forbearance window and how many people in forbearance, does it feel like are current on their mortgages?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. so yeah, the numbers we report to you are, those are in forbearance and delinquent -- have skipped two payments, at least. so we have a few more. as you could appreciate that are in forbearance -- still current. the figure is coming in very, very haphazardly. so it's very -- i wish -- we are constantly asking and plotting for that kind of information. i think that most of the forbearance, that are still there are lower in the year, most of the forbearance that were declared early in april, may, june, the vast majority of them have are cured by now. so it seems to be the pattern of getting to forbearance and sort of staying in their four, five months and then eventually things get back to normalcy. so that's what we would expect it to be the case going forward. yeah, go ahead.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank securities -- analyst
no, no, no, no. so i think the one question that we're trying to get to and i get a lot of questions about as you had mentioned 80% of the delinquencies have at least 10% in equity in the home. and you had talked about the visibility allowing you to repurchase shares, at what point do we get visibility that maybe the mi reserves are a little more redundant and we can start to see a release there? i mean how do we think about what you're looking for in the visibility to adjust that?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
so, from your lips to god's ear i hope you're right that it's going to be redundant. we'll see -- only time will tell for us. i think the way we look at reserve phil is very simple, is just we have to wait till we get the data that we feel confident, that we're going to get there. and as you know, you've seen us do the reserving on mi and p&c for a long time. you tell me when a forbearance program is done and when the unemployment rate goes down to 3 or 4 and the economy picks up again, then i'll have a better sense for what it is. so we hope, but having said all this, i hope that by the summer after the vaccines have been rolled out that we'll have much, much, much better visibility as to what, if any, the reserve needs to be released or is not necessary to pay claims.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank securities -- analyst
understood. okay. and switching gears on the reinsurance business. i appreciate the remarks you made in response to an earlier question, i mean is there any way you can help frame for us what the opportunity is for premium volume? so maybe -- how that one-one's go versus last year or how should we be thinking about the growth potential in 2021?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
i think the growth in 2021 should be more in line, at least with what we've seen last year. i think the opportunities on the reinsurance side -- oh, you have an echo. i think the reinsurance opportunities are still very, very solid, very strong. they're not necessarily, as i mentioned earlier in a traditional property cat arena. but we're definitely, definitely looking at a lot of transactions and a lot of them will have to do with what you would expect a reinsurance company to be providing, which is capital as we get into harder market, right? a lot of people are -- some of our clients are looking for capital, at least looking for validation of their plan going forward and want to make sure that they reunderwrite and rerepurpose their book of business that we're there to help them and we're able in that case to help them get through that transition period.
so the opportunity in reinsurance was great last year and i think it's actually very, very good. again, as we go this year one interesting fact for everyone that one of the key leading indicator to us, to me at least personally based on my history as to what is a leading indicator of the treaty reinsurance conditions are, the facultative industry is still really, really strong and it's typically -- you typically have a hard market or a hardening market for as long as the fact market goes, you'll have a treaty market staying strong well beyond that -- a year, two years beyond that. so we expect that to be yet again a strong leading indicator. and we -- our facultative team is telling us that is a really good market for them at this point in time, which is encouraging.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank securities -- analyst
great, thank you.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure.
operator
our next question comes from meyer shields with kbw.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
great, thanks. so, two questions on the p&c side. first arch's confidence in the pricing cycle has clearly borne itself out. but is it safe to say that maybe this is as good as it gets on the property cat side because there is this level of capital available so that cycle will play out along historical lines?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. all i will tell you meyer is my experience. we do a lot of property cat writing in '01, '02. and if you remember at arch, we were not heavily focused on property cat excel at the time. we were more on the liability side and the market was going down in '04 and well into '05 and we thought we had seen the last of the hard market for a little while and katrina, rita, and wilma happen, and it changed the whole thing. so my question to you is, my answer to you is i don't know, i don't know is the short answer. i think that there is clearly a lot of capital that's again found its way over the last four, five years. and once capital find its way into a niche, it gets sticky. it wants to stay there for a while and will sort of justify itself for a while longer to have been insured.
but i think we're always -- hopefully it doesn't happen but we could be one major event away from changing the perception of risk in that area. and that i think will mean actually probably a much harder market that you would expect meyer because the volatility and the knee-jerk reaction, it would be like an elastic, right, when this happens. i think you'll have a -- you may have a massive excess of capital out of the door and that might create more opportunities for us. i'm not saying it will happen, meyer, but i could see scenario where your premise does that -- does not actually hold true. so there's always a chance.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
okay. no, i just wanted to understand what you're thinking. second, you talked, i think on the insurance segment about market dislocation. and i think maybe the sense out there that, that has been a major factor or was a major factor in 2020 but now most companies are kind of settling down and are comfortable with their books of business. are you still seeing like today that level of market dislocation?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
dislocation is, you're right, there is some real realignment, there's a couple of people going back to the market. this is truly happening, but it's not across the board, and there are still we believe, bad news that needs to come -- find their way through the system that that might make somewhat of a difference as we go forward. but again, if you had a 20% rate increase on one transaction on the insurance side this year and you had -- this is on top of a 10% last year, if you can read on rate on rate perhaps three times, it's not a bad place to be. and plus, i think what we hear meyer for what it's worth, and this is actually not insignificant, we're hearing in terms and conditions finally changing and moving in the right direction so rates will move first and terms and conditions sort of follow right behind them. and we are hearing that this is what's happening in marketplace. so even though we may not have a headline going as high in terms of rate change as much as it was over the last two, three years. i think the underlying conditions in the policies could actually help improve it we beyond the number that we see on that as the headline number.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
okay, understood. thank you so much.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
you're welcome.
operator
our next question comes from brian meredith with ubs.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
hey, thanks. a couple of them for you here. the first one marc or francois, i wonder if you could just confirm, it used to be that your determination on whether you buy back your stock or not is that if you could actually recouped the premium you paid relative to book value over a three-year period; is that still the case and if it is, does that basically mean that you could just continue to be pretty aggressive with your share buyback given where your stock is trading right now?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think that rule of thumb is still is still in place. i mean, obviously it's not a black and white. i mean, there is always factors we consider around deploying whether there is business opportunities and etc. but yeah, we still think in those terms of the buyback. the premium we make and that we want to earn it back over -- no more than three years. and you're right, i mean i think the fact that the price -- that the stock price is not as -- is below that level suggest that maybe we'll be out there buying more stock as we go through the year. we'll assess -- obviously, as we every day, every quarter we will look at what's in front of us, but for the time being, i think we're certainly something we're considering and we probably will do more of.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. and then just on the topic. so just maybe a little bit on uses of capital or cash kind of here going forward the next 12 months. it sounds like you've got $453 million that's going out here. we've got watford that i think is you have to close. is that is all going to be constraining to your ability to actually buy back stock, given you also have -- capital you need to fund your growth in your business and particularly marc just said, in the reinsurance business is going to be very capital kind of generated type transactions?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
no, because we, i mean, we raised $1 billion of capital as you know last summer. we didn't deploy fully until -- it was all part of that kind of one-one. looking ahead, as the one-ones would do. we know these transactions were on the horizon and we have a lot of faith in our ability to generate earnings moving forward on our own. i mean by self funding the growth i think is something that is part of the plan and we don't really have a whole lot of constraints other than that.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
and brian, both these acquisitions, as you mentioned, will actually be accretive and grow book value for us. so they're capital positive for us.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. that makes sense. and then last question, i just now that it's closed, coface, maybe you can give us a little bit of color on what the title insurance market looks like -- in europe kind of return profile. what should we expect here?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
you know it's been about what 20 minutes that we announced this. so you're going to have to give me a couple more quarters. [speech overlap] you know we have it but listen, we got to think it through what we got, we have going to have directors on there are going to be working very close and hand in hand with coface. we're very excited as you know, brian. i think there is more that meets the eye and this one i think strategically it's going to be a very, very valuable thing for us, way beyond just the initial investment. i think i'd say it's a formidable established company across so many countries with so many client contacts. we're really excited about that.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great, thank you.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer

i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, mr. marc grandisson and mr. francois morin. sirs, you may begin.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. overall, we are pleased with the current market conditions and the opportunities available to arch, as we close out 2020 and spring into 2021. one of our fundamental principles is that achieving growth and book value per share above the cost of capital over the long run is the best way to create and sustain shareholder value. we believe we delivered on that front in 2020. our disciplined underwriting and diversified business model enabled arch to grow its year end book value per share by 5.4% over the third quarter and by 14.7% for the last 12 months. we responded to broadly hardening market conditions and as a result, all three of our segments grew their premium writings in the quarter.
in particular, the hardening markets allowed for significant growth within our p&c units, increasing our net premium written for the p&c by 32% for the full year. on the whole for 2020, we achieved an operating profit of $557 million and grew book value to $30.31 per share. now, as most of you know, cycle management is core to who we are. arch leaned strongly into improving markets because history has shown that times like these are when superior risk adjusted returns gradually compound and accelerate book value growth and arch's position to significantly expand as others derisk, rethink their underwriting strategies or even retrench. as we look at the opportunities ahead for arch, i'm reminded of a situation in hockey that is exciting for any fan.
in hockey, you get a one player advantage if the other team takes a penalty. it's called a power play. when that happens a few things need to be kept in mind as you deploy your specialty power play unit to try and improve the odds of scoring. you need to have a clear 5-on-4 strategy. you need to be -- the fact to be savvy enough to not forget to protect your own zone and you need to have a sense of urgency because the clock will tick down and you will soon be back to even strength. these are a few moments that make a difference in a hockey game. the advantageous position we find ourselves in is similar to that hockey power play, where the odds are in our favor. i'm proud of how our team performed last year during the challenges of 2020. now, after spending a good portion of the last several years in a defensive position, we're embracing a more offensive mindset.
here's what that looked like in the fourth quarter. let's begin with our insurance segment. across our worldwide insurance group renewal rate change has increased approximately 12%, up 200 bps from the prior quarter's rate changes. our fourth quarter growth occurred in many lines with d&o, property, energy and marine all exhibiting strong advances. e&s casualty and our alternative markets business also grew in this quarter. we believe that rate momentum in these lines is healthy, and we also see it building in other lines, albeit at a slower pace. increasing margins helped improve our insurance accident year ex-cat loss ratio, which decreased by 4.6 percentage points in the fourth quarter. as you may know, the full effects of increased rate levels can take approximately five quarters to become fully reflected in underwriting margins.
so today, we are earning the higher rates from the past year. in addition, our operating expense ratio has benefited from rising production this past year. we are pleased with the continuing progress achieved by our insurance group in the last two years. turning next to our reinsurance segment; underwriting results were significantly better than the fourth quarter of 2019, despite the impact of $94 million worth of cat losses. while market conditions are not uniformly strong in the reinsurance sector, dislocation from other carriers that are reducing their positions is creating pockets with hardening rates that arch is well-positioned to capitalize on. reinsurance also benefits from the underlying insurance market rate increases through its clients.
for 2020 we grew reinsurance net written premium by 53% with the two main areas of growth being non-cat property and specialty. at the january 2021 renewals, we saw continued rate increases in most areas. however, we agree with the market consensus that property cat pricing moves were more subdued than expected or hoped as capacity for that risk still remain strong. accordingly, we maintain a cautious approach to this business. our mortgage segment delivered good returns in both the fourth quarter and for the entire year despite the economic headwinds. we are confident in the continued earnings strength of this segment and frankly, the uncertainty we were facing during the early stages of covid has been largely mitigated. covid premium rates and the credit quality of the new insurance written improved in 2020 and accordingly the return on capital for our new u.s. mi business is essentially back to 2018 level which was a strong year.
here's why mi has done well this past year; first, housing markets have remained strong despite the difficult economic conditions. second, the government forbearance program achieved largely what it was intended to do, which was to provide financial respite to many homeowners. and third, credit criteria in the mortgage sector tightened in 2020. and as you know, credit quality is a critical factor in determining underwriting profitability. on a side note, just yesterday, the fhfa announced that the forbearance program has been extended an additional three months, which should help further mitigate the risk in our delinquency inventory. the delinquency rate of our portfolio decreased by 50 bps sequentially in the fourth quarter. at year-end, roughly two-thirds of our delinquent loans were in the government sponsored forbearance program.
we currently estimate that 89% of delinquent borrowers in our portfolio at year-end have at least 10% equity in their homes and as we have discussed on prior calls, the amount of equity in a home is a single most important factor in determining mi losses as it plays a significant role in mitigating claim activity. we are cautiously optimistic that delinquencies will continue to cure as vaccines enable the economies to reopen. importantly, record home purchases in the u.s. in 2020 supported a 5% price appreciation nationwide while historically low interest rates accelerated housing and refinance demand. this enabled arch u.s. to report record niw of $38 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, up nearly 60% from the same period in 2019. our outlook for continued growth in 2021 remains positive. turning back to the current phase of the p&c cycle, there are three conditions that we believe will persist and help sustain the improved underwriting environment. one, social inflation and reserving problems are now starting to apply pressure for companies that haven't been prudent enough. two, anemic investment yields require a sharper focus on underwriting profit.
and three, a return to a post-covid world should accelerate economic activity and increase the demand for insurance. each of these conditions will put pressure on results for the industry, our conservative approach to reserving over the past several years means that we are well-positioned to drive results in p&c going forward since we expect our future returns to better reflect current and forward pricing. finally, with better visibility into the overall economic conditions, and with more clarity on the mortgage and p&c prospects, along with our strong capital generation, we see a compelling opportunity to invest in our shares at very attractive returns.
francois will talk to it in a moment. this recent share repurchase is a testament to our capital strategy and designed to enhance shareholder value over the long term. we still have ample resources to deploy toward new growth and feel confident in our team's ability to be creative in order to capitalize on the opportunities before us. this is a time in the game where our cycle management strategy allows us to play offense and deploy capital dynamically to generate above average returns.
and now, i will turn the game commentary over to francois.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, mark, and good morning to all. we at arch hope that you are in good health and that 2021 is off to a good start. on to the fourth quarter results; as a reminder and consistent with prior practice the following comments are on a core basis, which corresponds to arch's financial results excluding the other segment, i.e., the operations of watford holdings limited. in our filings the term consolidated includes watford. after-tax operating income for the quarter was $230.4 million, which translates to an annualized 7.7% operating return on average common equity and $0.56 per share. for the year, our operating return on average common equity stood at 4.8% while the return on average common equity stood at 11.8%.
book value per share increased to $30.31 at december 31, up 5.4% from last quarter and 14.7% from one year ago; again, an excellent result despite the strong headwinds from catastrophe losses this year, which is a testament to the resilience of our operations and our superior diversification strategy. losses from 2020 catastrophic events in the quarter including covid-19 net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums stood at $156.4 million or 9.4 combined ratio points compared to 2.2 combined ratio points in the fourth quarter of 2019. the losses impacted both our insurance and reinsurance segments, primarily as a result of a series of natural catastrophes in the quarter, including hurricane delta and zeta and other smaller events as well as adjustments to our estimates for events that occurred earlier in 2020.
our best estimate of ultimate losses for covid-19 for occurrences through december 31 remained essentially unchanged from prior estimates. as of december 31, the vast majority of our covid-19 claims are yet to be settled or paid with approximately two-thirds of the inception to-date incurred loss amount recorded as incurred, but not reported ibnr reserves or as additional case reserves within our insurance and reinsurance segments. as regards the potential impact of covid-19 on our mortgage segment, as mark alluded to the delinquency rate at the end of the quarter was 4.19%, down from 4.69% at september 30. we are encouraged with the downward trend in delinquency rates over the last few quarters, which continue to come in significantly better than our earlier forecast.
our latest assessment of the situation assumes a progressively improving economy in 2021, which should bode well for the housing sector and the performance of our book as we move forward. in the insurance segment net written premium grew 21.6% over the same quarter one year ago, 29.6% if we exclude the impact of the pandemic on our travel, accident and health unit. the insurance segment's accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats was 93.6%, lower by 800 basis points over the same period one year ago. approximately 360 basis points of the difference is due to our lower expense ratio, primarily from the growth in the premium base from one year ago and continued lower levels of travel and entertainment expenses. the lower ex-cat accident quarter loss ratio reflects the benefits of rate increases achieved over the last 12 months and changes in our mix of business.
prior period net loss reserve development net of related adjustments was favorable at $1.2 million. as for our reinsurance operations, we had strong growth of 44.9% in net written premiums on a year-over-year basis, which was observed across most of our lines and includes a combination of new business opportunities, rate increases and the integration of the barbican reinsurance business. the segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats stood at 82.1% compared to 92.3% on the same basis one year ago. the year-over-year movement is primarily driven by rate change activity over the last 12 months in a more normal level of large attritional losses compared to a year ago. most of the remaining difference is explained by operating expense ratio improvements primarily resulting from the growth in earned premium.
favorable prior period net loss reserve development net of related adjustments was $40.5 million or 6.9 combined ratio points compared to 4.9 combined ratio points in the fourth quarter of 2019. the development was mostly in short tail lines. the mortgage industry had a second consecutive record breaking quarter in terms of mortgage originations, which allowed arch mi to produce $38 billion of niw in the fourth quarter, a full 15.9% higher than our prior high watermark. with refinance activity leveling off from prior peaks we our insurance in-force increase by 2.5% across the mortgage segment. the combined ratio was 45.1% reflecting the lower level of new delinquencies reporting during the quarter. the expense ratio was slightly lower over the same quarter over one year ago and prior period net loss reserve development was favorable at $8.2 million this quarter mostly from our second lien run off portfolios.
improving investor sentiment enabled arch to issue two bellemeade transactions during the fourth quarter at terms that are getting closer to pre-pandemic levels. you will recall that we discussed our 2020-3 transaction on the last call and on the one deal covering our production from june through august of 2020. our latest transaction, bellemeade 2020-4 provides additional protection on mortgages we insured in the second half of 2019 and already covered by our 2020-1 bellemeade transaction by effectively reducing the original retention from 7.5% to 1.85% of the risk in-force. at year end the bellemeade structures provided approximately $4 billion of aggregate reinsurance coverage. total investment return for the quarter was positive 246 basis points on a u.s. dollar basis.
and we ended the year with our investment portfolio producing a 7.77% total return. while our fixed income portfolio generated an excellent return of 188 bps in the quarter, contributions from our equity and alternative investments were also significant and represented approximately 40% of the total return for the quarter. the duration of our investment portfolio decreased modestly to 3.01 years at year end, reflecting our ongoing positioning of the portfolio toward shorter-term maturities. the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 6.8% in the quarter reflecting changes in the full year estimated tax rate, the geographic mix of our pre-tax income and a benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. we currently estimate the full year tax rate to be in the 10% to 12% range for 2021.
turning briefly to risk management, our natural cat pml on a net basis decreased slightly to $860 million as of january 1, which at approximately 7.4% of tangible common equity remains well below our internal limits at the single event 1 in 250-year return level. the decrease in our peak zone pmls this quarter is mostly attributable to our e&s property unit within the insurance segment where we reduced property aggregate in the florida tri-county peak zone and made selective additions to our reinsurance purchases.
our balance sheet remains strong and our debt-to-plus preferred leverage ratio stood at 22.1% at year-end, well within a reasonable range. finally, on the capital front, we repurchased approximately 251,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. it is worth noting that we have since repurchased an additional 2.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of $83.6 million in the first quarter of 2021 under a rule 10b-5 plan that we implemented during this quarter's closed window period. our remaining share purchase authorization currently stands at $833 million.
with these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from phil stefano, deutsche bank.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah, thanks and good morning. so, the idea of rate adequacy is something that's gotten a lot of airtime with people focusing on the second derivative of the pricing move. i was hoping you could just talk about how you see rate adequacy from your perspective. primarily, it's an insurance question, but reinsurance would be appreciated as well. in my mind, it feels like the messaging is that exposure growth will help to carry the baton, i don't know how to put that into a biking analogy. but move to the front from the tailwinds of pricing that we've seen and push forward to the next leg.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yes. it's a good question. i'll try not to steer away from the cycling analogy myself. i think very -- at a very high level, the rates keep on being really, really healthy. 11% is above the loss cost trend, as we mentioned earlier. we started seeing this last year in the first quarter. so we're in the second round, if you will, of round of rate increases. while we had some rate increases last year and those policies that are currently being renewed and whirring in the first quarter, had another set of rate increases. so i think where we are right now, the market is really -- psychologically, the market is in rate increases minded and being careful in the way to deploy capital.
and i think if you look back at where we came out 18, 19 years, where combined ratio was in the way it's been developing and trending for the last six quarters, i think, the story tells itself. the fact that we are indeed getting rate-above-loss cost trend, and that also finds its way into our combined ratio on a quarterly basis. there's more to go. we put our first quarter prime last year. there's another -- the first coat of paint this year. we'd be surprised that we have another coat to paint given over the next several quarters. it remains to be seen how much more it will be. but certainly, anything we have at this point in time is -- helps improving the margins.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. and switching gears a bit to look at mortgage. the incident rate assumptions were high single digits, something like 8%, 9%, as we talked through the second half 2020 results. can you just let us know where about you're looking at booking that now? and maybe weave in some of the -- some additional color commentary around what exactly it means optimizing our mi book as we kind of migrate from the forbearance world to a more traditional operating environment.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
absolutely. i think we have -- first, on the optimizing, we have a very substantial market share in the u.s., and we'll very soon have a very decent one in australia as well. i think it's early to go toward the area where the better returns are. as we -- and we grew a little bit in the last half of 2020. we see the opportunity. the market is coming back to some more normalcy. so i think our game plan will be to -- as we were doing in 2019, as we were heading into 2020, to be -- rely on our best base pricing to make sure we pick the best area of the marketplace to make sure we are enhancing the returns as we go forward. in terms of nods, our roll rate for the new nods this quarter -- if you remember, last quarter, it was 9.4%. this quarter, we booked it for the u.s. mi at 9.1%. so it's slightly better than the last quarter. we did not -- we are sort of out of the predicting business of where it's going to end up at the end of the year in terms of the delinquency rate. but you see it going to 3.86% this quarter, which is way, way, way better than we would have anticipated sitting here a year ago.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. hopefully, a quick follow-up on the mi. is there any clarity on the gse limitations on dividends out of the operating entities? any sense on when this will be lifted?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, great question, phil. there is a moratorium that's in place till the end of june. we are certainly hopeful that the moratorium will expire and not be extended. nothing definitive. there's discussions going on, but the -- certainly, from our side, the hope is that in the second half of the year, we would be able to start dividending some of the capital from our u.s. mi operation.

our next question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, good morning. my first question, on last quarter's call, you guys had alluded to, i believe, your property casualty businesses generating returns in the double digits and mortgage kind of getting back to the 15% level. obviously, some noise in the quarter with cats and some of the investment items -- investment income items you pointed to. but do you guys broadly see your businesses generating returns on -- in the double digits and mortgage kind of around that 15% level?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yes. our view has not changed in terms of expectations of what we've written from what we said last quarter, at least, very much in line.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then on the underlying side, in your prepared remarks, right, you alluded to continuing to get underlying margin improvement. i mean you guys have done a really good job over the past few years of rejiggering the business mix, and we're seeing that come through in both insurance and reinsurance. so would that comment imply that the back three quarters of the year from an underlying basis would be better relative to the q1? was it a year-over-year comment? just directionally, how should we think about the margins in insurance and reinsurance?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yes. it's all relating to the price increase that the market will push through, right, over the next several quarters. but certainly, the earnings that we are seeing currently in the first quarter, right, elyse, some of it was at lower pricing last year. i know in the first half of the year and in the third quarter, and that kept on getting better as we went toward the end of 2020 and into 2021. so we should all, everything else being equal, expect -- and expect the margins to be expanding. and if there is more rate increases, then we should hopefully see this and -- well, nothing will -- we'll see them in the numbers right away. but certainly, the feeling and the momentum is building to get more margin improvements, yes.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
and then in terms of mortgage, right, you guys had pointed to kind of getting back to the 35% to 45% combined ratio, 42%, 44% in the quarter, right? so currently, within that range, based on what you know today and the fact that you mentioned, right, the level of new notices is slowing, would you expect that the combined ratio for that business would continue to trend better during the next three quarters relative to what you reported in the q1?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, a couple of points on that. i think just to clarify the comment that i think i made was the, call it, the 35% to 45% range was meant to be more of a, call it, over the cycle, kind of a steady state, not in a stress environment kind of reasonable combined ratio. do we feel we're kind of in that environment? yes. delinquencies, new notices, marc touched on it. they're back to being roughly 10,000 orders. so that's a good sign. could the combined ratio in the last three quarters of the year be lower than it was in first quarter? it could. we were not -- we don't know. i think some of it would certainly be a function of reserve releases, if there's any. we just -- again, that's -- we'll have more clarity on that once forbearance programs expire or get people come out of that. so i think at a high level, we're -- we -- the range that we put out there is -- we're still very comfortable with. could we beat that or could we come in a bit lower? i guess we'll see when the data shows up. but certainly, yes, it's not inconceivable.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then one last one on the fhfa this morning announced on new refi options for low-income families. could you just help us think about how that could impact your -- the back book within your mortgage insurance portfolio?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yes. i think the -- to me, all the questions about the fha, the fhfa and all the various government policy that could be put out there. i think we're only receiving it and react to it. and what we have at heart is a -- our risk-based pricing is really making sure that we're allocating capital and supporting the policies that meet our threshold, return thresholds. i think that we still believe that the -- even though there are some push to become -- get more affordable housing available to folks, which we're encouraging, there's still a very healthy level of appreciation for the risk in washington. so we're not overly concerned with that. and most of the targeted markets that are toward -- that these policies are geared toward would be the lower fico and most likely the higher ltvs, which is not typically where we are more -- most competitive and most focused on at this point in time. so we're not losing sleep over this, elyse.

our next question comes from jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
i had a couple of questions. first, on the mi business. i think my speaker's on, let me see if i could turn it off. so first on the mi business. can you talk about -- delinquencies, obviously, have improved a little bit, but they're still fairly elevated. and it seems like a lot of this has to do with this government forbearance programs versus actual hardship on the part of the borrower. but if you could just talk about what your view is, and you addressed a little bit of that in your comments about equity and homes and stuff. and then secondly, on your covid-related reserves. i think last quarter, you gave a number that around 70% or so were still in ibnr, and you haven't had much in the way of additional losses recently. so just wondering what the likelihood is that, that number might be overly conservative now given the economy is opening up and the chances of reserve release is related to those.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yes. on the forbearance, clearly, well, i would have a different spin on you than you would have, obviously, on the delinquency rate. at 3.86%, i think, it's a pretty good place to be. we're not still out of the covid, so the potential issues that could develop. now it's looking very, very good, obviously, but we're still not out of it completely. of the 3.86%, right, 2/3 of our delinquencies are actually in the forbearance program. and of those who are in those forbearance programs delinquency, 90% -- 94% of them actually have more than 10% of equity. so yes, there is -- this counts, the delinquency count staying in the inventory. we still have an extension of the forbearance moratorium until the end of june extended to -- for -- potentially could be extended. and that's all with the idea that the gses and sort of the government agencies want the homeowners to get back on their feet. so it's helping. it's maintaining a little bit higher level of uncertainty because the forbearance is still there.
you still don't know 100% how they're going to turn out. but we still have many cures that had -- that occurred out of the forbearances that were put in there back in april or may of last year, right? 2/3 of them or fewer are now back into current being current. so on one hand, yes, it shows as a higher number in terms of delinquency. but when you look at being 2/3 forbearance program, which is very helpful for the homeowners on the heels of a high level of equity, this is, all things considered, a very reasonable place for us to be. and we think it's going to get -- most likely get better throughout the end of the year and go back to way we saw core delinquency, which is at 1.4% or 1.35%, which is more like what we have historically seen, at least, as of late as of the end of 2019. i'll ask francois to answer the covid question.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. and jimmy, on the covid, yes, i mentioned it quickly, i think, we're still at 65% in ibnr and acrs through the end of the quarter. are we redundant? i mean, again, it's early for us to have a view. i mean whether that mean what we accrued on our reserves is going to hold up. i think we're -- again, we're very comfortable that we've got a prudent provision for covid-related claims, but it's going to take a while for everything to settle out. and from that point of view, i would think that a lot of our reserves will probably stay in ibnr for quite some time, and we'll see from there.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, thank you.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yup.
operator
our next question comes from josh shanker with bank of america.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. a quickie and a longer one. the quickie is, so i understand that the expenses are elevated in the first quarter. but first quarter '20 didn't have the same elevated expenses. can you talk about what was exceptional in that quarter? and why maybe, i'm thinking going forward, we should -- how we should think about 1q expenses?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, two things i'd say. one is, i encourage everyone to compare the first quarter 2020 expense ratio and operating expenses compared to the last three quarters of 2020. and there's a quite -- there's a good differential there. so that, i think, is -- that's what i was trying to refer to and recognize that there's -- what we saw in q1 is -- '21, we don't expect is going to reoccur or is going to be the going forward rate. this quarter, a little bit more -- i mean, i don't want to get too much in the weeds, but there's a couple of things that, i think, impacted this quarter's results. one is, call it, short-term bonus-related compensation where we have a process where we accrue bonuses throughout the year and what we think is going to happen and when they get finalized in february, the following year, then there's a true up.
and last year, based on where we were in the first -- certainly the first six to nine months of the year, we slowed down our accruals a little bit because we didn't think that the performance would be there, and it turned out to be actually not as bad as we had thought at the time. so there's -- effectively, this quarter, there's a bit of a catch-up on the, call it, the bonus accrual that came through. so i call that a bit -- a one-off. and second, there's -- on the equity side, there's -- and performance shares that were introduced three years ago. last year was the first time that -- or this year their first time they actually vested. and there's a final calculation that came through this quarter. and while we accrued for it, it's never quite perfect and we do our best. but it's a bit of a catch-up going on this quarter as well here. so i'd say those are the kind of two things i'd point you to. i think it's opex, we manage those. we track them very carefully. and unfortunately, there's a bit of noise from quarter-to-quarter. but as we look forward for the rest of the year, i think, we're very confident that they're going to trend down from the current level.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. great. and that's -- the second question is -- this is the back of the envelope calculation. maybe i'm not exactly right. but it looks to me that you're carrying right now about $20,000 worth of reserves per mortgage default -- mortgage and default. and if i look back before the pandemic, you were like a little bit higher, maybe '21, but kind of your back to the same reserve per notice that you were before the pandemic. when i think about the pool of mortgage and default that you have right now, my thoughts would be that a higher probability of those are going to cure than in run rate conditions when people go into default. am i wrong to think that? do you think that when you think of the pool that the percentage that are going to cure is normal to history? or do you think a higher percent will cure or higher will go into claim given the amount you're carrying for reserves? i guess there's a lot in there, but maybe give us some thoughts.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yes. i think, josh, i think, to that probably a shorter answer than you might expect, actually. the fact is that it's very uncertain, and we took -- we did take -- we believe we've taken conservative, at least prudent numbers to put the reserve because of -- due to the tremendous uncertainty surrounding what was going to happen, however long the forbearance would take place, what would be in place, what would the economy turn around? how long would covid last? and frankly, we're still -- again, like we said to you, josh, we're still not out of the wood. so we have taken -- not only us, i think, as an industry, people have taken a somewhat prudent approach to reserving. you're right.
we should expect, everything else being equal, and forbearance programs in the past have showed us that when you had an 8% ultimate claims rate on a regular delinquency. when you compare to the forbearance through a cat event, for instance, that is -- that would be sort of a 1% to 2% ultimate claims rate, but we decided to be a bit more careful and prudent in establishing reserve. and i would say that we haven't really changed our mind quite yet. i think we've also put a moratorium on our revising our prior reserves, and we'll see where the data takes us for the next several quarters. and i hope that your assumption on the back of the envelope is right. and i hope that we prove to ourselves that it was, yes, indeed, a regular -- a more of a regular forbearance phenomenon in terms of curing than more of a regular dq phenomenon.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
is there a timeline for when that moratorium ends? or is that a subjective item?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
on our reserving, we -- i think -- i actually looked at the cfo, i think, they're pretty difficult. and i think we just have to take several more quarters. i don't think we're quite ready yet for that. i would expect, josh, over the next two, three quarters, it's certainly inflecting a lot quicker than we would have anticipated back in third quarter of 2020. so we're like you seeing things well, at some point, we'll need to be as we are, typically, well, when we have solid data to back it, we'll take action at that point in time. and i'm hoping that it's over the next three to four quarters.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
you're welcome.

our next question comes from john collins with dowling & partners.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
good morning. it's actually geoff dunn. two questions. one, just back on the provision this quarter from mi. can you share the average severity assumption that went along with the 9/1 incidents? i think it was about $54,000 last quarter.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
$4,800.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
what was the total severity factor?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
9.1%? is that the one you're looking at?
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
i'm sorry. so $4,800 was the actual vision and then [indecipherable]
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
have a reserve for annually. yes. yes.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
okay. perfect. and then secondly, francois, you mentioned looking for dividends in the back half of the year from mi. how do you think about the capacity there, given that the surplus levels at both the primaries are down to about $200 million at year-end?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, we've got room. that's for sure. the one thing that is a factor for us, and i'm sure many of the peers is contingency reserves. so there is a -- right? so it's not purely, i'd say, pmis driven. there is an eic constraints around the amount of dividends that we can declare based on contingency reserves and the 10-year time of that. so while -- on the face of it, you might say, ""oh, 190% pmi ratio, there's tons of capacity."" we have some, and we're happy with it. but no question that we'll have to go through a bit more modeling and figure out how much we could move out. and then there's other sources for the -- for those funds. but ballpark, a couple of hundred million, i think, is easily -- assuming we get the approval from both the fhfa, the gses and the right -- the state regulators. and then if we can get more, we'll certainly try and do so.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
so, when you say a couple of hundred million, does that assume that you can convince the regulators to let you release contingencies earlier? or do you think you can bleed surplus down below $100 million at each of the operating companies?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, no, we think, we -- it's -- we would be within -- we wouldn't do anything, any special dividends from the regulators. it'd be very much within what's allowed from the regulatory point of view.
geoff dunn -- dowling & partners -- analyst
okay. alright, thanks.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yup.

our next question comes from brian meredith with ubs.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
hi. a couple of questions here for you. first, marc, i'm just curious, now that watford is going to be -- i guess, you own 40% of it. if you look at kind of the model there, it's a little different in the model you typically deploy in your traditional business. combined ratio is well above 100%. is there any thoughts to maybe changing the strategy there a little bit? or are you going to keep the same one? and then as you book those numbers, are you going to assume those realized gains are kind of going through your operating results?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yes. i'll let the second question to francois. but the first part, brian, is, i think, that, first, we have 40%, so we're not majority, so there's a board of directors. but i do believe that at heart, this is a harder market. this is a good market on the underwriting side. and i think that collectively, we believe that there is an opportunity to maybe focus more the risk or the effort of the capital toward the underwriting as opposed to the investment side of things, but this will have to take place over time, right? we'll have to also talk to our -- to the partners that are currently in watford and see what expectations they have in the return. so this is an ongoing discussion. but at a high level, right, i think, that we should expect watford to become a little bit more strategic from an opportunistic positioning right now at this point in the cycle based on the opportunities that we have right now. i think that the reliance on investment income was probably more in favor back in 2014, 2015.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
and quickly on part two of your question, brian. the -- listen, with the acquisition, it opens up, i call it, a little window for us to take a harder look at accounting policies. and what you mentioned around realized gains is something that we'll look at as well in the -- at closing. i mean we were already looking at it. i mean it's just a matter of -- we got a few documents and agreements that need to get finalized. but we'll be -- we'll make sure we communicate to you exactly how -- if things are going to change, how they're going to impact our financials.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great. and then, marc, my second question is, some of the, i guess, calls we've heard so far from the insurance brokers this quarter, have highlighted the fact that new business has gotten competitive. renewals, companies still try to raise prices, but new business is getting much more competitive. i'm just curious, are you seeing that. and what does that potentially mean for the kind of length and duration of the cycle? are we getting toward the end when that happens?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
no, i don't think so. i think that the -- some comments were made as well, brian, about the e&s market, so they've been vibrant, which is a good sign of not dislocation, but really a renewed or a new underwriting appetite by the main street writers. that's not going away. in new business, it's normal to be expected, right? i think we went through the first year from underwriting, shuffling and readjusting to the new underwriting policy to now, well, let's say, what do we have and what do we want to focus on in terms of new business and maybe seek and grow that. and frankly, all of us here, right, brian, talk about how the good the market is. so i think it probably makes them a little bit more willing to take on those policies. but i think it's a hardening market. i will add that new business could be more competitive, but the rates are not going down. i mean it's not like somebody is coming to undercut, which is really the important factor here. i do believe that the new business, typically -- we were once, way, way, way back when a new player in the marketplace. and i do believe that we had pretty lofty expectation in terms of pricing, we would need to get on that piece of business.
and i'm expecting -- and that's what we're saying. we're not seeing a softening from that positioning from the external world. and frankly, brian, i mean, the existing players are not growing so significantly that it's creating a lot of competition necessary, right? the new business is probably -- probably needs to find a new home with new players. so that's not that surprising. so i wouldn't lose -- i'm not losing sleep over this. hard market does not last forever as you can appreciate. but we're already in the second round of this. i wouldn't be surprised we have another round to go. and even after that, brian, it takes a bit longer for things to get softer yet again to the point of not getting the returns. so we have win our sales for a little while here.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great. and then one just last quick one here. i noticed your construction and national accounts business finally started to grow, again, in the first quarter. is there anything unusual there? or is that something that we should see picking up growth as the economy improves?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
i think a couple of things. i think seeking quality accounts. there's still some shuffling of accounts around. some people are debating what to do, stay with clients. we're able -- we have a very good product offering both on these instances. and this is -- these are two areas actually where -- i referred to in my comments where that didn't seem to be moving a whole lot. and then we're seeing, finally, for the first time and on rates moving in the right direction. as you can appreciate, right, a lot of it is work is comp-driven, but it's still -- we can still see clients working with us as we evidence the lack of interest in investment income, some covid exposure. so i think we're seeing some good traction there and still offering good product. but we have to be careful obviously. we're here of the long haul. this is a franchise positioning for us. it's a little bit of everything. it's a really good story for us, and i'm glad you picked that up, brian.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst

operator
our next question comes from derek han with kbw.
derek han -- kbw -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. so, my first question is, you talked about strong pricing and new accounts driving growth in the property business line within reinsurance. how are you thinking about the loss trends in that line of business, both in reinsurance and insurance?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yes. so, very much with the same way we would the other lines of business, derek, where we would look at the history of the loss cost and modeling out in terms of specifically talking about cat loss specifically. just looking at the cat history of these accounts that are similar. if it's a reinsurance portfolio then it's the experience on the portfolio. and build in some modeling magic, i would call it, based on our own expectations of demand surge or maybe some on-model perspective. and we just price it this way to make sure we have a healthy level of margin. and it's really nothing new from what we've had historically. i think on property, the one beautiful thing about property is the feedback loop is a lot quicker as opposed to a gl portfolio where it may take you four, five, six, 10 years sometimes to really figure out whether you did the right thing and you price your goods at the right level, property allows us to do a lot of repricing.
and right now, our ability to grow in that lines of business is because we're also willing and able to go anywhere on the reinsurance side for that matter in terms of core share or risk access where some of the other players out there could be a little bit more reluctant to go. and just one thing you have to keep in mind when you price for business and property, you can't just take the last data point and say, this is going to be the recurring one. you have to take a small -- a longer-term period with the proper caveat on the margin for safety to price. so i'm trying to give you a 25-year knowledge base in five minutes, i'm not sure i'll be doing that great. but i think, hopefully, it gives you a good flavor for it.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. and -- but the only thing i'd add to that, i think, there's certainly been a lot of press in the last few weeks and months around building materials, costs going through the roof in some areas. so that's certainly something that our underwriters are fully aware of and fully engaged in adjusting their view of price as they trend. and so that's part of the underwriting decision when you're in some parts of the country where cost of materials, whether through shortage or just a lot of significant demand, i think, that is impacting the trends or the pricing that we're trying to get on the product. so i'd say that's maybe a bit more on the insurance side, more direct, but i think it's a bit of a something that is more top of mind currently.
derek han -- kbw -- analyst
that's really helpful. and then i have a quick second question. there was a sequential increase in the mi g&a ratio. was that all incentive comp?
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, there's a couple of things. i mean, sequential, there's always -- q1 is, yes, there's current, but there's also -- and it gets very granular around payroll taxes. and there's other things that we're just -- we pick up more of those expenses in the first quarter, and they do decrease over time throughout the year. so i'd say, yes, for the most part, is -- incentive comp is a big part of it, but there's also a few other things that just enhance that or make it stand out a bit more. but again, from our point of view or your point of view, you should fully expect a return back to a lower level and starting in the second quarter.
derek han -- kbw -- analyst
okay. thank you for all the answers.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yup. you're welcome.

marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
thanks, liz. good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call for the first quarter of 2021. the power of arch's diversified strategy is evident again this quarter as we have strong underlying earnings across our three operating divisions and a 7.8% operating roe despite the cat events. pricing is attractive in almost all of our insurance markets and more than meets our cost of capital thresholds. as a result, we expect the next several quarters to continue to show improved underwriting margins, partially due to the compounding of rate-on-rate increases and the rebalancing of our mix. importantly, the market is showing discipline in maintaining its momentum and the recent cat losses are likely to keep upward pressure on rates.
our three primary areas of focus for 2021 are: one, continuing our growth in the sectors where rates allow for returns that are substantially more than our cost of capital; two, optimize our mi mortgage insurance book as it transitions from forbearance to recovery on its way back to normalcy in the next few quarters, our notices of default are leveling and the quality of recent production is excellent; three, actively managing our investments and capital to enhance our returns over the longer run. the past quarter, p&c premium renewal rates increased across a broader spectrum of lines, including several that did not show movement as recently as the third quarter of 2020.
we also expect to see exposure growth as the economy recovers more fully, which, in turn, should further spur increased revenues and profit. on the mi front, housing has emerged as one of the stronger economic sectors due to a combination of positive house price appreciation with good affordability for homeowners. although mortgage interest rates have increased modestly, they remain low compared to historic levels and continue to fuel strong demand for the purchase market. finally, it's worth noting, and francois will cover in more detail, that there's also some good news on the investment side as yields have increased slightly in 2021. for arch, every 25 basis points increase in yield should've result in about a 50 basis point increase in our return on equity. now let's dive into the businesses a bit more.
turning first to p&c insurance. we are very optimistic about the prospects across our specialty insurance group for 2021. this past quarter, the higher level of premium earned from the post-2019 written period is one of the main reasons why our underlying combined ratio continued to improve. about 2/3 of the improvement was due to lower loss ratios as a result of the impact of rate increases as well as to underwriting actions we have taken over the past several years. the other 1/3 of the improvement was driven by a lower expense ratio. in q1, we observed a plus 11% rate increase on a global basis, solidifying the momentum for improving margins in p&c. we are now in the fifth consecutive quarter of rate increase in excess of loss cost as evidenced by our current underlying combined ratio of 93.3% versus 97.1% in the same quarter last year. adding to the rate improvement already mentioned, we've seen lower claims activity over the last four quarters.
nevertheless, we continue to be prudent by maintaining what we believe to be an appropriate safety margin in our reserving approach. one of our key principles is that we are cautious when recognizing favorable news but react quickly to adverse signs in the data. next, on to our reinsurance segment. we had another quarter of improving profitability fundamentals. our trailing 12-month accident year combined ratio ex cat has improved significantly from a year ago. we again had a meaningful increase in net premium written of 25%. in the first quarter, we estimate that our effective rate change or rate over trend was roughly plus 8%. as with insurance, we expect these rate improvements to continue to be reflected in our underwriting results for the next several quarters. as you can see from our total premium growth in property over the last year, we continue to believe that risk-adjusted returns are more favorable in a non-cat xl property arena.
our reinsurance group incurred $146 million of cat losses in the quarter, which was within our expectations given the type of event and where we have historically positioned our property cat exposures. let me explain a bit more. strategically, we allocate more catastrophe capital toward homeowners and smaller commercial portfolios because we believe, one, they have homogeneous risk characteristics; two, the data used to model their exposure is of better quality; and three, policy language tends to have less variability than with larger commercial exposures. we believe that there is less uncertainty in the expected cat load of homeowners and smaller commercial portfolios. as a consequence of this portfolio construction bias, on a medium-sized storm such as uri, at between $14 billion and $16 billion in losses that affects personal lines more markedly, we would expect our market share to be around 1%.
and last, but certainly not least, mortgage. overall, our mortgage group is very well positioned to produce good earnings as a reinvigorated u.s. housing market is promising in 2021 and beyond. in the first quarter, arch mi u.s. new insurance written was $27 billion, around 60% above the same period last year and new loan originations are tracking toward another very strong year. as you know, last year saw a refinancing boom, which meant significant turnover in our insurance in force. our first quarter annualized persistency was up from the 54% we experienced over the last 12 months as interest rates rose earlier this year. if mortgage rates continue to rise, we would expect persistency to gradually return to the longer-term range of 75%, which will be a net positive as we would hold more of the recent higher credit quality, higher risk-adjusted return portfolio on our books for longer. looking next at our delinquency inventory, we still expect a large portion to cure based on many factors, including the strong equity position of our current dq inventory. 94% of delinquent policies have over 20% of equity. we also had good news in march as the run rate for new notices of default was nearly back to 2019 levels at about 10,000 new annuities per quarter. outside of the u.s., we increased our writings in australia as the housing market remains strong there.
we like the long-term opportunity in australia as demonstrated by our announcement to acquire westpac's lmi business in march. the agreement allows us to free up capital even as we build our australian presence and diversify our earning streams at attractive risk-adjusted returns. to borrow a sports analogy for this quarter, with a nod to our friends at coface, this market feels a little like the last legs of the tour de france. we just went through the muteness section, came out among the leaders and a lot of writers struggle to keep pace. now as we roll toward paris, we can continue to build on our lead while remaining mindful of protecting our position and energy. we can go all out and be reckless at several stages as several stages of the race remain. however, our team is in great shape. we have many great writers working together to ensure we're ultimately smiling in that beautiful yellow jersey on the [indecipherable]. as usual, our focus is on finishing the race with grace and winning for our sponsors, our shareholders.
now i'll turn it over to francois.
francois morin -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, marc, and good morning to all. thanks for joining us today. on to the first quarter results. as a reminder, and consistent with prior practice, the following comments are on a core basis, which corresponds to arch's financial results, excluding the other segment, i.e., the operations of watford holdings limited. in our filings, the term consolidated includes watford. on the transaction, we announced late last year to acquire watford in partnership with warburg pincus and kelso. to use marc's cycling analogy, our team has been peddling hard in anticipation of the closing, and we are down to the last few kilometers before we reach our final destination.
i will provide a bit more color on its status in a few minutes. as you will have seen by now, we had a very solid quarter despite the severe winter storms with after-tax operating income for the quarter of $239.8 million, or $0.59 per share, and an annualized 7.8% operating return on average common equity. book value per share increased to $30.54 at march 31, up 0.8% from last quarter. in the insurance segment, net written premium grew 20% over the same quarter one year ago, 28.4% if we exclude the impact of the pandemic on our travel, accident and health units.
the insurance segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, was 93.3%, lower by 380 basis points from the same period one year ago. the improvement in the ex cat accident quarter loss ratio reflects the benefits of rate increases achieved over the last 12 months and changes in our mix of business. in addition, the expense ratio was lower by approximately 80 basis points since the same quarter one year ago, primarily due to the growth in the premium base. as for our reinsurance operations, we also had strong growth of 25.3% in net written premium over -- on a year-over-year basis, 40.8% if we adjust for an $88 million loss portfolio transfer that was recorded in the first quarter of 2020.
the growth was observed across most of our lines, but especially in our property, other than property catastrophe line, where strong rate increases and a few new accounts helped increase the top line by 84.3%. the segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, stood at 84% compared to 91.3% on the same basis one year ago. once we normalize for the onetime impact of the loss portfolio transfer, the improvement in the ex cat accident year combined ratio was 590 basis points, which is almost entirely attributable to a corresponding improvement in the loss ratio.
the overall expense ratio remained relatively unchanged, again after adjusting for the lpt. losses from 2021 catastrophic events in the quarter, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums stood at $188.3 million, or 10.5 combined ratio points, compared to 7.4 combined ratio points in the first quarter of 2020. these were primarily as a result of the north american winter storms uri and viola in february and consistent with our earnings pre-announcement two weeks ago, close to 80% of the losses came from our reinsurance segment with the rest attributable to the insurance segment. we remain comfortable with our level of loss reserves for covid-19 claims, which remained essentially unchanged from prior estimates. approximately 65% of the inception-to-date incurring loss amount sits within our incurred but not reported ibnr reserves or as additional case reserves within our insurance and reinsurance segments.
the key performance indicators we track to help us assess the ultimate impact of covid-19 on our mortgage segment keep trending in a favorable direction. chief, of course, being the delinquency rate, which came in at 3.86% at the end of the quarter. arch mi had another excellent quarter in terms of production. and with refinance activity leveling off from prior peaks, we saw our insurance inform remain relatively stable with an increase from our international book, offset by a small decrease in our u.s. mi book. the combined ratio for this segment was 42.4%, reflecting the lower level of new delinquencies reported during the quarter. both the loss and expense ratio were slightly lower than the pre-pandemic levels experienced in the same quarter one year ago.
as a reminder, i wanted to remind everyone of the seasonality that exists in the reporting of operating expenses across our underwriting segments, investment expenses and at the corporate level. given all incentive compensation decisions, including share-based awards get approved by our board of directors in february of each year, the first quarter has generally been the quarter with the highest level of operating expenses, and we do expect the current year to follow this pattern. overall, with the underlying improvements in both of our p&c segments, and mortgage segment fundamentals returning to pre-pandemic levels, we are excited by the prospects for each of the three legs of our stool. our objective to deliver a well-balanced return to our shareholders with meaningful contributions from each of our underwriting segments should become more and more apparent as we move forward. i've kept my segment-level comments a bit shorter than usual in order to give a bit more color on the performance of our investment portfolio this quarter and on the new line in our income statement titled, income loss from operating affiliates.
as regards to the investment portfolio, total investment return for the quarter was a negative 18 basis points on a u.s. dollar basis. our defensive positioning with a short duration and limited credit exposure relative to our benchmark helped us withstand headwinds we experienced on the heels of an 80 basis point increase in the 10-year treasury rate during the quarter, which was a main factor in the negative 56 basis point price return on our portfolio during the quarter. net investment income was $78.7 million during the quarter, down 9.3% on a sequential basis. this decrease, while certainly affected by lower available interest rates and higher investment expenses due to incentive compensation payments and investment management fees, is also very much the result of deliberate portfolio actions taken over the last few quarters.
specifically, we continue to maintain a short duration on our portfolio, 2.71 years at the end of the quarter, based on our internal view of the risk and return trade-offs in the fixed income markets. we also continue to deploy additional capital to an alternative investments, the returns from which are generally not reflected in investment income. finally, we also transformed some short-term investments this quarter into our 29.5% equity ownership in coface as well as an investment in corporate-owned life insurance policies. again, both items whose returns are included in operating income, but are not reflected in net investment income. equity and net income of investment funds using the -- accounted for using the equity method, and realized gains from nonfixed income investments returned approximately $154 million during the quarter and were key contributors to the growth in our book value.
now on to income from operating affiliates, which we are including in our definition of operating income. this quarter, in addition to our share of the quarterly results of investments we have made in operating affiliates, being primarily those from premia holdings at this time, we also benefited from an initial nonrecurring gain we made at closing of our acquisition of a 29.5% ownership stake in coface for approximately $74.5 million. consistent with our accounting policy under equity method accounting, we will report our investment in coface on a quarter lag. as regards to watford transaction, shareholder approval was obtained in late march, and we are awaiting a few final regulatory approvals before we can close the transaction, hopefully, over the next few weeks.
as we disclosed earlier, we expect our ownership of watford to increase to 40% at closing. the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 10.6% in the quarter, reflecting changes in the full year estimated tax rate, the geographic mix of our pre-tax income, and a benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. we currently estimate the full year tax rate to be in the 10% to 12% range for 2021. turning briefly to risk management. our natural cat pml on a net basis decreased to $778 million as of april 1, which had approximately 6.7% of tangible common equity remains well below our internal limits at the single event 1-in-250-year return level. our peak zone across the group changed from the florida tri-county area to the northeast, reflecting our view of better opportunities given the current rate environment. our balance sheet remains strong. and our debt plus preferred leverage stood at 22.1% at quarter end, well within the reasonable range. on the capital front, we repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $179.3 million in the first quarter. our remaining share repurchase authorization currently stands at $737.3 million.
with these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
good morning. my first question was on capital. do you guys -- francois, you just said, right, you bought back less than half of your earnings to start this year. and i believe going into the year, you guys thought you had more than enough capital to support your growth -- the growth that you thought you would see. so should we think about a pickup in potentially capital return if that statement is true in the back half of the year? and can you just update us? would you be willing to be active buying back your stock during wind season just given that it seems like you have a good level of excess capital?
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
sure. on the second question, elyse, yes. we're -- while in our early days and i'd say pre-mortgage years, we were somewhat more careful with share buybacks during the wind season. we're not -- we're now, as you know, a lot more diversified. so i think that constraint or that reality is maybe less applicable than it used to be. but yes, certainly, as we think about share repurchases or capital deployment throughout the second half of the year, we certainly think that we could be buying back more shares. i mean our top priority is still to invest in the business and grow the business as best we can. but as you saw this quarter, i mean, we were able to do both and then some and like to think that if things stay where they are or within reason, we'd be doing the same in the second half of the year.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then in terms of your insurance segment, so you guys still seem pretty positive, right? 30% of the growth came from rate increases in the quarter, positive on pricing, a little bit concern of that inflation, which we've heard throughout the industry. so broadly, as you guys are thinking about the pricing environment as well as just what's going on with inflation, do you have a sense of for how long you think pricing should continue to exceed loss trend just broadly across insurance, recognizing, obviously, it's many different lines that comes together?
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
there's a question that will lead all of us, if you get the right answer, to riches, elyse. but i think it's fair to say that the market momentum is clearly there. i think you heard on other calls that, that push for rate and increase in the rate adequacy and getting to a better level is shared among most in the industry. i think there's a recognition between some of the losses that have occurred in the past and cat losses included some uncertainty in such inflation, cyber risk as well as no property cat events. obviously, that have occurred. i think there's a -- and the interest rates being lower, i think there's a recognition that the prices need to go up. i think i will just give you a quick anecdote. some of our folks are doing file audits on the reinsurance side, that is, with some of our clients who are competitors of ours as well. and the common thread or theme that seems to come through the audit is that the underwriting community is recognizing that more needs to be done, and you can see this evidenced in the discussion that they have with brokers. so we're very secure. i think there's going to be quite a bit more runway to this pricing improvement.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
and then one last one on the reinsurance side. it sounds like, francois, from your comments that the deterioration in the quarter was more just kind of one-off. i guess as we think about going forward, my question more is, as we've seen the shift to more longer tail lines within that book, and away from property, would you expect the underlying loss ratio to deteriorate? or was it just that there was just some one-off factors in the quarter, we could still see improvement in that on a go-forward basis?
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
yes. if you're -- in terms of modeling, i think it's going to go up and down, right? and i would say the numbers we quoted in terms of the rolling 12 months is probably as good a -- it's a good starting point. the business mix, yes, there'll be some fluctuations here and there, but -- yes, we wrote more casualty, but we wrote also a lot more other specialty, which is -- maybe combined ratios there a bit better. so it's hard to pinpoint exactly where everything -- i mean, what's going to happen, obviously, in the next few quarters, but i'd steer you to the kind of the rolling 12-month number that i quoted to be -- that should be a good starting point.
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
elyse, if i may add to that point. i mean, also bear in mind at arch, we tend to be prudent in reflecting all the margin improvement early on. so we'll have to wait and see where the data takes us. i just want to make sure we keep that in mind as we go forward.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thanks for the color.
operator
our next question comes from jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning. so first, just had a question on pricing and -- obviously, your comments are pretty positive, but can you sort of compare and contrast what you're seeing on the primary side versus what you're seeing in reinsurance broadly?
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
yes. so on the insurance side, there's a lot more activity, more price pickup on the insurance side. and that's why on a quota share basis, even though the seeding commissions have not decreased as much as they would have otherwise in other hard markets. i think that if you're on a quota share basis, you've essentially taken -- you're participating alongside your clients in terms of rate increases. so whatever rate increase i would have included in my remarks on the insurance, you could ascribe to the quota share reinsurance participation. on the excess of loss, it tends to always lag a little bit behind. there's some benefit from the underlying rate because the excess of loss pricing typically is a percentage of the underlying portfolio. so to the extent that some rate increase, at the primary level, the excess of loss would get presumably a bigger percentage.
but i think that it would be safe to say that the softer markets probably gave a little bit less adequacy or probably more of a need for price pickup in the excess of loss, in general. and we're probably expecting this to start to happen soon. i think there will be some recognition that is sort of a second derivative of typically of a hardening market. i hope that helps.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and are you equally optimistic? or are there signs because you mentioned property cat may be slowing down a little bit? but are you equally optimistic about the sustainability of the trend on pricing in both reinsurance and in insurance?
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
yes, on the excess of loss because, like i said, if i go back to 2002, 2005 market, i think that the excess of loss market got probably a lot better. it took to like 2004 to get there. so you need a couple of years of primary rate increases to start to find its way or their way onto the reinsurance excess pricing. it's a very normal hardening market. so i'm very encouraged, actually.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and then just lastly, you mentioned credit quality on the mi side being strong. how are you -- and obviously, the labor market is very good as well. but how are you thinking about high property prices and just inflated values for homes? and how that factors into your view of the business that you're writing now?
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
if you were in an equilibrium in terms of supply and demand or the supply was plentiful, we'd be worried. that would take us back to the 2006 and '07 period. but the supply and demand on the housing is such that it should help maintain the pricing for quite a while. we have 1.5 million to two million homes missing in the marketplace. it takes a while to find their way to the market. there's also underbuilt, as you know, as we all read in the press. so from our perspective, the house price appreciation is there. we look at over or undervaluation. we also have these metrics from our economist and we're not seeing significant national overvaluations. so that's not another -- yet another -- not a concern. and the interest rates are still pretty low at 3% -- the mortgage rate that is at 3%. so the affordability is still pretty high compared to historical metrics. so all of these put together, it's never one dimension, right? i mean, you look at, i think overall, if you across everything, it tends in a positive direction.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from josh shanker with bank of america.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
so i think i've asked the same question like from the last two conference calls. i'm going to ask it again. i look at the reserve releases in mortgage and i look at the reserves per new case in the 2q '21 numbers and you're reserving more than ever for new defaults or delinquencies as you're releasing the reserves. yet the housing prices are appreciating. i'm trying to figure out what the math is about why the potential claim per loss keeps getting worse?
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
well, you're asking a very good question, josh. i think big picture, as you know, we're still -- there's still a lot that has to happen before we have more visibility until -- in how the forbearance loans are going to pan out, how they're going to -- whether they're going to cure, whether they're going to turn to claim. and as you know, those are -- i mean that's an 18-month process. so we -- if we look at the peak months of april and may of last year, their 18-month period will expire -- unless things change should expire in the fourth quarter this year. so that's when we'll certainly have, again, more visibility and have a more definitive view on how to -- i mean, whether reserves were too high or not. and so that's where we sit on that at this point.
we're reacting a little bit to the data. but again, we still feel there's quite a need -- a lot that needs to be settled before we take, i'd say, action on the current reserve levels. in terms of the new delinquencies, there's always tweaks that happen every quarter. you look at the average -- the incidence rate and how -- severities and frequency assumptions that we put on the new delinquencies that get reported this quarter, again, it's a smaller inventory of new delinquencies. so i wouldn't -- there's a bit more leverage in how those numbers play out. but big picture, i think, we're still very comfortable with our reserve levels. yes, i think you're implying maybe that we got too much. that's a possibility. but again, we'll know more in the second half of the year.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
so when i look at the reserves, i guess, the $55 million in reserves for current accident year period put up in the fourth quarter, is that a strengthening of average claim for the entire portfolio? or is that a new -- we think the new claims being put on 2q '21 have the potential to be worse in terms of severity than the average claim currently on the book?
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
yes. i think it's the latter. we didn't really make any adjustments in terms of prior notices, so notices that were on the books before the quarter started. the thinking on the new notices is that the fact that they became delinquent kind of this late in the game, i'd say, given that forbearance programs have been available for some time over a year, we think that there's a possibility that they could turn out worse than the ones that we got earlier. so there's a bit of a mindset or a philosophy that and time will tell. but given that they might have gone through all their savings and they might have tried a lot of things and now they finally turned delinquent. so that's a little bit of the -- i think the rationale behind these numbers.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you very much for the update.

our next question comes from ryan tunis with autonomous research.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
good afternoon guys. marc, i guess my first question. can you hear me?
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
yes, we can. go ahead.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
sorry about that. so i had a cycle management question in -- with property cat. and i'm not being critical. i'm just curious. so a year ago, it looks like you wrote $118 million of premium. and this year, you wrote $88 million. so you wrote less. i get the property cat is not the best place to be, but it feels like the rate environment was incrementally a little bit better. so i'm just, i guess, a little bit curious like what goes into the decision to, as conditions improve, actually decide that 2q of '21 we don't want to write as much as we did in 2q of '20?
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
it's a really, really good question. so i think a couple of things happen, right? number one, we probably, like everyone else, have a different perception on the riskiness of the cat book, right? there's a -- we just had a wind storm in january. so that will definitely make you take a different look at the non-model losses, right? there's a lot of non-model losses that seem to have percolated way more than we expected over the last 2, three years. so there's an element of loss cost expectancy and also as a result of that needing a higher margin of safety for your return. that's clearly the #1 consideration. and as a second one that is not to be forgotten is also -- it's an allocation of capital.
they're saying, well, where is a better use of capital? is a risk-adjusted of x in cat worth as much as a y in other property, for instance, or in casualty? and those decisions are made on a quarterly basis, i would almost say, almost daily. so as you get a broader range of opportunities, on the reinsurance side specifically, you're able to manage your portfolio and sort of reoptimize the portfolio as you go, at least, maybe in a quarter or two quarters ahead. so that's sort of a thinking beyond the stock management with a view of optimizing your return, not necessarily betting all out, right? i mean that's sort of a one thing that pauline told me way back when is that you don't want to be unlucky. property cat, if you have all these great opportunities and not excluding out of the cat realm, it probably be who is your manager to taper it down a little bit, also provided because it's not as juicy perhaps as the other lines are appearing at this point in time. so it's a bit of a window we think.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
yes, that makes sense. that's interesting. and then i guess just in mortgage insurance, seeing the attritional loss ratio, i mean, yes, pretty much at pre-pandemic levels. i guess i was a little bit surprising just given there are some new notices, and i felt like back in '19, they're almost none. so is this sustainable kind of the 15% to 20% attritional? or is it something this quarter that was an unusual tailwind?
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
well, i mean, attritional excluding pyd, that's how we think about it. again, i think i mentioned it in prior quarters where a 20% loss ratio is kind of plus or minus that should be what you should get over the cycle. and there's a bit of noise with the crt transaction. so i mean, there's moving parts within that. but yes, 20% is absolutely sustainable.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
got it. and then just lastly, just out of curiosity, i was wondering if you guys would be willing to share like an internal view of what your excess capital position is?
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
well, that's not something we've made public in the past. and i think we're -- because it's a daily kind of a moving target, right? i mean there's -- we don't know what the market is going to give us. so we could give you a number, but then next tomorrow will be different. so it's just -- we rather want to keep the flexibility there. and that's...
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
i hear you. i thought i'd try.
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
yes.
operator
our next question comes from meyer shields with kbw.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
two, i think, basic questions. first, i know there's a lot of commentary at arch and elsewhere about if that was like prudent reserves because of current uncertainties with regard to inflation. is that -- let me phrase it differently. are you releasing reserves more slowly now than you would have in the past because of that issue? or is that a current accident year issue?
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
i think, meyer, you're an actuary as i am. so you know that inflation impacts current accident year and prior accident year, right? so clearly, we are -- it's part of the recipe, if you will, of establishing reserves. so we're trying to peg the historical trend, as you know, in a triangle is the best we can to the extent it's not captured within a loss development factors. so i think it's on both sides. does that mean that we are releasing less? i think that probably means that we historically have been a bit more careful in establishing our loss pick. if you look back at our history of combined ratio in the insurance group specifically, you'll see that we were much higher than what most people were in the industry. so i think that tells you that we were reserving at that point with a view of loss inflation that was more in the 3% to 5%. we haven't changed our view really at this point in time, except for like i said in my comments, certain lines where it's probably appropriate to do a bit more.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
okay. no, i think that's the right call and it makes a lot of sense. second question in reinsurance. how should we think about the catastrophe exposure in the non-property cat property book?
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
well, it's part of the $676 million that francois mentioned. we're accounting for that, but it's definitely less of a cat exposure. there is some in there, but it's definitely not the driver of the exposure at all. so it depends on what kind of business you look at. the cat load on these premium is anywhere from 5% to 10%, sometimes a bit higher, depending on the quota share you're writing. but in a lot of our other specialty quota share, you had some but again, much, much smaller. so i would say that still the larger contributor to our pml is through the cat xl portfolio.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
thank you so much.
operator
our next question comes from phil stefano with deutsche bank.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. one or two focused on the mi business. so of the $44 million in favorable development, it seems like just shy of half of that was due to the gses and the cancellation of the crt deal. the other $24 million, give or take, can you give us a sense of the vintage years associated with that? or what's driving that development?
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
well, i'll be -- yes, i'll give you a bit more specifics. so yes, you're right, just about half of the -- under half -- just slightly under a half of the total was from the gse call deals. and about a third, i'd say, is little tweaks, again, in, call it, covid assumptions that we've kind of brought down a little bit. and that's across -- it's across all our books. so it's like a u.s. -- primary u.s. mi. it's across some crt deal that are still around that we've made some adjustments on those reserves and also on the international book. so that gives you a perspective. and then there's just -- call it, just under 20% of favorable development on runoff businesses or second lien and student loan businesses that have been in runoff for quite some time. so hopefully, that gives you the split, phil, and answers your question.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes, that's great. that's great. and i think the pmier's efficiency ratio -- sorry, go ahead.
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
no, you go.
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
no. we're good.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. so the pmier's efficiency ratio is pushing up near 200%. maybe you could talk to us about the ability to upstream capital? when the gses might let you do that? or do you go to the state regulators and contemplate getting permission for a special of some sort?
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
yes. that -- as we discussed last quarter, that's in the works. second half of the year, we are -- we've begun the process already to upstream. as you mentioned, the dividend from our regulated entities to the holding company in the u.s. it's -- some of it will have to be extraordinary and some of it is ordinary dividends. so there's -- we'll have to have some discussions with the regulators on that. i'd like to think that we can get them comfortable that with our current levels of total capital and some of it, as you know, a lot of it being trapped in within the contingency reserves, i think they'll -- i think we'll be able to get them comfortable that the levels of dividend that we're talking about will be -- will meet their needs and ours. so stay tuned, but i'd like to think that we'll be able to extract some dividends in the second half of the year.
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
if i can address for one second, fill the gse. the gses are allowing you to do a dividend without any approval at 150% or above right now, pmier. so at the end of the year, it's going to go down to 115%. so we think we have flexibility even from that perspective, even if you consider them as another gatekeeper of that dividend payout.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from brian meredith with ubs.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
a couple of quick questions here. first, the decline you saw in your property cat reinsurance, i'm assuming that was just reduction in florida exposure. and i guess on that question, what does your southeastern kind of gulf exposure look like today versus last year?
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
it's down versus last year. but the first question on florida, we had some decrease in flow. but if you look at premium, it's not as -- it's not a one-to-one thing, brian. i think that the reduction was also as a result of buying a few things to, if you will, round of the portfolio. so it's not necessarily all like because if we get into this market, trying to get our net exposure to a different level because of returns, we use also some reinsurance buying to take care. so it's not only florida decrease.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. got you. and then my second question is now that the watford deal is closed. it is in some private hands, no longer a public company. any material or any meaningful changes in strategy here that you're anticipating with watford here going forward, different types of business they could write, etc, etc?
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
yes, i'd say at a high level, i mean, still early days, but at a high level, i think you should think more of watford as a closer clone to arch re business or underwriting than what watford was. watford was -- didn't necessarily do all the same classes of business, was very much focused more on the longer-tail stuff because of the additional pickup, the assumptions that were in terms of investment returns that we're going to get. so the, call it, the 2.0 business model of watford makes it more similar to what the arch re portfolio or book looks like.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. so results should actually trend toward -- ultimately trend toward what arch re looks like?
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
much more so, correct. yes.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. and then i'm just curious on watford. is there ability or any contemplation of maybe kicking on some of your mortgage insurance exposure going forward?
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
we actually write some mortgage on watford. yes, there is some already existing. it's actually been one of the things they've done for quite a while. that's also something that the watford shareholders were very pleased with, giving them the opportunity to participate.
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
the only -- i mean, that's an issue with ratings too like, brian. so that's something that the ratings do matter for -- in terms of getting gse and regulators comfortable. so that's something that they're going to look into as well.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2021 arch capital group earnings conference call. [operator instructions]. i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, mr. marc grandisson and mr. francois morin. sirs, you may begin.
marc grandisson -- executive vice president, chief financial officer & treasurer
thanks, liz. good morning, and thank you all for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings call. at arch, our playbook remains simple, yet effective. we protect our capital through soft markets and unleash our underwriters during hard market. we believe that this time tested strategy gives us the best chance to generate superior risk-adjusted returns over time. you should expect then from us at this stage of the cycle comes straight from that playbook. as long as rate increases support returns above our threshold, we will continue to grow our writings. we have seen this video before in the hard market of 2002 through 2005 when p&c results generated a sustainable stream of earnings for several years after market prices peaked and were fully earned. and so, again, this quarter, the power of arch's diversified platform is evident in the strong underlying earnings in each of our operating segments.
we delivered a 13% annualized operating roe and aided by good investment returns an annualized net income roe of 21% this quarter. one item that stands out this quarter was our strong p&c underwriting activity. our p&c insurance results demonstrate significant improvement in underwriting performance. better market conditions allowed our teams to expand their overall positioning and grow net written premiums substantially over the same quarter last year. we are now in the sixth consecutive quarter of rate increases at plus 10% this quarter, comfortably in excess of loss cost trend estimates. the higher level of premium earned from the post 2019 policy years is a primary driver of our improving underlying accident year combined ratio. about two thirds of the combined ratio improvement was due to lower loss ratios attributable to rate increases and underwriting actions we have taken over the past several years. the balance of the improvement was driven by a lower expense ratio. production increased across most lines of business and geography areas as pricing improvements spread.
while rate increases have tapered off from previous highs in some lines, we're seeing increases in lines that had been immune to meaningful change. and in lines where price increases have eased, we're still getting rate on rate increases on an improving margins. we estimate that approximately 30% of our insurance premium growth reflects rate increases. about 15% is from higher net retention level, and the remaining growth comes from new business and exposure growth with existing clients. both our international and u.s. insurance platforms continue to excel in the current market with substantial growth in professional lines, programs, property and travel and a&h writings. our reinsurance group also had a quarter of strong growth while producing strong underwriting results. a large portion of this growth results from our ability to leverage our expertise and historical experience as a writer of quota share business.
when markets dislocate, our clients need capacity and capital as they seek to reshape their portfolio. that's why, since 2019, we have been increasing our participation in side-by-side quota share arrangements. this has always been part of our reinsurance playbook and based on historical patterns we believe a good place to deploy our capital for the next few years. as you may have heard, this market is notable as rate increases in traditional xol reinsurance lag the insurance rate increases. so our current preference is to be closer to the primary rate increases through quota share with our clients. property cat xl is one of the few areas where we have reduced premium writings.
they are down 26%, as we are not finding enough opportunities that meet our return expectations. however, as you can see in our supplement, premium writings grew substantially in property other than cat and specialty segments. casualty and marine also produced excellent levels of growth. as with insurance, we expect the ongoing rate improvements to be reflected in our underwriting results over the next several quarters. the arch reinsurance story is one of providing creative capital solutions during hard markets that enables us to leverage our growth faster than in our primary insurance markets. we have considered this a core capability throughout our history. our reaction to this market is no exception. all in all, it was a very satisfactory job of seizing hard market opportunities by our team.
carpe diem, as they say. from a strategic standpoint, it's worth noting that we, along with our business partners, successfully completed the purchase of watford at the beginning of the third quarter and are focused on working to build a sustainable reinsurance franchise. all me now to switch to inflation fears, which continues to be a hot topic for our industry. i want to reiterate our perspective on how we view inflation at arch. as underwriters, we study inflation on a line-by-line basis to price the business and establish reserves. in some lines like workers' comp, inflation remains low at this stage, i'd say, 0% to 1%. however, in other lines like high excess general liability, we're estimating inflation to be in the 8% to 12% range. as a point of comparison, loss cost inflation from the ground-up has been in a 3% to 5% range for around five years, broadly across our portfolio. it's important to consider line of business specifics when we discuss claims inflation. second, it's worth noting that in every line of business, the inflation rate increases as you move up attachment points.
the key in pricing or reserving for an excess policy is to start with the proper ground-up trend and then apply the best curve to select a range for the trend in the upper layers. as is often the case in insurance, we are estimating and there is a lot of uncertainty around the correct number. our philosophy is to keep this methodology consistent through the cycle. third, we also supplement our analysis with some subjectivity. in the current environment and in certain lines, we had to try and account for the increased uncertainty, including the possibility of the so-called social inflation. we are typically more willing to adjust the trend above our indications than we are to reduce it, all with creating a margin of safety in mind. this is not a new concept at arch, but a time-tested philosophy that has allowed us to navigate both soft and hard markets through our opportunistic cycle management approach. let's turn now to our mortgage group, which continues to operate as a well-oiled machine, generating $250 million of operating earnings in the quarter.
our insurance in force remained steady at roughly $278 billion for u.s. primary mi. refinance activity has slowed, and we expect improving persistency throughout the remainder of the year and into 2022. delinquency rates are decreasing across our portfolio, and we still expect a large portion of delinquencies to cure based on many factors, including the strong equity position of our current inventory, where more than 95% of delinquent policies have over 10% of equity. new notices of default continues to decline and at 7,400 in the second quarter are better than pre-covid levels. outside of the u.s., we increased our writings in australia as the housing market remains strong. we like the long-term opportunity in australia as demonstrated by our announcement to acquire westpac's lmi business, which we now expect to close later this quarter. pricing remains competitive but rational across the mi industry has rated our back to 2019 levels.
however, the credit quality of borrowers remains strong, similar to 2016, supporting our confidence in the continued earnings from our mortgage insurance portfolio. as i close my prepared remarks, this quarter, i'll borrow from cricket, which is top of mind because this weekend marks cup match here in bermuda when the entire island goes cricket crazy for a four-day holiday weekend. i think of the current p&c market like being the first team to bat during a cricket test match. test cricket is one of the few sports that isn't governed by a clock. unlike games that must be completed in 60 or 90 minutes, test cricket is about scoring as any runs as possible as long as you are getting favorable balls or pitches for baseball fans and for as long as it takes for all of your batsmen to be out.
he details are not critical, but the idea is that similar to this market, we're waiting for the right ball and scoring as many runs as possible while we can. rather than swinging aimlessly, we'll do what we always do, play defensively when we have to but become aggressive and score as many runs as possible when the opportunity arises. we're not worried about the clock running out. we'll just keep scoring runs. now i'll ball it over to francois to run through the financials.
francois morin -- chief executive officer & director
thank you, marc, and good morning to all on this first day of the bermuda cup match classic. thanks for joining us today. before i provide more color on our excellent second quarter results, i should remind you that, consistent with prior practice, the following comments are on a core basis, which corresponds to arch's financial results, excluding the other segment, i.e., the operations of watford holdings ltd. in our filings, the term consolidated includes watford. as you know, we closed earlier this month on the transaction we announced late last year to acquire watford in partnership with warburg pincus and kelso. concurrent with the closing, we will be making changes going forward in how we report our equity interest in watford results, which i will share with you in a few minutes.
as marc shared earlier, we had an excellent quarter with each of the three legs of our stool performing very well and our investment portfolio also producing solid results. after-tax operating income for the quarter was $407.2 million or $1 per share, resulting in an annualized 13% operating return on average common equity. book value per share increased to $32.02 at june 30, up 4.8% in the quarter. in the insurance segment, net written premium grew 43.3% over the same quarter one year ago, 38.5% if we exclude the growth due to the covid-related recovery in our travel, accident and health unit from the same quarter one year ago. the insured segment's accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats was 91.4%, lower by 470 basis points from the same period one year ago.
the improvement in the ex-cat accident quarter loss ratio reflects the benefits of rate increases achieved over the last 12 months and changes in our mix of business. in addition, the expense ratio was lower by approximately 180 basis points since the same quarter one year ago, primarily due to the growth in the premium base. as for our reinsurance operations, we had strong growth of 63.6% in net written premiums on a year-over-year basis. the growth was observed across most of our lines, but especially in our casualty and other specialty lines where strong rate increases and growth in new accounts helped increase the top line. the segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, stood at 87.1% compared to 87.5% on the same basis one year ago. as we have discussed in the past, we believe the underlying performance of our reinsurance segment is better analyzed on a rolling 12-month basis, which typically smooths out the impact of certain large transactions and/or claims that can have an impact on quarterly results.
on that basis, the ex-cat accident year combined ratio stood at 84.3% over the last 12 months, lower by 660 basis points from the prior 12 months where the improvement almost entirely reflected on the loss side as a result of the rate increases we have observed over the last 6-plus quarters. losses from 2021 catastrophic events in the quarter, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums, stood at $46.5 million or 2.4 combined ratio points compared to 13.5 combined ratio points in the second quarter of 2020. the activity in the quarter was the result of a series of small events across the globe and some late reported claim activity from the north american winter storms, uri and viola in february. following up on the trends we have seen in the last few quarters, the ultimate impact of covid-19 on our mortgage segment remains very manageable. in particular, the delinquency rate, which came in at 3.11% at the end of the quarter, is now close to 40% lower than it was when it reached its peak during the pandemic at the end of the second quarter one year ago.
we had another solid quarter in terms of production. and with refinance activity coming down from prior levels, we saw the insurance in force for our u.s. mi book remained relatively stable. of note this quarter was the exercise of call features by the gses on certain vintage credit risk transfer contracts, reducing the insurance in force for our non-u.s. mi portfolio. the overall impact of these calls was an approximate onetime $31 million benefit to our underwriting income, approximately two thirds of which came from the release of prior year loss reserves and the rest from the call premiums received. the combined ratio for this segment was 26.5%, reflecting the lower level of new delinquencies reported during the quarter. income from operating affiliates was strong at $24.5 million, mostly driven by an excellent first quarter at coface. as a reminder, we report our ownership interest in coface's results on a quarter lag into our financial statements.
as regards to watford, the closing of the transaction on july one gave rise to a reconsideration event. and as a result, we revisited our vie analysis. based on the new governing documents of the entity, we have concluded that while we will attain significant influence, we will not control the entity going forward. accordingly, we will no longer consolidate the results of watford in our financial results, starting with our third quarter financials. and our 40% share of watford's results will be reported in the income from operating affiliates line, along with our proportionate share of other operating affiliates such as coface and premia. as a result of the closing of the transaction, we also expect to report a onetime nonrecurring gain of approximately $65 million in the third quarter. total investment return for our investment portfolio was positive 150 basis points on a u.s. dollar basis for the quarter. net investment income was $89.4 million during the quarter, up $10.7 million on a sequential basis, driven by lower investment expenses and interest received on funds withheld transactions. the duration of our portfolio remains at one of its lowest levels in our history, 2.31 years at the end of the quarter, reflecting our internal view of the risk and return trade-offs in the fixed income markets.
equity and net income of investment funds accounted for -- accounting for using the equity method returned approximately $122 million during the quarter, a key contributor to the growth in our book value. the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 7.6% in the quarter, reflecting changes in the full year estimated tax rate, the geographic mix of our pre-tax income and a benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. turning briefly to risk management. our natural cat pml on a net basis decreased to $676 million as of july one for the northeast peak zone down to approximately 5.6% of tangible common equity and well below our internal limits at the single event 1-in-250-year return level. on the capital front, we issued $500 million of 4.55% perpetual fixed rate preferred shares in june.
we expect to use the proceeds to redeem all or a portion of our outstanding series e noncumulative preferred shares in september 2021 and to use any remaining amounts for general corporate purposes. separately, we repurchased approximately 7.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $306 million in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to over $485 million or approximately 45% of our year-to-date net income, all while growing our book value and top line. as we have said since our formation 20 years ago, we are strong proponents of active cycle and capital management.
we believe this quarter's results demonstrates our ability to execute on this philosophy and leads us to invest in opportunities where we believe the returns are most attractive. at current prices and with the prospect of improving returns, we believe buying back our shares represent another compelling value proposition for our shareholders without compromising our capital flexibility. with these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
good morning.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
good morning.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
my first question, marc, you're talking about the mortgage business. you talked about buying more reinsurance. so it was more capital for growth on the p&c side, which i found interesting in the past you've spoken about mortgage running at around a 15 plus return and p&c at kind of 10% to 12%. has the dynamics changed that that caused you to kind of buy some more reinsurance to pursue more growth on the property casualty side?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think our opportunities on the p&c side just have improved right over the last couple of years and i think we're even more convinced of the length and that has -- that has legs for the foreseeable future. so that makes us be more proactive, to balance, if you will, the capital allocation between more than one year, i mean we did rely heavily on a capital deployed in mi for quite a while because it returns in p&c as you know at least as attractive. but now that we have a new attractive and increase and improve returns in the p&c, it behooves us to balance the risk profile of the portfolio and that's one of the reasons why we would do some more reinsurance. and again the reinsurance also helps -- helps our return on a net basis as well, which is also another benefit.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
but the return numbers i gave still kind of where you see the three businesses of 50% plus and then 10% to 12%.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yes. i would say on the p&c side, elyse, i would say it's getting up, is north of that now. i think we have our prospects closing -- the gap is closing between mi and p&c, if you will.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
so north of, higher than 12%?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
i would agree. yeah, we think it's the case. yes.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
and then in terms of capital you guys put in place a $1.5 billion authorization. it sounds like you bought back a little bit under that so far this quarter going through the end of next year. i know obviously what the buyback depends upon the market also will your shares and the trading over the course of the next year, but when you put that in place, was that designed to set a mark of what you will buyback or are there other factors that could cause you to either fully buyback that level or maybe come in lower. just help us kind of think through that as we think about capital return through 2022.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
well, i mean, two things, we bought -- were close to $1 billion this year. so we don't want to go back to the board every three months and ask for more. so we thought ok, what may we need, could we need by the end of 2022 over the next 15, over the next 15 months effectively, $1.5 billion is just a number that nice round number. nothing, nothing special about it. but are we committed to that number? the answer is absolutely not. if the market keeps improving and we have the ability to deploy your capital, all the capital and then some in the business, we may not end up buying anything back. so it's really again a function of the market conditions and vice versa. right, if the market doesn't really generate, give us a lot of opportunities to grow, we might be in a position where we buy back more than that. so it's really, again, it will be a function of what we see in front of us over the next 15 months. and if we end up going through the $1.5 billion sooner than the end of next year then we'll do something else. so again, it's very dynamic, very real time i'd say. and we'll see where things take us.

our next question comes from jimmy bhullar with j.p. morgan.
jimmy bhullar -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
good morning.
jimmy bhullar -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
so first i've a question on just what you're seeing in terms of pricing, both on the insurance and the reinsurance side. and to what extent do you think price increases are going to hold versus may be especially on the reinsurance market seems like things have been getting a little bit softer over through the course of the year. but how does, how do recently high catastrophes affect your view of one-one notes.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
right, jimmy, if we bifurcate the market into property cat, you agree, i would tend to agree with you that property cat raise did not increase as much as we had hoped, collectively as an industry, i would say, not only at arch, it's not a single arch phenomenon. therefore that's why you saw us write less property cat over the next, over the last nine months.
assuming that reaction to those rate level, i would -- it's still early, like we said -- like i said in my commentary, but i think we should have a repricing, definitely repricing in europe and in the us even for the layers that have been impacted. that's for sure. and i think it would start to spill out even on to those that have not sustained a loss, because i think there is a recognition of heightened cat activity and i think that the market is sort of bracing for that as we go forward. it's going to be a matter of degree.
on the rest of the marketplace, i think that overall since if you look at the liability lines in general, overall you'll see -- you can think of in terms of a quarter share, if you like quarter [phonetic] share of casualty or liability lines, you are benefiting from the rate increases in the business and i think the ceding commissions, which were maintained held high for in 2020 are starting to come down a little bit. so there is a recognition that, so there's a bit of an improvement from that perspective. on quarter share, on the excess of loss in general for liability, the raise are stable to somewhat, more stable, but again, you apply those raise against a base that is increasing in premium level, so they are also getting some price uplift. and i think that big as soon, i mean the reinsurance market, jimmy feeds [phonetic] off of the insurance market, right, in a positive way, i want to express a positive message. we actually -- we one the receiving end of a portion of what the insurance market writes, and to the extent the interest market writes premium at a higher level, we are benefiting from those -- from those rate increases.
jimmy bhullar -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay. and then can you quantify how much you've got in terms of covid reserves especially for business interruption and i'm assuming they're mostly still ibnr as you had been quantifying last year. and just discuss what the process would be and the timeline would be for release and these given that for the most part, it seems like the courts have been fighting with the insurance companies at least thus far in the us.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'd say, i mean we're still very much a lot of ibnr in our covid reserve is more than half, 60% or so. i'd say of our -- call it covid reserves on the p&c side are still ibnr. so -- and how quickly, well we know or not know, whether we'll need those reserves, time will tell. i think it's where we sit. yes. i don't disagree that. so far, there have been a couple of positive developments from the courts, but it's going to take a while. i truly think this is, i mean, very complicated and issue that will take years to resolve. so i wouldn't expect us to really take dramatic action on the level of covid reserves on the p&c side for some time.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
and jimmy, in our industry and insurance, you could win 95 lawsuits and lose 96th and it changes everything. so there's a lot of uncertainty in our space. even though we've been a good streak, one change could change everything so we are very...
jimmy bhullar -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and what is the rough number of -- rough dollar amount of reserves.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
that's a good question. i don't have it in front of me. we can circle back with you, i know we booked a few $100 million last year and we paid some of that. i don't have the current figure. but we can give you that. we haven't changed ultimate, jimmy, over the last three quarters.
jimmy bhullar -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
but it's not something like it's more maybe 2023, '24 as opposed to '22 in terms of potential releases on these?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
there are releases. i will say, yes, it will probably take another one year, year-and-half and we might hold a little bit more longer for the reasons i just mentioned in terms of the court decisions.
jimmy bhullar -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you.

our next question comes from mike zaremski with wolfe research.
mike zaremski -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, great. good morning/afternoon. i guess in some of the prepared remarks, when you guys were talking about the primary insurance segment, talked about kind of seeing rate acceleration actually in the lower limits kind of the smaller commercial space. any theories on what's -- on why that's happening? is it due to loss cost trend increasing because we're kind of -- we're seeing a fading of rate a little bit of a deceleration in the large account space. so kind of curious if you guys have any views maybe broadly to on kind of loss cost trend, given all the uncertainty during the pandemic on the primary insurance side.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
right, the loss cost trend as we observe it and it might change is still roughly in the 3% to 5%. it depends on lines of business, but we haven't really changed our view on this at this point in time. we had a loss reserve review, i believe, a couple of months ago. so it's not changing, although we are putting in our loss ratio pick an extra level of margin safety to make sure we wouldn't be missing because it could be higher, as you know, inflation is certainly another concern that we all have collectively as underwriters.
in terms of my theory about why the smaller accounts get those rates right now, it's just the -- it's -- the market is a human psychology market and the pricing gets more acutely needed in the larger capacity play. and this is where the market starts focusing its first effort as the market hardens. and this is not unusual. this is a very, very normal phenomenon in the hardening markets. you'll tend to try and fix those or more important, meaning if you put a $10 million, $15 million, $25 million limit, these are the ones you're going to trying to fix right away because presumably, those will have caused you a bit more pain over the last two, three years, you were expecting more pain coming from that portfolio. and it's just a matter of time before people start looking sideways as to what other lines of business need rate and then you start dipping down into your overall portfolio and seeing where the liability trends, for instance, might also be an impact. and this is sort of a second round, sort of a rippling effect from the main capacity providing players into the ones who have lower players.
and at the same time, to be fair and to be -- i mean, to be truthful, you also have development ongoing -- happening on the smaller account at the same time. it's just not as acute and as glaring and as obvious early as the larger capacity players. that's why.
mike zaremski -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's interesting. that's helpful. maybe switching gears to the mortgage segment. just curious, i know the forbearance levels continue to decrease. if you could remind us, i believe there is some extensions to the forbearance program or maybe even new kind of enhanced programs where the p&i could be reduced if the payment can be reduced by up to 25%. is that correct? and if so, are you seeing your borrowers utilize those options?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yes. so right now, the program is done, it expires at 9/30 -- expired in 9/30 in terms of foreclosure, right? so -- but the forbearance, i'm sorry. the foreclosure it's still unclear, right, because they could also come back and extend it further if things were to change. and the cfpb is also involved with the fhfa saying that we don't want to have any more -- there's a moratorium on the foreclosure process as well. so i think both federal entities are trying to push -- to go back to your last point of the question, push the mortgage -- the loan -- the mortgage originator and provider of providing solutions to the borrowers who are still in forbearance or not current on their payment. and to your point, a lot of it is going to be continuing same payment. most of it is going to be continuing the same payment as prior to the covid forbearance program and it's attaching at the end -- toward the end, the lack of what wasn't paid or what was accrued as unpaid at the end of the loan.
so this is roughly what it's going to look like. but it's going to be another three quarters before we have more visibility because even though the forbearance program stopped in 9/30 and people should come now to the banks and -- to the mortgage originator and trying to remediate their position from a forbearance perspective, it's still going to take another six to nine months. and i think the agencies are watching carefully. so everything is heading toward a happy resolution, if you will, of the overall forbearance programs. like, everybody is focusing on this at this point in time.
mike zaremski -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. great. and one last one, sticking to mortgage, and i could take this off-line with donald too. but just i want to -- the increased ceded -- premium ceded as a percentage of gross, is that due to bellemeade? and i guess if it is, can you guys continue to upsize the reinsurance usage in the segment if you thought opportunistically, you wanted to shift more growth toward other lines of business?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes, that's very much in that vein. i think marc made the point earlier, we're always looking to optimize the portfolio. and certainly, a lot of that is focused on capital deployment. we, i think, made the point last call that we had increased our quota share percentages on the u.s. mi book at 7.1 [phonetic], so that's starting to play through, basically. and that is reflected. we also -- we're still very active in the bellemeade space, so we're purchasing quite a lot there as well. and i'd say those two things combined really explain why we have more ceded premium starting this quarter.
mike zaremski -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. and there's more appetite if you decided to do more, either quota or bellemeade in the future? or are you kind of reaching kind of a max?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
i mean, i'd say we certainly do a lot of bellemeade, as it is. so i don't want to say we wouldn't do more, but it's -- i mean, we already are very active in that space and made big placements. so i wouldn't expect us to necessarily increase that vehicle or that mechanism to transfer risk a whole lot. and on the quota share, i mean, we're -- yes, can we see more? we could, but then it's a risk return trade-off and whether the economics work -- are reasonable or work in our favor, too. so right now, we're happy where we're at. but if things change in the market, gives us better opportunities, we could conceivably cede a bit more, yes.
mike zaremski -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer

our next question comes from josh shanker with bank of america.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, everyone. this may not be the best math, but it's rough. i think you guys -- the inventory of covid era, mortgage claims about 120,000, you've had about 90,000 cures. i'm estimating that you guys have about $20,000 up per notice right now in the portfolio. it may not be exact. historically, you've had about an average of $5,000 up per notice. it seems like the reserves are stuffed, particularly as you tell us that 90% of -- 98% of the claims have at least $10,000 in equity. so i mean, i'm trying to rectify all this -- like, can you explain to me, i feel -- so i've asked this question before, i just don't understand what's going on there?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i think the answer is going to be very similar. so a very good question, hopefully not taken by the policemen back there. if you look at the average case reserve per nods, it's actually 23,500. i believe, it's in the supplement, you can look into it. and you're right, it was -- it went up from last year. the run rate pre-covid was roughly 10,000, 11,000, 12,000. so it did increase. and about -- it was about 110,000 claims that we got as well of covid in the forbearance and about 78% of them have cured so far. so we're about 20,500. so better than this, we have about 31,770 i think, is the number in terms of nods outstanding. when you multiply by 23, you're right, it would look on the high side.
a couple of things i will say here. number one is the average -- the average severity of the policies that are facing the covid-19 are starting from '18, '19, which have a higher face than the one we had as nods back in 2019, right? those in 2019 were largely pre-2008. so you have to adjust for the level of coverage that has increased over the last 10, 12 years. so that explains one, why the 23 would be higher than the 11, 13 historically.
the second part of your question was, well -- where should it go? and this is where it's more art than science, josh. we hear you. we are cautiously optimistic that it may not come to pass in terms of needing the reserves. and hopefully, some of it will cure better than we anticipated. but i just want to remind everyone on the call and as we remind ourselves all the time, it's that this is a political positioning, right? things could change very quickly from the fhfa, the gses or the housing department. so we need to be really careful. and we've never been through that kind of event.
so we are, arch, as you know, and we will take a cautious, prudent approach to reserving. and if we happen not to meet those reserves, as we do typically, we'll be taking them by the hands on the liability side down to the capital side. we're not going to let them stranded for a long time. but again, so much, so many uncertainties, josh. we understand your puzzling. this is a very unusual situation for the industry. therefore, we have to -- and that's why we appear probably to be a little bit unusual and that we're reserving it.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
and my second question, unrelated. can you talk about the differential, i guess, the new business penalty between new business you're putting on the book and legacy customers who you have a deep sense of their -- the risk factors on those accounts. is there a gap? is the business that you're renewing at better margins at least the way you're booking it to new business, given that you know more about the business you already have?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
i believe, josh, you're talking about p&c, right?
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
yes. this is only primary p&c, not more.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
right. that makes sense to me. so it's a really -- a very astute question, josh, because we keep on track of the renewal rate versus the new business rate level. and symptomatic or as a representation of the hardening market, the pricing of the new business is coming higher than the renewal business. and that sort of speaks to the fact that they need a new home and they need to be repriced and people sort of get tired of that relationship and it goes back, throw them back into either the e&s or the admitted market. so right now, we're still seeing, on average, the new business price better than renewal business.
josh shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer

our next question comes from tracy benguigui with barclays.
tracy benguigui -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. just a big picture question. i see this quarter with you and your closer peer group, is that the insurance growth is outpacing the more primary market focused players without reinsurance arms. are you seeing a lot of market dislocation where you feel like you just do a better job assuming displaced risk that still meet your risk-adjusted return hurdles?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
we'd like to think we're better than the average guy out there. but tracy, i think overall, the dislocation was much larger in 2020. i think you are still seeing some dislocation right now. it's certainly not -- there's still some repositioning of limit provided to the market by a lot of players still as we speak. and i think what explains our ability to grow is, first, we have a really well-established presence, and we were really underweight, tracy, historically. we are really, really good markets for people that want a good security for products such as d&o, for instance, right? we are a really good home for someone to take on new as an insurer. and we're sort of -- we're definitely benefiting from that as an incumbent good -- with a good quality, good reputation as we do. and also, i think the other thing that i want to mention, we had said that last year, we were suffering a little bit from sort of a travel -- lack of traveling that impacted our travel portfolio. so that certainly helps, right, tracy, the fact that economy is reopening and people are traveling a bit more. that also helps explain why we're able to grow a little bit more than probably means the average -- than the average would.
lastly, i would say that beyond just new business, funding new homes, i think there are programs. we're also growing in programs, as you see. this is a very specialty smaller risk. i think that, again, another example of programs, funding a new home going away from the existing incumbent possibly because of the results and funding a new home, and we definitely are in receiving end of that relationship.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
yes. and one thing i'll add quickly. i think both -- depending on the mix of business of what you call the more established and the traditional insurers, i mean, workers' comp and commercial auto typically will make up bigger shares of their portfolio. auto is moving up nicely, but i would say that certainly, comp has had a really good period of excellent results. so rate increases on the comp side have been pretty flattish. so again, that's probably worth adjusting for comp because it's such a big line for some of these carriers.
tracy benguigui -- barclays -- analyst
and i'm wondering how much of that is structural in nature. like are others raising attachment points and you're lowering attachment points or offering lower deductibles?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
no. we don't do that. no, we don't play that game. i think we would just be replacing most of our play typically on specialty lines, tracy, is mid access, first and second -- this is sort of what we play a lot of times and high access, of course, in certain areas. so we -- for the record, tracy, we're not seeing any of the deductible being played out in the marketplace. and in fact, there are deductible increases if anything else.
we just see a lot of shortening of limit toward in the stacking. we've saw that in 2020. it's ongoing as we speak, instead of having stretch of 25, i'm talking about larger placements, you'll have stretches of 10 or five -- five or 10 really and 15, perhaps still staying. but there's a lot more players needed to fill up the towers. that's definitely happening more so and still continuing on to some extent, less so than 2020.
tracy benguigui -- barclays -- analyst
okay. and then just shifting to reinsurance. where are you seeing your favorable reserve development coming from?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i mean the vast majority, and we'll talk to it end of june in the q. vast majority is in short-tail lines. i mean, i'd say probably 80% is in short-tail lines. mostly property other than cat, where we've grown a lot in the last couple of years. and while the tail is always a bit longer, we think it should be, it's still, we have a pretty good idea two, three years out after writing the policy or the account, and we're seeing a lot of that coming through in this quarter. a bit of favorable development on prior year cat as well and a bit on trade credit and surety from a few years ago where we had some reserves that proved out to be a bit -- weren't required. so we released those this quarter.
tracy benguigui -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from meyer shields with kbw.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
thanks. it's a cycle management question, i guess, for marc, when if ever do we decide that there's never going to be an appropriate hard market in property cat just get out of the line?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
i think that by virtue of -- well, first, i'm an optimist, right? i've always been an optimist. i've heard so many times over the last 27 years from some of our own underwriters that there will never be a hard market again. and when i hear this, it's music to my ears because that means we're cruising for bruising. so i think that things will get better in cat at some point. it may not be this quarter, meyer, but at some point, numbers speak for themselves. if you lose money every year, people just get this enchanted and just walk away from it. it happened after the '90 storms in europe, '92 andrews, earthquake in california -- '94, terrorist attack, katrina, rita, wilma, i mean there's always changes. and it's not -- i rattled like five or six of them. and you got to believe that the world is a dangerous place, meyer. so i think something will happen.
and again, losses don't necessarily change the market pricing, but perception of risk will and would. so maybe we're in this place where people say, ""you know what, why bother?"" and if that's the case, and that -- and the demand for cat, as you know, protection is inelastic. so if supply shrinks, then demand will stay as is and pricing will, therefore, increase. so i'm an optimist. i'm not sure when it's going to happen, but i believe it will happen at some point.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst

our next question comes from brian meredith with ubs.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
yes. thanks. a couple of quick questions here for you. first, marc, i just want to follow-up on the comment about new business pricing better than renewal pricing, and i've heard that from other carriers. but i'm just curious, when you actually go to book the margin on that new piece of business? are you booking a better margin than perhaps that renewal piece of business? or do you have to build in some level of cushion because it is new?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
well, it's a very good point. i think the latter part is what we would do. but even -- we would also take a higher level of cushion on margin safety, if you will, not reserving, even in our renewal business. i think that we're, as you know, reserving wise and loss ratio pick wise at arch we tend to be more conservative and hope for the best, and hopefully, good news come down later. we're trying to figure out would have as much cushion as we can early on so that we're not surprised down the road. that's not changing. i would say it's the same approach, renewal or new business, brian. it's not much of a change.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
not much of a change. got you. okay. second, just a quick question here. are we still seeing admitted market shed business to the e&s markets? or has that slowed?
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
that slowed down a little bit, but it's still happening. we're not seeing a return back to the admitted market quite yet. it's going to take a little bit longer, we think.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
got you. got you. and then one kind of bigger, i guess, philosophical question for you. i think with the mi business, clearly, you've demonstrated that it is not as big of a volatility business that maybe somewhat perceived just given the results we've seen through this recent crisis. if that is indeed the case and the amount of cash that business throws off because it's not a growth business, i guess i see you guys using share buyback as your means of capital management, and i completely get that where your stock's trading now. but what about a dividend? and maybe remind us about your philosophy with respect to a dividend.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
well, i mean i'll take that, brian. i think it's something we talk about with the board and between ourselves all the time. we had a pretty long discussion at our last board meeting on that. it's always on the table. i'd say right now, i mean i think -- i mean the share buybacks that we went through this quarter were very attractive to us, the economics were very much, i think, they're easy to justify. but could we ever introduce a dividend? certainly, that's on the table. not saying it's imminent, but it's something that we evaluate pretty much definitely with regularity, and we'll keep looking at it.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi. thanks. just one additional question. can you guys spend time highlighting that session to watford in the quarter, given that, that transaction closed. so my sense is they're going to become more arch like in terms of the business that you're ceding to them versus prior to this transaction. so as you think about your 40% stake, can you just help us think about the earnings stream there? because i would think that as we go through next year that, that could become a meaningful contributor to your earnings as the underwriting income of watford for pickup from what we're used to.
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i think the 40% share would grow at an average sort of reinsurance market results, right, because we are writing business on the balance sheet of watford. so you would expect that. i think that what you would also see is our collecting fees or -- for our efforts, compensation for our efforts for watford that would be for the 100%. so i think that the overall return would be slightly better even though, elyse, as you can appreciate with the accounting rules, it might not show as such. but i think that our results will be as good, i would hope for, if not better than our overall results. so it's definitely an accretive return generator for reinsurance platform.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
and that should pick up within that other income line as we move through next year?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. so a couple -- yes, the 40%, correct. the other income line is -- well, the fees are picked up by the reinsurance segment because they -- it's sort of the underwriting services they provide to watford. but you're correct in saying that the net equity pickup of the 40% that we own in watford, if you're modeling what kind of combined ratio is it going to operate at, what kind of premium, or are you going to see in terms of the volume, i would -- you're right, i mean it's probably more and more over time, it's going to look more and more like arch re, the reinsurance segment. the percentages we cede to watford are not uniform across all our divisions, but directionally, i think that's a good way to think about it.
and the other thing, too, which has somewhat been an issue with watford is the performance of the investments, right? and that has -- that's being a little bit -- is being addressed as we speak. i think there's a process underway to reduce the volatility from the investment portfolio or the investment strategy at watford. so think of it more as a, yes, a more less volatile stream of income with more reliance on underwriting income and less so on investment income. and hopefully, that gets you in good place to start modeling out how watford is going to play out for us -- the 40% for arch going forward.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
and then maybe i'll squeeze one last in. i'm not sure if you provided an updated tax guidance. if so, i missed it. if you could just let us know that. and then we've heard about some potential tax changes, whether in the u.s. and also abroad in relation to bermuda. do you guys have just any kind of prospective tax loss and just some of what we're hearing in the market and how that could impact arch?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i'd say, first of all, that question, fourth quarter, we're still in the 9% to 11% kind of tax rate for arch in the fourth quarter. for 2022 and beyond, and marc will chime in, it's way too early. unfortunately, we track and we look at all the developments very carefully. we're on top of things. and the reality is they change daily. so it's very hard for us at this point to give you any kind of guidance or any expectations of what we think 2022 is going to look like. we'll be more than happy to have a good discussion at our -- on the next call. but for now, it's -- we feel it's just premature to -- because we really don't know.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
and elyse, just to make the point about daily, literally last night, our tax director or this morning, just sent us like there's a new proposal on the hill that brings back shield and then corrects other things and then dispenses off other areas of the tax proposal in the oecd. so again, a moving target, it's politics. we'll react to it when we do when we see it.

francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, let me start. i'd say we may see a little in the fourth quarter, but that will be i don't think everything will be resolved. i truly think that the first half of '22 is when you'll see most of the movement or the corrections and our assumptions and the cure rates and mediation. so i'd say we're going to start seeing some data as early as this month internally and the number of cures and people moving out of forbearance, but the way it's going to flow through our numbers again, given some of the uncertainties that marc talked about, i think, will be first half of '22.
marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
and the reason also, matt has to be said and understood is that they had 18 months of forbearance worth when you get into forbearance earlier in 2020. and some of them went into forbearance, came out of forbearance and went back in again, but they still get to -- get to do -- to benefit from 18 months' worth of forbearance. so that's why some of them were coming out of their 18-month and then fourth quarter and many of them in the first and second quarter next. so it seems like some of them were able to get back current for four, five months and went back to forbearance program. that's why we have this lengthy adjustment period.

marc grandisson -- chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. we are pleased to have delivered solid results this quarter as our operating units generated a 9.3% annualized operating return equity and a 12.5% annualized net income roe despite an active catastrophe quarter, sorry guys. premium writings and rate growth remains strong in our p&c unit driving solid fundamental earnings while our mortgage insurance unit again produced excellent results. the current market conditions allow us to demonstrate the value of our diversified platform and underwriting strength as they provide us with plenty of opportunities to deploy capital and generate an expected return on equity in the mid-teens.
in the broader p&c arena, we continue to see the market hardening along with ample evidence that our industry is addressing the adequacy of pricing across most sectors. the trajectory and market acceptance of rate increases reinforce why we remain optimistic that improved economics in the p&c market will be sustainable for some time. as you know, the p&c industry is facing many degrees of uncertainty, heightened cat activity for the last five years, rising inflation, covid ongoing influence on a global economy and enduring low interest rates. when faced with escalating risk, underwriters need both rate increases and conservative loss estimates in order to build adequate margins of safety into premium levels. with our agile underwriting, established teams and strong capital position, we are well equipped to grow into this improving market.
turning now to our operating units. we'll begin with insurance where our early focus on strengthening our underwriting capability and seizing recent market opportunities is working. gross written premiums continued to grow substantially, up 32% over the same quarter in 2020 and our accident year combined ratio ex-cats improved to 90.5%. this is another indication of the progress we have made in our specialty insurance business. we have been leaning into this hardening market for two years now as rate increases remain well above the long-term loss cost trends and have spread to more lines than last year.
overall, 2021 rates are up around 10% compared to 2020 and we expect that the benefit of higher premium levels will be realized well into 2023 enhancing our expected returns for that period. this quarter had many bright spots including positive rate increases have accelerated lower limits account. these lines had previously lagged the increases in larger accounts, that is no longer the case. two, our early focus on lloyd's and business in the uk has improved our scale and our economics in this market. three, some of our business lines that were most impacted by covid like travel are recapturing some of the lost volume as both business and consumer travel increases. in summary, our specialty insurance group is making the most of the current opportunities.
pivoting now to our reinsurance group. we delivered strong growth in the quarter with gross written premiums up nearly 25% over the same period in 2020. on a net basis reported growth was only a modest 3% versus the same quarter in 2020 due to a catch-up in sessions to watford following the purchase of the company with our partners at july 1. francois will provide more detail during his comments, but absent this one-off transaction reinsurance net written premium growth was still very strong at 30% and our outlook remains favorable as similar to insurance. we are experiencing broad rate increases in our specialty and casualty reinsurance lines.
in the quarter, our reinsurance segment reported a combined ratio of 106% reflecting the effects of the third quarter cats primarily ida and the central european floods, but reinsurance's accident year combined ratio ex-cat is excellent at 83.2%. there are signs that property market rates could adjust higher due to cat fatigue as you've likely heard on other calls this quarter. the recent five-year period of elevated losses from catastrophes proves an important insurance adage, losses don't know the level of the premium.
there are also early indications that retrocessional and aggregate excess of loss protections are becoming increasingly hard to come by and we believe that this will be reflected in higher property rates broadly. as you know, we weren't remain judicious in the deployment of our cat pml which was effectively flat in the third quarter. at less than 6% of our tangible equity, we remained underweight in net property cat exposure and we will deploy more capital to the line if expected returns improve above our target. it's too early to make a call on a january 1 renewal process, but pricing in this sector is heavily influenced of the margins and if ils or other capacity phase there is a possibility for significant rate corrections and increase engagement on our part.
in the meantime, our reinsurance teams are demonstrating their agility and like insurance are leaning hard into the markets where returns are most attractive. thirdly, our mortgage group continues to deliver exceptional returns. it generated $234 million of underwriting profit in the third quarter and continues its impressive rebound from loss concerns associated with the pandemic.
a september 30 insurance in-force of $457 billion for the segment was up modestly. further good news is that notices of default have declined to pre-pandemic levels at september 30, which is a good indicator of improved conditions. additionally, loans in forbearance continue to decline as federal programs conclude and we remain cautiously optimistic that most of these loans will ultimately cure. rising home prices have broadly increased homeowner equity and you will recall our position that equity levels are the best indication of whether a delinquency will ultimately result in a loss.
we estimate that 98% of our loans in forbearance today have at least 10% equity providing significant protection against potential losses. overall, the mi market remains competitive but rational and our business continues to generate returns on capital in the mid-teens. mortgage originations continue at a pace similar to last year's record origination volume and credit quality remains excellent.
as you know, in all of our operations, we actively manage capital to enhance shareholder returns. the strong results in our mortgage segment have enabled us to optimize our capital structure, the increased reinsurance sessions through our bellemeade mortgage insurance linked notes as well as traditional reinsurance. additional reinsurance purchases enable us to reallocate capital toward faster growing areas in specialty, property and casualty lines while enhancing our return profile in mi by reducing required capital. mi remains a very attractive business for us.
now a point of pride and interest to us and perhaps to you all is that last saturday, october 23, arch celebrated its 20 year anniversary. so i want to say to our investors, thank you for believing in us and to our employees past and present, thank you for your contributions to arch for last 20 years and our clients for showing support and conviction in our capacity to provide products to you.
finally, the pga tours in bermuda this weekend. so golf is top of mind. a golf tournament is interesting and it takes place over several days and therefore consistency is critical. you have to be sure to pick your spots and lower your score. but if you want to make the cut, you have to limit the bogeys early, so that you can play more aggressively in a stretch. and then once you get to the weekend, you can play with a bit more freedom and really try for the birdies and eagles. at this point in the cycle, we feel we've made the cut and now were focused on really taking advantage of our positioning to make sure we end up at the top of the leaderboard. francois?
francois morin -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, marc and good morning to you all on this first day of the butterfield bermuda championship here in bermuda. thanks for joining us today. before i provide more color on our solid third quarter results, you will have observed that while our earnings release still makes a distinction between core and consolidated for purposes -- comparison to prior periods, there is no difference between the two presentations this quarter. as we discussed on the last call, the closing of the watford transaction on july 1 gave rise to a reconsideration events and as a result of our updated vie analysis we no longer consolidate the results of watford in our financial results.
our 40% share of watford results is now reported in the income from operating affiliates line and there is no longer a need to make a distinction between core and consolidated results in our financials. as marc shared earlier our after-tax operating income for the quarter was $294.7 million or $0.74 per share resulting in an annualized 9.3% operating return on average common equity, and book value per share increased to $32.43 at september 30, up 1.3% in the quarter. a very solid result in light of the catastrophe activity that was much higher than the long-term average for this quarter, which we estimate at over $45 billion in insured losses for the p&c industry apart, approximately three times the average third quarter cat losses observed over the last ten years. this quarter, i wanted to first give you some additional detail on the results of our reinsurance operations, which were impacted by the watford acquisition, especially on the top line.
as part of the agreement signed at the beginning of the year with our co-investors in watford, we committed to seeding varying percentages of the premium written by our bermuda and us treaty reinsurance operations to watford, effectively enhancing the existing business model to also serve as a sidecar for arch. while the retrocession agreements were effective as of the start of the year, their signing was contingent on the transaction closing, which delayed their recognition in our income statement until this quarter. as a result, the third quarter ceded written premium reflects a catch-up of approximately $161.2 million from the first half of the year.
the impact of the premium catch-up adjustment on underwriting income for the reinsurance segment was minimal. growth in gross written premium remained strong at 24.6% on a quarter-over-quarter basis and growth in net written premium would have come in at 29.5% adjusting for the watford catch-up. the growth was observed across most of our lines, but especially in our casualty, other specialty and property other than property catastrophe lines where strong rate increases and growth in new accounts help increase the top line. the segment's accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats stood at 83.2% compared to 83.1% on the same basis one year ago.
on a year-to-date basis, the ex-cat accident year combined ratio has improved by approximately 250 basis points over the same period last year, reflecting the improving underwriting results in most of the lines in which we write them. in the insurance segment, net written premium grew 40% over the same quarter one year ago and the segment's accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats was 90.5% lower by approximately 360 basis points from the same period one year ago.
excellent results across the board, which demonstrate the progress our insurance segment has made over the last three plus years and improving its performance and provide us with optimism on the underlying quality of our franchise going forward. losses from 2021 catastrophic events in the quarter, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums stood at $335.9 million or 17.4 combined ratio points compared to 12.5 combined ratio points in the third quarter of 2020. as noted in our pre-release, our p&c operations were impacted by hurricane ida, the european flooding events of july as well as a series of other events across the globe. our mortgage segment had an excellent quarter with a combined ratio of 26.2% reflecting favorable prior year development of $48.4 million, about half of which came from usmi from better than expected cure activity in pre-pandemic delinquencies and recoveries on the second lien loans and the other half from our crt portfolio and international mi.
the decrease in net premiums earned on a sequential basis was primarily attributable to lower levels of a single premium terminations in the quarter for usmi business and to a lower level of call the crt transaction than what was observed in the second quarter. recall that second quarter benefited from higher earned premiums due to an unusually high number of crt transactions being called, which we highlighted as effectively being a non-recurring event.
the delinquency rate for usmi book came in at 2.67% at the end of the quarter, a material reduction from the peak we observed at the end of the second quarter one year ago. we had another solid quarter in terms of production, mostly from the purchase market and with refinance activity coming down from prior levels, the insurance in force for our usmi book grew slightly. the increase from last quarter in the insurance in force of our international mortgage unit is mostly the result of the acquisition of westpac lenders mortgage insurance limited in early august.
although income from operating affiliates grew significantly to $124.1 million, it is worth noting that approximately $95.7 million of the total is attributable to a one-time operating gain resulting from the acquisition of a 40% stake in watford, which was offset in part by a realized loss upon the deconsolidation with the resulting net income gain of $62.5 million. the remainder of the operating income from affiliates represents our share of the net income generated this quarter by our operating affiliates, which consist primarily of watford, coface and premia.
total investment return for our investment portfolio was de minimis on a us dollar basis for the quarter. net investment income was $88.2 million during the quarter, down by $1.2 million on a sequential basis driven by lower coupons on fixed maturities and lower income on consolidated funds. the duration of our portfolio remains low at 2.68 years at the end of the quarter, reflecting our internal view of the risk and return trade-offs in the fixed income markets.
equity in net income of investment funds accounted for using the equity method produced $105.4 million during the quarter, more than half of the total income generated by our investment portfolio and a key contributor to the growth in our book value. as we discussed on prior calls, we have increased our allocation to alternative investments in the last few years and these funds now represent approximately 12% of our total portfolio at the end of the quarter. we are also very pleased with their performance so far this year, which stands at 13% year-to-date.
of note, had we included income from funds using the equity method in our definition of operating income, our reported operating roe would have increased by 3.2% on a year-to-date basis to 13.3%. while these funds returns are potentially more volatile than core fixed income strategies, we believe the incremental returns they provide more than compensate for the liquidity constraints and volatility that are usually associated with them.
the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was a benefit of 0.7% in the quarter reflecting changes in the full year estimated tax rate, the geographic mix of our pre-tax income and then 8.2% benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. the discrete tax items in the quarter primarily relate to a partial release in a valuation allowance on certain uk deferred tax assets.
now a quick comment on the two acquisitions we closed on this quarter, westpac and somerset bridge. you will have seen that in accordance with purchase gaap, we established approximately $337.4 million of intangibles and goodwill this quarter, most of which will be amortized through our income statement going forward. to help with remodeling efforts, we now expect our amortization expense to be approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter of this year and $21 million quarterly throughout 2022.
on the capital front, we redeemed all of our outstanding series e non-cumulative preferred shares for $450 million on september 30. separately, we repurchased approximately $9.7 million common shares at an aggregate cost of $386.9 million in the third quarter. if we include the additional common shares we have purchased in the fourth quarter, the year-to-date totals are now approximately 24 million shares or 5.9% of the common shares outstanding at the beginning of the year for $917.7 million. some of the additional share repurchases in the fourth quarter were effectuated under the new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion approved by our board of directors earlier this month.
as we have said since our formation 20 years ago, our core operating principles are anchored in active cycle and capital management. we believe this quarter results demonstrates our ability to execute on this philosophy and leads us to invest in opportunities where we believe the returns are most attractive. at recent prices and with the prospect of improving returns, we believe buying back our shares continues to represent another compelling value proposition for our shareholders without compromising our capital flexibility nor lessening the quality and strength of our balance sheet.
with these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.
