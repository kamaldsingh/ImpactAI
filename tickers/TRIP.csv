[operator instructions]. our first question or comment comes from the line of deepak mathivanan from barclays. your line is open.
deepak mathivanan -- barclays -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the questions. so first, can you talk about the media -- the strategy behind the media efforts a little bit more in detail? the content, particularly on the feed, is improving steadily and we look at that very closely. and also, we noticed that you're launching some new ad units recently. although it's still in early days, what should we expect to see both in terms of product and also in terms of monetization efforts over the next few quarters that makes this a more sizable business in the next few, say, the next few years?
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks for the question. this is steve. we first kind of want to remember more than 400 million unique users, and they're almost all on our site looking for a place to go, looking for a place to stay, looking for a thing to do, a place to eat. that's an incredible amount of influence across the travel ecosystem. and as you know, we've monetized through a couple of different vehicles so far in our history, but we really don't feel we've tapped into the opportunity to better understand who these folks are so that we can segment them and offer visibility to these users across all of our endemic clients as well as non-endemic clients. so you've noticed a couple of different ad units. that's great. you'll see more custom pieces throughout the site.
you'll see more native integrated pieces. the feed will be part of that, but i wouldn't say it would be -- i wouldn't guess, as we implement new products, i wouldn't guess that it would be a majority of the new pieces. we're going where we find consumers are at a decision point. where can we inspire them -- or where can we help our clients inspire them to go to that location? and then how can we help select the right hotel, the right thing to do for them? all that comes down to new video units, better programmatic capabilities or our clients can buy easier on our platform, more ad units across all of our devices and, in general, a better targeting ad tech stack that we're already in the process of assembling.
so this is new people, relatively new effort. i should say we have a very nice display and media business, but it's a nice opportunity for us to dramatically grow that using kind of latest technology where we hadn't invested as much before. compared to some of our peers with our audience size, we see it relatively -- well, we see what we believe to be a fantastic opportunity for doubling this part of our business in the next 3 to 5 years.
deepak mathivanan -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks, steve. and then, ernst, was the 2q revenue trends in the hm&p segment a surprise to you at all? how are you thinking about it? and then looking at it in terms of the back half as well, so you're calling out returning to growth in 4q. is that primarily from comping through some of the marketing expenses? or is there any other puts and takes that's going in there as well?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
hey deepak, the -- a profit growth trend in hm&p was not a surprise to us. we continue to benefit from the optimizations that we've done around our marketing expenses. we saw continued aggressive profit improvement. first half now, we have a total of 31% ebitda growth in our hm&p segment, and q2 was very close to the 30% mark. so that was very pleasing and very strong for us. on the revenue side, we had said that we would continue to see some weakness in the overall revenue line as a result of the marketing pullback.
this quarter, we additionally saw some increased seo trends as well that we focused on. but if you look ahead for the rest of the year, in q4, we are seeing the segment go back to growth. into q1 for next year, we have fully lapped all the marketing -- the reset that we have done. we will be in the position to start growing our 8 marketing channels again, and we're forecasting to return to growth on the hm&p segment in that year. display is an additional growth driver for the back half. so it's not just comping the paid marketing spend. the display initiatives that steve was just talking about will start to kick in some extra contribution to our revenue growth as well toward the end of the year is our expectation.
deepak mathivanan -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thanks ernst.

thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of lloyd walmsley from deutsche bank. your line is open.
lloyd walmsley -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks, guys. two questions, if i can. first, can you just talk about the comments in the letter on e&d segment growth tapering and what might be driving that? and where are you in terms of driving bookings through core tripadvisor versus viator? is some of the impact competitive? or are you kind of done making tripadvisor kind of fully bookable? and then second one, just when you talk about slower demand, is that on the consumer side in terms of hotel shoppers or the advertiser side or both? any comment you can share on trends in metasearch pricing options would be great.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yes. lloyd, thank you. first of all, growth for the segment e&d in the second quarter was strong. it was 28%. but excluding the impact of currency, it was 33%. the product, supply and marketing initiatives that we're driving are progressing very nicely. pleased with that. we're making a lot of investments this year that may not necessarily impact our revenue growth this year, but it's setting us up for longer-term growth on the platform. and as you know, a huge market opportunity across both restaurant and experiences that is very untapped, 80% off-line on the experiences side. there's a couple of things this year in the revenue trends that we called out before. one is currency. obviously it's making an impact this half but also in the next half.
we've called out before that we're comping some very high growth in our -- with the new restaurant products and the restaurant media products business that we built last year, and we're comping against that particularly in the back half of the year. that was a major factor last year. but also, we had pretty explosive growth on the ta platform for experiences last year which we're comping into as well. so if you dial back from all of that, we're making huge investments for the growth here -- for the future here. and there's long-term sustainable growth that we're able to capture. we believe we're playing to win. not everything is focused on optimizing revenue this year, but we see this as a long-term growth opportunity for tripadvisor.
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
and then this is steve. when you look at the actual, what's going on, on tripadvisor, there is -- we think we're doing a much better job helping our travelers find the things that they really want to book in advance before they go. we feel there's a lot more headroom there. we're improving our, what we call, our trips functionality so you can start building more of a trip together. that needs to include and will include abilities to book fast tours, those magical moments that are part of the vacation that trip has. whether they be things sold on the platform or just the wonderful advice that you can get, it's really that full package that consider trip that allows us to shine so well, and experiences is a vital part of that.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
to your second question, lloyd, about the hotel meta option, the trends that we're seeing are on the consumer side. so on the supplier side, we've seen consistency in the bidding behavior of our partners. we've seen slower demand in paid marketing, obviously, because we are bidding less aggressively on those search terms and we're getting fewer paid customers in. and on the seo side, we made a comment that we saw some slowdown.
lloyd walmsley -- deutsche bank -- analyst
all right. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of line of mike olson from piper jaffray. your line is open.
mike olson -- piper jaffray -- analyst
good morning. others in the space continue to talk more and more about getting more aggressive in the activities and experiences segment. just wondering if you're seeing any evidence of more competition in that category or not really at this point. and then also in experiences & dining, i realized you're pushing for long-term growth with continued investment in the segment. i believe you've said in the past that you think this segment can have a margin profile that's more similar to hm&p. do you still believe that's the case? or is there anything structural that would make that more challenging?
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
mike, thanks for the question. this is steve. the focus -- the way we look at the overall experiences market is that it's really in the beginning. the demand is huge. this is a huge new category coming online. we got in really early. we have a number of other players that are also in the space. but the vast, vast majority of everything going on is still off-line, off-line in the pre-trip phase, off-line in destination, as in someone walks up and buys something. we truly believe all of that or a huge portion of that will migrate online and some of it will migrate online to our app, others for prepurchase or pre-trip activities.
we're doing our best to invest in all the different areas we need in order to capture more than our fair share of the marketplace. we fully expect all of our competitors to be on the same game plan, and the beauty is there's plenty of opportunity for there to be multiple winners in this category. we think our phenomenal traffic advantage gives us a great opportunity to do extremely well. so between traffic, between supply, between the frictionless booking platform we have now, it all works. to your second question on margin profile for the business, we're not going to be too specific, but we do believe that the margins in this category do end up looking like hotel margins have evolved to. and so we feel it's a very natural opportunity for our marketplace to consolidate the supply. and we already have huge portion of the demand, and that makes for a great business with a ton of network effects.
mike olson -- piper jaffray -- analyst
thank you.

thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of naved khan from suntrust. your line is open.
naved khan -- suntrust -- analyst
yeah. thanks a lot. another couple of questions. maybe on the hotel side, as you talked about the seo headwinds, is that -- are the seo headwinds just limited on the hotel side? or is that something you're also seeing on experiences? can you just clarify that for us? and then just based on the commentary, it just seems like if i look at the hotel's subsegment, you're going to comp the advertising cost in q1 of 2020. so is that -- when we should expect that subsegment to kind of stabilize or maybe even start seeing positive growth? what's the right way to think about that?
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, naved. this is steve. i'll take the first seo-related question. and let's start with the context that, of course, we get a lot of seo traffic across all of our business units. and it's a great way for travelers to discover tripadvisor and in everything we do. there is an effect of google and other search engines moving more and more into the travel space, and that's a bit of the hotel headwind we called out. of course, it hits all of our business units, but we continue to look at the overall positive of how this traffic finds us, how we're able to educate them on tripadvisor. and then at some point, if you want, we can go into the rest of the initiatives that we're doing to otherwise drive long-term loyal behavior of our customer base.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
to your point -- to your second question, naved, hm&p and growth in the future, yes, this year, 2019 is obviously a profit-focused year. we've been talking about the significant profits we've been driving. we have progressively throughout 2018 made improvements in our performance marketing. we're now in q1 and q2 flat on our returns there. we're happy with our returns. we're lapping into some benefit, but it's a diminishing benefit, and it should start helping revenue and our ability to start acquiring paid marketing again and grow that line. so in q1 of 2020, we will have fully lapped that, and we will be in a position to start focusing on growth in our paid marketing channels again. so we've called out, in q4, we are anticipating to go to growth for the segment. and into 2020, we're expecting growth from that segment.
naved khan -- suntrust -- analyst
okay. just a quick clarification on that. i think on the last earnings call, you spoke about some weakness in auctions in the month of april. it seems like that might have been more advertiser-driven. can you just give us some more color on how the quarter evolved and if that persisted? or what are you seeing on your end? it seems like based on data risk out of the 2 large otas, their own business seems to be seeing room nights -- at least room nights growth in the double digits. so what are you seeing on your end and how those trends improved since april?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yes. naved, what we called out is it's not, from our perspective, an advertiser-driven event. it is more about the demand side, on the one hand, us pulling back on marketing and increasing in efficiency there, which has been an impact and was an impact in q2, plus the seo challenges that steve just talked about. and so -- but we are going to lap through a lot of those changes throughout the rest of the year. and as i just had responded, we see us returning to growth for the segment by the end of the year.
naved khan -- suntrust -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of line of mark mahaney of rbc capital markets. your line is open.
analyst
great. thank you. a few questions. one, could you please talk about demand trends? you mentioned in the letter that there were softer-than-anticipated demand trends. a little bit more comment on that will be great. second, on your membership and loyal customer base. so that is very interesting. you shared some metrics around frequency as well as the ability to generate more revenue than an average user. could you talk about what you are doing in order to get more members, in order to keep them more engaged and some of the initiatives that you have taken and may take the rest of the year? and then finally, on ebitda, thank you for sharing the -- giving some color on double-digit growth rate as well as acceleration in q4 over q3 and then back half growth being less than 15%. but could you talk about how you're thinking on investing in the experiences segment? how should we think about ebitda in the back half for that segment as you invest?
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
sure. this is steve. thanks for the question. when we look at membership, we look at the ability to sign somebody up, have them use our app, have them invest a bit in the platform, that might be writing a review. it might be saving a couple of things to a trip that they want to take. we then take that information, customize our crm and our push notifications to make it highly relevant to what the customer is looking for and then encourage them to return to the site to either finish the booking process they were in the middle of or explore another adjacent activity.
you can imagine when there's someone starting on a flight or a hotel, it's a great opportunity to add a thing to do, an attraction, a private tour. there's wonderful upsell opportunities that we'll have going down the road. look, job one for us that we've been working on is making sure the messages that we're sending to people are highly relevant. we want to make sure that when they come to the site, we know more about them than just their name and ip address so that we can give great recommendations. that all drives a wonderful value proposition for members. and you combine that with our activity of soliciting membership more and you can -- and what we're happy to share is we've seen the past 4 quarters have been consecutive growth in our membership numbers, the growth, the year-on-year growth of how many new members we had each quarter.
and we're on a tear for the rest of the year. that's just one indication of how we get from the 400 million monthly new use to a more meaningful set of members who are coming back using us or letting us help them in all of their trips. that's also one aspect of how the demand question gets framed a year from now because we'll have a much more direct relationship with so many more members going forward.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
to your second question about the experiences & dining ebitda trends, this is obviously a year in which we're making investments for the future. this is a year in which ebitda in this segment is coming down year-over-year, fortunately funded by significant ebitda improvements on the hotel side. we said before and we maintain that, that although ebitda will be lower for the segment, we forecast to be positive for the year in the segment. and so going into the second quarter, expect additional -- to see additional investment in this segment.
analyst
thank you, steve and ernst. and then on demand trends that will be great and that's it for me. thanks.
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
look, we already covered some of the demand trends. and then i talked about how membership -- i didn't talk much about app download, but that will be another aspect that we're working on and have seen some nice results in order to move this demand to be more in our control. if you're referring to kind of overall travel demand in the industry, we see a number of different kind of signals out there when we look -- when we listen to other companies' comments. there's a little confusion out there, but we're seeing a reasonably good travel environment at the moment. so in our prepared remarks, we're not commenting or we're not calling out anything particularly unique in travel that's causing a big plus or a big minus for us. so we're happy with the overall environment and we're executing and putting, we think, well on our journey.
analyst
okay. that's helpful. thank you, steve.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of justin patterson from raymond james. your line is open.
justin patterson -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. i wanted to go back to the ad platform opportunity. how should we think through the investment ramp and ad tech infrastructure and the sales force as you build out this new initiative? and another big picture one, if i can. i wanted to play devil's advocate for a second. i agree you're under-indexed on media revenue versus peers. however, it's also true that you're more vertical-focused, focused on travel, whereas a lot of those peers, it's either more horizontal in nature. curious to hear how you think about that and how you think through potential ceilings on monetization.
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, justin. i love the questions. so we're fortunate enough to have resources internally on the tech side that we were able to shift over. it includes some licensing and some buys not builds. but i wouldn't phrase it as a big multi-year lift to do this because we already have $150 million-plus business built on a level of targeting and we just need to extend it, make it easier for clients to buy programmatic and then build some additional ad units, particularly video, fast-growing area where we just don't have the product offering. so i would say small tech lift there. on the sales force side, we're already very global. of course, we need to add some more folks as we reach into different sets of clients that haven't historically been advertising on our site but love the demographic that we represent.
so we're probably pretty well covered in endemic. we feel like there's a lot of opportunity outside of travel with audience targeting, as evidenced by the many other companies out there that do it pretty well. we are obviously pretty good at taking advantage of the vertical nature of our categories and we move into that transaction as we go. but of all the people that go to tripadvisor, so many are purely in the research mode and they just are not ready to buy anything. that's a beautiful aspect of our site being a funnel for many others. so for the folks that aren't ready to buy, how do we monetize the ability to influence in one direction or another?
and that's not a click off to an ota. that's not a transaction of a private tour. that's a media opportunity to help educate a consumer on all the different stuff that they really should do. so we have a ton of influence in the category. we have a ton of traffic that is looking for something around their trip. and the more information we can get about who those folks are, the better we can do for overall general targeting. i hope that was helpful.
justin patterson -- raymond james -- analyst
that was very helpful. thank you, steve.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of jed kelly from oppenheimer. your line is open.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. can you just speak on the new brand campaign, what the key message is going to be? and then can you provide any update on the amount you spent on television this quarter? and then one more, if i can. any way you can give us some kpis just around the membership opportunity in terms of percentage of maus or how many are converting to members?
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question. i'd say that i can't really share the details of the brand messaging in part because it's evolving and in part we're not ready to launch at this point. but i can tell you, it will be most likely be focused on aspects that are relatively unique to the tripadvisor value proposition versus what the other set of travel players can provide. we have done a lot of research on our travelers, the awareness we have in different markets and the irreplaceable value that we provide to so many travelers. so the brand campaign, we expect, will highlight that, delivered in unique and compelling ways across a wide variety of media.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
in terms of the spend, we spent $26 million on brand this quarter, which makes really the first half very comparable and spend almost the same as the year before. with all these changes that we're thinking about our brand advertising, it does not mean that we're increasing our budgets for it. so it shouldn't be an incremental spend now or even in the following year. we're doing this all within our existing budget.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
and should we expect to see the new television commercials this quarter?
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
no, it would be far too early. what we have going for next year is -- and i want to back up. i wouldn't phrase it as just the television effort because we really do believe that there's a host of different media opportunities available for us. and as the branding rolls out later in the year and the advertising begins probably closer to next year, maybe that will help set your expectations.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of -- we have lee horowitz from evercore isi. your line is open.
lee horowitz -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. i just wanted to dig in a little bit on the seo headwinds that you guys had called out. obviously, google has been moving more aggressively into travel products for a long time now. and i was wondering what may be different in this quarter that warranted a headwind or impacted your business in a more meaningful way.
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
sure. so back up, we actually grew seo traffic in 2018. that was -- i've mentioned many times, it is getting a lot harder due to google pushing their own products. and by the way, we think it's entirely appropriate for regulators to be looking into this practice. but frankly, we're focused on what we can do about it. this past quarter, they did a few things on the hotel front which hurt a bit more than usual, but we've been working on a handful of initiatives, some of which we've already covered to counter that for a while. so as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, member growth, app usage, building a stronger direct relationship with the travelers, new branding campaign, these are the sorts of things that we look to drive that deep consumer relationship that, while we love the google traffic, while we love all search engine and all social traffic as well, we're looking -- we've been implementing and have more on the horizon initiatives that enable us to own the relationship in a tighter way.
lee horowitz -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks for the time.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of james lee of mizuho securities. your line is open.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking my questions. a couple of questions here. just want to dig a little bit deeper about the trends in the second half here. last quarter, you mentioned for the hotel and media business, you're expecting growth in the second half, kind of implying third quarter will be growing. i wonder what has changed. is it more due to maybe the external environment where you see demand overall for travel is weak? or is it more due to internal decision where you want to cut down marketing expenses as a result of revenues coming down?
and secondly, also on digital advertising, i'm sure you guys know it's obviously a pretty competitive space. and i was wondering, what new products are coming up that you feel confident that is differentiated? and does the confidence that you put in this product include the news feed product advertising that we've been talking about the last couple of quarters? and how should we think about the growth rate for hotel and media business going to 2020?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
i'll start with the first part of the question. so this year has been a year in which growth in our hotels, media & platform business has been impacted by our decision to optimize the marketing expenditure, and that has been a major impact on the growth rates, as we've been calling out throughout, as we believe those will start to abate by the end of the year and fully lapping in the first quarter. so from that, we're expecting improvement. we are seeing growth for the first time to return in that segment in the first quarter, and then we're well set up for the period and beyond. you want to take the second, steve?
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
yes. and so for the media growth opportunity, as i've mentioned, new video ad units, better programmatic access to specific audience, us understanding our own data in conjunction with other data, which i'll just call it more enhanced segmentation allowing advertisers to buy that specific audience that they want, and some of this -- or i might argue, most of this is not actually rocket science. it's just an area that we have not invested in, in the past. and so with the new level of focus, we've already seen some modest results. we rolled out a couple of additional products.
we mentioned there's some other ad products that are in beta now, be able to sponsor a location or sponsor the discovery of a location. and there are just a lot of both untapped media dialers in travel or endemic category and then a wide-open opportunity. of course, we have competition with that opportunity, but we have a ton of first-party data unique to our massive audience at a global scale. and that makes us a particularly nice compelling ad buy for quite a few folks looking for an extremely brand-safe environment.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. any commentary on growth rate for hotel and media business 2020?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
sorry, can you repeat the question? sorry.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
yes. any commentary on the revenue growth rate for hotel and media business for 2020?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yes. as we said, we are expecting to return to growth. it's a little early to be more specific than that. we'll do that in the quarters to come. we obviously have highlighted the various puts and takes there, the return to a more level-playing field around the marketing efficiencies and as well as the ambition we have in the media space, which we believe we can at least double in the next three or five years.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of kevin kopelman from cowen & company. your line is open.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks a lot. i just had a follow-up on the hm&p revenue guide. so the second quarter was down, the revenue was down 4% ex currency, and it looks like you're expecting that to grow year-over-year in the fourth quarter. so in the interim, can you talk about how q3 is looking for hm&p? do you think it will be better than q2? or will you see the full quarter of seo headwinds making it similar or worse than q2?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
without putting too fine a point on it, we -- q3 will be still a quarter in which we will have significantly lower marketing expense, which will be great for profitability, but it's still slowing the recovery of revenue growth. so q3 will be another quarter in which we experience that. really, in q4, we see the more meaningful start of the lap of the marketing performance, and that's why we call out q4 as the moment where the segment can come to growth.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. great. that's helpful. and then -- and on that q4, the confidence there in returning to growth, is that really across the segment? and how much of it is driven by what you anticipate in the display side for the fourth quarter versus really the display and also the tripadvisor-branded hotels?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yes. it's a combination of the increased lapping into the marketing performances that we will see. but also, we have some exciting things in the works on the media side, and we expect positive impact from that in q3 and more in q4.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. great. and just one other just quick follow-up. talked about the kind of seo headwinds. it sounds like it started or maybe exacerbated kind of mid-quarter in the second quarter. have you ever seen seo-driven revenue down before? or 2019, would you expect that to be the first year that that's happened?
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
we've seen our growth rates decelerate over the years, but i've kind of been talking about this for quite a while as google continues to move into travel. the notion comes back to, with this trend that's been going on for several years, how we take control of that customer -- control is perhaps a bad word, how we help that customer and encourage the relationships so that they continually come back to us. and with our growth in membership, it becomes, as we mentioned in our published remarks, the improved repeat rate, the improved monetization and the improved loyalty to tripadvisor. and so we're particularly excited about the growth in our membership numbers. you should expect more from us in that store, and that helps address a number of the other concerns around the business.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of brent thill from jefferies. your line is open.
stanislav nikolaev -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. this is stan for brent. i was just wondering from what you know so far about your brand spend, is it helping drive more incremental traffic to the platform? or it's mostly shifting traffic from paid to direct channels?
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question. it's hard for us to know that because we're blessed with so much traffic in so many of our points of sale, and our pure branding campaigns tend to be in our larger markets. it's a little hard to -- we know we are getting some additional audience, but the purpose of the campaign was really to drive different behavior of the people who already knew us. and so we've seen consistent improvement in conversion on our things-to-do section on tripadvisor. some of that is going to be the brand campaign. some of that is going to be converted on the site, better implementations, better supply. teasing out the difference is hard, but we know the brand campaigns have been helping on the tripadvisor point of sale.
stanislav nikolaev -- jefferies -- analyst
i got it. and one more question. can you give us some color on international trends? any specific markets or regions to call out?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
nothing really to highlight at this point. we see pretty uniform trends across the globe at this point. we called out in the past that we saw some softness particularly in europe. that has started to converge. so we don't see a particular area, and we see actually the upside from all the initiatives that we are currently deploying in all our markets across the world.
steve kaufer -- chief executive officer
great. thank you very much.

operator
good morning and welcome to tripadvisor's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]. at this time i would like to turn the conference call over to tripadvisor's vice president of investor relations mr. will lyons. please go ahead.
will lyons -- vice president of investor relation
thanks victor. good morning everyone and welcome to our call. joining me today are ceo stephen kaufer; cfo ernst teunissen; president of hotels kanika soni; and president of core experience lindsay nelson. last night after market closed we distributed and filed our third quarter 2019 earnings release and we made available our prepared remarks on our investor relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com. in the release you will find reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures discussed on this call. you will also find supplemental financial information which includes certain non-gaap financial measures discussed on this call as well as other performance metrics.
before we begin, i'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's views as of today, november 7, 2019. tripadvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. please refer to our earnings release as well as our filings with the sec for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. now here is steve who will share a few thoughts before we open the call up to questions.
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
thank you will and good morning everyone. q3 was more difficult than we had anticipated and this has somewhat dampened our outlook for the remainder of the year. however we are taking action: first we are focused on driving nonauction revenue growth and continue to make excellent early progress on a number of growth initiatives; second we are evaluating our cost structure and we'll prudently reduce and reallocate expenses in certain parts of our business to preserve strong profitability while investing in strategic growth areas; and third we are returning more capital to shareholders including declaring a special dividend of $3.50 per share and increasing our existing share repurchase authorization to $250 million.
in sum, we are allocating our resources and our capital prudently and have the flexibility both now and in the future to simultaneously invest in growth areas, fund opportunistic m&a and return cash to shareholders to drive long-term shareholder value. we are also very excited to have entered into a strategic partnership with trip.com group, an important step to further strengthen our position as a global travel leader. now as many of you know during the past 12 months we focused on building the leadership team we need in order to execute against attractive long-term opportunity and welcome 2 talented and experienced leaders for our -- for this next stage in our company's growth. i'm very pleased to have kanika soni our president of hotels; and lindsay nelson our president of core experience joining us today during q&a to discuss these initiatives aimed at deepening customer engagement on our platform and monetizing tripadvisor's influence.
we'll now open up the call for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from line of deepak mathivanan from barclays. you may begin.
deepak mathivanan -- barclays -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the questions. i understand that it's a highly fluid dynamic. but on your 4q commentary and then also in 2020 is there a scenario that could cause 4q to be worse than 3q? or is the benefit of lapping the marketing optimization powerful enough to offset any traffic headwinds? how should we think about this in 2020 in the hotel hm&p business? and then second question. can you give a little bit more color about what steps you are taking to scale the nonauction advertising unit? is the operational efforts that's involved largely related to hiring ad sales teams? or what else is required before we see that business reach meaningful scale as a bigger part of revenues?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
deepak this is ernst. we have indeed in our prepared remarks said that we expect q4 trends to be -- improve versus q3. there is a lapping of the optimizations that you mentioned. there are also the nonauction revenue items in our hm&p segment that we will talk about a little bit more where we expect a meaningful contribution now from these new initiatives that we have started in q4. so even with the trends in the core auction as they are we believe we can improve the revenue performance versus q3. previous quarter we thought we would actually get to growth year-over-year in hm&p. we said this quarter that given the more recent trends we don't believe that is likely. but we do believe -- still believe that it's going to narrow -- the negative growth is going to narrow in the fourth quarter. what about 2020?
the -- we expect continued improvement into 2020. we are going to continue to see benefits from these nonauction revenue items. we are also next year no longer disadvantaged from the year-over-year trends in paid marketing. we're at this point prudently not putting a fine point on when we expect hm&p would go back to growth but somewhere in 2020 is our expectation. on nonauction i'll actually pass that on to both kanika and lindsay to talk more about. but as i said nonauction is an area where we expect not only in q4 to see initial positive impact. but as we look ahead to the future that is an area where we can drive double-digit growth in those revenue lines. and so we're excited to see that happen. and maybe lindsay you can kick off what we're doing on the display media side.
lindsay nelson -- president of core experience business unit
yes deepak. thanks for the question. so we've been working on growing the media business for the last six months or so addressing some infrastructure and capabilities over the past few months. we actually as you know already sit on a fairly large sales organization and we're on the other side of a reorg that we executed at the beginning of this quarter. so we expect to get some additional leverage out of that current sales team. of course next year as we look to expand our customer base we'll look to bring on additional sales folks. but we're actually pretty pleased with some of the investments that we've already made. just this quarter alone we've rolled out 10 new products to the market and we're already seeing some really great traction and some promising pipeline there.
we're also focused on some other leading indicators like growing inventory. we have a tremendous amount of capacity on the platform that we're looking to unlock and we've already grown monetizable inventory by double digits. we're also focused on expanding the customer base and i think one of the things we're really proud of is we have 189 new advertisers this quarter alone which i think demonstrates that both our audience our platform and our marketing solutions are attractive to not only marketers within the travel category but also marketers in finance food and beverage auto. and then finally we're focused on really making sure that we're doing a good job of expressing our value proposition to partners. and we're starting to see the results of that work by growing our average deal size. so certainly more work to be done. but we have a large team today. we have a lot of capabilities today. and our outlook on the future remains unchanged.
kanika soni -- president of hotels business unit
great. and i'll take the b2b side. we obviously have a very healthy business today there. as ernst mentioned our b2b business is growing by double digits already driven mostly by sponsored placement which is on track to achieve -- to double in size this year. that's a very solid foundation for us to be building from and i remain very bullish on the space and the opportunity that this segment presents. as we look into the future we've outlined 3 key priorities for this part of the business and we're actually making great strides against each of those priorities. number one we want to execute with a very partner-first lens. and while that sounds very simple it's actually a pretty big cultural shift within the organization for us.
and to that end lindsay touched on this earlier as well we've done a pretty big sales reorganization with the sole objective of creating single point of accountability at the partner level across our portfolio of products. we believe this will give us visibility and better visibility into partner needs and priorities and really allow us to bring products to market that fit their needs. number two we want to focus on innovation and speed and that means rapid deployments more upgrades more features as far as our existing products go. and at the same time also maintaining an ongoing pipeline of new products. and with that in -- with that as an objective and goal in mind we aim to bring 2 new products to market in 2020.
we also want to create new sources of value for our partners which means looking more holistically and taking a wider lens and a broader lens to how we serve our partners and the value that we create in extending that value to beyond direct bookings. so again b2b as lindsay mentioned on the media side more work to go but we've got a lot of the foundational pieces in place already. a great business to work from and we remain really excited about continuing to leverage our assets to build and grow in this segment.
deepak mathivanan -- barclays -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from the line of lloyd walmsley from deutsche bank. you may begin.
lloyd walmsley -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks. two if i can. first maybe for steve or ernst. on the e&d segment just curious if you can explain a bit more about why you'd be reducing investment in what seems like a pretty strategic growth area for the company one where you guys have an advantage now. do you worry about underinvesting there if you're looking to cut back? and then secondly lindsay and kanika great to have you on the call. a very helpful background already you guys have shared with us. but maybe you can talk about some of the things you're most excited about in terms of the expanded ad units on the site? and then how meaningful do you guys think this can get to in the revenue mix some of the new stuff you all are working on?
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
super. thanks lloyd. this is steve. i'll take the e&d one. we look back at the level of investment that we've applied to both experiences & dining over the past four or five years and say it's been incredibly beneficial to the company. we moved into these huge categories that the tam is wonderful we've talked a lot about that. and we've invested quite heavily i -- and we absolutely believe it was the right thing to do. we continue to invest in both of these areas. and so what we're really talking about is shifting some of that investment from the building of supply and you guys can all see the fantastic results of that to leveraging the demand that we already have speaking specifically of experiences of course.
tripadvisor has hundreds of millions of travelers each and every month planning this considered trip and finding that great thing to do is part of that equation. and so with the supply i'd say with a firm lead with excellent connectivity with a rebuild tech stack in many different parts we can say excellent job team internally and now we can work on the demand side converting the demand that's already on trip that's already on viator that's already flowing through our third parties into finding the right product for the right individual. it's a personalized recommendation. it's a frictionless consumer path. it's the right reminders in trip and preplanning all to help. so i -- when we look cost-wise we see the opportunity to help move folks from essentially the back end the supply piece toward the conversion end to really help address the customer needs.
i -- that's not unusual in terms of when one builds up a marketplace. you have to have enough supply in order to make the match. now that we feel we do have enough supply in almost all parts of the world it's our opportunity to make that demand match off of the traffic that i like to remind people we already have on our points of sale. for us it's not really a question of figuring out how to go find the traffic. we have the hundreds of millions of visitors monthly already looking for something to do on a considered trip.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and i would add from the competitive lens competitors are investing as well. but we were early at this game and we've invested way ahead of the competition so far. as steve was saying we have the largest supply base. and so we feel we have invested sufficiently and will continue to invest sufficiently. but we can tailor some of that expense and we can actually reduce in some areas where we have maybe overbuilt a little and it can direct that toward other growth initiatives. and then to point out versus our competition we have some assets that some of our competitors may not have. we have the vast tripadvisor audience not only on our things to do pages and restaurant pages but also the ability to cross-sell from an entire travel experience perspective. and so we think we have some really important demand assets and it's not just a dollar number as well.
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
maybe for the expanded ad units and those opportunities i'll refer over to lindsay.
lindsay nelson -- president of core experience business unit
thanks. so there's a lot of things that i am excited about around our media business but i'll try and narrow in around 3 areas. i think one of the things that's super interesting about my job is i both oversee our marketing budget and i have folks inside of that organization thinking about customer segmentation thinking about creativity thinking about roas and those same people sit in the same organization as our sales organization who's trying to build solutions for marketers. and my litmus test when joining the company is would i invest tripadvisor's marketing dollars on tripadvisor? and i can say the answer is now yes.
and the things that i get most excited about are are we enabling premium programmatic? and that's because marketers want to transact programmatically because it gives them increased visibility into all of their data and customer segmentation. and we should be able to enable that kind of transactional buying without have to sacrifice creative excellence and that's an area that we're putting a lot of attention in. the second is leveraging our first-party data. we have a huge push on the consumer experience side around personalization and loyalty. the more we understand the traveler the better we can serve them. and we can also take advantage of that data by turning those travelers into customer segments that are incredibly important to our partners but also incredibly proprietary to tripadvisor.
i think we have one of the most robust and important first-party datasets where we have an understanding not only who you are where do you live what's your affluence what are your preferences how big is your family size what are your travel patterns do you tend to fly do you tend to drive and those are all signals that our marketers want access to. and so we're doing some of the technical lift in infrastructure work to be able to enable that kind of segmentation which i think is really great. and the third is which i think is also pretty unusual for us is how do we connect -- sort of the ultimate challenge for most marketers right now is thinking about the relationship between brand building and performance marketing and we're also thinking about that.
on the marketing side is how do you stitch those strategies together and understand how both of those budgets can actually leverage one another. and so while we have historically worked with a lot of our travel partners in the performance marketing space we're really excited to work with them on the brand building front but also connect those 2 streams together so that they can have a clear understanding of not -- of both the performance and the outcomes but also how those channels are actually quite complementary.
lloyd walmsley -- deutsche bank -- analyst
that's really helpful. thank you all.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of naved khan from suntrust. you may begin.
naved khan -- suntrust -- analyst
yeah. thanks a lot. i have a few questions. just maybe on the hotel business. maybe steve maybe can you talk a little bit about the incrementality of the headwinds? it just seems like things may have gotten a little worse but was it related to the changes that google might have made to the offering? or was it just a result of something that might have happened in the quarter before that? so just give us some sense of that. and maybe if you can go into some detail about what exactly are the kind of changes that google is making that would be helpful.
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
sure. thanks naved. i -- so yes unfortunately we did see some incremental seo headwinds over the course of the quarter. i -- it's always hard to know exactly what google is doing. we think of it as how far down the page are we -- is our organic result. and i think you're seeing this across the industry as google has gotten more aggressive. i -- we've been predicting this of course for the past many years. we talked about on our last call there's -- we know that this seo piece is an ongoing trend and we're not predicting that it's going to turn around. having said that we're doing a better and better job of making or helping our travelers find the right hotel when they're in hotel shopping mode. and then our focus around the whole tripadvisor brand is enabling folks and offering many more reasons why they want to come back to tripadvisor to plan the considered trip and then that hotel shopping part of that entire trip flows out the bottom as added benefit to tripadvisor.
as we with the brand positioning as we with our crm efforts as we with our loyalty programs get better and better at that we have the opportunity to return the auction itself to growth. over the shorter term we've talked more and more about these nonauction revenue sources including media including hotel b2b restaurants experiences the sets of things that are already growing for us and that we feel all have clear double-digit growth ahead to make up for anything that comes our way in google headwinds.
naved khan -- suntrust -- analyst
so that's helpful. so last night we also heard from expedia talking about similar issues. and they talked about spending more on paid advertising. is there sort of a secondary effect where the otas which are one of the sort of large advertisers on your platform might also be spending more with you overtime? or do you see any sort of secondary benefits from this -- from the google changes?
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
so those are pretty -- it's a great question. those are pretty hard for us to measure. we've seen a pretty stable environment from our key partners in the hotel auction over this year. and of course they have many places many choices in which to spend their performance dollars. as lindsay and kanika would add by making our offering that much more valuable by qualifying the traffic on our site before we send it downstream to an ota by helping otas get their brand message across on our platform there's still a we feel wonderful opportunity to help our clients in lots of ways not just with the individual clicks on our platform today.
naved khan -- suntrust -- analyst
one last question if i may. and this is on -- so congrats on the ctrip partnership and on getting them potentially over time as an investor in tripadvisor. i just wanted to sort of get more context around the deal. how quickly did it come around? and then just in regards to the dividend payout why did -- how do you decide? or why did you choose a dividend versus just doing a share buyback?
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
sure. i'll take the first part on the deal with trip.com group. they've certainly been a partner of ours for many many years. we've operated tripadvisor china for quite some time and they've been a fantastic partner for us there. we feel like we've done a good job in china. but when we look at the size of the -- especially the outbound travel audience where outbound is where our content excels i -- we thought partnering up with trip.com group in this manner offered a much better much more global much more exciting opportunity for all parties.
and certainly the combination of our strength in outbound content global content their strength in so many things including the eyeballs of the domestic chinese traveler made for a -- just a fantastic strategic partnership. so we do have lots of excitement around the jv. we welcome them pending regulatory approval on to our board. i -- and feel like there's many opportunities ahead.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yes naved on the dividend and the buyback we are obviously very cash generative and we have a significant cash balance. we had last quarter over $900 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet have no long-term debt and have been generating very attractive profit levels and good flow-through to free cash flow. we have from time to time used our proceeds for m&a and we continue to see an opportunity for m&a in sort of targeted selected areas. but even taking that into account in a recent review we think we have significant cash on our balance sheet that we could return to our shareholders and we thought this quarter was a good opportunity to start returning some cash to shareholders.
we thought dividend was an attractive way of doing that at scale in a relatively short period of time. you've also seen that the -- our board approved a further capacity for buyback. we're now back up to $250 million of buyback capacity and so we have that in place as well. and as we look forward yes we will continue to have room for m&a but we think dividends and buybacks are attractive opportunities for us to return cash to shareholders as well.
naved khan -- suntrust -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you, steve. thank you, ernest
operator
our next question will come from the line of tom white from d.a. davidson. you may begin.
tom white -- d.a. davidson -- anlayst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. i think in the letter you talked about membership growth and how it's accelerated. i was hoping you could just elaborate a bit on your initiatives there how you're driving that growth. and maybe if possible give us a sense of how that impacts the revenue model be it better pricing because of more data that sort of thing? and then just secondarily one of your peers in the space last night talked about sort of adr softness sort of broadly. i was curious if you'd seen any evidence of that impacting your business.
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
sure. so thanks tom. this is steve. i'll take the membership growth piece. i -- when you dial it up and look at our overall strategy and as we've spoken about this before it does center around inviting more people to join tripadvisor become loyal plan that considered trip not just the hotel not just the attraction not just the restaurant but really the entire package. having someone as a member and then a loyal member is a fantastic way to be able to reach out communicate with them and help them throughout the different planning phases of the journey. frankly it's a little less interesting if it's a single one-night stay somewhere. but if you're planning that week-long trip somewhere there really are quite a few different aspects of the trip that we can help with.
becoming a member telling us something about yourself the type of trip when you're going obviously where you're going the sorts of things that we might learn about you we believe helps cement that loyalty to tripadvisor that reason to come back specifically to tripadvisor because we know you and hopefully we know you better than anyone else. i -- the amount of traffic that we have coming to our site every single day affords us the opportunity unlike many other sites out there to offer reasons to join today and build upon the membership and the benefits of membership over time. i'll turn it to lindsay if she wants to comment on the revenue opportunities on that membership piece.
lindsay nelson -- president of core experience business unit
yes. i think you have to think about membership holistically and it starts becoming a virtuous cycle. we sit on a tremendous amount of members today mailable numbers but that we've had a crm strategy and tech stack that isn't meeting our needs and doesn't enable to -- enable us to drive personalized communication. and what we know is that the more personalized we get the better the results the more revenue we drive. and that includes not only an email communication but also the on-site experience. and so i don't think you can think about membership by just looking at one piece right? there's the registration component how do we onboard more members? when we onboard you as a member what do we know about you?
and how do we get more sophisticated at getting members to share information with us that we can then turn around and deliver a better on-site experience and more relevant communication. and then finally over time how do we create enough of a value exchange that's going to drive the direct individual relationship that we aspire to. and that's a platform strategy which includes some of the work that we're doing around the native app so how do we close the gap between tripadvisor and our users? and that first and foremost starts with having a unique enough and valuable enough experience that you can't get anywhere else.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and on your question about adr softness tom that some have commented on yes we run on the hotel side we run an auction. and obviously what impacts our partners will impact us and especially what impacts our 2 biggest partners. we've called out at various points some of the macro trends that we've seen either regionally what's going on in different regions and softness in certain regions and adr is another area that's being talked about. so that makes an impact on us obviously we're calling out the google impact on this call because it's the most impactful one. but the general macro travel environment and currency are also factors that play into our results.
tom white -- d.a. davidson -- anlayst
okay. thanks very much.
operator
and our next question will come from the line of mike olson from piper jaffray. your may begin.
mike olson -- piper jaffray. -- analyst
hey, good morning. i have two questions. when looking at the potential for cost structure changes that you mentioned maybe could you just provide any early thoughts on what kinds of cost cutting might be considered? and maybe how many changes on that front could be done without potentially impacting top line growth? and then second related to experiences you mentioned having a strong set of supply and now focusing more on conversion. does that kind of imply that competitively you're just not really seeing anyone else out there that has anywhere close to your supply in that category? or i guess maybe you can just tell us what are you seeing competitively there?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
mike this is ernst. on the cost saving and some detail there as we outlined in our prepared remarks we see 3 areas where we can reduce cost from our run rate. and one is on the e&d side. and steve alluded that to maybe reorienting from supply more to demand growth. the second area is generally a targeted reductions of cost and overheads that we see -- can see across the business and we see opportunity for across the business. and third is to look at our brand budget. we're revamping our brand strategy for next year and we think there are opportunities for us to do that more cost efficiently going into the next year.
so if you look at that together this is sort of early days but what we are currently sort of anticipating is to take a meaningful call it $60 million $80 million out of our run rate and use that to fund some of the growth areas and we don't think we need all of that to fund some of the growth areas which are in the area of our media business in the area of building membership in the area of our restaurant solutions business and in the area of our hotel b2b. and we think that is a prudent measure to take at this point. we are looking at the headwind which is not just a revenue headwind but obviously a profit headwind that we see in our auction right now. and we don't know if that extrapolates into next year and if that is -- how much of a headwind that is next year. but we prudently just assume it is and therefore we're taking measures to protect our ebitda because that's very important to us.
we want to continue to drive strong ebitda and these cost measures are our way to achieve that for us. and obviously what we're doing is we're looking across our cost base and say how can we do this with minimal impact to revenue? how can we take out areas of cost that do not directly drive revenue and where we think the line to even long-term revenue is a little bit tenuous. and so that's our focus point there. and we anticipate therefore this largely will allow us to fund other areas.
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
this is steve. i'll take the experiences question. so i do want to be clear. i think we've done a fantastic job exceeding many of our own expectations in terms of how quickly we've been able to grow supply over the past couple of years. and we are not by any stretch of the imagination stopping the onboarding of additional supply in all of our markets. the opportunity however is to slow down a bit on the supply because we feel we already have a ton of great stuff to offer to our consumers and shift more toward the conversion shift more toward discovery shift more toward making sure we're presenting the right inventory at the right time.
in terms of competition there's certainly that there is competition on the demand side and there's competition in the sort of ota for attractions that's out there and they each have different angles of where they might be particularly strong in supply. and i -- we respect those competitors immensely. but we are the ones that have such an incredible amount of demand already -- people travelers already planning a leisure trip looking for something to do and we have we believe a plenty big enough supply footprint to satisfy most of that demand. we need to become better at matching that demand. you hear us talk about membership and loyalty the site experience how do you discover this and to reiterate of course we will continue to be adding supply to the equation. we're not stopping but it's just no longer our -- one of our primary focal points for the coming year.
mike olson -- piper jaffray. -- analyst
thank you.

and our next question will come from the line of mark mahaney from rbc capital markets. you may begin.
mark mahaney -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you. this is shweta for mark. a few quick ones please. for restaurants is this similar to experiences? bookable restaurants and diners both grew at a pretty healthy clip. what are you most focused on in terms of -- are you focused on growing more restaurants? improving the product for diners? improving conversion? where do you see most opportunity there? and then the second one is on m&a. you called it out you're looking at it. what categories are you targeting and you're sort of looking at? and then finally on display. is display revenue expected to double in the next three to five years? are you reiterating that? just following up on what you said last quarter.
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
thanks shweta. this is steve. i'll take the restaurant question. we certainly expect to continue to grow supply grow seated diners in all of our markets. i -- it is an area where again we continue to grow across all dimensions key focus for us is building the habit. most of the transaction most of the seated diner growth comes from our mobile offerings. that's to be expected. and the more habit we can build among more people the better off. to build a habit you have to have a terrific supplied footprint. that's what we have so we'll continue to expand that. but if you ask me which is kind of the most important habit repeat visits loyal users and you get that by driving supply focus points.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and in terms of m&a categories we think across our nonauction revenue growth areas. we have the ability to grow without m&a and we have a lot of capabilities that we have or can build. but complementary m&a in these areas may make sense from time to time. and so that's -- those are the areas that we look at. in terms of your question on display yes we said we expect the business to double in the next three to five years and we continue to do so. i think what lindsay was describing before is the team is fully focused on that is rolling out new products and sees a lot of opportunity. and we continue to think that is well within our reach.
mark mahaney -- rbc capital markets -- analyst

maybe following up on the last one just sort of asking it from a little bit different question. and maybe steve i don't know if you could take this but how do you think sort of broadly about the competition you're seeing from google at the top of the funnel and the competition for direct traffic at the bottom of the funnel from the otas and whether the broader sort of better travel advertising layer of the industry needs a pretty-extensive consolidation to sort of have much more scale or interesting dynamics in the auction and the ability to sort of reclaim some of the dynamic that existed in the industry sort of three, five, seven years ago?
just kind of curious broadly like your big picture view on that sort of consolidation between google at the top and sort of the otas at the bottom as a potential way to create shareholder value. and then you made a lot of changes to the property make it a little more social a little more interactive over the last 12 months. i don't think it was talked about earlier in the call but any sense you give us on what that's doing for engagement or session length or sort of broad engagement trends you're seeing with your users as they come to the site that might lead to better conversion over time?
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
sure eric. a great question certainly something we think about all the time. we are blessed by having such an incredible footprint of traffic a global brand and a trusted brand. so when folks all over the world are looking for that considered trip for that special vacation they're turning to tripadvisor. they may find us through a variety of different channels but it really is tripadvisor that they're looking for. when we think of the specifics of hey how do you compete with a hotel meta auction against all of the sets of the competitors including google? that's a challenge. there's a lot -- google is up-funnel from us. the otas are some of our biggest clients also have meta engines of their own. our answer is to be not the world's -- not for people to think of us as a metasearch engine for hotels but to think of us as a site to plan an amazing vacation.
and that's not the space that others occupy. you can't go to a google or an ota or any of our incredibly strong competitors and look for recommendations from people like you about where to go and how to maximize your precious vacation time. tripadvisor with the size of our footprint with the content that we have with the recommendations that we make today with our different sort orders and going forward with what we'll be able to do going down the road we think remains the category of 1 in the ecosystem. i -- so in summary we already have the scale so it's not a scale issue. competing in the individual category case that's challenging because you do have niche players and you do have google top-of-funnel from us. but as a considered trip as planning the whole vacation we believe we are the ones best suited to address that need. when it comes to how we do that we've done a number of things.
our review count continues to grow. i -- our -- we have a number of social features on the site for the folks that are looking for that type of inspiration. and then i pull us back to our growth in membership because when we query our audience when we do our user feedback survey everyone continues to tell us we love the recommendations especially when they are people like me helping take me where i want to go have an amazing time. and the social connection combines extremely nicely with the trust that people already have in the tripadvisor brand and the fact that it's not just a magic algorithm it's real people behind the content helping you do that trip. that's where you'll see us continue to focus in the coming year and multiple years because we believe it is truly a differentiator between what tripadvisor has and the set of competitors that you named and whatever new competitors arise over the next decade.
eric sheridan -- ubs -- analyst
thanks so much.
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from the line of doug anmuth from jp morgan. you may begin.
doug anmuth -- jp morgan -- analyst
good morning. this is dae on for doug. first on last quarter you wrote about reimagining your tripadvisor app. and this quarter you gave a timing around the release. i appreciate the clarity on when we can see the change. i was curious to hear what change we should be expecting to see? what you're trying to looking to improve from your current app? and then secondly on buyback. it's good to see additional authorization but just curious to hear why you didn't buy back shares year-to-date? and how we should think about the cadence of buyback going forward?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
all right. lindsay you want to take the first?
lindsay nelson -- president of core experience business unit
yes. so i can take the app. so as we shared we expect to release a new native app sometime in the middle of next year. there's a number of things that we hope the new native strategy will deliver on some really practical ones like speed and performance how do we make the app just faster and more lightweight so that it can address the on-the-go use case. we plan to focus a lot on just enhancing and modernizing the user experience. how do we make it so easy and intuitive to plan your entire trip whether you're moving from the app and back to desktop or moving back into email. so we have a focus on user experience and also planning tools how do we help you save the things that you're excited to go do and deliver back to you when you reopen the app those ideas. we also are really optimistic about the commercial opportunity. historically we haven't had much display advertising -- or we actually had no display advertising in the native app until recently. so we're excited to build both the consumer strategy and the commercial strategy together. and we think there's a lot of opportunity to leverage the unique data that you can only get on a mobile device.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and in terms of buyback year-to-date we have a continuous dialogue here internally and with our board about capital allocation. and we look at what m&a pipeline do we see ahead of us or maybe even what transactions are ongoing versus returning cash to shareholders. and that year-to-date didn't conclude in a buyback. but as we've outlined clearly this quarter we're leaning in more on shareholder returns with the dividend and also with the expansion of the buyback capacity.
doug anmuth -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from the line of kevin kopelman from cowen and co. you may begin.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, thanks a lot. just had a couple of follow-ups on some of the seo dynamics that you mentioned that are being going on here in the industry this quarter. so first within the context of seo having been pressured for a number of years can you just give us a sense of -- have you -- if you've seen any stabilization in recent weeks following the kind of mid-quarter deterioration in seo? are you seeing the kind of current wave of seo deterioration continuing to develop or get worse to date?
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
this is steve. it's always kind of hard to tell. these things don't tend to drop off a cliff on one particular day. and so i couldn't comment on anything in -- over the past couple of weeks. we've forecasted in general where we think seo is going to go going forward. i -- and we don't see any reason to think that the trends will be different in terms of google continuing to take more and more space in the search results. we believe our strategy around diversifying the hm&p revenue stream off of the auction onto other pieces combined with our other segments combined with the holistic bringing the tripadvisor story around the considered trip for which the hotel auction and everything else will benefit is our way forward in light of these ongoing seo headwinds.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
steve that's helpful. and then just one more follow-up. can you give us an update on seo -- your seo exposure as a percentage of overall trip revenue today?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yes we're not going to be getting precise on the percentage of seo but it's a significant minority of our auction revenue.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks guys.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of james lee from mizuho securities. you may begin.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my questions. steve a follow-up question on jv with trip.com here. and maybe help us understand a little bit besides tripadvisor china any other assets you're putting to jv? and also what does ctrip bring to the table into the jv? and what do you foresee as the key synergy between the 2 companies? and what are you hoping to achieve on the longer term? and on the same topic question for ernst. how should we think about the assumption on valuation for the jv specifically? is it fair to say you're effectively selling 60% of tripadvisor china and -- which enable you to highlight your asset value and also letting ctrip run the business more effectively?
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
thanks james for the question. so i -- ctrip is certainly contributing not only cash but really their expertise in identifying what's going on in the china market especially toward outbound. they have a ton of experience on the user profiling side on the understanding what that customer segment wants as well as sort of best-in-class booking capabilities across the board. i think tripadvisor to the flip side brings an intense and insane amount of relevant content for the traveler no matter where they're going. and so when you combine those 2 strengths into this tripadvisor china opportunity we feel the possibility for that jv entity to really become a much more meaningful player in the china travel ecosystem emerges. and that's something that i don't -- that tripadvisor i don't think would have been able to do on our own. ctrip doesn't have historically the type of content play especially for outbound that tripadvisor brings to the table. so the long-term goal it's not confusing it's being able to take the assets that both parties bring to the table and create something really magical doing a fantastic job serving that outbound traveler.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yes. in terms of valuation it's going to be a valuable company going forward. as steve was describing there's cash going in there's assets going in our brand is going in content and the vast expertise that we have and trip.com group has specifically around china. and so we think that is a company a joint venture set up for success in china. we've been in china ourselves for a while and we bring a lot to bear in china. but we have on our own not been able to be a significant player and this jv has more of a chance to become that. so we're very excited about our opportunity to do that together with ctrip.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
okay. great. and let me ask a follow-up question on experiences here. i think ernst you talked about shifting investment to more on the demand side as opposed to supply side. maybe steve you said the same thing too. and maybe give us more color on what investment you're making here? are you increase your bookable supply so remove the friction for consumer to book the experience they are looking for? or are you changing the user interface on your various property to make that more seamless from a consumer perspective? or are you investing promotion and marketing for customer acquisitions on to your websites? and help us understand that a little bit.
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
sure. i think we have the opportunity to do many of those things. i'd say our focus would be helping the travelers that are currently looking for things to do helping our -- that are on tripadvisor and viator today helping the travelers that are already planning a considered trip be matched with the right set of bookable inventory that we probably already have. but as i said if we feel we are missing something key i mean that's an ongoing process to go add that to the platform. but whereas we're very happy with our triple-digit bookable supply inventory growth that's not the core metric -- that's not one of the core metrics that we will be chasing in years to come as we feel like we have a lot. now it's a question of matching it with the demand that we already have in a better more inspirational clearer more helpful way matched with the additional info we're learning about our membership growth on tripadvisor.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
operator
and our last question will come from the line of jed kelly from oppenheimer. you may begin.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great. two if i may. one on the ctrip agreement congratulations. does that allow you to work more closely with makemytrip now? and then second just on the last point on sort of managing demand. in terms of putting the best bookable supply for activities is that kind of an initiative where your internal supply force works with the best providers? is that how you sort of think about managing it?
stephen kaufer -- co-founder president chief executive officer and director
this is steve. so i mean makemytrip has been a client for many years. i couldn't really opine as to whether this particular jv helps that. i know they run pretty independently. but again we already have an excellent relationship with them makemytrip. i -- with regard to experiences we already generate a number -- quite a large transaction volume for quite a few suppliers. we're important to their ecosystem. we love having them as part of our platform. i think what i was alluding to before was more capturing the needs on the part of travelers that are currently on tripadvisor and viator and making sure our suggestions for which of our bookable supply is best suited for their needs is a very nice opportunity.
we already have the traffic we already have the supplies so it's product it's ui maybe it's promotion other ways to help make that match during the considered trip. and then when we know someone is actually on the trip help them find the amazing something to do when they're already there that they may not even have known about but we know who they are we know where they are and so we're able to send a push message or a highly contextual email that's extremely helpful to that traveler.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you.

operator
good morning and welcome to tripadvisor's fourth quarter and year-end 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to tripadvisor's vice president of investor relations, mr. will lyons. please go ahead.
will lyons -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, tyler. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call.
joining me today are steve kaufer, our ceo; ernst teunissen, our cfo; and chief experience & brand officer, lindsay nelson.
last night, after market close, we distributed and filed our fourth quarter and year-end 2019 earnings release and we made available our shareholder letter on our investor relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com. in the release, you will find reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures discussed on this call. also on our ir site, you will find supplemental financial information which includes certain non-gaap financial measures discussed on this call as well as other performance metrics.
before we begin, i'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's views as of today, february 13, 2020. tripadvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. please refer to our earnings release as well as our filings with the sec for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.
now here is steve, who will share a few thoughts before we open the call up to your questions.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, will, and good morning, everyone.
as we outlined in our shareholder letter, challenging 2019 hotel auction trends persisted in q4 though our financial results were in line with our lowered expectations. we've taken action in our three important focus areas. specifically, we've continued to focus on driving revenue growth outside of the hotel auction; we adjusted our cost structure to support continued strong adjusted ebitda and free cash flow; and we've returned a total of $548 million of capital to shareholders through a special dividend and share buyback.
we also closed two acquisitions that further bolster our fast growing restaurant offering in q4. more recently, we reorganized to align teams along our one tripadvisor vision. these changes bring together and streamline the tripadvisor user and shopping experience, leveraging our differentiated, people-powered planning consumer value proposition. our target travelers, once they take a trip that's really important to them, come to us to plan that entire trip. we therefore expect our non-hotel-auction revenue will drive the lion's share of our future growth. we expect e&d revenue alone will exceed the hotel auction in 2020, and over the coming years, the relative size of these revenue lines will reduce the hotel auction's influence on our overall results.
in summary, we are enhancing our position in an attractive and competitive travel market and clearly differentiating ourselves from every other travel company. we continue to have strong unique assets, and our progress makes us optimistic about our future. we'll now open up the call for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from deepak mathivanan with barclays. your line is now open.
deepak mathivanan -- barclays -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for taking the question. two quick questions. so first, can you talk about the trends in hotel auction business during 4q vs. third quarter? did google impact get worse or was it largely stable? and then does your commentary on the revenue growth improving in the second half of 2020 depend on google's efforts being relatively stable? or can you do it just largely given the comps? and then the second question, a little bit more near-term, can you comment on what you're seeing from the coronavirus impact so far in terms of traffic and maybe the ota partner bidding activity related to that? how are you thinking about that in the guidance too? thank you.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. hi, deepak, this is steve. thanks for the question. hotel auction was stable q3 to q4, but it's still challenged. what we're doing about it is building direct relationships with our travelers. and you can see that in the increased membership rates. with this direct relationship, we're getting more repeat traffic in a higher percentage of our revenues coming from these members, and that's great for our long-term health of our business.
perhaps just as important, we're focused on extending this relationship we have with the traveler to beyond hotel to help them on the full trip. and say, you're going to cancun. a hotel is important, but you should definitely consider any number of the tours that we offer to really make that trip special. and how about some restaurants? and all that stuff is working. as you can see, more travelers on tripadvisor are booking experiences than ever before. and our median reservation businesses, they're growing double digits.
in terms of the seo impact later in 2020, look, we always assume some continued google headwinds, but nothing dramatic. nothing like that is baked into our plan.
to your second question, the coronavirus, one has to believe it's part of our softer start in the hotel auction for us, and we do see some unexpected or new cancellation levels in asia, but we're not that exposed to asia as an overall part of our business. so we're watching it closely. we might see 1 point or 2 or low single digits impact, but at this point it's there. we're watching it closely. so it's not that material to us.
deepak mathivanan -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thanks, steve. very helpful.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
you bet.
operator
our next question comes from lloyd walmsley with deutsche bank. your line is now open.
chris -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, thanks. this is chris on for lloyd. i believe you guys had called out exiting the year at 30% booking growth in the experiences business. so can you just talk a bit about how you're thinking about the shape of bookings growth this year? and then separately, we've seen some press that indicates you guys may be in the process of flexing the pricing lever in the experiences business, and was curious if you guys could give us some color on how that's factored into the guidance for e&d segment revenue to accelerate this year. thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. thanks. this is steve again. so, we are super bullish on our overall experiences & dining segment and experiences in particular. internally, we've changed things around to really focus both on the tripadvisor opportunity, which has been growing strongly as we told you to help center around the traveler, and whether that traveler is looking at a hotel or a restaurant or an experience, help that traveler finish that considered trip. so we look at bookings growth rate on tripadvisor as remaining strong. when we look at viator, which is the other part of our change, we're adding a bunch more focus on that platform. and with that focus as a pure play for experiences, we're excited about its acceleration in terms of bookings growth and overall focus for the year.
in terms of the pricing question, our marketplace has grown dramatically over the past several years, and we discovered that there were parts of the marketplace that frankly weren't fair to a number of suppliers, given different suppliers had some different margins on the platform and we wanted to fix that. we firmly believe in a fair marketplace for all of our suppliers, and a fair marketplace is going to give the best results for travelers no matter where they're traveling. i don't think that's a big impact on overall financial, but it is important for the health of the marketplace.
chris -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
okay.
operator
our next question comes from naved khan with suntrust. your line is now open.
naved khan -- suntrust -- analyst
yeah. thanks a lot. a couple of questions. so on the e&d side, how should we think about the potential for organic growth in 2020 in that business and how is the restructuring going to affect revenue growth? and then on the hotel side, as you think about your commentary on the decel you saw in january, what are the primary factors for that -- one of your partners pulled back spending.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
hey, naved, this is ernst. thanks for your questions. first on experiences & dining. we have made two impressive acquisitions. they are going to help with the reacceleration of growth that we highlighted. but we are, as steve just said, also very bullish on the organic prospects we have in the business. on the dining side, we've seen continued strong performance from viator. they've been able to continue to -- sorry, of lafourchette. they've been able to continue their organic growth, and we expect them to continue their organic growth as they have been. they are pushing deeper into the secondary and tertiary markets, other cities. they are making progress on loyalty of their customers -- repeat rates with their customers, a very solid piece of the business.
on the experiences side, as steve was just saying, we see opportunities as well. we see an opportunity to integrate the experiences business deeper in the overall tripadvisor offering and benefit from being able to offer experiences not only to people on the experiences pages, but also on other parts of their travel. viator, we believe we can reinvigorate the positioning and the growth of that business, and so we feel very good about the overall impacts of that.
you asked about restructuring impacts. yes, we have taken out some costs out of the experiences business in particular within the e&d segment. we have come out of a period of about three, four years of significant investment. we have more than doubled our cost in experiences for instance in the last few years to build a supply base, which we have done very aggressively and we are very happy with now, and build our systems for a larger scale. we feel we've come out of that investment cycle, and we are now pivoting toward focusing more on the demand side, which is less labor intensive than the burst in the supply build has been. so we felt we could take out some cost. we don't believe that's going to have a meaningful impact on our ability to execute for the rest of the year.
naved khan -- suntrust -- analyst
that's helpful. and then on the hotel auction piece, can you just give some color on the decel?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yeah, sorry. the deceleration we saw early in the year on the hotel side, not so much due to partner bidding levels, but more to an overall -- the continuation of the google trends, but maybe an overall travel spending and coronavirus impact that we've seen, and we've seen that decelerate versus what we saw in q4. as we look ahead, of course, what we are focused on -- super-focused on the hotel business is making sure we grow the non-auction lines. we have some ambitious plan for 2020 for our hotel b2b business which was growing double digits last year and we have aggressive growth plans for this year.
and of course our media business -- lindsay is on the line and is going to talk later more undoubtedly about our media business. but we see a reacceleration of our media business as well into 2020 and these will offset some of the pressures we've seen in the auction.
operator
our next question comes from shweta khajuria with rbc capital markets. your line is now open.
shweta khajuria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks. two questions, please. first, member growth accelerated for the sixth consecutive quarter, i believe, from the letter in the fourth quarter. could you provide a little bit more context around member versus non-member trends? so how much more do they spend or how much more do they engage? what is their demographic profile versus non-members? any context there? and then second, your fiscal year '20 guide calls for experiences & dining to be higher than auctions revenue. i don't believe you break out auctions, but any context on how big that is as a part of the branded hotels revenue? could we assume 70%, 80% of that revenue is auction? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. thanks, shweta. this is steve. i'll take the first question. member growth does continue to accelerate. that's a lot of fresh users who had been coming by our site haven't found a reason to log in and now they're doing, so that allows us to reach out to them again through our crm efforts. we added 50 million as we indicated in 2019 and we're on a great pace going into 2020. members do come back more. no surprise there.
a higher percentage of our overall revenue is now coming from members, as i already said. while we're not kind of ready to share specific numbers about increased monetization rates, every great business builds its loyalty based upon people who view themselves as members. signing in is one attribute, but there is coming back to main direct, coming back for more and more of their traveler purchases.
critical to this kind of focus of ours -- and it really is a focus and can swing [phonetic] the results -- is that considered trip and helping those members plan not just what they originally started on with tripadvisor, but the rest of that travel cycle. they started on a restaurant, they become a member. that's fantastic. we can help them with the experience, with the hotel, with the fleet, etc.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and shweta, to your second question, our tripadvisor branded hotels line consists of two main components: the auction as well as our hotel b2b business. without putting a finer point on the split between the two, you're correct to assume that a large majority of that revenue today is in the auction. the other part, the b2b hotel business, is the part that is growing. it's been growing last year. we expect it to grow nicely this year as well. so over time, we see, within the hotel line, the auction to be less impactful and especially less impactful within the overall hm&p revenue line.
operator
our next question comes from brad erickson with needham & company. your line is now open.
brad erickson -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, thanks. i guess, can you just give any kind of a finer sense of what promoted listings, video ad, stuff like that ended up being financially last year as you've gotten started? i guess that one might be for lindsay. and just kind of how big of a contributor we should expect that to be here in 2020? and then, also can you just give the updated monthly active users on the site in q4?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. this is steve. could you clarify the promoted ads? that's not really a term we use. are you referring to our sponsored placements or...
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
or media business.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
or media business attracting more traffic...
brad erickson -- needham & company -- analyst
the sponsored placements, i guess, is what i was getting at, the piece of the business. i know it's small, but i think it was roughly doubling last year, just ended up -- wondering if you got there and kind of how much of a contributor that becomes in 2020.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
it was, again, another nice growth rate for that product. it's a very popular product for our customers. a significant part of the growth that we've seen this year in our hotel b2b was as a result of our continued growth in sponsor placements. we expect that to continue the growth into 2020. it's not the only growth area in b2b in 2020. we have some new products that we are building out that are b2b products for our hotel base. so sponsor placement plus other products we see continue to drive hotel b2b revenue next year.
in terms of overall users, the decline of the users narrowed in q4. we had a little over 380 million users in q4. q4 of course is a seasonably low number for users compared to q3. the point remains that we have huge scale, and the overall users only a fraction of what we really look at. we look underneath. we look at membership growth, we look at the quality of these users.
and we've highlighted in our prepared remarks a few of the great green shoots that we're seeing there. we're particularly excited about being able to grow membership because members just have a better ability for us to market to, especially on email, but they also tend to be much more loyal and much higher revenue generating. so we look at underneath and -- we look at the underneath -- the trends underneath the 380 million users, and we are actually quite pleased with the way that's trending.
brad erickson -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from brian fitzgerald with wells fargo. your line is now open.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks, guys. i had a couple of questions with around the engagement on tripadvisor media manager and then some color there on the mix and dynamics between ramping endemic versus non-endemic clients. and then a related question with tripadvisor connect, the new self-serve off-platform kind of audience extension media solution. what are the puts and takes there for advertisers? may we get a holistic view of our travel marketing spend and roi in one place and one dashboard and we don't have to the hassle with managing multiple dsps? would they get better rates there versus going directly to a dsp? can you give us some color there on tripadvisor connect?
lindsay nelson -- chief experience & brand officer
yeah. thanks, brian, for the question. to take it up a notch, i mean, we remain pretty optimistic about the potential of the display business, given the massive scale that ernst just talked about. and we're also pretty proud of the brand-safe environment and the access to first-party data, particularly in a world where identity and authentication of one's user base is getting harder and harder for many other publishers in this space to very much connect with our ambition around membership. the more logged in members, the more people we have a deep understanding of and the better we can attribute them on behalf of our marketing partners.
so, to your question around tripadvisor connect, the challenge many marketers have is once you identify a high-value audience, how can you continue to remarket and start a conversation with that audience, whether their own tripadvisor or off-platform. so that's the product that meets that demand. we're seeing a lot of interest in that product. it's already starting to grow quickly, particularly with both endemic and non-endemic advertisers.
just to give you some highlights as we closed out the year, the leading indicators that we continue to pay attention to as to whether or not we can grow and double this business in three to five years is whether we're growing our new customer base. we added over 200 new advertisers in q4. we also increased our average deal size. we grew average deal by about 20% and i think that's a pretty remarkable achievement to not only continue to grow your customers, to be able to maintain pricing integrity and the overall deal volume and the impact of each of those deals.
we've also increased our programmatic business relative to the overall growth in the market. our programmatic channel for us grew by 100%. and we continue to grow monetizable inventory across the site and increased sell rate. so when you think about the spectrum of the market and to your question around the self-service platform, we believe that we have great solutions for enterprise partners to do multi-year deals, particularly around exclusive data relationships. but we also think we can serve that small and medium-sized business through the self-serve platform.
and as you look sort of the other vertical on the matrix, we believe we can meet the sort of highly transactional, programmatic buyer but also introduce high touch solutions like branded content, like sponsorships, and so far the market has been reacting pretty positively.

our next question comes from tom white with d.a. davidson. your line is now open.
philip rigby -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hi. it's actually philip rigby on for tom. so, on the letter you talked about conversion gains with experience shoppers and how it's accelerated. i was hoping you could just elaborate a bit on your initiatives there and how you're driving better conversions in experiences. and then maybe can you talk about the 10 products rolled out in q3, how those are performing? i think you touched on some of those early in the call. and just lastly, anymore color you can give us on your product pipeline would be great. thank you.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
this is steve. i'll take the experiences conversion. i might ask you after i finish to repeat the second question. so with experiences, it's a two part answer. on tripadvisor, we're getting better and better at helping travelers no matter where they are in the funnel discover the experiences and make it very easy for them to buy the right experience around that point of interest. so if it's a buckingham palace, is it a guided tour, is it a skip the line, is it a private tour, what's the best experience -- what's the best thing that we can offer to help sell that particular attraction.
on viator, the fact that we have so much more choice and that we're improving our ability with streamlined methods to actually complete the purchase, still a bunch of low-hanging fruit that we're excited to tackle, that we started on over the past several quarters and have a rather robust roadmap to help our travelers on that particular point of sale.
i reiterate the focus that our recent changes are allowing us to pursue in terms of helping the traveler throughout the trip on tripadvisor makes us extremely bullish, given the hundreds of millions of travelers on our site planning their considered trip, and then on viator, occupying the mindshare around being the place to go to have that magical experience, whether i discover viator when i'm in destination or whether i'm a planner, in picking out the absolute best hike or tour or vatican experience or whatever.
could i ask you to repeat the second question?
philip rigby -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah. it's super helpful. thanks. and then -- so you, on your last call you talked about 10 new product launches that you rolled out over q3. just wanted to get any more color on how those are performing or what your product pipeline looks like for 2020.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
i don't think we referred to 10 products. we had launched a couple on the ad side that lindsay had covered in the last answer. and certainly, there are different ad units on our site, different than a rectangle -- or we have a new homepage placement that we've been talking about. i'd give -- the short answer is, it's all part of the mix that makes us comfortable with our estimation that will still be able -- that we are executing on our plan to double our media revenue over the next three to five years. we're not sure any one product is going to be a breakaway hit. so our strategy is really to focus on our audience, segmenting it for the right buyer and leveraging the fact that we have so much first-party data, which is becoming scarcer across the media universe.
operator
and our next question comes from jed kelly with oppenheimer. your line is now open.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. in the prepared comments, in the e&d segment, both seated diners and bookings, you mentioned they grew over 30%. ad [phonetic] revenue in that segment i think grew 20% ex-fx. can you just talk about what the gap is between your key kpis and the overall revenue growth?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yes. seated diners and bookings are obviously volume indicators. particularly in experiences -- and we've highlighted this before this year -- we've made a push into new products with a lower aov so they have lowered our revenue per booking. and that may be a short-term impact as we just sign up more new customers with offering them more attractively priced lower aov products. but that has been a main driver on the experiences side. on the dining side, there has been less of a shift between volume and pricing year-over-year.
as we look forward into next year, we see an opportunity for both of those segments to keep driving volume, but also have opportunities to keep driving aov as well. and so we look ahead and we believe this is a great -- both of these metrics are great leading indicators for what we can do over time.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
and then on experiences and on the cost rationalization, has that impacted how you're thinking about your overall marketing that product in 2020?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
the cost rationalization, i want to be very clear, has been on the back of a number of years, really deeply investing particularly in supply growth and overall platform growth -- the overall scalability of our platform. we've been growing -- as you have been able to see in our statistics bookable products, very aggressively, triple digit type of growth that we've seen. we feel now we are in a very good place. we've made a big spurt. we thought that was important to make a big spurt of available inventory. we have that now.
we're shifting now toward the less labor intensive activity of pushing on the demand side. so we have a lot of initiatives that we're driving to stimulate demand, and we've shifted our focus that way. it doesn't have a direct implication on how we can execute on that side, the fact that we've tapered our expenses on the other side.
operator
our next question comes from eric sheridan with ubs. your line is now open.
eric sheridan -- ubs -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. maybe two, if i can. firstly on the auction dynamics. is there a way you can get a little additional color on whether it's advertisers adjusting budget, how much of it is macro industry issues versus pricing dynamics versus budget dynamics that you're seeing in the auction and how your -- maybe the assumptions you're making looking out to 2020 and how those might change from what you saw in 2019?
and then on experiences, could you help frame how you see the competitive landscape and experience is playing out from 2020 and beyond? there's a lot of players in travel, albeit probably not at the scale you guys are at today, have inventory trying to go after that opportunity. so how do you see the competitive landscape playing out, especially reflected in trying to continue to scale inventory and choice for consumers in experiences? thanks so much.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
hey, eric, ernst. i'll take the first and steve will take the second one. in terms of the auction, there's been a number of factors at play. the macro we believe is important. the continuation of google is important. the overall willingness to transact of users is important. of course, advertisers are adjusting their budgets accordingly when you're on other platform. so it's sometimes a little bit difficult to tease apart. but we'll put it in the bucket of some of these external headwinds that have come in on overall travel spending by consumers as the most important driver.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
and on the experiences side, let's all remember, 80% of the bookings are done offline. so when you look at with the tripadvisor brand lens on, we have so many of those travelers already on our site. our job is to match that traveler demand either in planning mode or in destination. we don't have to pay additional dollars to get those travelers. it's a clear advantage we have over basically every other competitor in the attraction space.
when you look at viator, with its supply footprint certainly in the markets where we are strong, we are sort of a clear leader, a clear player with all of the heavy -- not all, but most of the heavy-lifting already done in terms of building the supply footprint and infrastructure. so when you compare viator's closer to stand-alone entity versus their head-to-head competitors, certainly we believe we stand ahead and we stand tall; we have better supply; we have a ton of traffic; we have more direct traffic, more brand awareness. it's really quite a good story that we plan to leverage going forward.
great markets bring lots of competitors. so we're not particularly nervous about other pure play attraction players. we're certainly watching carefully because the market is so big and has such nice growth opportunities.
operator
our next question comes from mike olson with piper sandler. your line is now open.
michael olson -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning. so, related to the e&d segment and particularly looking at experiences, it sounds like there is a high degree of confidence in continued growth there. and you talked about new ways to engage and convert users. but are there also just certain regions or categories that just may have more opportunity for growth or less penetrated that you're looking into? and, i guess along those lines, are there also then areas where supply is maybe less robust today that you're particularly working on? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. excellent question. there is certainly a plethora of opportunity around the globe. and so we do have to focus in on certain areas. we're not trying to do everything in every geography. so naturally, we go where we already have good supply footprint and/or a great traffic footprint, particularly on the tripadvisor point of sale so that we at least come with either a strong supply footprint or a strong demand footprint as opposed to having to start from scratch in either. that's pretty much how you can see our product strategy, our supply strategy and our demand strategy rolling out between tripadvisor and viator, leveraging either a supply or a demand footprint.
and there will be other players. we recognize that that grab a foothold in a market that we're not particularly strong in at the moment. however, our overall considered trip with our current audience where we can bring the demand if we don't have the supply ourselves, we can cut the supply relationships with somebody else. perhaps, there's lots of different ways to do what's right for our traveler.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and steve answered the question mostly for experiences. but if you look at the dining side, there are exciting opportunities there as well. and these two acquisitions that we've been making are supporting that as well. lafourchette, with its transactional business, has been able to grow in the footprint that they've had within europe because it's still underpenetrated. but the acquisition with bookatable that we've made allowed us to more deeply penetrate the uk and germany, which were two white spaces for lafourchette, which is very exciting. lafourchette will now be a truly pan-european player and able to leverage the scale associated with it.
earlier last year, we made an acquisition in south america, as you know, which is another growth market that we're focusing on. so on the transactional business, there's a lot of growth opportunity ahead geographically, but also a deeper penetration within market that we have ahead of us.
and then the other component of this -- of restaurants, as you know, is, the products that we're selling through restaurateurs on tripadvisor, which is our restaurant services business that we've been able to grow very nicely. the other acquisition we made, singleplatform, is an ability to add more product to the sales force that is selling these two restaurants on tripadvisor. and so it's highly synergistic. we've bought a company that was not growing as part of the platform that they were on, but we are able to take that and put that on top of the sales force that we've created and offer more product to the same restaurant. so another area of product additions, product proliferation for restaurants is another nice growth area on the tripadvisor restaurant services side.
operator
our next question is from justin patterson with raymond james. your line is now open.
justin patterson -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. could you expand on the redesign of the tripadvisor app? you changed the user experience not that long ago. so, i'm curious how this redesign compares to the last, what you're trying to solve and how we should think through the business and pack? and then the second question is on experiences. steve, i think you just said that 80% of attractions are still booked offline. where would you say the industry is in that shift from offline to online and what can you do to accelerate that shift to convert more bookings online? thanks so much.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
and that's a terrific two-parter. i'll ask lindsay to handle the first and see how it dovetails nicely with the second.
lindsay nelson -- chief experience & brand officer
all right. thanks, mike, for that question about the app. as we shared a few months ago, we've been in the process of overhauling the app for about two quarters now and we have about two quarters more to go. as you can appreciate, these products are not only about what the consumer sees, but also how we manage the back-end services that support not only [indecipherable] also improve the web platform experience.
overall, our ambition is just to create world-class consumer products, and that includes not only the planning experience but also the shopping and booking experience. and while there's a lot to love about the current app, we think there is a lot of areas of improvement to not only make it much more lightweight but also just much more reactive and personalized and intuitive for the traveler.
we recognize that the travel planning process happens across many surfaces. sometimes that happens on your phone, sometimes that happens on your desktop, sometimes you want to exchange emails with your travel partner to compare the best hotel or a really exciting tour. and we don't make it easy to hand off across this platform. we really want the app to be that sort of -- in your pocket hub for all of your travel planning moments, but also your on-destination companion where you can not only organize all of the things that you've booked on tripadvisor but also discover great deals, last minute opportunities or recommendations from travelers like you.
i would say the most important thing to take away for this group is just the importance of personalization and ongoing member communication. we recognize that not every traveler is the same. it's important that we don't have a blunt instrument experience. and so we believe that on the backs of the membership opportunity, which is why we sequence the focus on membership in advance of the launch of the app, that the more logged in users we have, the more questions we ask those users, the more information we have about what your travel preferences are, the better recommendations and merchandising we can do across any category on tripadvisor.
and we believe that the combination of data collection with the membership and the delivery of that through the new experience is not only going to increase engagement and repeat users, but it will ultimately drive revenue because each app user will be given an app experience that is tailored to their preferences. and we're pretty excited about that.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
and, as you can imagine, downloading and being a frequent user of the app is an ultimate sign of loyalty. and so, when we look at that 80% offline experience purchase, a chunk of it is -- i have no reason to book in advance and all of a sudden tripadvisor and viator are now giving you a reason because of convenience. you can always cancel 24 hours before the thing. there is different payment methods. there is potentially deals, and there is just the convenience of buying through a safe channel like tripadvisor or viator in advance.
and then for all those things that you've put on in your wish list, not ready, not because you don't like the tour, you're just not sure if you're ready to take it. now, you're in destination, you open up our app and there it is in that exact same format, and now you're ready to buy it because heaven forbid, it's now sold out. and with the app can send you push notifications telling you that, hey, inventory is getting limited or now is a good time or here are some three other things you might want to do.
imagine it down the road. how incredibly helpful it can be to have a travel agent, a travel wizard in your pocket, giving you recommendations based on where you are, what the weather is like, the things that we've learned about you to just make that in destination travel experience so much easier, so much better. and that's a sign of loyalty that we feel we're in a great position to deliver.
to be clear, that is not a q3 launch. the q3 launches the beginning of the app. it's a new surface. we're very excited about it. what i talked about was the several year vision of how the traveler becomes super loyal to us because of all the services that we're providing both in planning and in destination.
justin patterson -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from dan wasiolek with morningstar. your line is now open.
dan wasiolek -- morningstar -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for taking the questions. two, if i may. so the first one on marketing expense, which saw some pretty strong leverage in 2019. how should we think about your ability to continue to optimize channels and the impact to your increasing loyalty member base and the app relaunch might have on direct traffic in 2020 and beyond? and should we think about marketing expense leverage potentially again in 2020?
and then just in regards to google, it looks like it might be testing placing some organic links above its matter in some markets. if that were to become prominent, how might that impact your business? that's it for me. thank you.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
thanks, dan. this is ernst. our marketing first. we've gone through a serious effort, as you know, over the last two years in improving the efficiency of our marketing on the hotel side. we're through that cycle now. so going forward on the auction side, we expect marketing to grow with demand, grow with overall revenue volume. the same, actually, for our growth businesses, for experiences, for dining, we see marketing grow with the overall volume.
to your point of channel diversification, a reinvigorated app help us actually lower marketing cost that is definitely a potential -- not baked into our numbers at the moment or forecast at the moment, but that is definitely a potential that we are able to reduce our dependence on some of these paid marketing channels.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
and this is steve. with regard to the test that google seems to be doing, putting an organic link above some of their placements, we'll see how it goes. far, far too early to tell whether that's a no effect or a modest positive. but it's a little hard for me to believe it would be meaningful from what i've seen so far.
dan wasiolek -- morningstar -- analyst
great. okay. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from lee horowitz with evercore isi. your line is now open.
lee horowitz -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks so much for the question. just one, if i could, on the reshuffling of the management team and the alignment in the experiences business, focusing on viator as a separate product and then experiences on tripadvisor as its own kind of stand-alone business. why was this the right timing to seemingly break these two businesses somewhat apart, given that you tried to integrate them a little bit more closely over the last couple of years?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, lee, for the question. excited to answer it. we had a plan many years ago when we first bought viator first turning it into a marketplace from very curated selection, growing supply, doing it geographically and leveraging the demand that existed on the tripadvisor and the viator platform. and we needed to teach ourselves how to best merchandise experiences having been kind of from the tripadvisor side not in that business for previously. and so the one team that was responsible both for tripadvisor and for viator was leveraging all those new learnings for how to effectively sell experiences to travelers.
with several years now of getting that into our dna, we're now able to split it off and say for tripadvisor, we've got the merchandising down; let's now tackle how an experience is part of a key considered trip. and that's a little bit of a different muscle that's very unique to tripadvisor because of all the traffic we have across all the verticals. so reorganization apply a focus toward helping that traveler on tripadvisor no matter whether they're looking for a restaurant, a hotel or an experience.
flip it back over to viator. now we have an opportunity as a pure play ota for experiences to really build up both the brand, the focus on the merchandising on just the viator point of sale, leveraging our third-party relationships, of which there are quite a few, and focus from a -- a set of consumers are looking for just the best thing to do while they're in destination or beforehand, and while some may go to tripadvisor, which will be great for tripadvisor media group, there will be a set that are just looking for a pure play experiences offering, and we want viator to have all the leverage to win in that space.
so it's kind of like, it was always part of what we thought would happen, and i think we timed it well in terms of being able to have both sides learn the merchandising, learn the best practices and then enable each brand to chase its audience.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and the other component of this reorg, of course, is this focus on ta and the overall ta platform, which is really important to us. we have developed ta very attractively vertical by vertical. there is a huge opportunity that we outlined in looking at the consumer much more holistically and with great hires that we made with lindsay and kanika, we feel we have the right plan in place right now to actually effect that.
lee horowitz -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
operator
our next question comes from doug anmuth with jpmorgan. your line is now open.
doug anmuth -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. just want to ask you, first, can you just give us some more color on how your brand campaign will evolve in 2020? talk about optimizing and reducing some investments for you to help us kind of quantify '19 and '20. and then separately, just on the at least flat ebitda in 2020 relative to '19, could you just talk more about some of the bigger puts and takes there and just how we should think about top line growth that's contemplated in the guidance? thanks.
lindsay nelson -- chief experience & brand officer
yeah. thanks, doug. so i'll give you a little bit of big picture color on the brand campaign. so last year, when i joined, we initiated a brand transformation. and when i think about what it means to transform a brand, especially one as iconic as tripadvisor, it's not just about a paid marketing campaign. it's about how do we define and reset how we think about the target customer, the role we play within travel and ultimately define strategically and creatively what it means for us to be the world's preeminent people powered guidance company.
the first external signal of that transformation was a very exciting moment for us a couple of weeks ago where we relaunched the visual identity of the company, including a simplification of the iconic owly logo, and consumers will continue to see rolling updates not only across the platform but also all of the channels that we own and operate over the next couple of months. we will be in market in april with a pretty high impact but targeted city campaign where the company will do out of home for the first time, particularly in major transit hubs like airports and subways and train stations. we will continue to think about what our communication strategy is for the first half of the year and as we look into the back half.
right now, we are acutely focused on the channels that we actually own and operate, that we don't pay for. as we've talked about earlier, we have an enormous, very valuable audience. historically, we haven't necessarily taken advantage of that audience using open inventory to merchandise and promote our businesses such as the growing experiences opportunity on tripadvisor. so we'll have a big focus there.
the second is crm. you see it as sort of a simple acronym. but what it means is, for all of these new members -- these are people we can connect and communicate to directly. and crm as a channel has been very fast growing for us, not only in volume, but efficacy, and we expect to double the revenue contribution from that channel this coming year. and that extends of course into push [phonetic] as we continue to grow app downloads even in advance of launch. again, that's a coveted audience that we have a direct line into.
from there, we'll look to the back half. as we identify what our specific campaign objectives are and as we have an understanding of how the business is doing, we'll put our back half media plan together and allocate the budget accordingly.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
so, as you can tell from what lindsay says, tv marketing as we've done in previous years, is going to have less of an overall weight in the way we go to market with our brand. the other ways we go to market with the brand, as lindsay outlines, are going to be more efficient and effective, we believe. and so we're looking at a reduction, year-over-year, in our overall brand budget from last year. it's one of the areas where we've seen cost efficiency for the upcoming year.
in terms of your second question on the puts and takes in our at least flat ebitda outlook for 2020, let's start with e&d. e&d is a source for profit growth in 2020 for us. not only does the top line continue to develop very nicely, we are also seeing improved margins in e&d this upcoming year. it's partly from the scale we are achieving in dining, it's partly from the scale we are achieving in experiences. and as you know, as we have outlined, we've taken some costs out of the experiences business as well. and so that combines to a meaningful profit improvement for the year.
the other part of the puts and takes is our hotel auction. the pressure on the hotel auction is putting some challenge on the profitability of that particular line item. and then thirdly, we have identified other cost savings areas that we have outlined in our prepared remarks as well. there are three. there is experiences; there is other areas of the business that are less strategic or we can take some efficiency -- take some cost out; and then the brand marketing i just talked about.
we're partly reinvesting -- about half of the savings of $80 million of our run rate that we're creating we're reinvesting in growth areas of the business, in our restaurant business in particular, but also in building capabilities around our core experiences, lindsay's area, as well as the hotel b2b. so partly reinvesting but taking some efficiencies. so that all together combines in our outlook for the year of at least flat ebitda.
operator
and our next question comes from nat schindler with bank of america. your line is now open.
nat schindler -- bank of america -- analyst
yes. hi, guys. i was wondering -- i don't know if it was really clearly answered, but i think it's what i asked. what portion of the tripadvisor branded hotel revenue is auctions. because i'm trying to clarify your guidance. i'm trying to figure out how much of e&d is going up. and then, if you could give at least some partial direction on how much of the e&d growth is acquisition related.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
in terms of the auction as a percentage of the ta branded hotel, i said it's a large majority -- we're not breaking it out -- but it's a large majority. and shweta was putting some percentages on it and directionally she is correct in thinking it's a large majority of that business.
in terms of e&d inorganic contribution, so we made two acquisitions. last year, as stand-alone businesses, in 2019 they created about $50 million of revenue with a flat bottom line -- with no profitability. the component in q4 of our q4 financials was very de minimis. we made these two acquisitions at the very end of the year, at the end of december and so didn't have a meaningful impact at all on q4. going forward, we're looking at these two assets as incredibly powerful add-ons to the overall dining business. as stand-alone businesses, they were actually growth challenged. but we think we can reinvigorate that on top of our platform. and it's going to be a part of what we do next year.
organically, as we have said a number of times, we also believe we can meaningfully continue growth or accelerate the growth that we've seen before.
nat schindler -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. one other clarifying question. what other than auction is in the tripadvisor branded hotel, just for clarification? and then a second additional question. can you go back over the last -- it's about two years -- your e&d margins have kind of fluctuated wildly and they seem to correspond with the inverse fluctuation in your hotel margins. have you done anything to change over the last couple of years your attribution of marketing between those because obviously someone who comes into your side because coming in for multiple reasons, so it's somewhat subjective what they're coming in for.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
the first part of your question is about that line of hotel revenue. two main components. auction. the other is hotel b2b services which split between subscription services as well as sponsored placement services. so hotel b2b is the other component there. there has been no reallocation of expenses over the last years of marketing expenses between the segments, so that's not a driver. the correlation that you're identifying, i don't think is there.
there have been very specific reasons why our e&d margins came down over the last years and not up again. and we've talked about that. and the significant investment cycle we've had over the last two years is specifically in our experiences business and a shift from supply growth to demand growth now in the upcoming year.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. this is steve. if you look back, we had wanted to diversify our business over the past five years, and with our acquisitions of lafourchette and viator, the subsequent set of acquisitions and the investment that we put behind them at the expense of margin over the past several years, you can see that it paid off pretty much as we had looked for in terms of growing the overall e&d component.
and so now we're sitting here, yes, with a hotel auction that's challenged, but a growing hotel b2b business, a growing media business, a growing experiences business, a growing restaurant business, as we've successfully -- with still lots more to come -- but successfully moved the core focus of our overall business from hotel auction to a much more diversified and growing set of segments.
operator
our last question comes from james lee with mizuho securities. your line is now open.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. ernst, just want to follow up on the contribution of the acquisition for the restaurant reservation business. is it fair to say that the additional contribution is in line pretty much with the growth of the restaurants supply that you added from the acquisitions here? and then also for steve, i think over the last couple of quarters, you've been speaking very highly of your newsfeed product. i was wondering any new learnings there, any new improvements or features you plan for 2020 to increase the engagement of travelers on your website? thanks.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
so, to your first question, that math is probably too simplistic that you have outlined. it is going to make a contribution. as i said, these assets, stand-alone, have been growth challenged. but we can integrate them into our platform. it's going to be somewhat difficult going forward to fully tease apart how much the acquisitions have delivered and how much we've done with it as part of our overall platform. we see acceleration of growth in our overall e&d line. these acquisitions are going to help. but also other lines, the organic growth lines, we see a very important opportunity as well.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
and this is steve. the list is quite long in terms of additional product enhancements in 2020 to help drive engagement. we talked a lot already about members, we talked about the new app experience, we talked about better able to help the traveler plan out and save all the different things that they're looking to do and present that in a more convenient way and enable travelers to share that with their traveling companions, all in the engagement category.
to the feed question that we had, launched the feed -- it's still there. everything's get posted. it helps in different types of content contribution. we like all that. it's just kind of one of the many things in 2020 that we expect will be helping to drive engagement.

last night, after market close, we distributed and filed our first quarter 2020 earnings release and made available our shareholder letter on our investor relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com. in the release, you will find reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures discussed on this call. also, on our ir site, you will find supplemental financial information which contains reconciliations of certain non-gaap financial measures discussed on this call as well as other metrics.
before we begin, i'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's views as of today, may 8th, 2020. tripadvisor disclaims any obligation to update these facts to reflect future events or circumstances. please refer to our earnings release as well as our filings with the sec for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.
with that, i'll pass the call to steve.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, will, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining our call. we're living in unprecedented times impacting all of our personal lives in hitting the travel industry hard.
first, to those on the front lines in the medical profession and to the everyday heroes working at our local grocery stores or delivery services, thank you. to our partners and suppliers in the travel industry, who are struggling with the sudden drop in business, we understand your pain, and we are helping in all the ways we can. and to our employees, know that your hard work during this challenging time is meaningful, as tripadvisor will play a critical role in helping the travel industry rebound.
as we reported, estimated bookings and revenue-related activity generally has been down by more than 90% since late march. april stabilized at these low year-over-year performance levels. we acknowledge industry estimates around travels long road to recovery. however, we are encouraged by some early small signs in recent weeks that show consumer demand is picking back up. we, tripadvisor and the industry, will get through this, travel will return. it is accepted as a fundamental human right in so many parts of the world. we believe our core strategy to help guide travelers on trips that really matter to them is not only compelling and differentiated, but even more essential in times like this, where travelers have high anxiety and uncertainty.
as ernst will discuss in a minute, we have streamlined our cost profile and solidified our financial position to weather this pandemic, and we believe our trusted brand and customer focus platform enables us to help get the world traveling again. ernst?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve. good morning, everyone. we've obviously been very focused on liquidity and costs since the covid crisis has hit, and i want to highlight where we are on this.
first, our cost structure. we took a number of cost reduction steps in response to covid. we've reduced headcounts in the form of lay-off, impacting about 900 people, nearly a quarter of our workforce. we've also furloughed about 850 people, mostly at the fork. i know that -- i know that although similar in size as the lay-off, the furloughing contributes much less to the cost saving as it tends to include lower wage personnel, and we pay top-ups to what employees get from government subsidized programs.
further cost reductions include a temporary reduction of work for lower pay for most remaining employees and some reductions to benefits. this is all in addition to removing pretty much all of our discretionary costs we had in our plan. so these measures lower our cost significantly in q2 and the rest of the year. for clarity, when i quote cost reductions in these remarks, i refer to expenses between revenue and ebitda, so not full gaap expense.
fixed cost, the cost excluding cogs and performance marketing expenses, fixed costs are coming down 25% in q2 and almost 40% in q3 versus the q1 starting level that we had this year. in absolute terms, that is a reduction by $45 million of these fixed cost expenses for q2 and $65 million for q3, so a total of $110 million for six months relative to the levels that we had started at. and i note that the q1 level, i'm comparing these against, was already lower than the average quarter in 2019, because we've had already taken other cost measures. so, year-over-year, our cost savings are even more significant.
and of course, all variable cost, cogs performance marketing is coming straight down with revenue. as steve said, we've been -- we've seen revenue related activity down more than 90% recently. and so, in q2, we expect cogs and performance marketing to come down by about $50 million from the q1 level to a number under $10 million. this is additional to these fixed cost reductions that i was talking about.
of course, we will invest more in variable expenses in q2, where revenue recovers faster than anticipated. importantly, not only do these cost measures preserve cash, but also they will position our p&l very well in a recovery into 2021. we will be leaner, more focused on the highest priorities in the business, and we expect much of the fixed cost savings to remain when revenue recovers.
now, to our liquidity position. we're very pleased to announce this week that we agreed to an amendment to our credit facility with our bank syndicate. we had a large facility in place before covid hit with already enough capacity to comfortably fund us through downside scenarios. the amendment we agreed this week additionally and importantly gives us a holiday on the main leverage covenant until q3 of 2021, which helps us navigate a period with ebitda under significant pressure. even under very adverse scenarios, with even under scenarios with little or no recovery in travel in 2020, we are confident we have now both the liquidity and the ability to stay compliant with covenants over the next two years.
as steve mentioned, revenue visibility remains limited. we are expecting a significant ebitda loss in q2, and we believe this is likely to persist at least through q3, assuming the travel industry has a slow recovery, although we expect q3 ebitda to improve versus q2. but as highlighted above, we believe we are well positioned to weather the storm, and we believe we are very well positioned to come out of this storm in a solid financial shape.
with that, we will now open the call for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of deepak mathivanan with barclays. your line is open.
deepak mathivanan -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question, guys. steve, how are you thinking about positioning trip for the recovery path both in terms of product and business model? you obviously have a great brand in travels, and traffic is always very strong. but the various assets that you've historically had, have they been like very disconnected from a user experience standpoint and to some extent under-monetized compared to other media peers. so how are you thinking about, perhaps first, realigning the product using this time into a more integrated experience, and then also potentially explore new monetization models around those? thank you.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, deepak. that's a great question and does dovetail very much with what we're doing internally. we have a fully centralized b2c organization at tripadvisor now that kind of follows as an extension on the one tripadvisor vision that we had talked about for the last couple of quarters. the key element to that is truly helping the traveler plan all of the things that they need for this considered trip. so, instead of, or in comparison to, someone first shopping for hotel and then may be shopping for an experience later, we really are aiming to have our travelers plan the entire trip with us, no matter which category they happen to start it. that considered trip, a huge tam, great positioning with respect to or in comparison to a search engine like google or someone that just sells in the airline flight or a hotel. and leverage is very much the brand trust that people have in this -- in tripadvisor to guide them through that whole journey.
so we have -- to the second part of your question, we have an excellent monetization vehicle for when someone is in hotel shopping mode or experienced shopping mode, and we've grown our restaurant media business quite well when they're looking for a place to eat. our biggest challenge has been enabling people to plan the entire trip around it so that we get not just a bite at when they're looking for a hotel or a restaurant or attraction, but since every considered trip involves at the minimum of three components, how do we help the traveler and therefore monetize all those different components. add to that some initial efforts on leveraging the large consumer base with direct-to-consumer products. and i think we have both the considered trip, monetize more for every considered chopper that we have, and some new offering that's going after newer revenue streams namely direct-to-consumer as potentially kind of opportunities ahead that we've never tapped into before.
deepak mathivanan -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thanks, steve.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from naved khan with suntrust. your line is open.
naved khan -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
yeah. thank you. can you provide some color on the uptick that you're seeing in bookings that are over 90 days out? how much of an improvement is it, and is it primarily in regions where lock-downs have been eased or is it more broad base? [phonetic] can you talk about that? and then, just with respect to the headcount reduction, how does it affect your plans to build out more features and functionality for the branded display side? just those two. thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, i want to caution folks. the uptick we're seeing is modest, it's not anything that i would characterize as a big rebound, which obviously makes sense given that the lock-downs in many parts of the world are easing, but are not off. and so, therefore, it starts to -- it starts to come back in, where probably an early indicator as people are thinking about the trip but not yet booking it on our site. so, traffic has started to come back pretty much around the globe.
to the question on how will the headcount reductions change what we invested in -- what we're investing in. yes, we're having to focus on some of these core things that matter to us, but growing our media business to better monetize all of our unique audience is certainly something we view as a high priority.
and so, i would recall the key points that i made in the past call in this one in terms of helping a traveler, guiding a traveler through their considered trip, we will continue be investing there. we will continue to be investing in our b2b businesses both with experiences and obviously our hotel auction. and then, the display or general media business continues to be, we expect, a very nice growth driver for us.
naved khan -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thank you, steve.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
of course.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of lloyd walmsley with deutsche bank. your line is open.
lloyd walmsley -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi. thanks. yeah, looking at kind of longer-dated queries, it looks like there is not a lot of auction density right now. just anecdotally, obviously not much demand out there right now. but wondering, are your customers falling below minimum ctc levels or just kind of exiting altogether like what's causing some of that beyond the obvious? and then, how are your conversations with customers in terms of when they're likely to come back to auctions, what they need to see, do you think it will be pretty quickly as conversion start to come up, any sense for that?
and then -- and then, secondly, i guess, just on the subscription listing business, can you give us a sense for how big that is and how that's holding up in light of everything going on? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll take the auction question, and then maybe ernst on subscription. you may see a little, what i'll call, dislocation in the auction at the moment or over the past week or two as many of our clients had to do a very quick reallocation, a very quick pull back. but if we look at prior recessions, prior big challenges to the travel industry, those companies that had an interesting demand footprint were in a good position because so many of the companies that have big fixed assets, be it new planes or in our case hotels, are very hungry for demand. and the travelers on tripadvisor and other front-end media sites become very valuable. so, i would -- i'd say, i'm cautiously optimistic that many of our current clients, certainly the big folks, will be very eager to get access to the auction that we have on our site. and so, as demand picks up, those eyeballs are that much more valuable.
i'll turn it to ernst.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yes. in terms of the subscription -- the subscriptions, yes, they are holding up better than the auction. subscriptions obviously are longer-dated terms, often a year terms. there are renewals coming up which might be under pressure. but overall, that revenue stream has held up better than the auction revenue stream. we've been helpful to some partners by pushing out some payments. but in terms of the actual revenue, we're expecting a more limited impact to that compared to the auction.
lloyd walmsley -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from jed kelly with oppenheimer. your line is open.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. two, if i may. first question, just how do you see your meta auction evolving into the recovery? i mean, is there any way you potentially can diversify your revenue among your partners. and then, on your activities. i guess, traveler health and safety is going to be a pretty big priority. so how do you view your supply? you still want to have a lot of supply or will you scale it down to work with a couple of partners that are trusted? thank you.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, on meta evolving, i really do believe we will have all the major otas, certainly the major chains be eager for our demand. so, i think -- what we might call the liquidity of the auction will be strong and people will be fighting over travelers on our site and others.
with respect to the traveler health and safety, absolutely important, arguably the biggest challenge, not just in an informational context, but what are the airlines and hotels and other travel companies actually doing to provide a safe experience for travel. we expect -- we would hope to be a major information hub to help travelers in exactly that concern. people turn to tripadvisor because we are a very trusted brand and we expect to share as much information as we can gather about the safety-related issues in anywhere you're going as well as where you're staying, and what you may choose to do while you are there.
we think that that will be a major benefit to travelers, helping them get comfortable to get back on the road, as many others have pointed out, probably trips will move toward more domestic travel than international, which works very well for us because we have -- we're not -- our business is not centered around a dozen top cities, our business is centered around everywhere a traveler is interested in going. so we have great content, great choice.
i don't think, to your question specifically, we'll need to scale down supply. we're simply going to be informing our travelers about the safety considerations that they may have questions about in all of our categories. and with that, and our community to answer questions, i would hope we would be --i would expect we would be a major source of valuable information for our hundreds of millions or billions of travelers.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our following question comes from brad erickson with needham & co. your line is open.
brad erickson -- needham & co. -- analyst
hi. thanks. just a couple. first, you talked about variable cost basically coming down as quickly and kind of in line with what you're seeing revenue wise. conversely, i guess, when we look toward the recovery, do you see any revenue that you might start to generate to correlate really as a function of like basically bookings rebound we might see from the hotels or the otas, kind of is that the right formula for how to think about any sort of a shape of recovery? and then, just what you're hearing from your customers specifically that leads you to comment just generally that q3 will be better than q2. and then just a quick follow-up.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
so i'll take that to begin with.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
i'm sorry. i was on mute. some of the technical glitches in the covid era. brad, thank you. in terms of variable costs, so variable cost mostly cogs and performance marketing. it's very linear with revenue and bookings, and so -- for our hotel business, but also for our experiences & dining business and across the board really. so, expect -- when revenue comes back, expect these variable cost to grow broadly in line with these.
and you asked about partners. yes, if our partners on the hotel side see bookings growth, they are likely to spend on our channel and we are likely to want to invest variable marketing expense as well against that. and across other parts of business where we have our own supply, for instance, experiences, we will also, when we see the demand pick up, spend more on the variable cost side.
so, i said in my opening remarks that we expect those levels to be very, very down in q2, i said maybe under $10 million between cogs and external marketing and performance marketing. of course, we're happy -- if revenue comes back more quickly, we're happy to pick up the pace and spend more of that, because that means more revenue will come. the reason why we believe q3 will look better than q2 is, q2 -- our assumption for q2 is that it stays pretty much at where we are today. and so, we commented on bookings and other revenue-related indicators for our business to be down over 90% right now in end of march and in april. we expect that to more or less extend into the rest of the quarter. maybe there is upside to that, maybe there is a recovery faster in june, but we're not banking on that near-term. we are expecting that there will be more of a recovery of revenue into q3, still very much down year-over-year, but more of a recovery than we've seen in q2, and we believe we're now really at the bottom level.
also, i highlighted some of the cost savings that we are -- that we're instituting and picking benefit off, and i said that we expect q3 benefits to be higher than q2 benefits. that's because we get a full quarter of some of these cost reductions that we make. in q2, we only get part of the quarter for that. so that together is in the statement that we expect q3 ebitda performance to improve from q2.
brad erickson -- needham & co. -- analyst
got it. and then, just a quick housekeeping. you guys report average monthly uniques for the quarter anywhere, i saw there is a number for q3 of '19, just curious where that numbers shook out for q1 of '20. thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
average monthly uniques of what, sorry?
brad erickson -- needham & co. -- analyst
just average monthly uniques on the...
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
uniques? no, we've not reported that this quarter or for some quarters.
brad erickson -- needham & co. -- analyst
got it. thanks.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of eric sheridan with ubs. your line is open.
eric sheridan -- ubs -- analyst
thanks so much for taking the question. maybe one big picture and one sort of housekeeping matter. steve, bigger picture, you talked a little bit about sort of the dynamics where you will invest in the portfolio of assets you have, can you share your world view on how you think maybe the industry may consolidate or there might be pockets of the industry that scale becomes more important on the other side of covid-19 obviously pretty unprecedented in what we're living through right now. and i'm just kind of curious for your views on how the industry might evolve on the other side of this.
and then, coming back to the deal that was announced in november with trip.com in china. my understanding of that deal was, they had to purchase in the open market within a year to maintain the board seat [phonetic], have they made any such purchases and how is that relationship evolving or how could that be implemented in the next couple of years? thanks so much.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, eric. i'll take the first part of that. in terms of -- at the biggest macro level from a traveler perspective, how do i think things are going to change in travel in a two, three-year time frame, i got to say, not much people love to travel. it's more and more of the younger generations growing up looking for experiences in travel always rate super highly on what people want to do. so, the demand, i believe, will be there. and so then what happens in the supply side, especially in the midst of this pandemic, certainly we feel for all of these hotels out there that are going through an incredibly rough patch. and unfortunately one can guess that a number going to be recapitalized in one form or another.
but if you leave my prediction that the demand will be returning within a couple of years at least, then you have the same need for accommodations and so the hotels may come under a different flag or may be reborn under different ownership in general, but they're there. and perhaps more will join chains, perhaps the reverse, that's a bit tough for me to read right now.
on the attraction side of things, it's going to be other big suppliers that we care about. yes, again, super tough time and there may be a thinning out that would be unfortunate from our perspective. but where there is a need and where that demand will grow, those tour providers will quickly come back into business and many of those are not highly capital intensive, so they can spring back.
restaurants, again, some closures, some reopenings as demand emerges. it's a big -- super big macro level, you already have such a consolidation among the big otas that there is kind of not much further that that can go, in my opinion at least. so it's not clear that there is going to be tectonic shifts in the travel space that we will look back in three or five years and say, wow, look what this pandemic caused in terms of the big supply -- the big suppliers of the big intermediaries being consolidated. but again, just my two sense.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
to your second question, our trip.com, yes, excited about that relationship, excited about the opportunity that we have together. the joint venture in china that we're working on together now has moved through its transition phase and is now implementing the strategy for the business, and we're excited to work on that with trip.com. as you point out, there is an ongoing step with the board seat, there are some regulatory approvals that are still required before we get there, but we continue to have a strong relationship with ctrip and are excited about the partnership that we forged.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of tom white with d.a. davidson. your line is open.
tom white -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thanks. steve, i think you made some comments about expecting kind of a rebound in the hotel auction in a recovery. and on one hand, i guess that makes sense that the large otas kind of might be in sort of a land grab mode, given that everyone has been dark for a while. but just curious if there is any more color you can give on kind of what gives you confidence about that, given that those big advertisers have been kind of leaning away a bit from the metasearch channel in recent quarters.
and then, just a follow-up, just curious if there is any update on how you guys are thinking about alternative accommodations or vacation rentals, that category, have your views changed there given the pandemic? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, tom. good question. i'd say, when looking at how i expect hotel chains and otas to play in our metasearch environment or any metasearch environment, i'm simply going off of prior downturns. and the basic economics that, say, the individual hotels are going to be very hungry for demand because they'll be operating and there is a huge difference to them, whether they're operating at a 40% occupancy or a 60% occupancy. and so, they will naturally turn to us as well as the otas to help fill the rooms. and as they are willing to pay more in a marketing way, that ends up coming back directly to us or through the ota channel if they're making more money than they're willing to spend more on various channels. more succinctly, i'm drawing on past experience in this case. demand hasn't really brought back -- hasn't really come back yet in a way that allows me to have evidence to prove it one way or the other. but we certainly think it's a very reasonable thesis based upon history.
to the second question on rentals, we know rentals -- alternative accommodations are clearly an important choice for consumers to have. we believe in maintaining that choice on our platform. it's all about helping guide the travelers on their considered trip and in many, many cases having an entire home is better than a couple of rooms in a hotel. so, i don't think our views have changed at this point, certainly not with respect to pandemic. there is an argument that says, alternative accommodations come back a little quicker than hotels, but probably on the margin, and i'm not even sure that i personally buy into that. i find anecdotally different opinions depending on different demographics i speak with.
tom white -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thank you.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
certainly.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of lee horowitz with evercore. your line is open.
lee horowitz -- evercore -- analyst
great. thanks for the question. just wonder if i could, i guess, with travel likely remaining much more localized in the near-term, people getting on their car and driving to their new vacation destination, how are you thinking about adjusting your business model in order to capitalize on that trend, if at all, and how may that effect the model, i guess, in the near-term in terms of revenue per user? or any kind of color there on localized travel would be helpful. thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a great comment, great observation. we certainly agree with it. and our research would say, and all the research i've seen says a domestic trip is going to be much more common than before. that's great with us. we have all the content we need in every country to help folks have a great local trip. so, on the tripadvisor homepage, if you're coming from a u.s. ip, you're going to see -- fewer times will you be seeing paris and bangkok, and much more often it might be an austin or a san francisco. so, we just think it's easy for us to market destinations that we already cover very, very well to more of a -- with more of a local audience. and initially it will be drive trips, but i think the big delineation is just going to be domestic versus international.
and if you were thinking about going -- you're sitting in boston, and you were thinking of going to paris for the summer, it's a considered trip, and you're going to be just as interested in my opinion about taking that considered trip somewhere else in the u.s. and so, whether it's a drive or a flight, it's going to be, you need the best place to stay, you need advice from your community, you need memorable things to do and wonderful restaurants to eat at. and we'll have all of that, we already have all of that information, and we hope to be it one-off, if not the most accurate source, for wonderful things to do in each of the countries in which we serve.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
in terms of revenue per user, we would expect that to be just a shift in spending toward domestic spending, so not necessarily a change of the revenue we can generate per user.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of shweta khajuria with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
shweta khajuria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you. how do you see the current environment from covid different from maybe past recessions? in your letter, you did call out prior recessions and potential for quicker recovery because demand for travel will be there, travelers still want to travel. how do you compare this covid-related downturn versus what we've -- what you've seen in the past in '08 and '09, how is it different and how will the recovery be different? thank you.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thanks. i'll start, then let ernst toss in some comments. i think it certainly will be different. past downturns have been very economically forecast, so -- or economically impactful, meaning there was always a class of individuals who could afford to travel and would happily go anywhere, was just economically impaired. whereas here, even though this pandemic -- even those [phonetic] with the ability to take the trip are not going on the trip anywhere at the moment, and when the restrictions ease up will likely much more stay domestic. it's going to be a little hard to fathom how travel completely returns to normal until there is a vaccine or months of no new cases taking hold.
and so, we all think, or many of us think, that that's quite a ways out. so, what the airlines and hotels and travel suppliers are doing to make people comfortable traveling, and the information that we can provide of course helps bring it back. but our forecast, we think, would be quite different where it [phonetic] and i see this painfully where it's merely a recession versus something that causes people meaningful health concerns when traveling.
ernst, i don't know if you want to add?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yeah, not much to add. it's obviously much sharper for the travel industry, a much sharper reaction and a much sharper reduction of revenue than '07, '08, '09 where -- but that may mean -- that doesn't mean that the recovery path is much longer than it was at that time. it is -- that is difficult to forecast. what i do observe is that the economic support structure, the financial markets are functioning really well, and it feels that there is enough liquidity available for companies which at least bodes well for the potential shape of the overall economic recovery.
shweta khajuria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you, steve. thanks, ernst.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of kevin kopelman with cowen. your line is open.
kevin kopelman -- cowen -- analyst
hi. thanks a lot. i've had a question about google, they made some changes to their different vertical and shopping, they made some changes to allow free price ads or organic price ads essentially, and do you have any thoughts on -- do you expect something like that to happen in travel? and if so, if tripadvisor would be able to participate? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
hi. this is steve. my thoughts -- yes, we noted what they were doing with shopping. i think the competitive dynamics are pretty different in the shopping category versus travel. so, look, when google makes a change or google offers a new product, we certainly happily look at it and see if it fits our business needs, but i'm not spending a lot of time sort of guessing about whether or something like that is coming into the travel category.
kevin kopelman -- cowen -- analyst
okay. understood. thanks, steve.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from james lee with mizuho. your line is open.
james lee -- mizuho -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. hope everybody is healthy and safe. steve, just curious, as you go through the portfolio review process, how should we think about your ability in terms of streamlining your business even more? i'm thinking about maybe your tripadvisor china jv, would you necessarily want to be in that business or potentially exiting some of the geographies or even vacation rental business? so, in other words, looking at categories where you do not -- where you do not have a leading position specifically. thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, james. so, i think we did a year back look at our china offering and said, yeah, we're not going to be able to do this alone. so, we put it into the jv, which does effectively take it off of our books. and to the extent as the junior jv partner, ctrip or trip.com can use all of our content information to help chinese travelers. that's clearly a win for us, and it's clearly a win for trip.com. so, kind of -- on my check list, that's a great, done. i've already achieved the streamlining that, i think, you're alluding to.
for rentals, it's still an evolution. we want the alternative accommodations to be part of the experience that tripadvisor offers. we have our own rental supply augmented by some other partners. and so, how can we further both improve the supply in our site and knowing that we're not going to be the king in the supply area, is there a better way that we can deal with that part of our business. we also did announce that our smarter travel business is being -- some of the brands folded into to tripadvisor, and we are looking to see whether there is some other better homes for some of those brands that we had acquired many, many years ago. so, the streamlining in the portfolio review did happen, it's obviously ongoing. so that we're enabled -- so that we are able to really focus on what we expect and what we would hope would be the big wins in the next three to five-year timeframe.
james lee -- mizuho -- analyst
great. if i can ask the follow-up questions -- are you expecting any, maybe structural changes to your customer behavior, whether it's on the supplier side or user side, for example, i'm thinking about maybe experiences suppliers moving to online faster. so, maybe you're anticipating to capitalize on that. and also maybe help us think about maybe potentially new business model emerging where you can provide content to raise consumer confidence or potential results, some of the potential frictions when it comes to travel? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
hi. so you raised two things certainly, online -- more experienced providers coming online. i think the number are doing that. we have a business unit called bokun, which is dedicated to exactly that. and they continue to sell in, in the marketplace. it's combined with the channel on both viator and tripadvisor for when people are ready to do those experiences again that we can help steer them to it. so i think that's a natural. we already have a lot of supply on our viator platform. so, well, i think that's a long-term secular benefit to us. i don't think it's a -- it's a particular needle mover over the next year.
and then, on the confidence to travel, i don't view it as an additional business model, but more -- the folks who are coming to tripadvisor because they're exploring, they're thinking about the trip the more we can provide information to make that traveler feel comfortable, where appropriate, that they can travel safely and stay safely and eat safely, that's going to help conversion rate. and they're already on our site. so, they convert by booking that experience or booking that hotel on our site or booking that hotel by clicking off to a booking or an expedia or marriott or a hilton, we're indifferent. but because of that raised confidence, we've helped the conversion, and that benefits us.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and i would add to both these points about the portfolio as well as the change -- structural changes in behavior. we have obviously been ruthlessly, now ruthlessly focused on what it is that we invest behind. as we said in our opening remarks, we have done a lay-off of close to a quarter of our people, and so we have very, very consciously now thought about how do we want to allocate the 75% that are still in the company.
certain businesses have been de-prioritized and focused, certain activities have been de-prioritized and focused, and certain activities we're just laser-focused on continuing to build our competitive advantage, and experiences that you talked about is one of them. experiences & dining are growth areas. we feel we have a very strong competitive position. we are investing to remain leaders in these industries and we want to emerge from this crisis really in a very, very strong position. so, looking at opportunities that may offer in terms of more rapid online movement as you were saying or other opportunities is something we're super-focused on despite the fact that we've reduced our cost.
james lee -- mizuho -- analyst
thanks, ernst.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our question comes from brian fitzgerald with wells fargo. your line is open.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, guys. had a couple of questions, maybe one to follow-up to tom's question. and steve, i'm wondering from the traveler point of view, are you seeing any nuances with respect to traveler preference for alternative inventory versus proper hotels as we emerge from this, hey, i'd rather stay at some place where they have seals on the doors and uv light cleaning versus some guy's vacation rental. so, nuances around that.
and then, the second question was around your dining assets, bookatable and lafourchette. as we emerge from this crisis, i think, the scheduling aspect of showing up at places, right, they're not going to be able to open up another table in the corner to seat you, it's going to be a third-full to a half-full and they're going to have to measure that and meter that very carefully. how do you feel about the opportunities of those -- your dining assets being kind of exacerbated or highlighted as we emerge from this?
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. two good questions. the first one, unfortunately i don't have much insight in terms of alternative accommodation versus hotels and user preferences. we've thought about it. we see it both ways, but our traffic isn't such that it's insightful at this point in time. to restaurants, yeah, there is -- as restaurants open up and they need to reconfigure their tables, especially in europe where the restaurants are in fact smaller, thefork can play quite a useful role from a traveler perspective to make sure there is room there. you don't want to venture out and then sure enough there is no room at the restaurant. but also from the restaurant management perspective, to help educate the restaurant toward that, maybe it's time, especially in europe, to shift to two seatings, 6 pm and 8 pm in europe, and 8 pm and 10 pm dining opportunity.
and reservation management system helps one do that, combined with the online capabilities. i don't want to imply that this could be a big driver for lafourchette because the whole restaurant industry is hurting. but i think, as dining goes back, more new habits are going to be formed, including making sure i can get a table when i venture out, and thefork does that beautifully. so, i think, with big changes comes opportunities, and i think thefork certainly throughout europe is going to be able to leverage this to help restaurants and travelers even more than before.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and i think more broadly, as steve said it before, more broadly tripadvisor as a brand is so well trusted for providing great information to its users and more information about, as steve says, layout of a restaurant or how good is an experienced supply or a hotel in social distancing, cleaning, more information is going to be a premium. and we think we have the brand to benefit from that.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
awesome. thanks, guys. appreciate it.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from heath terry with goldman sachs. your line is open.
heath terry -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks. steve, i was just wondering if, given the -- obviously the world we're living in now, doesn't come along very often. is there any way that you're looking at this as an opportunity to revisit some of things that you may have tried before where it wasn't just -- simply just wasn't the right time in the industry or the industry your customers, the hotels maybe weren't necessarily ready for it. instant booking comes to mind but it's not the only thing that i'm thinking of here that may be given where the business is here, you have some air cover to try some things that are a little bit more extreme in evolving your business model. just curious kind of getting beyond the quarter and the current crisis, as somebody who has been through these before and seen a lot of evolution in the industry, how you might be looking at this as an opportunity for trip?
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, heath. great question. you bet, we've been thinking hard about this. frankly not so much from the perspective of instant booking though it may have a role, but really more from reinventing the experience of a traveler coming to tripadvisor to plan that important trip. and historically, because we were so successful in so many categories and we were growing, we opted for speed and we opted for focusing on conversion around our hotel shopping or experience shopping. we are growing our inventory, all wide range of things that made a lot of sense and grew the company quite nicely over the past couple of decades.
this is an opportunity we have and are taking right now to reimagine the consumer experience around that considered trip, around the planning aspect where consumer -- traveler isn't just looking for a hotel or isn't just looking for something to do. they're looking to have an amazing time visiting philadelphia or san francisco, wherever the trip is going and how can we internally and, this is product, this is tech, this is sharing information, this is great data access, this is treating the traveler throughout their life cycle when they're first discovering a location, all the way through collecting the five or six things they want to do when they get there, and having an amazing itinerary so that they -- so that we're not a stop along the way for planning a trip, but we're the travel hub where someone is starting. however they found us, but with so much wonderful functionality designed around completing that entire trip that they keep coming back and back.
and to be fair, that's coming at the expense of some of the other things that we had been doing for a couple of decades in terms of making the hotel shopping path as smooth and frictionless as possible or making sure we had all the perfect payment types in all the different markets that we were supporting.
so, to your question, we are taking this opportunity where are the fundamentals of the revenue of our business is dependent upon traffic coming back, and we're not able to influence that a lot to really rebuild from much more foundational perspective, how we want the traveler to experience trip planning on tripadvisor, so that as we emerge, trips are planned are bigger, are more complete, users were turning to tripadvisor many more times. and the end of the day, our total unique users per month might go down, but the repeat rate goes way up because we've found the set of audience that is entirely -- that loves being dependent upon tripadvisor for the whole experience versus using us for a point task. and that's not a one-quarter or a two-quarter journey, but that is, i'd say, the biggest way that we think this pandemic will contribute to reinventing tripadvisor.
heath terry -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. i really appreciate the answer, steve. thank you.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and there are no further questions at this time. i will now turn the call back over to steve kaufer. your line is open.
stephen kaufer -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, everyone, for joining the call. we are navigating tough times, and we have had to bid farewell to a number of exceptional employees. on behalf of the tripadvisor family, i want to extend a heartfelt thank you to these colleagues for their passion and their service. and to my current teammates at tripadvisor, you're doing an amazing job. i'm very proud of how you've all stepped up to help our business partners in the industry, and with the site updates that we've already launched and we'll soon launch to help the billions of travelers who trust us to safely guide them on their next journey.
the near-term remains unpredictable. but time and time again, we have seen the hospitality industry recover and thrive. concerted actions have solidified our financial position and will help us to emerge a more focused business on the other side. we will continue executing our strategy and ensure tripadvisor plays an influential role with consumers and partners worldwide in the recovery and beyond.
so, thanks, everyone, and please stay safe.

"
2020-Q2,TRIP,2020-08-07 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to tripadvisor second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to tripadvisor's vice president of investor relations, mr. will lyons. please go ahead.
will lyons -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, catherine. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. joining me today is our ceo, steve kaufer and our cfo, ernst teunissen. last night, after market close, we distributed and filed our second quarter 2020 earnings release and made available our shareholder letter on our investor relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com.
in the release, you will find reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures discussed on this call. also, on our ir site, you will find supplemental financial information which includes reconciliations of certain non-gaap financial measures discussed on this call as well as other metrics.
before we begin, i'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's views as of today, august 7th, 2020. tripadvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. please refer to our earnings release as well as our filings with the sec for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
and with that, i'll pass the call to steve.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, will, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining the call. as you saw from our results and described in our shareholder letter that we posted last night, the second quarter was one of historic proportion, given the impacts of covid-19 pandemic is having on our business and on the travel industry.
significant year-over-year impacts persist, but we are encouraged by gradually improving trends since april. monthly unique users on tripadvisor sites progressed from 33% of last year's comparable period in april to 67% of last year's comparable period in july. revenue improved from 10% of last year's period in april and may to approximately 30% of last year's comparable period in july.
so while q2 was challenging, we have emerged from our industry's darkest of days. i remain confident that while it may take time and be uneven along the way, it will eventually fully return. in the meantime, we are executing well on what we can control, streamlining our operations to preserve cash, leveraging our platform's differentiated strengths to help customers and redoubling our strategic efforts to address future opportunities and emerge in a strong position on the other side of this pandemic.
now before i turn the call over to ernst, i want to, again, extend a thank you to all frontline workers, from medical professionals to the everyday heroes working in our local grocery stores or delivery services. and to our employees, i'm grateful for your tireless hard work during this difficult period. you have demonstrated both your talent and your resilience. i am pleased with how we have come together to execute on our important initiatives that serve our stakeholders, ernst?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve, and good morning, everyone. in the face of this unprecedented uncertainty, during q2, we took swift and concerted action to preserve cash and maintain our solid financial position. first, related to expense management, we are tracking in line with the targeted discretionary and workforce related savings levels that we discussed with you three months ago.
i'll note that these cost savings i'm about to reference do not consider depreciation, amortization, restructuring and related reorganization costs as well as stock-based compensation. so specifically, our expenses were $104 million lower in q2 compared to q1. $53 million of this was due to variable cost, which came down roughly in line with the revenue and $51 million was from savings from previously announced discretionary and workforce related cost measures.
we expect annualized savings of these more fixed, discretionary and workforce related cost will be in excess of $200 million this year versus 2019, positioning us very well as we enter 2021. the variable costs are expected to be lower this year as well, driven by reduced marketing spend and lower expected revenue but will go up again as revenue recovers.
we are executing as a leaner and more focused organization now and we are pursuing our highest business priorities. we believe the steps we've taken position the business for better flow through as consumer travel demand returns and the revenue recovers.
as for liquidity, we had close to $700 million of cash at the end of june. and in july, we completed a $500 million bond offering. this offering has provided us with a long-term debt capital, and together with our credit facility, ample liquidity to withstand even prolonged covid scenarios.
we believe our actions to streamline operations, conserve cash, and raise long-term debt capital have the business appropriately capitalized now and positioned for covenant compliance even in the event of a prolonged downturn.
looking ahead, significant year-over-year impacts persist and near-term visibility remains low. that said, we expect revenue declines will improve and ebitda loss to narrow meaningfully in q3 versus q2. we remain cautious, but we believe we have taken the necessary steps to ensure we can emerge from this pandemic in solid financial as well as strategic shape.
with that, we will open it up for your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from deepak mathivanan with barclays. your line is open.
deepak mathivanan -- barclays -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. steve, i understand that it's still in early days, but can you talk about how user behavior is different in the new homepage? what products are getting more traffic and is engagement different to one product versus the other compared to the prior experience?
and then the second question is, you mentioned in the letter that the traffic in european markets recovered faster than u.s. obviously u.s. was early to reopen in many states and many european nations are still in the reopen mode right now. what do you think the traffic recovery was driven to be faster in europe for you? is it a function of product mix in europe more toward restaurants, attractions? can you provide a little bit additional color there? thank you.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure, deepak. thanks for the questions. so to start on the homepage, look we're -- as we've talked about our overall message of helping travelers' on the considered trip, a trip that really matters to people, we needed to move the focus away from, hey, it's a hotel price comparison site or just review site to really focus on a little bit of inspiration, a little bit of guides, little bit of more personality on the site, showcasing all the different things we do.
so yes, we did see some shifts from categories away from things like a flight, it's a small piece, and more toward overall exploring geographies. the nice thing is that we saw an immediate uptick in repeat rate, people that came in on the homepage were more likely do come back, because the experience was just better.
category shifts beyond that are probably more related to covid, in terms of the type of trips that people are taking are clearly much more domestic. they tend to be a little shorter duration and they're moving away from urban centers and toward the outdoors, the beach, the -- places where social distancing is so much easier. and that's --- i think that's probably less our homepage redesign than obviously the circumstances around us.
to your second question, the european markets recovering faster than the u.s., it's all about safety. our surveys are showing this when travelers' feel comfortable that they can go somewhere they will. so as european markets opened up because caseload, frankly the chance of contracting the virus is so much lower, people are feeling much more comfortable traveling.
the u.s. has not been shining in that regard. and so while we had opened up earlier or not locked down as hard, we're paying the price now in terms of cases on the rise in so many states and that's put a damp -- a meaningful damper on the travel rebound post the initial outbreak. so, no surprise, i think you'll see a very uneven recovery, different geographies, mostly depending on caseload and where the hotspots emerge.
deepak mathivanan -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thanks, steve.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brad erickson with needham & company. your line is open.
brad erickson -- needham & company. -- analyst
hi, thanks. just a couple from me. so first, relative to the improving traffic levels you gave into july, the revenue declines are obviously lagging that somewhat. just curious if that's a gap you expect to meaningfully narrow as early as say q3 or q4. do you expect those two items to remain pretty far apart for the foreseeable future into next year?
and then, the second question is just when you think about, call it, medium-term priorities, is the goal to -- of the business right now to drive a rebound to revenue as fast as possible or is it getting -- going to be siding more with getting back to profitability or a combination thereof? just talk about your philosophy here in the medium term. thanks.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yeah, thank you, brad. this is ernst. good morning. first of all, on the lag between traffic and revenue that you identified. yes indeed, we see that people are coming back to our sites to look and investigate travel ahead of the actual conversion which is down from a year ago and that is quite natural, if you think about it. people start to look around and are waiting to get comfortable to book.
and so i think we will -- throughout the year, we will see a lag between these two indicators. but, traffic is a leading indicator. in fact the people are coming back now and the improvement has been significant since april, may, as steve said in his opening remarks. that is a good sign and is a leading indicator. how quickly that gap will close is really difficult to say for us, but we're anticipating that gap will remain for a while. but hey, revenue has improved 10% april, may versus last year and now 30% in july, so we're taking that.
in terms of medium-term priorities, of course, we're focused on making sure we're ready for a recovery and we're able to serve consumers as they are getting more willing to travel and book, but we're also focused on the priorities that we have before when the covid finally is -- it goes away and we want to come out of this crisis stronger than we were before.
we've highlighted in our prepared remarks and in our shareholder letter, there are some areas where we're investing, not surprisingly experiences & dining, not surprisingly working on our one tripadvisor experience, working on some new revenue streams that we've identified on the -- more on the direct-to-consumer side. so we -- the team is fully focused on that, trying to capture both revenue recovery near term and our long-term opportunities.
brad erickson -- needham & company. -- analyst
got it, thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from lloyd walmsley with deutsche bank. your line is open.
lloyd walmsley -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the question. going back to the kind of traffic revenue recovery gap, are you seeing -- are you seeing commercial engagement lag or is it also a function of advertisers being slow to come back and are there anything you can do to kind of steepen the bid curve to get them bidding up again or maybe even using your own booking path to monetize traffic if advertisers aren't willing to pay what it's worth?
and second one would just be, to the extent you can, if you can give us an update on some of the july trends, on a segment level, anything you can share with us across some of the various segments?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thanks lloyd. this is steve, i'll take the first one. so as the pandemic hit, it's pretty obvious to everyone that cancellation rates on the downstream bookings that we're providing to our partners would spike, as people change. so the recovery of that where people are now booking and our clients are not sure whether the cancellation is going to happen naturally causes our clients to be nervous about paying top dollar if -- right now on a cpc basis, if in fact a user is going to cancel.
so yes, i'd surmise that it's rational behavior in this unknown period for cpcs, for what we get paid to lag as bookings recover. we believe as our clients see the trends of consumers staying after they are making the reservation and fulfilling it, actually taking the trip, then they'll be more confident that the cpcs they pay us will in fact be turned into profit on their side, at which point cpcs go up in our auction and it comes kind of back to -- back to where things were.
to the question of -- or the sub-question ""hey, could we use our own instant booking as another way to leverage the auction?"" yes, we've been doing that during this pandemic and that enabled us to continue to deliver for our travelers on all the bookings that they want to do, even as some auction players were too hesitant to step back in the auction back in april and may, for instance. ernst [speech overlap].
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yeah, on the second question, you know the july trends on a more segment level. the areas of the business that are recovering the fastest or ahead in the recovery for us are our restaurant business, thefork reservation business which has performed very strongly in the wake of restaurants opening in europe. and so that's clearly the -- an area where we're ahead right now.
rentals is another area that has performed relatively strongly compared to others. so, on a segment level, obviously thefork will hit our experiences & dining segment and will benefit our experiences & dining segment. rentals is in our other segment. hotels comes behind that. that's obviously in our hm&p segment and then experiences which has seen very good traffic recovery, but not yet the booking recovery that we see in other parts of the business that will also hit experiences & dining. so within experiences & dining there is a bit of a two-track in terms of recovery with the restaurants ahead and experiences behind.
lloyd walmsley -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, thanks guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from naved khan with suntrust. your line is open.
naved khan -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
yeah, hi. thanks a lot. two questions. we've been hearing about consumer demand skewing much heavier toward alternative logging during the recovery. how does that affect the recovery in your hotel auctions?
and then secondarily, expedia has told about boosting advertising efficiency on performance channels, how does that factor into auction recovery on your platform?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thanks naved. sure, so, yes as ernst was saying alternative lodging or rentals has been faster to recover than hotels, it's a smaller part of our overall business. so we were less benefited by that, by that shift. but of course hotels are on the rebound now and will continue. it's the absolute lion's share of the lodging market space.
so the question, i'm sorry, the second part of your question was...
naved khan -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
just around expedia's change of ad efficiency targets and how that might affect [speech overlap].
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so we have seen our major ota clients talk about wanting to be more efficient in their direct marketing spend for years and years. what we've always found is that they're interested in buying high quality traffic. traffic that converts on their side and that's what we've been known for. we've been doing this for quite a while. our partners have had -- they were pulled out of our auctions. we've been happy and have strong relationships with all of them. and that's been a win-win for everyone.
we certainly understand our client's desire to directly win over the consumer to go direct to their site. but at the end of the day tripadvisor does so well with a leisure trip, the trip that matters to them, that tends to be a higher price point than, ""hey, i just need a roadside hotel next to my next business meeting etc."" so the type of traffic that we have is pretty hard to find anywhere else.
it's an auction, so it requires lots of people to play, and fortunately, we do have the chains. we do have all the major ota and most of the second tier or third tier otas on the platform as we always have been. so there is always some ins and outs there but i'd characterize the auction as healthy and currently responding to the change in cancellation and truly just covid dynamics.
naved khan -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
and maybe a related question, steve. so on the new hotel offering that you plan to launch in q3. is that display advertising focused or is that option focused? how should we think about it?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
we have a large and sort of meaningful hotel solutions business where we're addressing challenges. we're helping individual hoteliers and hotel chains reach the eyeballs that are on our site, help them grow their business. and we have another product coming that is truly aimed at the million plus lodging, leveraging the traffic we have, the reputation that we provide for these hotels and their ability to put more heads in bed.
so i wish i could be more specific, but you'll learn soon. and again, just think of it as another product in the product line and as we move forward, we look to bundle a bunch of these products together to help hoteliers in more ways.
naved khan -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thank you.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and the way we report revenue, it will hit the hotel revenue line, not the display and core-x [phonetic] line.
naved khan -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
got it. thanks, ernst.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tom white with d.a. davidson. your line is open.
tom white -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. maybe a high level one for you, steve. you know now we're a few more months into the pandemic, just curious whether you think the situation here is going to have any kind of lasting impact on kind of the traditional hotel food chain, if you will? specifically, curious whether you think larger hotel chains kind of emerge on the other side of this thing in a stronger market position relative to the independents and small chains and how does that impact guys like tripadvisor?
and then, just a quick follow-up on monetization of the auction. i think one of your peers is experimenting with a cpa offering on top of cpc offering. is that something that you guys have considered and why or why not? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, tom. two good questions there. so -- and this is just kind of personal opinion, i guess. when you look at the growth in alternative lodging rentals at the moment, i think it is an opportunity where a lot of people are trying that alternative for the first time. so there is probably post pandemic a little bit of an accelerated share shift in the lodging category toward some more of the alternative lodging pieces, and tripadvisor, like everyone else, is looking to kind of grow the selection on our site.
i think that's a bit more on the edges. when you look on the chains versus independents, we've spoken with a number of independents, they're certainly struggling. they tend -- whether they're a franchise owner or a true independent getting demand through these tough times, it's really tough.
and so, when we look a bit further out and say who might not make it through the cycle. obviously, the chains will, some of the indes may not, and so, that could tilt the balance a bit more toward the chain. as it relates to tripadvisor, i don't see any particular impact in that. we serve the -- our travelers, the biggest lever for the growth of our overall business is getting more quality travelers to return to our site and figure out where they want to go and it frankly doesn't matter all that much to us, whether that's an inde franchise owners or a fully chain-owned property
to the question on the auction cpa, we've had a variety of different payment mechanisms for many years. so we call our model a traditional cpc. people pay on the click, but we've certainly had cpa and has cpa as an alternative method where it works for the clients and where it works for us. normally clients prefer cpc, so they can correctly control and where they sit in our auction.
but in major uncertain times like we saw a month ago. i'd say it's easing now, but where there is major uncertainty and the client doesn't want to take the risk of bidding at a cpc level but is happy to pay on a cpa, we can certainly accommodate that and have accommodated that as well.
it doesn't fundamentally change our auction. it just shifts a little bit of the risk around if the cancellation happens, is it on tripadvisor's dime or the client's dime in exchange for a more control over auction placement. i expect that for us and perhaps for others that that will end up flipping back over the next few quarters for clients that are on cpa now to move back to cpc, but we're modestly indifferent on our end.
tom white -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from shweta khajuria with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
shweta khajuria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, thank you. steve, what is your view on how differently tripadvisor will be positioned post covid, not really next year, but call it a couple of years from today as some of your current strategic investments come to fruition. so maybe the company is better positioned in terms of product offerings or company's ability to engage users' better, maybe improved content or completely something else altogether. but what do you think will be -- will likely be the most impactful change related to tripadvisor's positioning post covid a couple of years from today. thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thank you shweta, for that question. we're investing quite a bit right now in changing the way that tripadvisor both goes to market with our offering but also how we're actually serving our travelers. so in our shareholder letter, kind of we outlined or at least three of those points are the most sort consumer focused.
our one tripadvisor vision really talks about how we're changing, and you can see it on our homepage already, changing how we're helping travelers plan a much more complete trip, focusing, again on those trips that matter and that's something unique in the industry. you don't have -- or the other travel sites thinking holistically about what's going to make a fabulous vacation. so it's not just the hotel, it's not just the flight; it's the things you're going to do, the places you're going to eat, the guides, the new experiences you're going to find, the amazing memories, the opportunities to really experience that destination.
and because tripadvisor has so many of those components already on the site with a ton of photos, ton of content, great forums, wonderful community to help guide you, our opportunity is to bring that together for the traveler in a way that we've never done before and would certainly be really difficult for anyone else to try to reach. so aiming for that trip that matters, the vacation that you're creating the memories for, bringing our concepts together; kind point one. we want you to experience that. we want you to fall in love all over again.
part of that comes in to, as we were known and make most of our money historically on hotels, how do we shift that over to the experiences category, in particular, on tripadvisor because it is such a compelling part of making that trip memorable. what's the amazing thing to do? and so, sure, we might sell some airport transfers and an entry ticket to museum, but what we care about is the story-worthy experiences.
what are you going to return from your vacation and really explain to your friends ""wow, paris was amazing because"", and share that experience that you booked, ""oh, where did you find that experience"", ""i've booked it on tripadvisor."" and that's that word of mouth; that's that component that we are looking for to grow our experience in dining segment for -- or as part of that considered trip.
and then third, i'd be remiss if i didn't touch on our direct-to-consumer paid offering. so, we're looking at hundreds of millions of travelers we have on our site each and every month even in the middle of the pandemic and we're thinking to ourselves, what are the other products and services that we can offer directly to them, helping them plan a trip, take a trip, get a different experience, deliver something of value to them.
and we've launched two already. one was an insurance product in partnership. and so it's an insurance for the whole year as opposed to just this one trip, something where you're in a pretty good position to offer. and another is a community of expert trip designer.
so as an -- almost an agency service for someone that doesn't want to do it all themselves. it's a great product to be able to say, i'd like an -- i'm going on vacation, i'm going to go on a trip to hawaii. i'd love to be able to talk to somebody who has been there, who likes the things i like, and it's a great matchmaking service. you can certainly find more about the product.
but just as an example, it's two services direct-to-consumer, paid offering leveraging the traffic on our site. and as we've shared in the shareholder letter, it's the first of a set and what we think is a potentially large opportunity in terms of tapping into the travel audience that is already on our site with the new set of products and services to help them have those magical trips.
and so stacking all the way up when we think of emerging from the pandemic, are vaccines available or look out 2022 and say what makes tripadvisor really differ than the pre-covid times? folks on our site are planning a complete trip. we're helping them at the different stages of the journey. it feels like a more integrated experience. that's the one tripadvisor version.
experiences are a lot more prominent, more story worthy, we're merchandising them, we're really helping you find what's perfect for you on this trip and we're surrounding you with another set of direct to consumer or paid services be it trip designers to help you plan, insurance or several more that we'd love to bring to market that help you in one way, shape or form have that perfect trip.
shweta khajuria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you, steve. that was helpful. if i may, could you please expand on b2c? i did read in the shareholder letter either subscription or other direct to consumer paid offerings. so, would this be a subscription product? how do you plan to monetize this offering going forward?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. so i mean happy to expand a bit. super early days, of course, but we have a paid insurance product, it's -- i forgot the exact price, call it $130 a year and we're offering you coverage for all the trips that you take and you can find that on tripadvisor. we contextually market it, where we think it's appropriate, and it's a great product. it's actually kind of hard to find somewhere else.
we didn't build that one. we're not getting into the insurance business ourselves, but we're trying to tap our audience and the consumer is buying it through our site, so direct-to-consumer. more meaningful and more in line with our brand. but again, covid is not a great time to launch any new product, but we launched anyways, is our reco product. in this, you go through a process to indicate what type of trip you're planning to take. we offer a match to a number of different travel agency or travel agents. we call them trip designers that are great at this sort of trip.
and we have a monetization mechanism that's essentially a matchmaking fees. so a consumer will put in their credit card, they'll buy the connection. the travel agent is at their disposal and it's a great match. so, again, a bit more on the luxury end but a lot of people don't want to spend the time that they know they should when they're going to be go -- when they're taking a couple of thousand dollar vacation and paying $100 or something upfront fee to get that level of expertise to have that magical trip, we're in a wonderful position to provide that service.
you can extrapolate further and say ""hey, are there guides that tripadvisor could offer that have specialized information that was so valuable that someone would pay a $20 subscription or a $20 one-time fee for. you can imagine other programs that could get exclusive seats, exclusive benefits, exclusive something or other that you as a consumer would be willing to pull out your credit card for.
so there's this content angle, there is a discount angle, there is a benefit -- exclusive benefit angle, there is a higher end concierge level service while in market. my point is mostly, we have this tremendous audience bigger than any other travel site that are self-qualified by being on our site as being interested in having usually a great trip, a trip that matters to them.
how are we -- what are the set of services that we can offer that can -- that someone who would be delighted to pay for because they're about to take this trip and it's going to make it that much more special. we share it now because we've actually launched a couple of products in this category. we're thinking of it as a category and of course we will be sharing more as we launch more.
shweta khajuria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
very helpful. thank you, steve.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jed kelly with oppenheimer. your line is open.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my question. interesting on the direct-to-consumer offerings you're thinking about. just a follow-up, i guess, can you kind of cite if you know like what the tradition -- what the commissions earned from traditional travel agents has been and is there an opportunity to get more through that transaction with the direct to consumer offering?
and then my second question is just around the alternative accommodation providers. seems like they've been leading the recovery in travel. is there a way, how do you think about sort of getting them more engaged on your platform, the vrbos, the airbnbs. i mean how do you think about that? thank you.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. so look the -- to your first question, the traditional travel agent, it's still a big market, there are commissions on all the things they book on behalf of the traveler, their model is moving from a completely free in some cases to an upfront fee in other cases. we're reasonably agnostic on the revenue model. we just know that, as in whether we charge an upfront fee to do this matchmaking service, which is our current model or whether we're, through another mechanism, tapping into a piece of the commission.
the trip designer or the travel agent is doing the hard work of really figuring out what the traveler wants. we simply recognized that we have, among our pre-covid we have 400 million unique users a month on the site. some small percentage, but it's still going to be a big number of those people would really be much better served and would love to be well served by a trip designer.
so, how can we help our traveler by presenting the best trip designers and then whether it's a finder's fee or a piece of the commission, there is a big transaction that's going to happen, we'll have kind of earned a piece of it by making the connection. the trip designer is going to be both recommending obviously hotels that are amazing on tripadvisor but also bookable experiences on tripadvisor, because that's what those types of considered trip want to do or not, we would be requiring a trip designer to book through us, but why wouldn't they, because we have fabulous supply.
so again, it drives back to how the tripadvisor offering focusing on that considered trip whether to do-it-yourself person on our website building out an itinerary, booking things independently or a hand off to an agent, who is going through those same steps for them. it's a nice way for us to capture a bigger portion of the market, rather than someone who potentially is using tripadvisor and then contacts an agent offline, in which case we lose all credit for those bookings and lose all influence in terms of helping to guide them to the best experiences that are offered on trip, and the best restaurants that are offered on trip.
to your second question on rentals. we do think that alternative accommodations in general was an important category, is an important category, and will continue to grow as a category that is important to our travelers.
so, we will not be building up our own supply. we will not be focused on trying to engage as what you could say as yet another vacation rental player in the space, but rather be partnering with other firms that already have established relationship so that we can focus on what we do best, which is bring a tremendous audience looking for accommodations.
and our secret sauce or our magic in the equation or value add is to help understand when a traveler would be better served by an alternative accommodation instead of a traditional hotel and make sure that is what's presented.
so think of it as, how can trip -- we think of it as how can tripadvisor have the best supply in that category without investing more of being in the supply business, and therefore, leveraging our demand for which we still have a ton of and we expect to be back in -- we are back in growth mode now as we're recovering from the pandemic.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brian fitzgerald with wells fargo. your line is open.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks guys. steve, wanted to try this out on you. generally when consumers travel closer to home, and we think you tend to see shorter durations, less expensive accommodations versus when they travel farther, is that a valid point? like are you seeing things change near term with more local travel coming back first, replacing bigger international trip? are the consumers trading up versus what you would ordinarily see in the shorter trips in terms of duration or property class? anything you could tell us about the propensity to spend would be helpful.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. i can offer just sort of -- a couple of nuggets. absolutely the trips are closer to home, international border is shut. so you have some countries where we're actually seeing year-on-year the same or even more domestic travel than before. i don't know that that's a long-term trend versus ""hey, i can't take that international trip so i am staying within my country.""
the trips, in general, are shorter. so you're right there and when we look at adrs versus a year ago, they have dropped at least the stay on trip -- sorry not technically -- what i'm referring to is not technically average daily rate, but the amount that the user is looking to spend on our site is down versus a year ago and so that -- adrs could be up but the trip stay could be shorter. i don't have that level of detail on my fingertips, but the overall spend on the part of the traveler is down year-on-year.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo -- analyst
and then, are they willing to spend more on -- just sleeve-for-sleeve inventory comparison, are they -- are you seeing them -- the price elasticity, are they willing to spend more for vacation rental in a rural area this year versus that same place last year?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
good question. i don't have an answer to that. i do know we are seeing more vacation rentals in those rural locations being booked than previous year. again, no surprise there, as people look for space and try to avoid the big cities, but i can't give you a data point on the price point. i just don't know.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo -- analyst
yeah. okay, thank you.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and it's tough to know how that's going to play out. but it could be indeed, as you were sort of speculating that budgets could shift in a different way spending domestically but spending more domestically. there's one thing that i wanted to point out, which i think is going to be obvious to most of you.
one impact is, people are taking trips by car more than they did before and take few flights. i just wanted to point out that we at tripadvisor have never been really dependent on flight revenue. so that particular trend is not impacting us as much. we made about 2% of our revenue last year was impacted by flights. so it's a pretty small slice of it, as i piece that part of the shift, people taking fewer flights is not impacting us that much.
brian fitzgerald -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks, steve. thank you ernst.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from heath terry with goldman sachs. your line is open.
heath terry -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great, thank you very much. steve, as you -- as you look at the opportunity on the other side, on the supplier side, obviously trip is almost equally, if not more important to suppliers like hotels, tour operators as you are to your consumers that use you to plan their trips. as you are evolving the offering and creating these new offerings for people who are planning their trips, anything that you're looking to do or any opportunities that you see in this environment to deepen your relationships with suppliers directly, create more direct revenue opportunities with those suppliers, either through new offerings, new technologies, investments in those areas that that you want to see made?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
yes, thanks. thanks for the question. as i alluded to, we are kind of launching a new product this quarter, that is aimed directly at hoteliers primarily targeted at indes or sort of gms of properties looking to leverage their reputation, their prominence, their ability -- their status on tripadvisor to help turn that into more bookings for them to get -- to get more demand.
we think our current suite of demand-based products, the ability to buy not only a business advantage subscription with your phone number and url, but also our sponsor placement offering of being able to be at the top of the -- of the hotel list, to be able to pull more traffic, pull more the eyeballs to individual properties is pretty compelling as individual properties seek to move demand throughout.
we have some other, i'll call it, you know somewhere in between ideas and plans that we feel could be more meaningful for our supply relationships. none at the ota level but at the individual property and chain level, but those are a bit further off and of course we'll share when they're closer to coming to fruition.
but i only -- i'd give you the teaser or i mention it in passing only because we are quite aware and feel like part of our financial success is dependent upon hoteliers looking to us as a great source of both high-quality leads and incremental demand that they were not otherwise going to see. and one of our best assets remains the traffic that we have on our site, the highly qualified traffic, and our ability to bend the demand curve on behalf of hoteliers if they have a good property that are interested in eyeballs that are on our site. and so, yes, we do have more offerings planned in this area.
heath terry -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and just curious if you -- i mean, is the end result of that or is the goal there diversifying the revenue side of things so that tripadvisor exiting this environment that we're in right now is sort of less dependent on the ota partners that you have now and more have -- in a position to have sort of a broader, more -- hopefully more stable set of revenue streams coming in?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
yes, i also -- yes, what you say is true. i just view it more as we like all companies search for our growth opportunities, what are the assets that are unique to tripadvisor and having the reputation we have, the number of customers and how do we -- the travelers, and how do we best serve them and then -- and that's the trip that matters.
it's bringing together the consolidated view of the traveler to help them plan all the different aspects which is, from our perspective, going to include matching them with the right experience, with the right restaurant, with the right hotel and therefore on the supply side, helping those hoteliers experience and restaurant operators get access to those travelers in a way that is essentially roi positive for them. and so that matchmaking capability at -- a stretch to say one-to-one level, but at a level that's providing measurable incremental benefit to our suppliers. we think it's a great place for tripadvisor to go.
it doesn't happen to be the auction which is dominated by the otas, but of course we love that auction and the more our overall strategy succeeds in terms of bringing more people back to tripadvisor for the considered trip, the regular auction is going to benefit; the individual hoteliers both bidding for incremental demand in the auction as well as all the other products we offer, as well as our experiences business.
you know like, it all benefits as more travelers come back, but our focus is much more around the non-auction revenue streams when we think about the supply side of the house.
heath terry -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you, steve.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from doug anmuth with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
dae lee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. this is dae lee on for doug. thank you for taking the questions. first one for you steve. just looking at your experiences businesses or experiences business, how is your supply base holding out given the slower pace of recovery there and what steps are you taking to ensure that you have ample supply once consumers come back to experiences? and then to maintain your leadership position in this vertical?
and then, second one for ernst, looking at margins, since the pace of recovery, it varies by segment and revenue mix, likely different during the recovery. how should we think about the shape of ebitda of the company relative to revenue? and then, looking out longer term, do you think margins can look different compared to pre covid-19 levels given the introduction of newer products like b2c and b2b and maybe the revenue mix looking different?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thanks dae. i'll take the first one. we have -- jeez, the last count was north of 300,000 different products selling in our experience base. no one individual product was so important or so compelling and if you think about the types of experiences offered, there is usually multiple choices. so we have a number of people that provide amazing private tours of pompeii for instance. that's great.
unfortunately, we would predict that some of our current suppliers aren't going to make it through the pandemic, but it seems to us unlikely that all of the suppliers in a particular category will go out, such that we won't be able to provide the choice that our travelers are looking for. so, at the end of the day, it would be -- we feel the pain. it's terrible if any of our experienced suppliers go out of business. we don't think many of the big or established ones will, from the conversations we've had.
but i'd be surprised if that had a material impact on our business, simply because we have so much supply already on the platform and there is so often multiple choices for any individual activity on our site, such that if one is no longer able to participate there is -- there is a backup player. so i think we're fine in terms of the supply and addressing the demand that our travelers already have on the site.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
on the point of margin recovery dae, i think the most impactful issue here is, is that we've taken out a substantial amount of our fixed and discretionary cost this year, which we don't plan on bringing back as the revenue recovers. we're only bringing back in a small way. and we've quantified, it's going to be $200 million-plus of costs -- fixed and discretionary costs that we've taken out year-over-year by the end of the year, and so that is significant.
so as revenue comes back, we will have a leaner cost structure to support that. so that alone -- if revenue comes back to the same level it was in 2019, is going to give us better overall margin in the future. and then within sort of segments and other pieces, i think generally variable cost anything between sort of revenue and contribution margin is not really going to change that much.
we don't expect longer-term our take rates to be impacted in any meaningful way. so you have to think about contribution margins at some point getting to the same level, but with a lower fixed cost base and that lowering of fixed cost has happened across all segments. it's not particular to any -- to any segment, so it should be benefiting all segments.
really longer term, of course, we have seen that we have had enjoyed high margins in hotels media & platform. we target to continue to have very high margins there. but then experiences & dining, we've always run sort of around breakeven and we continue to invest in that -- in that business. but if you look out for the longer term, the years ahead, we would expect that business to become more profitable too.
so if you look longer or look longer out, more profit contribution, we expect, to come from experiences & dining as a most important mix shift. but as i said, nearer term next year or so, the most impactful thing that we've done is taking out a whole lot of fixed costs.
dae lee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great, thanks for the color, both.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kevin kopelman with cowen and company. your line is open.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
great, thanks a lot. most of my questions have been asked, but i did have one follow-up. could you give any color on your efforts in kind of vacation rental and alternatives and just a little bit more color on how are you seeing the growth in demand for that category play out on tripadvisor? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. thanks, kevin. so we did -- rentals and restaurants are the two categories that have been bouncing back the fastest as people were certainly worried the most about social distancing. think a month ago, rentals was the clear go-to. that -- from our perspective that's very much pandemic related.
we're stronger in a traditional rental setting as in a stand-alone home in more rural or a beach type environment. so again, pretty predictable given covid but not necessarily a harbinger of long-term change in terms of consumer behavior.
so as i mentioned before, we're mostly interested in expanding our supply through partnership not through direct outreach to address the traveler demand that we have on our site. do a better job integrating -- you know this is next year not immediate, integrating alternative lodging into more of our overall lodging sort.
but we're not particularly taking a pandemic view on it. we're taking a -- this is -- it's been recognized as here to stay a great alternative to a traditional hotel for many years and it's just part of our overall strategy of addressing or helping travelers find the type of lodging that best suits their need for that trip that matters and we recognize the broad category of alternative lodging absolutely plays an important part in that, and we'll be there to help our travelers.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks steve.
operator
thank you. and our last question comes from james lee with mizuho securities. your line is open.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my question. and steve, i was wondering, can you comment about trip.com ceo joining your board and maybe help us understand what are the implications here, what can trip.com bring to the table and what can you learn from the company there? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, james. thank you for the question. we're thrilled to have a couple of new board members join us this year. greg from certares and jane from trip.com group. if you know them, you know they both bring a wealth of travel industry knowledge from an operational -- from a strategic and an operational perspective in very different aspects of the space.
certares, in greg's personal experience, is on the business travel and travel agency side with his holdings. obviously he knows the overall industry extremely well. and jane operating a top global ota with interesting global ambitions with their trip.com as well as their secret points of sale.
so i couldn't be happier having these two on our board, kind of in our camps going forward. and on your question on jane in particular, we've teamed up in our joint venture in china, so the trip.com group can use our brand and tripadvisor.cn to really augment the leadership position that ctrip already has in the market focused mostly on outbound travel where tripadvisor's content footprint is extremely strong.
and so, taking this content, helping other trip.com group properties and the trip.com group operational excellence, inventory, pricing capabilities, bringing that on to the -- or pieces of that on to the tripadvisor.cn point of sale. that's why we did the jv and that's why we think it's a great opportunity offering us upside exposure to the china outbound market, which we had been missing as part of our story.
and then, again, as industry experts being on our board helping to guide us. i love having them on our board. so truly one of those kind of win-win with wonderful opportunities appearing on a regular basis.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
alright, great. thank you.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer

operator
thank you. and there are no other questions in the queue, i'd like to turn it back to mr steve kaufer for closing remarks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
terrific. so thank you everyone for joining the call. and i just want to reiterate my thanks to all tripadvisor employees all around the globe. you guys are doing an amazing job. i'm really proud of how you've come together in this virtual environment but still were pursuing our strategic objectives or supporting all of our stakeholders in these -- in these challenging times.
to our investors, i want to reassure you that we're working hard not only to recover from this crisis, this moment in time, but really to emerge stronger than before. as i outlined in some of my comments earlier, how does tripadvisor look different than when we went into -- how does it look different than the pre-covid -- the tripadvisor of pre-covid times.
we always take this approach of maximizing our long-term shareholder value. we'll get through this. time and time again travel has rebounded and travelers have come back. we will continue executing our strategy and ensure tripadvisor plays an influential role with consumers and partners worldwide in this recovery and beyond. thanks, everyone and stay safe, please.

2020-Q4,TRIP,2021-02-19 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to tripadvisor's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to turn the conference call over to tripadvisor's vice president of investor relations, mr. will lyons. please go ahead.
will lyons -- vice president-investor relations
thanks, liz. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. joining me today is our ceo, steve kaufer and our cfo, ernst teunissen.
last night, after market close, we distributed and filed our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings release and made available our shareholder letter on our investor relations website. in the release, you will find reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures discussed on this call. on our ir site, you will find supplemental financial information, which includes reconciliations of certain non-gaap financial measures discussed on this call as well as other metrics. also, i'll note that comments regarding costs and cost saving levels referenced on this call do not consider depreciation, amortization, restructuring and other related reorganization costs or stock-based compensation.
before we begin, i would like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's views as of today, february 19, 2020 -- 2021. tripadvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. please refer to our earnings release as well as our filings with the sec for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
and with that, i'll pass the call to steve.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, will, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a challenging year and fundamentally optimistic. inflection curves have been, vaccines are being distributed. and from what we see on our site and hear in our research, travelers are all eager to get back out and explore the world. as we've described in our shareholder letter, we made a bunch of tough decisions last year. we also showed up our liquidity thought to work helping customers make the best of the current situation with initiatives like travel safe. and most importantly from my perspective, we prepared tripadvisor to emerge as a stronger, more focused company when travel comes back. and i'm really proud of what we accomplished.
we soft launched our new tripadvisor plus product in record time. we're focused on making the core experience of tripadvisor more engaging and personal for all travelers. and we've got some great teams in place growing our exciting restaurants and attraction businesses. we entered 2021 excited about the important role that tripadvisor can play in the recovery. it is based upon our historical reputation as a trusted guidance platform, but also because for new initiatives that are ready to help travelers take amazing trips.
let me also take a minute to thank everyone at trip for their commitment during this past year. know that your hard work is what has positioned our company to help hundreds of millions of travelers get back out on that road again. and all of that makes 2021 look like a pretty exciting year for us.
ernst, let me turn it over to you for additional thoughts.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve, and good morning, everyone. our fourth quarter mirrored most of the financial themes of our previous 2020 earnings calls that we've done. lessen our control, of course, has been how covid has continue to impact revenue with all of our business lines very much impacted again in q4, but uneven stories by geography and type of business. for instance, our restaurants revenue performed very strongly in q3 as most of the european restaurants were open and then took a step back again in q4 with most of europe locking down. and restaurants might be among the first revenue lines to actually benefit again when europe reopens again.
consistent financial themes that have been more in our control are driving significant cost savings, ensuring a solid liquidity position and laying the groundwork for compelling and profitable growth when the pandemic finally subsides. on the cost savings side, we more than achieved our target of $200 million of fixed and discretionary savings in 2020 versus 2019. and we entered 2021 a more efficient and leaner company. of course, the reduction in variable cost mostly performance-based marketing was actually significantly larger even than $200 million, but most of that expense will return. but the $200 million of savings we have achieved, we're very proud to have achieved. and we think the majority of that we will be able to keep as savings going forward.
i want to point out one thing in our q4 financial results is that the majority of the sequential expense increase in q4 versus q3 was due to an increase in our full year compensation expense. as such, $12 million of that q4 expense is not indicative of the underlying quarterly run rate that we take with us into 2021. while we anticipate prudently increasing investments as the pandemic eases and revenue and demand comes back, as i said, we expect that the majority of these 2020 fixed cost savings will persist in 2021 and beyond. and our fundamentally leaner cost structure positions us for operating leverage, better margins as revenue returns.
we've also strengthened our liquidity position again in q4. we renegotiated our credit facility to extend maturity to may 2024 and to extend our leverage covenant holiday for part of the facility, and both of these have provided us with increased financial flexibility. with over $400 million of cash at the end of december as well as $500 million of additional available borrowing capacity under our credit facility, we believe we are very well capitalized. we have been throughout this pandemic and are right now focused on driving customer value across our diverse revenue lines. and we're getting ready to catch the wave when travel inevitably bounces back.
so in summary, despite uneven travel recovery trends in q4 2020 and in early 2021, the current backdrop makes us increasingly optimistic that travel could come roaring back as early as the second half of the year. more importantly, we have positioned the company well in terms of future growth potential and margins.
with that, we will open it up for your questions.

lloyd walmsley -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks, guys. a couple if i can. first, steve, could you give us a sense for where you are in terms of establishing key relationships with your otas, hotels, other kind of companies to directly buildup supply of kind of discounts and perks for tripadvisor plus? and what is the roadmap for adding new benefits for subscribers of tripadvisor plus?
and then second one would just be, can you give us a sense of how the unit economics work? how you're kind of providing the discounts? who is funding those? and what the puts and takes are for you guys, for hotel supplier or at ota for participating in that? thanks.

certainly. thanks, lloyd. excellent questions. so when we talk about tripadvisor plus it really comes to the proverbial win-win-win. for the travelers, they're getting these amazing discounts, the perks. it's something that's turning their trip into fabulous. when it comes to tripadvisor, we're making some money on the actual subscription in building up what we hope to be a wonderful recurring revenue stream.
for your hotelier, and that's really where your question started, we've changed -- we are changing the model, whereby folks like tripadvisor would ordinarily take a commission on the hotel sale and we're going direct to the hotel and say, instead of paying us, let's offer that discount directly to the consumer. so if you might have been paying x percentage to your other distribution channel, let's instead offer that same percentage, but as a discount. tripadvisor passes it directly along to the plus subscriber where subscriber get the deal.
now when you add the value of the perk and you add the value of the discount, it becomes something pretty compelling for the consumer, back to that original win, and something that's well within the availability of the hotelier to offer that package at the same or better travel distribution cost as they go through for other channels. and so the win for the hoteliers, they get access to this club on tripadvisor. they get preferred placement on the tripadvisor site, so more visibility for their property. they get a guest that's perhaps higher end, perhaps likely to stay longer at a distribution cost that's the same as lower -- the same or lower as many of their other channels.
the unit cost, if you will, for plus, from tripadvisor's perspective, we have practically speaking no cost of goods on us delivering on the service. we have some level of customer support, that's fine. but we make our revenue on the trends -- on the subscription fee for tripadvisor plus. and then the next time somebody comes back to tripadvisor because they are a member, they might be booking in the traction, will make a decent margin on there even after passing the discount back to the consumer. travelers will also come back to tripadvisor to plan other parts of their trip. and again, making us a preferred place for those subscribers to start their travel planning, all of which building into our repeat story.
to answer your other question on roadmap for new benefits for subscribers, we expect to be launching -- when we'll launch more fully throughout the u.s., we'll be adding some additional benefits that we'll announce at that time. and we can see a very straightforward plan over the course of this year and next to add additional benefits that helps make people, that helps make traveler, term travelers into savvy travelers.
so again, you start with hotels and experiences because those are the things you book on our site today are quite valuable, the amount of savings, you can differentiate on the perks, but we're also going well beyond that in the travel category. our goal is nothing less than building an affordable travel subscription product that pretty much everyone would love to be a part of travelers because it turns them into better travelers no matter where they're going. and i don't want to repeat myself, but we think it's going to be a great offering.

your next question comes from richard clarke with bernstein.
richard clarke -- bernstein -- analyst
good morning. thanks very much for taking my questions. just a question to start with on your guidance into q1 about revenues flat to [technical issue] compared to pre-pandemic that would make [technical issue] and more than q4. so maybe if you could break that down between different geographies, different components. what are you seeing -- what's getting worse, better? and then second, follow-up question around your additional [technical issue] what is the nature of that? is that just sort of bringing up the bonus pool for the full year? where did that one-off cost come from?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
richard, i'll take those questions. thank you for those questions. firstly, about the first quarter, yeah, there are a number of things that go into q4 and q1, different revenue streams. europe is obviously a big impact on our business today, the lockdowns in europe. and that has impacted our european business broadly, our fork business. the restaurant business, of course, is very skewed to europe, so that's making impact. and the lockdown progressed throughout q4 in europe and we expect to take that into the first quarter. and that's where the -- what's the bases for what we've provided as guidance for q1.
having said that, we also pointed out that february is a marked uptick in the quarter. and so we have seen at least some improving fundamentals in the business coming up again. and that bodes well for hopefully the rest of the quarter and for the first half more broadly. but this is the -- the lockdown in europe, in particular, is behind the cautious outlook for the first quarter.
the second question, the $12 million of additional cost in q4 that we said is really should be taken out of the run rate, if you do your analysis. yes, that was an additional expense in compensation. that was indeed based on bonuses. we accrued throughout the year a low bonus percentage. and at the end of the year, we decided with our board to up that. it's still well below 100% for the year, but higher than we originally accrued for. and so as we've pointed out, although that all hits our q4 p&l, really you should take out $12 million of that if you want to take a run rate for the quarter and start to project that into the following year.
richard clarke -- bernstein -- analyst
that's very clear. thanks very much.

your next question comes from naved khan with truist securities.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
hi. thanks a lot. maybe a quick follow-up on trip plus, and maybe i'll start with a clarification. so if a participating hotel that's giving perks to the members is booked through an ota, would the travelers still receive the perks or is it only on direct bookings? and then can you just maybe give us a sense of the size of the beta, what percentage of the traffic that's eligible as getting exposed to this and how should we expect that to grow as the year progresses?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
certainly. thanks, naved. steve, i'll take that. so to your first question, no, all of the perks and discounts are available to travelers when they subscribe to tripadvisor plus first. and then, of course, they -- not of course, i suppose, but then they do have to complete the booking on tripadvisor. we have a very solid booking flow, we will store your credit cards, we'll make it easy. and we're building that repeat behavior where you come in what we call that no-brainer moment where this hotel for your five nights stay, it has a $250 discount, which is close to our average at this point. you then take a $99 subscription fee, you're still -- travelers still saving meaningful dollars right now and they book through the tripadvisor booking flow.
traveler comes back, they get a similar discount the next trip they're going to take perhaps, and of course they have already paid that fee. so it's all drop into savings whether that traveler then chooses to spend that savings on amazing new experiences that they found on our site or anything else that they're looking for, that's up to them.
to the question of beta rollout, yes, we're still in pretty early days. we're excited by the fact that it's out. we're testing. we're learning. it's [indecipherable] kind of u.s. audience only at this point. and we've shared that we will be rolling it out to the rest of our u.s. traffic in the first half of the year. and then we go beyond in other english markets at some point after that.
we are very excited about the opportunity that trip represents. i talked about having a 160 million times when we looked at our 2019 numbers where travelers were expressing enough interest in looking at a specific property such that they were using our meta auctioning clicking off to an ota or supplier direct. that's a 160 million times we think of it as shots on goal. 160 million opportunities for tripadvisor with tripadvisor plus to say, hey, on a lot of these properties, we have an amazing discount and a perk that's going to make you, the customer, a savvy traveler. it's part of the tripadvisor plus subscription, please come subscribe, make your money back or close to it in the very first purchase and get the benefits for an entire year. that savings can go into making a better trip, that savings can go into your bank. and the audiences, folks who are not only taking this one trip, but are likely to come back to tripadvisor over and over again over the course of the year. so it doesn't take a high conversion percentage for when your denominator is 160 million opportunities to be able to find the set of audience that's quite excited about this product.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. a quick follow-up, if i may. as you kind of plan for a recovery that it takes hold as the year goes on, any plans of increasing your ad spending as we -- sort of ahead of that as you have the bookings that happened in advance and things like that? how should we be thinking about your ad spend?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
so i would say we have so much traffic on our site today that we don't feel a need to reach out to market space on not known or paid channels. of course, our paid marketing, our regular performance marketing will grow as traffic returns. it's really just a function of our kind of standard operating procedure. when it relates to plus specifically, again, i talked about that 100 plus million number of people who are already potentially plus clients, and we don't need to reach outside of tripadvisor to talk to those folks.
ernst, do you want to add anything?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
no, i think that's correct, steve. outside of the business, as we've said before, is the marketing expenses mostly going to be variable with revenue.
naved khan -- truist securities -- analyst
understood. thank you, both.

your next question comes from tom white with da davidson.
tom white -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. two if i may. thanks for the color on trip plus there, steve. it sounds like the platform is kind of heading down the road of becoming more kind of transactional i guess. i might be just curious to kind of hear your thoughts on maybe how your initial push into making tripadvisor more of a transactional site with back from the instant booking days. maybe kind of what the big learnings from that were and how that's going to inform the rollout here? and then maybe also, just an update on where you guys stand in terms of leveraging customer data, some of you guys have talked about prior calls. just would love to get an update on how those initiatives are coming?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. thanks, tom. excellent question. learnings from instant book and past transaction on tripadvisor, i would say instant book taught us a lot about how to be an effective transaction platform. we did a ton of bookings when instant book was rolled out throughout the site. we did it on a global scale. we had a lot of partners involved. and we succeeded in delivering a lot of bookings for a lot of customers. where it didn't work as well as we had hoped with instant book was simply we did not offer a compelling additional value proposition to the user as to why they should book on tripadvisor versus their other choices out in the marketplace.
and so when we take it forward and look at tripadvisor plus, it looks like instant book a little bit because the transactions on tripadvisor, but the whole message is completely different. here we're talking about a subscription service to make you a savvy, to make that traveler a savvy traveler, getting compelling, immediate, instant value for going down the transaction path with us, subscribing to tripadvisor plus and getting that immediate savings or that immediate room upgrade, that immediate set of benefits that compel someone to say, [indecipherable] a straightforward choice.
tripadvisor plus may not have the frequency of something like an amazon prime, but we do have that immediate logical benefit of we're going to help you have a better trip right now. you'll save $200, you can take the private tour instead of the group tour, fairly straightforward. we're adding, as i mentioned before, more of the non-transactional components to turn you into a smarter traveler when you're actually in destination, to help you when things go wrong. and again, we'll be adding more of that over the year.
so the learnings from instant book, we know how to do. we know how to work in a transaction environment in hotels because we've done it before. that's great. clearly, one of the reasons we were able to launch the product in such a short time period. and i don't want to -- i want to make sure to mention that we are also adapted being a transaction site as we've been selling experiences on tripadvisor for many, many years now. so again, people may think of tripadvisor or some people may think of tripadvisor as a review site, but we've been selling travel for quite some time.
to the second question on more of that we're doing in customer with our customer data. it certainly plays an important role internally as we launch trip and have offers going out to existing members, existing contributors, folks who already have a relationship with tripadvisor that we can identify. and then as we've shared in prior calls, our targeting capabilities in our media business is getting better and better. so we're just able to more effectively create campaigns that serve our advertisers in a better way with the additional capabilities that we've been building in the system, some of which have launched, other pieces of which are still in development.
tom white -- d.a. davidson -- analyst

your next question comes from mario lu with barclays.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. i have another one on plus and one on alternative accommodations. so the one on plus, just wanted to take a step back and talk more broadly about the genesis of the product. i just wanted to hear your thoughts on why you think tripadvisor is uniquely positioned to succeed with the subscription product versus say the traditional otas? and then secondly on alternative accommodations, they are continuing to gain share versus hotels within your travel industry. so just curious to see if anything has changed in terms of your strategy in this category to either ramp up supply or add more partnerships to show more listings in this category? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. thank you, mario. two excellent questions. so on the plus side, that was your first question, we've studied the behavior of travelers on tripadvisor for so many years now. and obviously, people are coming, they're looking, they're getting great guidance. and then our monetization model was advertising on the site and then getting those travelers to leave us and book on supplier or ota sites. that worked. built $1.6 billion. all good. but we've is known that there was this notion of a leaky bucket. we're sending folks, the travelers away to book elsewhere. and many of them do take the trip, but they don't book right away and we lose credit for that.
there's also the notion while our meta engine finds a good price for people, it doesn't by definition find a better price or offer better traveler experience than what is out there, than what that user could find themselves. we help them find it easier, but it's not unique, it's not exclusive. and obviously, there's many other meta players. so we sat and we thought, what do travelers want? they want to have a better experience. they want their dollars to grow further. what do we have? we have a ton of travelers on our site taking all types of trips. so if we start with that consumer value proposition, how could we provide real discounts, amazing perks in a way that the customer isn't able to find that value proposition through their other channels, through the traditional places that they book or through other meta sites.
and we came up with this notion of well, if we put it behind a subscription wall, there is an established model of being able to offer discounts and perks to folks that are behind industry problems, behind this pay gate and could that be a model that works? so we asked first, hey, would the customer be interested in this and with our service and with discounts and perks? the answer was clearly yes. then how could we market this product to an audience? would we be able to find -- would people on tripadvisor be interested in this product? and as i shared, a 160 million times in 2019 that people were building or interested in expensive trip, interesting enough to be clicking off of our site in our meta option, and we picked $750 because you take a 15% discount on us, $750 purchase, you're equating it to that membership price of $99.
so can we find the audience to be able to educate about this product? the answer is clearly yes, because they are already on our site. and then we asked, will hoteliers give us these discounts and perks? and as i explained in the earlier question, like, yes, because it still has the opportunity to be a lower cost of distribution for the hotelier than the other channels that they use. so again, by getting the extra visibility on tripadvisor at a distribution cost equal or better than what they're otherwise paying, that seems very straightforward from a hotelier perspective. and we've been finding up hotels in addition to our aggregators, been signing up direct hotels that say, it sounds great. let me give it whirl. and we continue to do that with our direct sales force.
and then, will travelers be willing to transact on tripadvisor? as i shared in the earlier question with instant book, clearly people were willing to do so when we said we have ton of experiences on tripadvisor. so that's really not a -- do we need permission from our travelers? tripadvisor is already a trusted site and they've already proven that they will go down that transaction flow.
and again, it's -- we have this as an additional product on top of our auction. the auction is not going away. and if you don't find the ideal property in our set of plus opportunities, there is a beautiful meta option. you're already on our site and you click off and you get the exact properties that you're looking for. so tripadvisor, we serve for -- in pre-covid days, we were north of 400 million you use a month, you could think of it as we serve a billion travelers a year. and if -- i have to say this carefully, but if it's only 10 million that sign up for tripadvisor plus, that's still less than 1% of our annual traffic, but 10 million sign ups times $100, then obviously the math looks pretty nicely in a recurring subscription revenue.
so i don't want to get ahead of ourselves. this is not going to happen overnight. we have a lot of suppliers we want to go sign up. but it is a huge market. we have our own tripadvisor channel to reach users when they are shopping. we're trusted as a brand. and post-covid, we think the regular traveler is ready to embrace a subscription product. subscription products in general have -- they've been doing quite well. and it's not us, but others, many others have been educating consumers on the notion of signing up for something on an annual basis.
so versus the otas or supplier directs, they're going to win, we're going to win. it's not a one or the other by any stretch. as i said, your auction will continue to be quite healthy. but our ability to hand the commission that the hotel is ready to pay their distribution channel back to the customer i think enables us to offer discounts in a way that is very hard to match from other more traditional channels.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. excellent, thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
your second question, shorter answer to the second question, alternative accommodations, absolutely we see alternative accommodations continue to grow. we had a pretty good last summer on our site for our rental inventory. it's just a smaller piece of our overall pie. and so we do look to grow choice. we do look at some point to be able to integrating the rental experience into tripadvisor plus because those travelers are also planning rental stays. we don't have anything kind of new to report at the moment, but please understand we are keenly aware of consumers' interest in this type of inventory. and the fact that we have a hotel auction that gets inventory from lots of different places, obviously, we have a rental -- it's not really an auction, but we have the rental display that also gets inventory from multiple sources, and we do look to expand that over time.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thank you.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
i would add to that is underlying what steve is saying here about the fact that we have a broad platform, including rentals. but i also want to point out that the -- in this pandemic, the rental business has benefited because of the travel trends that were specific to the pandemic, of course. so people making more local trips, not traveling by car and offline. and so although it's been an important development this year, there will be some degree of reversion to the mean when the pandemic has gone and people start to feel comfortable flying again, feel comfortable staying in hotels. so i wouldn't -- i would caution to overestimating the trend for the long-term.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thank you, both.
operator
your next question comes from jed kelly with oppenheimer.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
hey, great. thanks for taking my question. one on plus and then just one on current trends. so just on tripadvisor plus, steve, ernst, how are you thinking about having enough supply or what execution do you need to do to prevent like a natural churn issue? and then like will you actually -- like when you're about to book a hotel, that's when like the plus option might come up, if you pay $99, you can save on plus? and then just real quick on current half trends. as we've seen cases have a decent decline here in the u.s., i mean have you seen an improvement over the last couple of weeks in traveler interest?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
great. thanks, jed. perhaps, i'll take the first one and turn to ernst for the recent trends. your question is, how we're thinking about supply voting [phonetic] in natural churn. was the natural churn on -- were you thinking on the hotel side or on the customer side?
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst
customer side, right? like -- all right. yeah.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
so -- yeah, we're using -- to answer the supply side first, we're using kind of traditional discount aggregators to bring up 100,000 plus properties online quickly offering discounts, other perk aggregators where they've already negotiated with the hotel to get a wonderful set of perks and make these properties really kind of standout from the rest, and that's been our launch.
we have been signing individual hotels with our direct sales force. fortunately for us, though we have, call it, 1 million plus pieces of launching on our site, there is a popular head to that, if you will, when you look at where people are planning expensive trips. that list narrows down quite a bit. and we're using our direct sales force to call into those properties, tell them about plus, share the easy decision that we think it is for them to give it a try. we don't look for long-term contracts. we don't look for guaranteed. every room is discounted. they can tune the channel to meet their needs of being able to get more reservations.
so when we think about the question on churn, when you -- if you're in the beta mix, you'll see that there are lots of hotels that are available for plus. it's not a majority or anything like that, but in most cities you'll find several choices. we look to expand that tremendously, of course, with more partners and more direct sales. there is no challenging availability right now. so plenty of opportunity to meet the consumer demand.
when we think about churn, we think yes. when -- purchase and then churn. we think the traveler looking at a city and going to -- i'm going to miami, i'm looking at hotels. this is a plus property because i see it's being merchandise with a discount and a perk. i'd log in to see what the actual discount is. and i can't transact on that discount unless i buy the trip subscription along the way. of course, at any point i can click off to a traditional ota and pay that rate, but the tripadvisor plus rate is better. the discount we're offering, that's the reason the hotel got to be at the top of our shortlist.
so it's a compelling inflow opportunity for us to market tripadvisor plus. and then assuming the customer buys, they are good for a whole year. and so they come back and they see a lot more opportunities to save money with any hotel purchase that they're making based upon the discounts and the perks that we have, they get their 10% off tractions and the rest of the benefits.
even though i keep talking about how most plus subscriptions are paying for themselves in the very first purchase, we fully expect the people that are buying plus to take multiple trips over the course of the year. and every time they are taking that additional trip, it's a pure savings moment for them. perhaps at the end of the year, we remind them, hey, it looks like you booked 6 hotels with us, here's the grand total. you saved $872. time for the $99 renewal, trying to make that very much a no-brainer moment when it comes to renewing tripadvisor plus for next year.
so obviously it's a subscription business, there will always be some level of churn, but the target audience here is taking more than one trip a year. they're already saving the cost of the subscription in general in that first purchase. so it doesn't take much to ask that traveler, do you think you're going to take at least one more trip over the coming year? answer is yes. they've had a great experience the first year of where we go.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and jed, to your second question, yeah, we did see january sort of starts softly, but february improved, seen revenue tick up more than we usually see from january to february. so that's positive. we've seen a market increase of the searches for 90 days plus out versus what we had seen in the three months before. so that was something that gives some positivity there. and so we -- february definitely starting off so far better than we expected or than we have seen in january, but it's very mixed across the businesses, as you can imagine.
the u.s. has been actually doing reasonably well. we called out in january, we had in our hotel auction, north america was roughly 50% of the year before where europe was just much, much lower. and so we've seen the difference play out between the u.s. with relatively few travel restrictions in place versus europe. we just see that in our numbers. and so we're looking forward to travel restrictions. hopefully, the rollout of the vaccine and hopefully with the subsiding number of cases that we are seeing right now also to start to apply in europe over time and see some of these trends improve both in north america and in europe.
jed kelly -- oppenheimer -- analyst

your next question comes from eric sheridan with ubs.
eric sheridan -- ubs -- analyst
thanks so much for taking the question. i won't ask anymore plus, i think we've talked about that. but generally pivoting back to sort of the scope and your working view on the recovery. anything you can give us about how you think where you sit in the broader marketing funnel will play out as demand starts to pick up again and whether you'll be a leading or lagging indicator or how conversations continue emerge with your advertisers in terms of how they might utilize the platform on the other side of covid versus the world we're in 2019 and earlier?
and then going to the local and experiences side, do you think you need to do a lot there on either growing the inventory scale or letting your travelers and consumers know that you have those offerings out in the marketplace or do you think it's just a function of end demand opening that up to see recovery in those businesses coming out over the next couple of years? thanks guys.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
great. thanks, eric. two excellent questions in there. so scope of the recovery -- a very good question, a very tough question to answer. we certainly have seen traffic on tripadvisor. people are planning or thinking about trip not go down nearly as much as travel actually went down. so in that sense, we're a leading indicator that people still want to travel, they're still searching, they're still coming back. our uu dropped, unique user dropped, again, lot less than our revenue dropped because they're not yet booking, but they're -- think of it -- they're dreaming.
so as we predict, as we hope in the second quarter as people certainly in the u.s. may have their vaccination dates scheduled, they would get more excited about planning that trip knowing that they will be vaccinated on x and y date. so i think it would be a good kind of leading indicator from a marketing perspective. and businesses that want to get in front of those customers when they are thinking about that similar trip, i would argue, would do wise to leverage the eyeballs that are on our platform today in the planning moments.
ernst, do you want to add something to that?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yeah. i would add, maybe if you look at our business line by business line, what we've seen last year is that restaurants actually has just as much more quickly than the rest of the business to improvement. so in q3, when restaurants were opened in europe, our business was straight back to the 2019 levels and in some countries actually above. so i expect that line of business to do better.
experiences has been lagging and is likely to lag in the recovery. and then if you look at for instance at our hotel auction, because of our revenue recognition being different than an ota model, we may see revenue earlier than otas may see revenue. we recognize revenue on the actual click and otas recognize revenue broadly on stay. so that may be an early indicator for us or a leader rather than a laggard in our business.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
and then on the...
eric sheridan -- ubs -- analyst
thanks so much.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
experiences, the question is, the supplier awareness or just to demand. at the moment, it's certainly just a demand question -- people taking those leisure trips, looking to do that exciting activity. but when those leisure trips do rebound, we feel for our core audience in western europe, in the u.s. we think we have most of the supply that we needed. they are constantly adding more, but we don't think of it as a supply throttled. we're looking to build up the demand and build up the sort of inspirational quality of what we are presenting as things to do in these tourist destinations because between why tour and tripadvisor, we certainly have -- we feel we have enough eyeballs. we have enough travelers taking the types of trips for the booking experiences. but we did help them make that commitment to book it online as opposed to wait and book it in destination.
it's a different answer if you reach all the way out to asia in terms of the supply question. but for our core markets, i think it's mostly traveler getting back to taking the trips that including experiences, i.e., nobody in the u.s. is headed to the vatican right now to get the amazing tours of the museums there. when that comes back, we will be more than ready to go.
eric sheridan -- ubs -- analyst

your next question comes from kevin kopelman with cowen.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thanks a lot. just a quick follow-up. could you talk a little bit more about the initial learnings from the beta test on plus? and what kind of conversion rates -- initial conversion rates you're seeing and what's the realistic goal over time? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. so that of course is why we do a beta. we look to learn. and it's out to a decent portion of our u.s. traffic so that we're getting daily subscriptions, we're watching where we are in the funnel. it's too early to really talk about the conversion rates of where we're at. and we don't honestly know what the right target is. we certainly would hope that the discount and the perk would generate a pretty compelling reason to go into the funnel. hey, i can save $300 here, that's pretty exciting. and then, again, we have the content from the hotels. we're making the transaction fairly straightforward. we're happy to store your credit cards. this will make it easy to come back. and then knocking down all the reasons why people will either get stuck or there is extra friction in the flow. but the core value proposition, i get early check-in, a late check-out. i get food plate in the room. i'm saving $200. this sounds like a really simple reason to book on tripadvisor, to subscribe to tripadvisor plus. and that's sort of, if you will, replacing a user who is going to click off to the hotel side or an ota for just that particular trip. and we feel like it's a better value for the traveler to book that tripadvisor plus offering. it makes economic sense for us and the hotel is happy because it's a less expensive distribution channel.
so again, win-win-win all around. and we'll be out of beta relatively soon as we look to expand the opportunity to both learn faster and just help more people start to realize the benefits of trip plus in advance of the peak summer travel season.
kevin kopelman -- cowen and company -- analyst
excellent. and as you think about the 160 million shots on goal, can you give us a sense of how much is that of your kind of overall hotel traffic or hotel ad revenue, just to give us a sense on that?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
i don't offhand know, but in a sense, you could take all of our auction revenue, take a guess at our cpc and do some backwards math in terms of how many total clicks over the course of the year we might be generating. of course, most of our travelers that are on our site for all the sets of reasons are looking for what i call the ordinary trip. it's staying a couple of nights here. it's a -- felicia has business trip. it's visiting grandma. there's lots of different reasons why people will be taking a trip.
and the tripadvisor plus offering is really -- it can be effective for those small trips, if you want to upgrade, but then there's that kind of $99 cost. we're clearly targeting, at least initially, on the bigger trips, the longer stays. and that's why we shared this 160 million number to help folks give -- give you all the confidence that we have that says we have a lot of travelers on the site already claiming trips of this scale. and so obviously we would look for it to be incremental revenue to us and recurring revenue being fabulous part of the overall offering. hope that helps?

your next question comes from lee horowitz with evercore isi.
lee horowitz -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks for the question. two if i could. maybe sticking with plus, appreciating that this is not necessarily a product that can only win if your key is lose by extracting the hotel discount via the hoteliers' distribution costs, this would seem to put you in more direct competition with the ota suppliers. how are you thinking about this potential management of this tension point with important advertisers on your platform?
and then maybe one on experiences, and building on eric's question a little bit. thinking through experiences and the recovery, was the experiences industry likely acutely impacted by covid? do you expect that you'll need to spend more aggressively on sales and marketing during the recovery to bring on more experiences supply to offset, what i would imagine, would be a lot of experiences, suppliers who have gone out of business during the crisis? and in your experience, what is the lead time between investing in that sales and marketing channel, onboarding an experiences supplier and getting them up to a meaningful bookings on the platform? thanks for the time.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. i'll take the plus question, and thanks, lee. again, two good questions there. it's fair at the highest level to think, hey, well, if somebody is booking on tripadvisor, that ends up kind of being a supplier direct booking, then that's a booking that the ota wouldn't get. technically true, but the volume of these bookings compared to the volume that our big client otas would see, it's a little hard to believe that it's even noticeable. unlike instant book, which did have ota participation, tripadvisor plus is not for the vast majority of our audience, whereas the instant book plan, it was for the vast majority of the audience. instant book we were looking at one night hotel stays, convenient booking on the phone.
so in a sense that was a potentially more competitive move, again, part wise it took a little while for the otas to join on, but as we evaluate client reaction from otas with this, they just put it in a different ballpark. this is a very gated product and discounts behind pay gates are extremely well established in the travel industry. and what could be a very big opportunity for tripadvisor still isn't necessarily more than a rounding error for the big online travel agency. so we don't see that being an issue at all, frankly.
to experiences question, ernst, do you want to add a comment on the supply side?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yeah. we don't see this as an investment, big investment push into supply different than we would normally have as the market recovers. we have a lot of supply, and overlapping supply in many markets. multiple providers have a certain service in many markets. and even if some of them will go out of business, we don't think that will be particularly harmful to our overall offering to the consumer.
moreover, there are a number of historically high revenue venues, like steve was mentioning, the vatican before or the sagrada familia in barcelona or the louvre, a special louvre tour in paris that are not likely to be not returning -- they are likely to return when the travel happens again. so we are not that concerned about that overall. we're thinking more about how do we catch the wave from a marketing perspective -- from a marketing to consumers' perspective when the market comes back more than what we need to do for our supply base.
lee horowitz -- evercore isi -- analyst
helpful. thank you, both.
operator
and our last question comes from james lee with mizuho.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. two here. steve, given you're focused on subscription, maybe can you talk about any changes to your view on the hotel meta search product over the longer term? should we think about the overall strategy from a consumer point of view as more of the segmentation strategy? for example, for high a asp traveler it goes to subscription and maybe for mass market we want to still focus on meta search?
and also secondly on trip plus again -- sorry about additional questions here. doing your testing here, just curious what your learning is on that specifically? do you think the demand that you're seeing for people signing up, is that incremental or do you think there's some sort of substitution effect coming from other travel subscriptions? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. thanks so much for the question, james. you can take a look at kind of what we're doing right now on with plus with respect to meta. in that, we're really trying to market plus where we think it's the -- we're making it the easiest possible decision for the traveler. so for instance, even where we might have a discount on a property, if that discount is only, call it, $25 and the subscription is $99, we're choosing not to push the consumer toward tripadvisor plus at that point because it's a little -- it may be what the consumer wants, but we don't want to push too hard where the value proposition isn't as compelling. where the consumer is going to save $150, sure, it makes a lot more sense for that consumer to buy tripadvisor plus than clicking off on some for meta auction.
so in our merchandising on the site, yes, we are segmenting our audience in terms of how hard we are pushing plus or how much we're choosing to market plus to those different segments. that's likely to change over time over years as plus becomes more well known, as people come to tripadvisor. hey, tripadvisor plus, how can i see more availability. as we otherwise segment travelers into very frequent travelers, well, maybe that traveler perfectly happy with the $40 savings because they're going to take five trips over the year and they know that and we know that. and so we have a marketing message that says, think of all your trips you're taking. it clearly pays for itself. to the degree that we also learn and can use the data we have in-house for folks who are less price sensitive and more interested in the upgraded experience, we have a different opportunity to push the perks as opposed to the discount to that audience.
we think our meta search is going to be around for a long, long, long, long time, and plus compliments that. and so when we think of perhaps a typical plus user found a great deal for this wonderful vacation, they're excited about the upgrade, the food plate, they take that trip. and now the next time they think about traveling, well, i'm going to start on tripadvisor because i'm looking for that similar thing. maybe not with the same amount of discount, but maybe the particular hotel they are interested in or whatever reason, location or reputation or referral doesn't have a plus offering at that moment in time.
well, great. they came to tripadvisor and their next step is to go click on a meta auction link, which also helps us monetize the consumer and get that traveler to the hotel that they want to book. and that hotel happens to be on expedia or booking.com or supplier direct. so we don't view it as particularly cannibalistic. we view plus as a wonderful engagement vehicle when we get to a meaningful enough number of subscribers.
and then final point, when i look at the rest of what the tripadvisor core team is working on, it is about building more engagement on our platform, getting more visitors to become members, members to become engaged members, and eventually, some of those engaged members will certainly become paid members, plus members. but all along that funnel, we're building more reasons to come back to tripadvisor. and one of the key ways we monetize that traffic is through that traditional hotel auction. the hotel auction is working beautifully. our clients continue to pay what we think of as fair prices for the traffic that we're sending them. there was kind of -- there's nothing wrong with the auction, except it was pressured at the top of the funnel. how much traffic starts looking for their hotel on tripadvisor into degrees that our visitor to member, member to engaged member programs are effective, we're able to get more traffic back to tripadvisor, which we know how to serve quite well.
second question on the testing learnings, there -- to the best of our knowledge, there aren't other travel subscription products we could be kind of pulling from. so we feel our current testing and the product rollout is pulling people that hadn't really thought of doing a travel subscription product, relatively new concept, and saying, hey, this is worth signing up for because i'm getting the benefits, i'm getting perks, i'm getting all this for a whole year.
it may be first of -- is first of a kind subscription product because of all the different categories we cover. but to the consumer, i don't think they're looking for a travel subscription product. i think they're looking to have a better trip. and by signing up for our subscription product, that's the way that they're going to achieve that objective. and they might take that savings from the hotel and apply it to spend an extra day on vacation. that's great with us. they enjoyed the benefits of the subscription immediately.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst

2021-Q1,TRIP,2021-05-07 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to tripadvisor's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to tripadvisor's vice president of investor relations, mr. will lyons. please go ahead.
will lyons -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, laurie. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. joining me today are tripadvisor's ceo, steve kaufer and our cfo, ernst teunissen.
last night, after market close, we distributed and filed our first quarter 2021 earnings release and made available our shareholder letter on our investor relations website. in the release, you will find reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures discussed on this call. on our ir site, you will find supplemental financial information, which includes reconciliations of certain non-gaap financial measures discussed on this call as well as other metrics.
i also note that comments we may make regarding cost saving levels referenced on this call do not consider depreciation, amortization, restructuring and other related organization costs or stock-based compensation.
before we begin, i'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's views as of today, may 7th, 2021. tripadvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. please refer to our earnings release as well as our filings with the sec for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to steve.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, will, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us today. as covered in our shareholder letter last night, i'm pleased to say that consumer demand and revenue performance as a percentage of 2019 levels improved sequentially on our platform in both february and march. this was led by the u.s. market where vaccination trends accelerated during the period. traffic to our u.s. hotel pages approached 80% of our 2019 levels in march.
two of our key offerings that lagged last year are our hotel metasearch auction and experiences are showing nice improvement so far this year, again due to increased u.s activity. europe lagged due to lockdowns but demand picked up in april and we're optimistic for broadened international recovery as vaccination rates improve. as with q1 trends in the u.s. and some other countries contrast greatly with challenges in many other parts of the world like in india.
and i just want to say that our thoughts are with all of our colleagues in india as well as their families and of course, everyone who is struggling so hard with this terrible situation. these contrasting trends that we are seeing support our overall view that the road to recovery is in fact uneven.
so travel is certainly not out of the woods, but we have a positive start to the year. we remain quite optimistic about the second half 2021, as the number of people vaccinated increases, countries reopen and the leisure traveler recovery broadens. people want to travel and we are certain that when they feel safe to do so, they will travel.
but the tripadvisor story is more than just the recovery. we have and will continue to position the business for future growth by leveraging our platform's breadth and our competitive strengths and executing on our strategic initiatives. pre-pandemic, we grew many offerings by double-digits, including our b2b business, display advertising, experiences and dining. we've been actively improving these products as well as our tech and our go-to-market strategies in order to deliver customers the best experience possible and drive diverse growth. add to that the innovation that we're bringing into travel in terms of our new subscription product tripadvisor plus.
as many of you know from our last quarterly remarks, we see a huge opportunity ahead and fully expect that plus is going to be a very exciting part of our future. we remain in beta in the u.s. today, but are pleased with our progress as we work to improve the product for consumers and work closely with partners to build out the offering.
converting even a small percentage of engaged tripadvisor traffic, not to mention the hundreds of millions of visitors per month that are searching on tripadvisor for hotels and experiences, implies a potential long-term growth opportunity of tens of millions of subscribers and a multibillion dollar recurring revenue stream.
i'll note that absolutely none of this is possible without the team, and i want to thank everyone at tripadvisor for their ongoing commitment to helping millions of consumers and partners get back to travel. we've grown accustomed to executing through tremendous unpredictability and i've been very proud of their continued resilience. i remain very optimistic about what's ahead.
and with that, ernst, let me turn it over to you for some additional thoughts.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve, and good morning, everyone. i first just want to echo some of steve's comments, uneven trends and uncertainty persists, but improvements have been encouraging. i remain pleased and impressed with our team's continued operational focus and how they rallied together to strengthen tripadvisor not for only a strong recovery, but for the long run.
q1 demand and revenue trends indeed reflected our commentary back in february with varied stories by geography and by offering. progress in the u.s., almost single-handedly drove sequential revenue improvements in our business in february, march and in april.
on the other hand, persistent lock-downs across europe and challenges throughout international markets as well as the absence of international travel remain significant drags on our results. the good news is that there is a lot of room for continued improvements in the periods to come in the u.s., but especially in europe and beyond as the number of people vaccinated increases, countries reopen, and the leisure travel recovery broadens.
i want to quickly highlight three financial themes that remain within our control; driving significant cost savings, ensuring a solid liquidity position, and laying the groundwork for compelling and profitable growth when the pandemic subsides.
firstly, regarding costs. we continue operating effectively and efficiently as a leaner company. operating expenses in q1 were 32% lower year-on-year. we expect the majority of the fixed cost savings that we generated in 2020 to persist, positioning us for operating leverage as the travel environment normalizes.
on the liquidity front, in q1, we completed an opportunistic convertible debt capital raise which further fortifies our balance sheet, with $674 million of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the last quarter, plus an undrawn credit facility for which covenant flexibility was achieved last year, as well as enhanced operating leverage as revenues comes back, we believe we are in a strong liquidity position.
and finally, throughout the pandemic, we have been focused on driving improvements across our platform. we expect that these efforts will pay dividends as faster growth and more efficiency across our various revenue lines as the market recovers.
so, in summary, much uncertainty remains, but green shoots have definitely started to emerge. we remain optimistic that leisure travel will come roaring back as early as the second half of the year, and are pleased with the ongoing work that will enhance our positioning well into the future.
with that, we will now open the call for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of lloyd walmsley [phonetic] of deutsche bank. your line is open.
lloyd walmsley -- deutsche bank -- analyst
all right, thanks. two questions if i can. first, just in the shareholder letter, you mentioned kind of credit card partnerships with tripadvisor plus. can you just help us understand, conceptually, how something like that might work? is that your credit card company paying some you know full freight, half freight, like how would that work in terms of paying for plus benefits for their members?
would it be, you know their cardholders would have to activate it, where they just pay kind of in blanket? how do those deals work and what kind of like bounties come with those, if you guys can sign up credit cards for them, if you can flesh that out a little bit?
and then, the second one just on the u.s. auctions. seems like it's clearly coming back at 80% of april levels or 80% of '19 levels in april. but that's a little bit behind, at least, some of the ota commentary on u.s. booking level. so wondering if you can help us kind of bridge the timing differences and how you guys think about the category of meta catching up relative to, i guess, ota bookings and revenue. thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. thanks, lloyd. this is steve. maybe i'll take the first question and ernst will take the second. there is a couple of different ways that we're looking to work with credit card companies. the first could be on the part of a more higher-end credit card that carries some interesting travel benefits already or may be a particular financial institution wants to break into that pretty lucrative category of travel.
and so the travel reward or one of the travel rewards with the credit card would be a subscription to tripadvisor plus. that type of model would generally have the credit card where the financial institution paying tripadvisor on behalf of the customer a -- perhaps a somewhat discounted off of list price rate, but that every credit card company would -- i mean, every credit card customer would automatically become a tripadvisor plus subscription.
that's a great deal for tripadvisor. it's a way to enhance the credit card in a very meaningful and differentiated way for a financial institution, but obviously those deals take a little while to put together and have to find the right partner in and we're still in beta as a product.
another option, certainly being explored with other financial institutions just simply include a discount perhaps or a free trial. so, a way to get started with tripadvisor plus subscription reaching an interesting audience. and, again, it's something that the consumer would likely activate themselves, auto renew on when we get someone to actually try the product and we are completely convinced that once someone sees what tripadvisor plus offers by way of discounts on all the hotels and all the experiences, the additional value propositions that we're bundling with the product, we think that that renewal will come rather simply. ernst?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yes. hello, lloyd. with regards to the auction and particularly the u.s. auction, have seen significant improvement throughout the start of the year. we said in our shareholder letter that in march we reached, in the u.s., about 67% of 2019, in april that was nearly 80%, and right now we're above 90% in the u.s. compared to 2019. so rapidly increasing performance.
a lot of domestic u.s. travel that is helping us here and we're pretty excited about that. the auction seems to be performing very nicely, cpcs are recently roughly at 2019 levels. so the auction is very healthy indeed and the otas, obviously, are actively participating in that.
so very pleased with how that's going and a good sign for what may happen with our european business, which is now very suppressed in the second half of the year.
lloyd walmsley -- deutsche bank -- analyst
all right, guys. thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of jason bazinet of citi. your line is open.
jason bazinet -- citigroup -- analyst
i just had a quick question on plus. as you've had discussions with sort of your hotel partners, are there any sort of broad parameters of things they're excited about or concerned about as they sort of contemplate putting some of their inventory into the program? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure, jason, thanks much. we've certainly had a quite a few discussions with hotel chains, independent hotels and we feel we're making good progress. well, look, let me just kind of back up and just remind everyone that we're at super early days about bringing this whole new subscription model to travel and hotel discounts are obviously a core part of that consumer value proposition.
and, in doing so, we're actively engaging with chains and independent hoteliers and listening closely for what they like, areas that they can -- that we can improve upon, and ultimately, how we get to everyone to join the program.
we're absolutely dedicated to making a win for hoteliers just as much as it's a win for the travelers. so what we've learned over the past couple of months is that a number of chains and independent hoteliers really like what we're doing. they're perfectly comfortable with how we're displaying the plus, our merchandising, how we're -- how we require a traveler to buy a plus subscription in order to book at discounted rate.
and that's what we call a hard gate and frankly that's what makes plus so different from the legacy hotel discount service.
jason bazinet -- citigroup -- analyst
so, if you -- no, go ahead, sorry.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
go ahead.
jason bazinet -- citigroup -- analyst
i was just going to ask, if you had to sort of rank order the risk of this not achieving your expectations, what would sort of be at the top of the list and what's at the bottom. sounds like the value proposition to the consumer is easy, right? so that one doesn't seem to be a constraint. what would be toward the top of your list of the things that you're more nervous about?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question. i do think a lot are valid [phonetic] because i love trying to kind of punch holes in our thesis going forward. and like, we have the traffic on the site, we shouted about 160 million shots on goal, people that are clicking on our meta links in 2019. it's a great opportunity. we're signing up independent hoteliers and they're comfortable with the product.
we've had some pushback from some chains, but they really don't speak with just one voice. so, a number are coming forward, saying, ""hey, it's exciting, let's enter in negotiations"" these see this as a great channel for tripadvisor -- for themselves, and they want to make sure their properties essentially get their fair share of bookings from this product.
other chains are a little bit more nervous about how we're showing the rate, and we've taken that as great sort of constructive feedback and we're addressing it. so we're in conversations with, i want to say, every single chain about what it will take to make them feel very comfortable about joining the program.
you asked me about concerns, and i just kind of want to make the point that we don't need universal coverage for this product because we have travelers going to say cancun and they want to see some amazing deals, and we want to present dozens of deals, but we don't need to display hundreds of deals.
and if you think all the way back to instant book, it was kind of different back then. but here, we're able to promote the deals that we're getting from chains or independents wherever we get them, and the kind of the better the deal, the more we're interested in promoting it to the traveler. and we've seen, over the past several months, traveler savings literally more than a -- our best savings is more than a $1,000 every single days since we launched the product and like pretty compelling numbers there.
and so, when we talk about the demand we already have on the site, i believe and partnerships, which i'm happy to go into more. i -- on the supply side, we have independents joining, we have good progress on negotiations with the chains. and some of the chain -- and we want to make sure that we have participation from as many as we can, because some of those chains have the absolute best properties -- absolute best properties around and so, we want every property to be able to join the program.
but the point i was trying to make is, we don't need every property. we just need a few dozen in all the geographies that people are traveling to. so, it may take a little longer than others for some of the chains to hop on-board, to see the benefit. but we want to make sure all of their properties, again, get the share of bookings that plus will be driving.
jason bazinet -- citigroup -- analyst
it's great color. thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of richard clarke of bernstein. your line is open.
richard clarke -- bernstein -- analyst
hi there. thanks for taking my questions. a couple if i may. you've provided some very helpful color there on where we are in terms of us bookings, both for the auction product and the experiences. would it be possible to get kind of the similar commentary for the rest of the world in aggregate or broken it down? are we seeing any progress as we've kind of exited the quarter outside the u.s.?
and then, maybe just a quick follow-up on the plus product. i think we've seen a few comment that supply has come down a little bit over the last month and there isn't as much into memorial day as there was a couple of months ago. is that just a natural result of the shift from wholesale supply to direct partnership supply and where are you in that process of shifting to that direct partnership supply?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you, richard. i'll start with the commentary about outside the u.s. much more muted, more like q4 throughout q1. more green shoots more recently starting in q2, in april and in may, but more depressed in the u.s. because of the lack of the rollout of the vaccine in europe and the lock-downs, many lock-downs by countries.
but this is starting to change. we see that the uk is very much ahead with the vaccines and travel incentives increasing there. we see a thawing in our restaurant business. and reminder, last year, as soon as the restaurants opened in europe, our fork business bounced back to 2019 levels very quickly in the last q3.
we're starting to see restaurants open. there is a timetable for oyo restaurants open in europe now which is in the next few weeks in most countries, italy is partially opened, spain in partially opened and in those markets where we're partially -- uk has just opened.
in those markets where we're partially opened, we immediately see revenues jump back. so recent green shoots across europe and -- but we anticipate that europe is, although behind the u.s., is going to catch up with the u.s. in the back half of the year.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, richard for the plus question as well. i'd give a short answer by saying simply, we're in discussions with a number of different aggregators, the ones we've brought on originally that helped us deliver such a comprehensive amount of supply right out the gate as well as independents and chains, who are direct supply effort. that's caused some variation, as you noted on the site. i'd say it's less seasonally related and more an aspect of how we're going to market with our direct connectivity, direct supply and how we're working with the different set of aggregators. i'd say, expect more change going forward.
we're a test and learn company. this is a brand new product. we're innovating about the best ways that we can display inventory, display great discounts for travelers, while at the same time respecting the wishes of hotels who want to make sure their inventory, their prices are displayed in a way that they're comfortable with.
so, as you continue to look at the site, you'll see some more tests coming, some more changes coming in the next weeks and months, and that's part of the reason why we're still in beta as we hone in on what makes for a great consumer experience with a nice breadth of inventory coverage.
richard clarke -- bernstein -- analyst
wonderful. thanks for the color.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of naved khan of truist securities. your line is open.
naved khan -- truist financial -- analyst
yeah, hi. thanks a lot. maybe first on trip plus, maybe can you give us a sense of the scope of the beta? how much traffic was exposed to it? and has the beta so far caused you to recalibrate your expectations up or down? any color on that would be great. and then, on the plus profit still, i think last time you disclosed more than 100,000 properties. do you have an updated number you can share? has that number grown versus where it was previously?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure, thanks naved. so we have been, since we rolled out beta earlier in the year, which was on a very small percent of our traffic, we rolled it up to north of 75% in the u.s. in terms of chances of seeing tripadvisor because we want to get as kind of -- as much experimental data as we can for how consumers are interacting.
on any sort of given day, you might have four or five different plus related tests running as we, again, hone in on kind of what makes the best style merchandising, how the checkout flow works, how we're sorting different properties to the top of our list. lots of different things that are all part of the equation.
would i been in u.s. [phonetic] calibrating up or down, i'm getting more bullish on the opportunity because i see the types of savings that consumers are achieving and they're pretty compelling, our average saving is north of $300 and there is several times every day when someone is saving more $1,000.
and that's a meaningful number for changing the type of the trip that that traveler can have and as word spreads that ""hey, all of this is available with this new tripadvisor plus subscription product,"" i look three to five years out, and i'd say ""of course somebody and darn it that's going to be us, is going to have a travel subscription product with tens of millions of subscribers because it's such a logical fit into the ecosystem.""
subscription is clearly improving in so many different categories now and we've priced this, we feel, appropriately so that -- so that a lot of people can afford to subscribe. i mean do the math. at $100 a year, it's less than $9 a month, what a great deal to be able to get the type of discounts on hotels, 10% off on all the bookable experiences on tripadvisor. you'll soon see some of the other things that we're adding in into the package and it's just a great notion and frankly great business model for us.
so i'm getting more bullish on the opportunity as i've seen more of the customer reaction and frankly i'm getting or i'm being careful myself to temper my enthusiasm about what this looks like in five years with how quickly we can get there because i'm constantly reminded, there isn't another travel subscription product out there. people aren't comparing this with something else.
it's a new concept that we're introducing to people and i have to be a little bit patient about the time it takes to educate folks, time it takes -- even though we have these no-brainer moments, the time it takes to -- for us to help persuade them that it's a very clear savings. so i am reminded by my team. i remind everyone that this is really early days in a great new product category and success is measured in years, not months.
and that's the way we're approaching it because it's, again, i'll try to be more succinct here. i believe even more in the category, love it. it will take us some time to get there. i'm impatient by personality, but i understand these things. it will take some time and super excited.
to your property count question, i don't want to hang too much on specific property counts because what we found is, it's really the combination of the discount level we're getting, how that compares to other partners of the prices that we're showing that drives a lot of the -- a lot of the bookings. so not surprisingly, a very small discount.
if we have a lot of properties with a very small discount, it doesn't move the needle for us. but when we're getting the 10%, 15%, 30%, 40% discounts, those become best sellers pretty quickly and we're really helping those hotels fill that empty room and that's why -- that's why the whole model is so powerful. thanks.
naved khan -- truist financial -- analyst
great. yeah, thanks for the color. maybe a quick question maybe on the viator distribution deal, when should -- when can we start to see the p&l impact? obviously, the economy is still reopening, but just maybe talk about that, maybe how the economics might be structured and is there a potential to do more distribution deals such as this?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. so i'll try to answer that and then i'll let ernst comment. part of viator's business model is as a player for all the different points of sale. and so whether that'd be a booking.com, an expedia, other otas, including kind of the traditional offline travel agencies. so they're very good at or very good at distributing that type of inventory.
and again, it's early days in the recovery of all experiences. thrilled with the partnership with booking.com. a great company to work with. obviously, we worked with them for a long time. they're excited on the experiences side. they have some of their own plans and we're able to complement globally for them and that's, from our perspective, quite exciting. ernst, do you want to add anything?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
yeah, i would add is the fact that we are able to do distribution deals like this. it's a reflection of the power of the supply aggregation that we put in place with viator, second to none across the world. and we have very attractive connections with very attractive supply in experiences and that makes a partnership with players like booking an attractive proposition for both sides. it will allow them to scale their experiences business faster and will allow us to create even more scale in our supply aggregation.
naved khan -- truist financial -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of deepak mathivanan with wolfe research. your line is open.
deepak mathivanan -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for taking the question. a couple ones. so first, can you talk about the auction participation at this time? are you seeing more participants come in, either hotels or more otas beyond your large partners? just trying to get a sense of how various players are reacting during the rebound and what the marketplace could potentially look like post-recovery?
and then, second one on plus, i know it's a small data point given it's a beta right now, but as you assess the rois based on early data, how are you thinking about currently the potential cannibalization of meta revenues because of this product? thank you.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
i'll start with the first one, deepak, on the auction. yeah, we're pleased with the increased participation, the auction, especially in the u.s. coming back to live -- to life. i was describing that cpcs recently have been sort of close to 2019 levels which is an indication of the health that you see emerging. i said that our revenue very recently has been sort of above 90% in the u.s. versus 2019. and so the auction is regaining health sequentially and we're very pleased with that.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
and i'll jump in on the plus question. so while we certainly keep a very close eye on cannibalization and when we put a plus offer at the top of the sword [phonetic] quarter, while one still can click on a meta link from that plus offer and people do, we're obviously trying and succeeding at driving a bunch traffic into the plus flow.
too hard to say what the complete roi is going to be because we really don't have data on renewal rates, but if we make reasonable assumptions and we clean up a few of the loose ends on the conversion path to make that more effective, i'm quite confident that we'll get to a positive -- a clearly positive draw on the dilution for the auction in place of the subscription revenue.
the other thing that clearly helps the cause is that folks who become subscribers of plus come back more frequently and whether they're coming back to book another plus hotel or a hotel that's not plus, but the fact is the regular auction meta-click they believe and they are much more loyal to tripadvisor.
and so. we're also looking at that repeat behavior and seeing how that boosts our domain direct traffic, which in turn boosts our overall auction revenue outside of plus. as you point out, very early days, pretty hard for us to measure right now those kind of medium to long-term benefits but what we're seeing so far looks positive.
deepak mathivanan -- analyst
got it. okay, thanks guys.
operator
our next question comes from the line of shweta khajuria of evercore isi. your line is open. shweta khajuria, your line is open.
shweta khajuria -- evercore isi -- analyst
i'm sorry, i was muted. can you hear me?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
yes.
shweta khajuria -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, sorry about that. so, could you please remind us how the pricing will work with trip plus so there is -- i know there was a question asked, there is wholesale pricing, there is consumer pricing, but how are you thinking about that? so it's a $100 night, you just pass the discount through to the subscriber and you get a subscription fee, but the subscriber sees $85 or something like that. and would it be different in terms of how much you pass through, whether it's a chain or an independent hotelier. just could you please remind us how you're thinking about that?
and then the second is, what would -- what are you looking for in terms of supply on the platform. in terms of engagement that will trigger a full launch out of beta. so, what are some of the metrics that you think will let you launch the product fully, whether in the u.s. or globally? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
great. thanks shweta. excellent two part question there. so, the basic model we're working with and there perhaps are some exceptions is that we're encouraging hotels of all types to identify a discount that we are able to pass along to the traveler. and we're in fact passing along the entire discount they're able to offer to be kind of the most beneficial to the consumer to get them -- to get that consumer to book to the properties.
so, if an independent hotel abc says, ""look, really interesting demand for these for dates, we'll give -- we'll offer a 25% discount."" that 25% discount flow straight through to the consumer. that means when someone is looking for a couple of nights stay at a 25% off at a decent average daily rate that might now be a $300 savings for that trip. and the consumer sees, wow, that's a great savings, love this hotel, highly ranked, in the location i want. and consumer saves $300, we charge them $99, net savings of $200 and it's a win-win-win all around.
a different hotel may only choose to offer a 10% off, which is something we would still offer, but it's not as compelling to the traveler. for an existing plus subscriber, ""hey, that's still nice."" for a brand new plus subscriber, for one night stay, that's probably not or perhaps isn't going to trigger a subscription purchase. but that same hotel 10% off for seven nights stay probably does add up to quite a bit of savings.
so, we leave that up to the hotel. i mean there is a minimum discount when we sign up the hotels, but that is something that they can kind of toggle up and down depending on their demand needs at a particular point in time.
and then -- i mean, i hope that kind of answered how we kind of deal with discounts. of course, down the road, we could always choose to not pass along the full discount to the consumer, but that's not our plans at the moment is, as we want this to kind of catch fire with consumers as quickly as possible. maximizing the discount is one way to do that and we're still making our money on subscription and growing that recurring revenue stream.
in terms of the plus supply/launch criteria, supply is one aspect of it. we're looking to kind of hone the consumer experience i.e. kind of make the conversion flow as straightforward as possible, make sure that all the ticks and ties, the nuts and bolts of building this and making sure it's working on all of our devices is kind of -- is up to snuff.
we don't have, and we don't feel it's necessary a hard and fast, we must have x number of properties at a y discount level, but we do look around at obviously our major geographies, we look and say, ""are we offering a set of hotels that are compelling in terms of discount and compelling properties themselves."" and we know we'll never get it right or we're not waiting to have every city looking great before we launch.
but again, the product is available to most of -- the clear majority of our traffic right now. we simply haven't launched it to our members and started up our pr machine. and the rest of the way is, when it goes about launching the product. but as i say, that will come soon and we're just putting the finishing touches on this is how i phrase it.
shweta khajuria -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, very helpful. thanks, steve.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of tom white of d.a. davidson. your line is open.
tom white -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my questions. i guess firstly, i was hoping you give us an update on your progress around leveraging the massive amount of customer data that you guys have and making it more actionable, any way you can kind of quantify the potential benefit to the business, maybe you hope to see from that, be it more repeat rates, higher conversion. and also, where does this rank kind of on your priorities, maybe it's kind of fallen down the pecking order, just given the focus on plus and making sure you optimize around the recovery.
and then, just a quick follow-up on plus. steve, you remarked how no other online travel platforms has kind of launched a subscription offering for consumers, just curious on that? i mean is that just because you -- because maybe the otas from day one have sort of been set up to kind of optimize around transactions and kind of e-commerce conversion or do you think there are other reasons why no one else has done something like this?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. a couple part question there. so i'll try to deal with first ones first, data to make it more actionable. we certainly have -- i've been talked about a lot, but we have been continuously doing that in our cpm or display ad business, helping to target with the [indecipherable] segmentation. i don't mean by geography, but lots of different aspects and that's what enables us to command a premium cpm in most of our display business. so we are doing that, have been making progress.
when it comes to tripadvisor plus, certainly our go-to-market plans do involve looking at a lot of our internal historical data, the travelers who we think would be great plus customers, how we approach them with an offer or something different than how we're mass marketing to all of our visitor audience.
so i'd say the data and analytics part is in service to that, to that plus subscription priority as we launch. when i look at a bunch of the activity that's going on. we aren't doing a lot as you haven't seen on the site in terms of pure recommendation type capabilities. we're adding a bunch, you'll see some of it in experiences going forward, but again, it's a matter of priorities. we have a bit more focus on plus than the hotel auction in that regard at the moment. but suffice to say, we do have teams working on bringing that data to life, just haven't given it a lot of air time historically.
to the second part of the question; yes, tripadvisor plus, we expect will be first kind of mass-market travel subscription product and we're investing a ton behind it and it really is a very different model than the traditional store. and so otas like an expedia or a booking are tremendous companies, have super brand awareness, a great product offering for travelers. they're both wonderfully global. but they've built their business around a commission orientation which, to be clear, is a great business.
we've been in the lead generation business for hotels, the transaction business just like the other otas for experiences and now we're introducing this new direct-to-consumer subscription model. so it's not that other folks can't, it's that it's a new way to think of something in travel. and because of -- well, the challenge with somebody else doing it, a start-up or a new company is that they may not have the traffic to expose to the subscription -- expose the subscription product to. but that's not tripadvisor's challenge, we already have so much of the traffic.
so, the opportunity to sell a subscription product for an occasional use, unlike the netflix or an amazon prime, you're not watching a movie or buying something every week or every month. travel is more episodic, but the value that we're presenting in this form of subscription is oftentimes much higher and can offer that instant savings. because we have the traffic is why we think we'll be successful where others might be challenged.
tom white -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
great, thanks for the color.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of james lee of mizuho securities. your line is open.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my questions. a couple of questions on plus here. maybe, can you guys talk about the checkout process here, it's the entire sign up and booking flow on your website or do you need to actually click at a website here?
and just curious, what is your cancellation policy for membership. and lastly, i think, steve, you talked about the deals in general, that's great, saving about 30% to 40%. i'm just curious, are these hotel deals you're able to negotiate, are they exclusive to tripadvisor? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
great. thanks, james. excellent questions. going forth, the checkout flow is all on tripadvisor. we're not sending you to any other website. we are the entity that's making the reservation for you. if there is anything wrong or you want to change, you're calling us and we're helping you through the process, whether that'd be for the attraction that you booked with a discount or the hotel that you booked with a discount, we're it, and that's a very deliberate choice.
we're also it in terms of hoping to get that second booking for the same trip or the very next trip. we operate on a very hotel-friendly policy in terms of when someone books the hotel on tripadvisor, we're sharing the sole name information, everything directly with the hotelier as part of the reservation.
and we're encouraging the hotelier to try to upsell that client with a spa treatment or whatever or room service, whatever else that they may -- might will be able to do or have them join the hotel's loyalty program, everything like that. so that's all good and in fact encouraged from us.
cancellation policy for trip plus, super consumer friendly now. it's essentially, if you look around and you're not going to use the subscription, we'll let you cancel, i think it's currently 30 days, but we'll probably extend that.
and then, you can envision kind of going forward, it's not a monthly subscription, it's an annual subscription. so if you, for whatever reason, haven't been able to use the product, we don't feel you should be paying for it, but if you have used the product, then it's not refundable, you have it for the whole rest of the year. and frankly, if you're using it once a year, you're probably making your money and if you're using it twice a year, it clearly equate savings.
third part of the question, are the deals exclusive to tripadvisor? they can be. that's really up to the hotel. we are -- as we contract with the hotels, we are not demanding that it'd be exclusive for other channels. but what's going to happen is that if a hotel offers us a 15% discount to be part of plus and they simultaneously give that 15% discount to an ota, then it will never be merchandised on tripadvisor as a plus deal, because it's not cheaper than what's showing up in our meta auction and -- or the reason again we're different is because we're requiring our travelers to buy the subscription product before they can book this discounted hotel.
and that's the hard gate, that's the pay gate that enables hotels to give us a discount that they're not putting out there on their own website or through other channels and that's what makes our deals special. so, in the weeds i guess if the hotel is offering this discount -- same discount on some other opaque discount site or packaged with an airline flight, that would be fine with us.
but if it's also on a deal that's also on their own website, then they're just -- it's not going to work. we're not going to merchandise their property as a plus property on tripadvisor because it's not a compelling value proposition.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. and just a follow-up question here on a separate topic. and this product you guys haven't talk about in the while which is news-feed or you guys call feed product, any progress on that front specifically? and just couple of quarters ago, you talk about feeds are very important for you guys to drive login users and any update on that too? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
i'm sorry, i want to -- i want to make sure i understand the question. could you reask it? i wasn't quite catching it.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
yeah, steve, i think couple of quarters ago, you guys introduced a very much a news-feed like product, very similar to facebook where people can put inspirational pictures, videos onto your [speech overlap]
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. i got it. yeah, certainly more than a couple of quarters ago that was what threw me. a couple of years ago, we had a social feed to the product, a lot of that is still live on the site, you can still post, you can still follow. it was a great way to engage more users. it generated a lot more sort of content and guides for us. that was all very helpful.
and we had been investing in it. then you know pandemic and tripadvisor plus came and we realized that this opportunity is kind of far more interesting, far more sustainable and it didn't have -- i want to call it a perceived competitive threat from other social networks. and we were not at all trying to be a social network.
but the short answer is, yes, that's still live on the site. we're adding, i think the numbers we're adding, more than 100,000 new members every day just as part of people joining tripadvisor because it's a great site to join. and so, we're able to market to those people.
so, growing membership is something that we're already, i think, quite good at engaging those members in our newer offerings like tripadvisor plus and focus on experiences, i think is the fun part of the game right now. so at the end of the day, we look at how can we best deliver an amazing vacation, amazing travel experience to consumers?
and we're doing that with the content on tripadvisor, the content you're used to in terms of using photos the new content, the guides and the new ways we're educating users about destinations and covid information that we're adding as well as obviously trip plus, the ability to save the time and have a much better vacation because of your ability to stay an extra night or to take that extra special tour or to otherwise see the location in a way that you hadn't been able to before.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thanks, steve.
operator
and our final question comes from vince ciepiel. your line is open.
vince ciepiel -- cleveland research -- analyst
great, thanks. you mentioned u.s. auction coming back to life, your peers have alluded to much stronger booking trends in the domestic market. and amid that backdrop, just kind of curious how you've seen reco and the insurance product progress, which was a direct-to-consumer offering that you rolled out.
and then a second part, a different product b2b, i think it was reputation pro and spotlight. curious how those are progressing as well as demand is improving? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thanks. excellent questions there. so reco, really fun product, but definitely aimed at the bigger, usually more international trip. that's where you get to connect with a travel agent that's really an expert or a trip designer we call them, really an expert in -- in the field that you're interested in the type of trip that you're taking and people have not been taking those types of trips over the past couple of quarters.
we launched the product right as the pandemic was starting. and we did not -- we chose not to put the product on ice and wait. we chose to continue to iterate and improve, even though we didn't have a lot of usage. and so now, as travel comes back, as europe says they're open up to u.s. travelers this summer, we look forward to being able to really give the product a great test run out there with tons of users connecting and looking at -- and hopefully the nps scores that we're seeing continue to shine and let that product sort of gain some organic traction.
for the second part of your question on the b2b side, spotlight, reputation pro, excellent products. again launched, revamped in the middle of a pandemic when it's both tough to reach hoteliers as well as tough to sell something new to them. so i think the -- 2021, certainly the back half year will be a great time to -- for us to be looking and saying, ""how are these doing?"" we're able -- hotels are clearly opening up. demand is growing here in the u.s. we're getting some stronger upticks of interest now, at least in the u.s., but it is a worldwide product set.
and so, it will be a great question for us to update you on in another quarter or two. it's been slow over the pandemic time, but we're not discouraged because we actually think these products -- we know these products are really quite valuable to the hotels that we're selling to.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer
and vince, as we are sort of filling out the tour of all the different revenue lines, i also want to highlight experiences, which we haven't talked about. we talked a bit about the viator deal. but experiences is really a highlight in this past quarter. and right now experience is very much lagging in 2020 during the -- in 2020, but really coming to life in the u.s. this quarter.
we said in our prepared remarks that u.s. point of sale booking levels reached 50% of 2019 in march. that was substantially up from earlier in the quarter and from before and has moved further up in april and now into may and u.s. as a destination has been very powerful for us and a good driver of the business. so experience is coming back to life and we're looking with enthusiasm what we can do for the rest of the year there.
vince ciepiel -- cleveland research -- analyst
thanks for all the detail.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer

and there are no other questions at this time, i will now turn the call over back to steve kaufer.

i also want to thank our shareholders for their shared belief that tripadvisor can play a key role in shaping travel in the years ahead. please get your vaccines and stay safe. i look forward to updating everyone on our progress next quarter.

2021-Q2,TRIP,2021-08-06 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to the tripadvisor's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to tripadvisor's vice president of investor relations, mr. will lyons. please go ahead.
will lyons -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, valerie. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. joining me today are tripadvisor's ceo, steve kaufer; and our cfo, ernst teunissen.
last night, after market closed, we distributed and filed our second quarter 2021 earnings release, and made available our shareholder letter on our investor relations website. in the release, you will find reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures discussed on this call. on our investor relations website, you will find supplemental financial information, which also includes reconciliations of certain non-gaap financial measures discussed on this call as well as other metrics.
before we begin, i'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's views as of today, august 6, 2021. tripadvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. please refer to our earnings release as well as our filings with the sec for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
and now with that, i'll pass the call over to steve.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, will, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us today. as covered in our shareholder letter, we were pleased to report that q2 grew by 91% versus q1, our net loss narrowed and adjusted ebitda turned positive. both monthly unique users and revenue as a percentage of 2019 levels improved each month throughout the quarter. whereas last quarter we saw strength predominantly in the u.s. market, in q2, we saw the recovery structure broaden, particularly in europe. these results indicate that the recovery is well underway and that tripadvisor is positioned well.
we note the traffic and revenue improved in july versus june. and while we are mindful of the variants and their potential impacts on travel, in the high percentage of domestic travel, we remain optimistic about the second half of the year and 2022 when the recovery broadens as both urban in international travel return in full.
while we are pleased with how we are successfully navigating the recovery, the tripadvisor story remains much more than just getting past covid. we see a huge opportunity to drive long-term growth and delivering more value to consumers and partners on our platform. we have and will continue to position the business for future growth by leveraging tripadvisor's global scale, influence and competitive strengths to execute on our strategic growth initiatives. this includes building our direct-to-consumer subscription offering, tripadvisor plus, which we rolled out to all of the u.s. users in the quarter. we will continue to invest in our product offerings, our tech and our go-to-market strategies in order to deliver customers the best experience possible and drive diverse growth across our platform.
so in summary, q2 has many encouraging developments. i want to thank tripadvisor employees for their passion and commitment to helping hundreds of millions of consumers and partners get back to travel. to our loyal customers and partners, we will keep building our products and services to drive more value to you. i remain very optimistic about what's ahead.
and with that, ernst, let me turn it over to you for some additional thoughts.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer and chief executive, viator, thefork and cruise critic
thank you, steve, and good morning, everyone. q2 results were beyond our expectations, and the progression of traffic and revenue improvements versus 2019 levels throughout the quarter is very encouraging. increased case counts and other challenges posed by the pandemic at near-term uncertainty for the pace of the ongoing travel recovery, of course, however, we expect another positive step forward in q3. our expectation is that q3 revenue as well as adjusted ebitda will meaningfully improve versus q2, both in absolute dollar terms, but also as a percentage of 2019, driven primarily by further improvement in europe.
in summary, uncertainty remains, but we believe the industry has entered a return to travel period and initial release of a significant pent-up demand that we've already seen. we continue to expect a better second half rebound and are optimistic about further significant travel recovery into 2022. this has already been demonstrated in terms of demand for domestic travel, primarily in the u.s., and we expect international travel as well as europe and the rest of the world to follow closely behind. we believe we are positioning tripadvisor well for not only a strong recovery, but for the long run.
with that, we will now open the call for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from naved khan of truist. your line is open.
naved khan -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
yeah, hi. thanks a lot. a couple of questions from me. let me just on the -- on your commentary about q3 and how july saw further improvement from june on the face of that improvement slowed, maybe can you just parse it out for us between u.s. versus europe? are you seeing that continued improvement more in europe and u.s. sort of flat lining or is improvement continued across both the markets? and then i have a follow-up question on tripadvisor plus.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer and chief executive, viator, thefork and cruise critic
hi, naved. this is ernst. yes, we've seen july improve from june levels in terms of percentage of 2019. the rate of improvement slowed may to june, as you saw in our numbers. it was a pretty significant step up as a percentage of 2019, but we saw continued progress. if you go underneath that, we saw europe starting to increase more significantly, where early in the quarter it had been primarily the u.s. we saw on the hotel side, the auction maybe take a little bit of a step back in july relative to june as a percentage -- only a few points, but our experiences and dining business continued to accelerate in july. and so overall, our july numbers compared to '19 were actually a little better than june, but not as much better as may to june.
naved khan -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. on tripadvisor plus, it's been live on your site for month and a half now, available to anyone. maybe any color on commentary on the uptick that you might have seen with consumer centers, the full launch versus your own expectations? and also maybe just on the usage, do you see the primary use case being that people who become subscribers to plus use it right away or is that with the live or is there a percentage that do not end up using it? and then -- can you just maybe speak to that?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure thing. thanks to naved. obviously, a topic i'd love to talk about. i got to start with the -- it is very early days. but i have to say i think we're really on to something here. as i mentioned before, we have plenty of examples of fantastic subscription businesses in a bunch of other categories, but now you have in travel. and so with our traffic, our brand trust, we think tripadvisor is just the ideal company to create really affordable plan that let's everyone, as we say, up their travel.
as you know, we just launched the product a couple of months ago in the u.s. so the question i guess you're asking is, like what did we learn so far. well, i'd say the biggest thing absolutely above our expectations is that we're saving a lot of money for travelers. the average savings is an impressive $350. there are some bookings every single day that are saving a traveler over $1,000. so it's pretty amazing stuff and user discounts that hotels are passing along to our travelers, and they're just like, that's a great value proposition. travelers pay $99 in this privilege to be able to get all these discounts.
and as a matter of fact, we're testing an expansion into our experiences booking flow, not just the hotel booking flow, because we really want to kind of expand the offering. as you know, we have discounts on not only hotels, but experiences, and we want to leverage all the traffic to help even more travelers take advantage of these savings. but to be fair, no product lunches without some hitches. and so while i'm excited about the travelers' savings exceeding our expectations, to be candid, we haven't made as much progress signing big change i would have hoped. but hey, we are great at listening, we're great at iterating and improving.
and so we've taken to heart some of the feedback that we've heard from our hotel chain partners and believe we have a solution that will be much more in line with their goals, and that won't hurt the great value proposition that we've created for travelers. so unfortunately, right now, i'm not ready to announce anything, but we're getting a much better reception from chains to the changes that we're making to the product, and that's a critical part of building this two-sided marketplace. as you know, we signed a couple of other hotel chains, we're excited about that. and we've also partnered with trip.com, specifically around plus. and we're working closely with them to bring all of their supply, and they have a lot into the plus ecosystem.
in terms of the question on kind of are users booking right away. i'd say most users are seeing in the flow of booking their hotel. they are seeing that they can save money if they subscribe kind of along the way. and that's the no-brainer moment that we talked about in prior calls, pointing out that the savings that you make on this particular booking can more than pay for the subscription. not all like that, but certainly most.

thank you. our next question comes from shweta khajuria of evercore isi. your line is open.
shweta khajuria -- evercore isi -- analyst
on your part on your signing up more hotel chains, you mentioned in the letter that you've developed new ways to communicate hotel discounts in slightly differently, that's been more -- that's been well received. but i guess, what was it? how are -- what was the change? and how has the reception been so far from larger chains? that's the first question. and on the second one, also on tripadvisor plus. is the supply side onboarding a slower than expected process in general? is that a product development focus for you in terms of once, let's say, a hotel says, ok, we are onboard. what is the process like until discount starts showing up? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. so i'd say the biggest challenge some properties have had with our current implementation is along the topic of rate parity where we're showing a discounted rate and hotels care a lot about having a standard rate across the internet. and so we've heard that loud and clear. and so as i just mentioned, we're making some changes that we think goes a long way toward addressing those changes. and hopefully, you'll see those come to fruition in the next few months, as in live on the site and offering the opportunities for more and more hotel chains to join in. to be clear with partners like trip.com, they have already a lot of inventory that is going to make a big difference we believe on the supply equation for plus.
when it comes to your question about asking individual hotels to sign up, we currently ask for a kind of the zero commission rate or a discounted rate that we can then show our travelers. there is some more for the hotelier to go create that rate so that we can show the savings. that's what earns the hoteliers a higher position on our site and gets them more bookings, because we're certainly preferencing hotels that are better deals for the consumer, and that's always what the consumer is interested in. so we think with some of the new things that we have under the covers, we can actually even make that sign-up process simpler. and again, i'll have a bunch more to say on that the next time we chat.
shweta khajuria -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. thanks, steve.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jason bazinet of citi. your line is open.
jason bazinet -- citi research -- analyst
[indecipherable] trip plus, but two quick questions. is it fair to say that that $350 savings you talked about, in weird way, what we'd want to see over time is that savings number comes down because it implies sort of deeper penetration and more receptivity for the consumer or am i thinking about that wrong? and then second, has there been any sort of impediments in terms of signing up hotel property owners because of covid where they just look even they said, demand is so strong, we don't really need any help at this particular moment because sort of everyone wants to get out and travel, and things get a little bit easier sort of as the world goes back to normal or is that not a fair characterization of the types of discussions you're having?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
so two terrific questions, jason. so if i had to project out over several years, as we look to build more and more properties that will have some level of discounts that we can share, pass back to the travelers, yes, i would expect that overall savings on average to come down. but i think of that is more because we're building, hopefully building a habit with consumers that they're coming back to us to not only book that $1,000 trip, but now that they're getting the savings for an entire year, they're coming back to book the $200 trip. and that property may not have a great discount on it, but it may have a good discount on it. and of course, it's lower overall spend.
so they literally -- that traveler may have saved $150 on the first purchase, a nice discount on a big ticket and is going to save $25 on the second purchase because it's a one night stay at a moderately priced hotel. traveler is happy about that. they are building more loyalty reusing our product over and over again, coming to us first, because they are able to find that discount on more and more inventory. but you just do the math, it was $150 savings the first time, $25 savings the second time, and that's going to be bringing your average down.
i absolutely believe that we will always have a set of properties in pretty much every market that will have tremendous savings on them because there's always -- just in the hotel distribution industry, there is always a set of great properties that could use some extra demand at certain points in time. and tripadvisor has the opportunity to be a great channel to distribute those rooms on a very incremental basis to hoteliers.
to your second question on covid impacting signing hotels, yes, i think it probably has, but for a slightly different reason i think than what you had shared. we're happy to sign hotels at a variety of discount levels. our message is simply the higher discount that you sign with us, the higher -- the more visibility you can get on our site. but you can also start with a discount that is similar or even less than what your other distribution channels than what you're paying to other distribution channels.
and so every hotel, even if they have a lot of demand, would always prefer to, a, they prefer to get bookings direct, but then when they go to alternate channels, they would like it to be the most cost efficient for them, and we think we can help do that for the hoteliers. the reason why i think covid is impacting our ability to sign, to some degree, is simply being able to reach people whether the hotel has not come back to full staff or whether they're really focused on making sure their hotel is safe for guests or perhaps dealing -- i'm sure there are some cases where they are sold out and just don't want to kind of bother signing a new channel. but i think it's probably more that they're still just getting back on their feet and growing their business globally, all of which, they're resolvable. it comes back to as travel recovers, hotels are always going to be looking for alternate distribution opportunities.
for our model, we're a cheaper channel for hotels, a very flexible channel for hotels. so like the reaction when we talk to individual hoteliers or groups has always been very positive. it's just been a matter of time. and to some -- and sometimes connectivity issues in terms of getting them all live on the site.
jason bazinet -- citi research -- analyst
super helpful. thank you.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
you bet.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from deepak mathivanan of wolfe research. your line is open.
deepak mathivanan -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. just a couple of ones. so first, wanted to ask about the auction. are you seeing mix of advertisers different now versus pre-covid in terms of revenue contribution? are smaller advertisers, hotels, otas now leveraging the platform more effectively than some of your larger customers from before? and then second one plus. you have one large ota right now on the platform, what do you think it takes to bring some of the other large otas to tripadvisor plus? anything you can share there would be great.
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer and chief executive, viator, thefork and cruise critic
hey, deepak. i'll take the first and i'll let steve answer the second. not really a change in advertiser mix versus pre-pandemic that we can discern at this point. so nothing really to call out in terms of the trend. steve?
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
so on plus, we certainly have a lot of experience going back quite a few years with our instant booking initiative, bringing lots of aggregators all around the globe on to the platform. it takes time. in fact, some of the new product direction pieces that i alluded to actually fortunately for us get to reuse some of the instant book infrastructure that we had in place and have kept lives. so i do think over time you will see some additional aggregators or otas as part of the equation, but not kind of from our perspective, they're not critical to have. we have a pretty good supply footprint now with trip.com coming online and their global reach.
from our perspective, well, it's always nice as we surface an offer to a consumer to be able to pick among kind of the best discounts for a particular property, it's actually a little less interesting from a consumer perspective because our goal is to always be surfacing offers that are better than the retail rate that is out there. and so whether we have five or 10 otas to kind of choose from the surfacing a particular offer is less important than having a good offer. and as i've said, the supply footprint from trip.com just the sheer number of properties that are available on their platform is really quite impressive. so we will continue to pursue additional aggregators, additional otas, but we don't view it as kind of critical to the success of the product.
deepak mathivanan -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. thanks, steve. thanks, ernst.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from richard clarke of bernstein. your line is open.
richard clarke -- bernstein -- analyst
hi, good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions. a couple if i may. first one, just on viator, obviously a bright star of the quarter. maybe you can just talk about what is the potential for that kind of b2b side of experiences? and maybe putting that into context, the deal you've done with booking, how big can that be? what google is doing in that space? and how can you kind of rectify that against using tripadvisor as the sort of top of the funnel for that? and is there any conflict there?
and just one question on trip plus. looks like you've soften the language a little bit, you used to talk about it potentially being a multi-billion dollar product, now you're saying, you can get a share of a multi-billion dollar market. is that because you're seeing some copycat products coming in or is this just a sort of am i reading too much into that change of language?
ernst teunissen -- chief financial officer and chief executive, viator, thefork and cruise critic
hey, richard. i'll take the first question. very pleased with our performance in experiences. very pleased, in particular, with the performance of our viator point-of-sale. we have seen experiences as a category come back much faster than we anticipated in q2. and we anticipated that the lack of international travel that we've historically benefited from with experiences would slow down the recovery. but what we've seen is we've been very effective at repositioning our offer toward more domestics, particularly u.s. domestic, but more recently, europe and away from big city to outside the city. and that's been very, very effective for us, very strong.
our u.s. bookings, on our u.s. points of sale across experiences, all channels, tripadvisor, viator, their bookings were above 2019 in june. very, very strong even in the absence of big cities opening or really europe opening significantly. cancellation rates are still a little bit elevated, but they are lower than last year, but very, very strong performance. viator as a channel actually overall globally was with our bookings above 2019 in june, which is very, very impressive, and it's improved again in july. and so really doing well. as you know, it's a huge market. it's still early days, 80% is still offline. we're a market leader. we have very, very strong global supply. and we feel that we have a, as we've always done, a real shot to win in experiences, and we're doubling down on that now in the recovery. so very, very important.
we play that among -- along three different channels. we have viator, which is a pure play ota consumer, but an ota. and then we have tripadvisor, the channel tripadvisor, which is much more integrated with the overall travel planning and overall travel experiences on tripadvisor. and then we have third-parties that we sell to, which is a smaller channel of the three that i'm outlining. and we have signed up in the likes of bookings with many, many other third-parties, leveraging the strength that we have in supply to broaden the impact we can have on the industry. so all three of those channels we believe are well positioned and all are leveraging this really superior global access to pretty amazing tours and attractions that our consumers like. so we're pretty pleased with where we're going with this.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. this is steve. to add just one sentence to ernst's comments. think of all that supply that we've gathered, that we've perfected, that we're able to merchandise and now we want to know where are all the consumers that could want it. and you've got that pure play ota named viator.com, growing like the wheat, looking fantastic. tripadvisor already has a ton of people planning their entire trip to a destination of which experiences is a key part.
so great we have that piece of the funnel. and then for the folks that aren't on our sites, we have this amazing third-party program with the likes of experience booking and most of the other big names that can capture travelers who offer our wares to travelers who are not part of our own ecosystem, all of which benefits in the two-sided marketplace like experiences are, of which benefits the supplier because it's more bookings, which in turn helps everyone achieve all the things you get when you're the biggest player in town. so quite excited about our experiences biz.
to the question on plus, did the language soften. no, not at all. i started -- i'm more excited about plus every week that goes by. to put it simply, we literally have millions of travelers looking at hotels on our site every single day. you can call it 100 million a month in normal times. we've described on these calls the 160 million, i think we call it shots on goal, as in 160 million hotel metasearch clicks in 2019 for stays that were of significance, and i call that as $750 or more. so it's 160 million people interested in clicking to a partner site because they're interested in buying a hotel room at $750. $750 being the number that kind of makes this a pretty easy purchase.
now i'll go add another 100 million travelers a month looking at experiences. that's a lot of reach and influence. and of course, tripadvisor overall has even more traffic than that, but that 200 million, they're looking at a hotel, they're looking experience, and those are the two categories that plus plays in right now. so if a small fraction of those travelers sign-up each month for our subscription product, since they know they'll save money on these hundreds of thousands of hotels, hundreds of thousands of attractions, we end up adding millions of subscribers over the next years with that same longer term opportunity in the tens of millions.
so again, we think it's super interesting space for tripadvisor to occupy, fits extremely well with our focus on guidance, leveraging the traffic we have, the brand trust we have and kind of the things that people already know tripadvisor for, and now we're introducing the subscription product, again proven in so many other categories, and we believe is the next big thing in travel.
richard clarke -- bernstein -- analyst
thanks for all the sense. thanks very much.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mario lu of barclays. your line is open.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. i have two on plus. so i believe currently you're still mainly offering the subscription as a no-brainer division as it will pay for itself after the first booking. but i believe before you mentioned the notion of potentially offering a free trial, so curious if that's still in the works to potentially onboard more members? and i have a follow-up.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
sure. yes, we have done some free trial programs. i'm sure we will continue to do some more. we're learning how to market a subscription product as it's our first one. i think it's a great opportunity. we've chosen not to go broad as in our entire audience with a free trial. we don't think that makes sense at this point for our partners. but i'd go back to my statement that it's very early days. we feel with our audience reach we have a lot of different ways that we can talk to them. we have really hundreds of millions of members. the product is still rolled out just to the united states so far. and so whether it's a free trial, a bundle, better job putting it in the experiences flow, more marketing across the site, changing how we merchandise plus so that -- i think right now we've -- if you're going to save at least $75, we're going to put it front and center. we can play with that number up or down. there's just lots of different ways that we are essentially iterating on every month as we look for the magic formula that helps to scale.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then i know it's still early for members that have been using plus for a few quarters, can you provide some color in terms of the magnitude of their booking frequency being a plus member versus their historical patterns? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
well, that's -- so again, early days. it's really hard for us to look at a six month cohort at this point given that it's embedded to a small percentage of our traffic in q1. and it's always just hard for us to compare what that booking behavior would be compared to what that customer does otherwise. so we can see how it compares visits on our site, a stronger repeat that sort of thing, but i'm not sure that that's telling us enough right now. so candidly my view that's going to be a great question where we're going to have a lot more interesting data on in three months and six months than we do right now. but rest assured, we're looking at that sort of stuff.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from james lee of mizuho. your line is open.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my questions. i just have a follow-up on trip.com agreement that you guys have. i think the ota have most of the hotel inventory in international markets, just wanted to check on that. and also is the discount from the ota available all season or does that need to be negotiated between you and trip.com after the onboarding process or is it automated where the ota can enter inventory in the system real-time? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
i don't want to give too much color on the specifics of the contract, but know that we look at the size of their inventory, their interest in sort of helping facilitate bookings to our global audience. and given the size of our global audience and the amount of inventories they have, there is not going to be anything manual about the whole process. so we aim to scale. we have experience working with otas and bringing breadth of inventory onboard to tripadvisor. in our sort of past lives and trip.com, it's distributed their inventories to other players as well. so again, i think it's a pretty good match.
the trip.com has global inventory that literally have tons of hotels in every single country in the world. historically, trip.com has served more outbound travel from china, but with their acquisitions, they have established a much more global footprint of travelers as well. and so no one supplier will ever offer the complete set of inventory that we are looking to build, but trip.com is absolutely a key and trusted partner in helping us bring plus to not only more hotels across the u.s., more hotels across the world, but over time, more hotels in more languages to serve more markets.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
and one quick follow-up, steve. any -- from a consumer's perspective relating to trip plus, any tweaks to your membership benefits as you continue to learn from the consumer behavior? thanks.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
i have nothing to announce now, but absolutely, we expect to be adding more benefits over time. we have dollar flight club, we have hertz, two pretty compelling benefits. and we see plenty of opportunity to add more in the years to come. no one subscriber in a travel club is going to use all of the benefits, but every additional thing that you add that ends up getting used is another reason why that individual is going to be sure to renew in addition to the savings on the hotels and experiences that we already offer. so we're looking ahead toward renewal opportunities. and we want to make sure that every trip plus subscriber is getting value on the things we offer and things that our partners can offer.
james lee -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. there are no further question at this time. i'd like to turn the call back over to steve kaufer.
stephen kaufer -- president & chief executive officer
terrific. thank you everyone for joining the call. travel recovery is underway. we will continue executing our long-term focused strategy to drive meaningful value in the years to come. a big thank you to all of our employees as well as to tripadvisor customers worldwide. and a big thank you to our shareholders for their shared belief that tripadvisor can play a key role in shaping travel in the years ahead. please get your vaccines and stay safe, and i look forward to updating everyone on our progress next quarter. thanks all.
