good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the q2 2020 evergy incorporated earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your host, ms. lori wright.
lori wright -- vice president, corporate planning, investor relations and treasurer
thank you. good morning, everyone, and welcome to evergy's second quarter call. thank you for joining us this morning. today's discussion will include forward-looking information. slide 2 and the disclosure in our sec filings containing list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations and include additional information on non-gaap financial measures. the releases issued this morning along with today's webcast slides and supplemental financial information for the quarter are available on the main page of our website at investors.evergy.com.
on the call today we have terry bassham, evergy's president and chief executive officer; and tony somma, executive vice president and chief financial officer. other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
i will now turn the call over to terry.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lori, and good morning, everybody. we've got a lot of positive news to discuss today, including our new sustainability transformation plan and solid second quarter results. so our new plan sets the stage for significant value creation and a strong future for evergy and our stakeholders. we'll begin today's call with a deeper dive into the stp and its benefits, then move to the quarter and your questions.
turning first to slide 4. as you know, earlier this year, the board established a new strategic review & operations committee to evaluate and recommend ways to enhance value for our shareholders and all the company stakeholders. among the options considered were a potential strategic combination and a modified, improved, stand-alone operating plan and strategy. both the committee and the board as a whole, were well advised in these efforts with each retaining independent financial advisors and consultants to assist in the review.
the work over the past four months has been extensive. the committee and our financial advisors engaged with a number of third-parties who may have been interested in a combination. we also took a fresh look at each element of our operating plan, including our investment priorities, our opportunities for cost savings and operating efficiencies and how and where we allocate capital.
throughout the review, we were focused on three core objectives; maximizing long-term value for our shareholders, serving the best interests of all evergy stakeholders, including our customers, employees and communities, and continuing to advance our work to successfully create a forward thinking sustainable energy company. the plan we are announcing today delivers on all of these objectives. accordingly, the committee unanimously recommended and the board unanimously approved pursuing our sustainability transformation plan that we are excited to announce today.
turning to slide 5. our plan creates a compelling value proposition for shareholders. under our plan, we will meaningfully increase our earnings growth to 6% to 8% through 2024 compared to our previous guidance of 5% to 7%. this increased growth rate places evergy in the top quartile of all u.s. electric companies. together with our growing dividend, evergy will have a compelling shareholder return profile. this growth will be enabled by increased capital investment as well as continued operational cost efficiencies to minimize the impact on customer rates.
under our new plan, we expect approximately $8.9 billion of capital investments through 2024 in infrastructure upgrades, grid modernization technology and clean energy initiatives across kansas and missouri. the incremental $1.4 billion in capital investments compared to our prior plan, which we announced in march of this year, is expected to support an estimated 5% to 6% compound annual rate base growth through 2024.
i want to point out that there are additional opportunities related to decarbonization and renewables deployment that are not included in our stp, which could support further investment depending on outcomes from our stakeholder engagement process. this process is under way as we update our long-term energy plan. we believe these potential incremental investment opportunities are realistic and achievable given the support for clean energy at the state and local level in kansas and missouri and from our customers.
as you know, there is a realization of the benefits associated with our prior merger, we have enhanced our planning processes that support system investment. we've also demonstrated our ability to execute on our identified cost management initiatives with the quantity and timing of merger savings well ahead of our initial targets. this execution drives our confidence in achieving continued cost reductions and the growth outlined here under a range of scenarios.
slide 6 highlights the growth opportunity in our earnings and rate base that i just discussed and shows the 25% reduction in o&m expenses we expect to achieve through 2024.
let me discuss each of these in greater detail. starting on slide 7. since completing our merger, we have regularly reviewed our capital investment plans to ensure that we are investing at levels and in areas that drive the greatest benefits for our customers and the greatest value for our shareholders. over time, we have adjusted our investment plan accordingly, the work conducted by the strategic review & operations committee to identify additional investment opportunities across our transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure as well as our customer-focused investments. the stp's incremental $1.4 billion of capex to bring the five year total to approximately $8.9 billion results in an estimated 5% to 6% annual rate base growth.
looking to slide 8. our capital plan is focused on additional investments to accelerate decarbonization and grid modernization, while continuing to be cost conscious, financially strong and people-first culture fundamentals that are core to evergy's foundation. the result is greener, more reliable, affordable energy for our customers and line of sight to continued earnings growth and value creation for evergy's shareholders.
over the next five years, we expect to invest $4.8 billion in upgrades to transmission and distribution infrastructure and customer-facing platforms to improve reliability, provide further access to renewable energy and enhance the customer experience. our new plan also contemplates approximately $500 million of asset hardening, grid automation and technology investments through 2024 to create the grid of the future. this includes expediting the evolution to a smarter, more reliable and more efficient grid.
increasing our renewable footprint is our priority that we have discussed and that we have acted on. since 2005, evergy has retired more than 2,400 megawatts of fossil generation and added or contracted over 4,600 megawatts of renewables, making kansas number two in the nation for wind generation as a percentage of total generation. our new plan has the potential to expedite co2 emission reductions by pursuing constructive regulatory mechanisms, economically retired coal-fired generation and expand evergy's wind and solar footprint. through these actions, we can drive lower fuel and purchase power cost as well as o&m savings, which help keep our customers' bills competitive in the region.
while we're still targeting 80% reduction in co2 emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels, under this plan, we have the potential to reduce co2 emissions as much as 85% by 2030, a material improvement in our co2 footprint over the next 10 years. the pace of this reduction will ultimately be defined in collaboration with stakeholders as we seek to find most beneficial, economic path forward for our customers. we are excited about the opportunities ahead, and we are already well on our way to meet our goals. nearly half the power to homes and businesses we serve comes from emission-free resources. and our clean charge network includes over 1,000 ev charging station and continues to expand.
slide 9. maintaining a solid financial foundation has always been front and center for us. as reviewed on slide 9, our plan requires no equity issuances, and evergy will continue to have a strong credit profile. tony will review our liquidity and financial activities in greater detail in his remarks. when we announced our review, we affirmed our commitment to serving the best interest of all evergy stakeholders, including evergy's employees, customers and communities. this commitment is unwavering, and our plan delivers on it.
slide 11 reviews our new growth plan as contrasted against our prior expectations, including growth and our capital investments, rate base and earnings as well continued growth in evergy's dividend. the result is an attractive investment outlook and meaningful shareholder value creation.
to sum up on slide 12, we are confident in this plan and the opportunities it creates to drive significant value for our shareholders and stakeholders alike. it allows us to target top quartile shareholder returns, deliver on regulatory and merger commitments, invest in critical infrastructure and accelerate our transition to providing more affordable and cleaner energy and project jobs, while enhancing economic development opportunities. we look forward to continuing to engage with our regulators as we execute on this plan.
now let's turn to the quarter where we delivered solid results and our outlook for the year. we reported second quarter gaap earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 a share earned in the second quarter of 2019. adjusted earnings per share were $0.68 in the second quarter of 2020 compared to adjusted $0.58 per share in the same period a year ago. on a period-over-period basis, these results were driven by favorable weather, cost reduction efforts and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by the negative sales impact of covid-19 and a non-cash income tax adjustment due to a new kansas law that will eliminate state income taxes for electric utilities.
also, we initiated our 2020 eps guidance, which on a gaap basis is $2.66 to $2.86 and on an adjusted non-gaap basis $2.90 to $3.10. i'll let tony give you more details on the outlook and drivers of this guidance. i am very proud of how our team has executed during these trying times. delivering solid results during extenuating circumstances underscores our teams' continued focus on safety, customer service and operational performance.
as a response to the pandemic has evolved, we are seeing the economy is starting to open up back over time. while some of our larger manufacturing companies may be working at slightly reduced output or shifts, by and large, they are operating at a much higher level than in april and may. our electric sales were down year-over-year, but we saw an increase in demand toward the end of the quarter. i'll let tony to give you more specifics on sales.
while pandemic precautions altered the legislative sessions in our states, there are two components of the recently passed kansas house bill 2585 relevant to evergy. the first provides for a special economic development rates in kansas, similar to what is allowed in missouri. the provision gives the kcc authority to approve rate contracts outside of the general proceedings that are based on the utilities incremental cost of service for customers that meet certain criteria. it allows for rate incentives that could attract businesses to kansas or encourage expansion of existing customers that otherwise may not be possible.
second portion of the bill eliminates the kansas state income tax for public electric utilities. this becomes effective on january 1, 2021. both of these are very positive for our customers and our communities. in july and in line with expectations, part two of the kansas rate study was filed. like part one, which was filed in january, the study provided thoughtful analysis of multiple issues impacting kansas electric rates and how they compare to regional states.
much of the focus on the second kansas rate study is on the competitiveness of rates, which is very much in line with the thesis underpinning our merger. the study demonstrates our strategy is working. and since closing the merger in 2018, our rates have declined at a faster pace than our neighboring states. additionally, the study supports our investment in modernizing and expanding the transmission grid that service kansas, which improves electric reliability and increases access to electricity generated from kansas wind farms.
now moving to the regulatory front, we've continued to work closely and collaboratively with our regulators to ensure we are representing all stakeholders as we adapt to dealing with the impacts of covid-19. we suspended disconnects through mid-july and we'll continue to waive late fees for our customers in both kansas and missouri. additionally, with commission approval, we have introduced additional payment plans to allow businesses additional payment flexibility and to provide residential customers with extended payment plan options.
kansas corporation commission approved our request for an accounting authority order that allows us to track expenses, lost revenue and any cost offsets associated with covid-19 to be considered for recovery in our next rate cases. we have a similar request for an accounting authority order pending in missouri. the mpsc has set a procedural schedule and we expect a ruling by the end of the year.
in june, the kcc approved an order to review our strategic review & operations committee. they also approved a joint motion filing by the company along with the kcc's staff, which aims to provide detail around certain timing and confidential iot [phonetic] concerns. now that our board has made a final determination in our process, we're working to submit a report back to the kcc in line with the requirements of the order.
i will now turn the call over to tony.
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, terry. good morning, everyone. i'll start with slide 17. we've reported second quarter 2020 gaap earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2019. the increase in eps is primarily due to warmer weather, lower operation and maintenance expense and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by the negative impacts of covid-19 and the income tax legislation in kansas.
as terry mentioned, effective january 1, 2021 public electric utilities in kansas will become income tax exempt. as a result, in june, we booked $13.8 million of income tax expense from the impact of revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities not recovered in rates from non-regulated operations and from the difference in the statutory tax rates recovered through rates and the consolidated income tax rate. while we plan to file for a change in income tax expense reflecting the rates effective january 1, 2021, the new law allows for kansas utilities to recover in a regulatory account any over or under collection of income tax expense as a result of a change in state or federal law.
moving on to adjusted non-gaap earnings, which were $0.68 per share compared to $0.58 per share in the same period a year ago. as shown in the chart on slide 16, adjusted eps was driven higher, primarily due to favorable weather, lower o&m and fewer shares outstanding and was partially offset by lower weather normalized sales, primarily due to covid-19, which we estimate cost us about $0.08. turning to weather, compared to last year, we estimate weather favorably impacted earnings by $0.10 in the quarter. and compared to normal, we estimate earnings were helped by about $0.06.
moving on to slide 18, i'll touch on year-to-date results. year-to-date, gaap earnings were $202 million or $0.89 per share compared to $239 million or $0.96 per share in the same period last year. adjusted earnings were $248 million or $1.09 per share compared to year-to-date 2019 adjusted earnings of $251 million or $1.01 per share. primary drivers compared to last year include lower sales, primarily due to covid-19, which we estimate cost us about $0.09 higher depreciation expense and increase in interest expense, partially offset by lower o&m expense and fewer shares outstanding.
our team continues its focus on operational efficiency to lower operating costs and exceed our savings targets. in the second quarter, we reduced our adjusted o&m by $25 million and through the first half of the year by $62 million. that equates to more than a 10% reduction in adjusted operating cost for the first six months of operations in 2020 as compared to last year.
as far as merger savings go, we remained ahead of schedule and expect to exceed our initial 2020 merger savings target. these savings are gained without sacrificing operating capabilities, and we recently announced another voluntary exit program for our employees. as for weather, compared to last year, we estimate weather was $0.02 unfavorable year-to-date. and compared to normal, we estimate earnings were flat.
on slide 19, i'll give you some details on the sales impact from covid-19. commercial and industrial sales declined reaching trough in april and started to improve in may and june, all the while being partially offset by increased residential usage driven by folks staying at home. these trends are consistent with what we observed as businesses started to reopen throughout the quarter.
for the second quarter and compared to the same period last year, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were about 7% lower, residential sales were up about 5%, while commercial and industrial sales declined 13% and 12% respectively. we remain optimistic in terms of our local economy slowly reopening. however, it's hard for us to predict if the situation will continue to improve or take a step back depending on the future impacts of the virus.
moving on to slide 20 and our latest financing activities and liquidity. as you may recall, we announced on april 2 that evergy kansas central issued $500 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 3.54%. proceeds were used to redeem $250 million of 5.1% bonds that matured mid-year. in may, evergy metro issued $400 million of 10-year mortgage bonds at 2.25%. this financing activity allowed us to pay down short-term debt at very attractive longer term rates and further bolster our liquidity position. we ended [phonetic] june with total liquidity of approximately $2 billion and do not expect new issuances or refinancing activity throughout the remainder of the year. as terry discussed, we were able to fund our new plan without any new equity issuances and maintaining a solid investment-grade profile.
now wrapping up on slide 21. for reasons we stated on our year-end call, we did not issue any earnings guidance for 2020. accordingly, now we're issuing 2020 gaap eps guidance of $2.66 to $2.86 and adjusted eps guidance of $2.90 to $3.10. we're still expecting a decline in year-over-year weather-normalized sales. our outlook assumes a slow and steady recovery throughout the third quarter and fourth quarter. some of the additional drivers would include a reduction of 8% to 1% adjusted o&m expense compared to 2019. depreciation expense around $20 million to $30 million higher than last year. coli proceeds of $20 million and we received roughly about $4 million through the end of june and an effective tax rate of 13% to 15%.
i'll now turn the call back to terry.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, tony. now we will be happy to take your questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from shahriar pourreza from guggenheim partners.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
good morning, terry and tony. how you're doing.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. good.
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
good morning.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
so a couple of questions here. first, it's obviously a very robust plan you've put out there. has there even been any partial varying with missouri and kansas? if you had any sort of conversations with the commissions? obviously, you have a five year base rate phase in kansas and conversations we've had with both commissions in the past seems to center on them wanting a fully embedded regulatory process in place before enacting plans like this. so what's the right podium to seek recovery? the timing of when you think you'll seek recovery? and what sort of gives you the sense that the plan is going to be palatable for them? and any sense on the bill impact on this plan?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so first of all, shahriar, yes, we have been talking to our regulators. recall, in particular, on the kansas side that the investigation, if you will, with the request by the staff to setup the docket was specifically addressing these issues. and if you recall, we actually supported confidential sharing of information with the staff only, but we have been talking to them along with this kind of dialog for several weeks. and in fact, they've made it clear that they don't have a preference for a strategic versus stand-alone plan to evaluate both. and in general, and going through the materials that have obviously been worked on by the sroc and the board, they've made it clear that their filing was addressing -- the original filing was addressing the concern over the public information that was in the elliott letter and outlined their concerns there.
we are very confident that the stp was prepared with those points in mind, and that we will have them involved in what's expected to be a very good stakeholder process to discuss all of these issues. we think the stp will meet each of their concerns going forward. what the process look like, we've talked about a stakeholder process that would involve the kind of things you mentioned, the regulators might want, which is long-term energy plan as a base for that conversation, but now obviously, we have the stp as well to discuss.
we're excited about the opportunity that it provides us for not only additional o&m activity to drive costs, but also investment in things that will drive better reliability and more certainty for customers and also provide us with ability to move forward with our decarbonization efforts and that stakeholder process will provide us with a lot of support when we go to work on regulatory and legislative support for that.
and finally, i think your last question was bill impact. i think we -- we believe that the bill impact will be very low. and in fact, in kansas, in particular, less than inflation. could be slightly higher in missouri simply because of the pisa piece of it, but it would be again lesser as well.
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
this is tony, shahriar. we're under the pisa cap.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. certainly under the pisa caps.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
got it. perfect. that's helpful. and then just -- this is going to take some time for you guys to go through this process. can you just maybe talk a little bit about the profile of that 6% to 8%? should we assume it's a little bit more back-end loaded as you seek recoveries? i mean, i.e., is the increase in that growth rate driven by the back half of '24? and then just on top of that, about $700 million of that capital growth opportunities is kind of predicated on ltep spending,, which may or may not transpire. so do you still feel that kind of with the plan you have, you have enough levers in place to sort of hit that 6% to 8% if the ltep spending doesn't really transpire?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey, shahriar. so as far as the profile, the 6% to 8% is not going to be perfectly linear. as you mentioned, we have a little bit of back-end lift just from the rate case is going into effect. missouri rates would go into effect starting probably january 1 of '23, kansas, a year after that. so it's not going to be perfectly linear. as far as the ltep spending goes, if we are not able to effectuate spending on those assets, we have plenty in the future that we could pull forward, that we can spend money on of other investment opportunities, whether it be grid modernization and grid hardening, etc.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
shahriar, we've talked about before having a backlog there, but certainly the process we've been through over the course of the last three months, four months has given us a lot more visual, if you will, to a 10-year plan of again modernizing the grid and upgrading the reliability and technology and customer focus programs.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
got it. terrific guys. i'll jump back in the queue and allow others to ask. thanks guys.
operator
your next question comes from durgesh chopra from evercore isi.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good morning, team. thanks for taking my question.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
maybe to the extent that you can comment on this, can you maybe provide us a little bit more color on the strategic review process? did you actually receive offers of combination? and if you did, then ultimately you decided to go ahead with the stand-alone plan. i don't know, i'm not sure if you can actually comment on that or not, but just any color on that process would be appreciated?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. what i would tell you that the committee conducted a robust and comprehensive process. we had advisors for both the committee and for the company. and yes, we did engage with a number of third-parties. and without getting into a lot of the detail, in the end, the committee and the board both agreed that based on that work and that review that our stand-alone plan produced a better long-term shareholder return profile and that was absolutely the best way to move forward.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. appreciate that. appreciate that. and then maybe just real quick, and i'll jump back in the queue. you mentioned a couple of additional opportunities, including renewable -- on the renewable front outside of this current capex plan, what sort of -- what should we -- what are the timelines for those? what are the milestones that we should be looking out in terms of you getting approval for those kinds of expenditures?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll let kevin bryant talk a minute about the opportunities. he worked on the -- that portion of the sroc stp work.
kevin bryant -- executive vice president, chief operating officer
yeah. so in terms of the opportunities, we laid out a slide in the deck that describes in more detail kind of grid mod. but it's all the things you would expect, i mean, updating conductors, poles, circuit breakers, aging infrastructure. so timeline-wise, we also plan to file our integrated resource plan in the first quarter of next year. and so we also describe our long-term energy plan process that terry mentioned, which is working with stakeholders through the balance of this year to build support and ultimately file that integrated resource plan, which will set the generation planning expectations for the foreseeable future. so that's probably the biggest, most notable milestone timeline-wise i'd point to you.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thanks guys. i'll jump back in the queue. thank you.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from julien dumoulin-smith.
julien doumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. thanks for the time. i appreciate it.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
julien doumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, howdie? perhaps if i can jump in a little bit, i see a lot of discussion on distribution spending, etc. can you talk a little bit more about coal retirements, securitization, specifically in the context of legislation in those states and how that might eventually fit into this plan, both in terms of incremental opportunities as well as to what extent that is already reflected or assumed in order to make those generation renewable investments that you've identified?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'm going to ask chuck caisley, who leads our community regulatory legislative process. so chuck?
chuck caisley -- senior vice president, marketing, public affairs & chief customer officer
yeah. i mean, securitization has been an issue that has been filed both in missouri and in kansas over the last couple of years. and we have been in conversation with multiple stakeholders over the last six months and believe that in the next year or so passing securitization would be something that is achievable in both states. and in fact, as recently as this morning and yesterday, we've had conversations with legislative leaders in both missouri and kansas that we believe that the stakeholder coalition exist to move that forward positively.
obviously, when you're talking about dealing with retiring coal assets, a mechanism for recovery on something like that would be a necessary precursor to be able to effectuate that part of the plan.
julien doumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
just to clarify, your current plan does not assume legislation/securitization in terms of what that would lead you for the slated capex here?
chuck caisley -- senior vice president, marketing, public affairs & chief customer officer
so on the very back end of the plan, it assumes a couple of year process to work through the securitization and ultimately regulatory processes. it does assume retirement of some coal in the back end of the plan and investment in renewables. i think it's in the 2024 time period.
julien doumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for clarifying that. and if i can just clarify further on the eps cagr. how do you think about how ratable that is against that specific target? i know that there could be some lumpiness, you obviously have some pretty ambitious o&m targets. i mean should we expect to see this ratably especially in the near years or do you think that this is more back end weighted?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey, good morning, julien. this is tony. as i said earlier, it's not going to be perfectly linear. there will be a little bit lift on the back end simply because that's when new rates are going to go into effect. in the interim period, we will rely on reducing our o&m that will improve our cash flows to help fund this -- on this investment thesis.
julien doumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, all right. i heard earlier about this. thank you very much. i appreciate it.
operator
your next question comes from steve fleishman with wolfe research.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. hey, good morning. i guess, first question on the strategic decision. maybe you could give some color from the standpoint of you mentioned that you think this plan gave the best value. but how much was kind of the risk of approval of a third-party plan part of the decision making? so there is value, but there's also risk. how much was at risk versus value?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
well, obviously, steve, probably the greater risk part of the process would have been on the bidder side. so obviously, they would look at their opportunity for success in making bids. in the end, as you look, it always affects both. but there is -- certainly, we think the stand-alone plan as we presented today is less risky and more likely to be successful and create more value than a merger situation based on the information we gathered through the process we went through.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then on the kansas side, the review of the information that they asked for and the like. as you give them this new stand-alone plan, is there any process that's kind of expected after you give this to them in terms of kind of reviewing the stand-alone plan or is that just do you expect that they're just going to take the information and kind of move on from that?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
so what i would expect is -- i'm sorry. did i interrupt you?
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
no, no. thank you.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
no, what i would expect is, number one, as part of the investigation, we are required to provide a report once a decision is made. and so we will be filing a report in the coming weeks that outlines the outcome of the process. so they'll receive that. and then what we expect is that the commission staff would participate with other parties in our stakeholder process that will be going through this plan as well as the long-term energy plan. and that's where we would expect to be able to talk about that.
and as i've said, obviously, they've already seen the information that the board and the sroc saw. so we certainly are in front of them from that perspective. and i think based on all that, we would expect to see through the fall a review and input from stakeholders. one of the opportunities here that i mentioned in my comments is the ability to move up decarbonization in our fleet. and although there needs to be some legislative regulatory work done there, we believe based on our conversations that both states have been supportive of that conversation. so we would continue to have that with them as well as it applies to ultimate approval of the rate case part or recovery parts of the stp.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. and then one last question, and i apologize to ask about the kind of ratability of the growth again. but -- so year one of the growth 2020 is obviously well below the 6% to 8%, if you look at your 2020 guidance, i assume due to covid. but just as -- is it fair to say besides the year one, are the other years all generally in that 6% to 8% range? just can you maybe give us some sense of the extent of the hockey stick, so to speak?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey, steve, this is tony. they're may be on the lower end of the range in the first couple of years as we're ramping up spending on the capital side and the offsets we would look to o&m to help obviously reduce that regulatory lag. and then on the back end, obviously, we're filing rate cases. and so you're going to get a bit of a lift for those rate cases going into effect in 2023 and 2024.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
i would not characterize it as a hockey stick, though.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
right. okay. so it's kind of the 6% to 8% and just maybe in the lower half the beginning and then upper half at the end or something like that roughly?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. that's the trajectory, if you will.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. that's helpful. thank you.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from michael lapides with goldman sachs.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on a good quarter. i have an easy one, which is when you think about where we are in the business for 2021, maybe '22, the biggest opportunities for o&m or g&a cost reduction or cost management are off of the level you're going to hit in 2020. i don't want to look back to 2018, that was a long time ago. i'm going to use this year. where do you think the biggest cost reduction opportunities for year one or year two of this plan really lie within the business?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey, good morning, michael. this is tony from the stp plan perspective, roughly 30% of the savings will come on the generation side, another 30% on the t&d side, about 20% coming from the g&a and then 10% from it and 10% coming from monthly customer care. those are kind of the approximate breakout percentages of o&m reduction.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and that's over the five years or is that in the next year or so? is that...
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
that's over the five year horizon.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. what about the first couple of years? five years is a long time away where the world is going to change 10 times in five years. so i'm just trying to think about what happens in the next one or two?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
well, we'll be executing on that plan, and i don't know that in any particular period. one functional area is going to outdo the other as far as cost savings go. part of the work over this process is that we've done a deep benchmarking and spent time reviewing those areas. so it gives us a lot of clarity around where those things would come from.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and when you think about plant retirements, do you see material plant retirements in the next, call it, two years to three years or is that more kind of back end loaded?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the plant retirements we will be talking about are obviously coal plants that address co2 issues and that fits in with the discussion around securitization and regulatory processes that would support that process being moved up. so it would not be closures in the next couple of years.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you. and one last question and it's a little just kind of detail-oriented stuff. any plan regarding what you want the level of holding company debt versus operating company debt to look like over time? and kind of where you are today versus where you would like to be?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
so michael, we would like to kind of stay around that 20% holding company debt compared to the total debt outstanding. it's kind of a moody's metric and we're a lot below that today.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you, tony. much appreciated. thanks guys for taking the questions.
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
you're welcome.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from paul patterson with glenrock associates.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates llc -- analyst
hey, good morning.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, paul.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates llc -- analyst
just a few quick follow-ups. what was the gating factor that -- i mean, obviously, you guys have always been looking at capex and modernizing the grid and opportunities in that area and what have you. but what was the gating factor that said, hey, we can do this and increase our earnings and everything? was there any crucial factor, i guess, that sort of led you to this or could you give us a little bit more of a flavor as to what the strategic review did in terms of eliminating these opportunities for you?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so there is no one single factor. obviously, first and foremost, we have commitments we made under the merger approvals in both our states. and so that was a beginning spot that we're absolutely going to be sure we could meet under any revised plan scenario. secondly, we continue to work to make our cost to customers more competitive and continue to reduce when compared to our regional peers, that's through our -- again commitment around the freeze in the merger. and so those two things were extremely important.
we also wanted though to be able to within that context to be able to drive additional investment, which would allow us; number one, to grow the business for shareholders' benefit, but also begin to update the grid and decarbonize at a quicker pace. so i'm not giving you more than a several, but they all had to fit together. and i think that was the key is if the work was how do we bring those together and do it in a fashion which improves upon our ability to invest our growth rate, but yet doesn't raise rates for customers, as i said, above inflation in kansas, takes advantage of pisa, which was there as a avenue that missouri supports. and then when you put all that together to be able to see how that might compare to other options. and we were very confident that this stp is absolutely the better option in front of us today for long-term shareholder value.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates llc -- analyst
okay. fair enough. the inflation rate -- so when we're talking about the customer impact in kansas, we're expecting something in the neighborhood of what inflation is in that, what's that? is that 2%? is that what you guys are looking at or is it something else?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
it's kind of the cpi, paul. i mean, in that zipcode, 2.5 or so.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates llc -- analyst
okay. and then finally, the 90-day -- the information sharing agreement. could you elaborate a little bit on what that's about, i guess?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. if you look at how the plan was originally put together, we were moving forward with both path one and path two, if you will, as i recall. but we extended the time for a review of strategic options when covid occurred. and so we began our work and completed our work on the stp opportunity. and once we came to a conclusion on the strategic opportunity, we thought it best to make the announcement to shareholders. there is still a piece of the sroc charter, which discusses their continued work with the board to make recommendations around benchmarks and kpis for tracking success of the stp and to assist and collaborate with the board on the optimal management team. and so those things had not been done yet. and so we agreed to with it around a 90-day period for that to be done.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates llc -- analyst
okay, great. thanks so much for the info.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

thank you for standing by, and welcome to the q3 2020 evergy, inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i'll now turn the call over to your host, the vice president, corporate planning, investor relations and treasurer, lori wright. ma'am, you may begin.
lori wright -- vice president, corporate planning, investor relations and treasurer
thank you, jesse. good morning, everyone, and welcome to evergy's third quarter call. thank you for joining us this morning. today's discussion will include forward-looking information. slide two and the disclosure in our sec filings contain a list of some the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations and include additional information on non-gaap financial measures the release is issued this morning, along with today's webcast slides and supplemental financial information for the quarter, are available on the main page of our website at investors.evergy.com. on the call today, we have terry bassham, evergy's president and chief executive officer; and tony somma, executive vice president and chief financial officer. other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
i will now turn the call over to terry.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lori, and good morning, everybody. i'll begin my comments on slide five. so today, we reported third quarter gaap earnings of $1.60 per share compared to $1.56 per share earned in the third quarter of 2019. adjustes earnings per share were $1.73 in the third quarter of 2020 compared to a $1.57 in the same period a year ago. third quarter results were driven by significant cost reductions, an increase in weather normalize demand and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by unfavorable weather. year-to-date, gaap earnings per share were $2.49 and in line with $2.49 in the same period last year. adjusted eps were $2.82 this year compared to $2.55 a year ago. throughout the year, we've managed cost to withstand a number of headwinds, including the impact of the global pandemic, unfavorable weather and less than planned coli proceeds. our solid execution has resulted in our ability to deliver a great quarter and gives us confidence in the outlook for the year. reflecting our strong performance, we are narrowing our 2020 adjusted eps guidance range to $2.95 to $3.10 by raising the low end. additionally, dividends are an important part of our total return story. you can see from our press release, the board increased the dividend 6%, which underscores their confidence and our execution of the sustainability transformation plan or what we refer to as stp. again, this is a great quarter, and i commend our team for the outstanding execution in these tough times. in addition to the over 3,000 dedicated employees and our frontline operations, power plants and other areas, we continue to have over 2,000 employees working remotely and will continue to do so into 2021. i'm proud of the resiliency and adaptability our team has displayed in dealing with the challenges brought forth by this pandemic. before i update you on our stp process, let me touch on the ceo search process. after announcing my retirement in august, our board formed a ceo search committee to find the right leader to execute our stp.
the search committee is currently interviewing quality internal and external candidates and just know that the process is ongoing, and we still expect to have someone named by the end of the year. now turning to slide six. as we have discussed before, the strategic review and operations committee and our entire board evaluated our new higher performance stp against other strategic alternatives available. the results were unequivocally and unanimously clear that our high-performance stp was the most valuable plan. it enhances value through infrastructure investment, cost reductions, while balancing the interest of customers, shareholders and communities. our stp is focused on three core objectives: maximizing long-term value for our shareholders; serving the best interest of our customers, employees and communities; and continuing to advance our progress as a forward-thinking, sustainable energy company. consistent with these objectives, our team has already began execution on these priorities set out in the stp. our operations planning team is a clear line of sight into our incremental 2021 grid modernization plans, which include new projects that will develop a more flexible grid to enhance customer reliability. our increased focus on substation and grid communication upgrades will overhaul aged equipment with modern technology and controls that will benefit our customers and communities for years to come. we've also invested considerable time and effort into robust stakeholder engagement to ensure our constituents fully understand the stp. some of this engagement has taken place within the structured irp process. we've also been working with stakeholders outside of the irp framework by developing a schedule for stp workshops to educate and gather feedback from our regulatory commissioners and our important stakeholders. additionally, we have been identifying metrics that we plan to use to track our success executing the stp.
there are relevant indicators around cost reductions, including both nonfuel and fuel as well as tracking infrastructure investments by category that we will periodically update you on throughout the year. we will use these potentially other metrics as we pursue highly strategic, value-focused approach to display a transparent track record of execution, accountability and results. now looking at slide seven. part of the vision within the stp is advocating for enabling energy policies that promote reliable and clean energy within our states. while the legislative sessions won't kick off until after the first of the year, that hasn't slowed us down from engaging with interested parties on potential legislation. through this dialogue, our confidence has grown in the clear desire across a diverse stakeholder base to enact long-term energy policies that will move kansas and missouri forward. while there are many solutions to deal with, remaining net investment in fossil plants being considered for retirement, securitization is one that can be more economical for customers. as a result, securitization is a topic that has come up in both states, and will be discussed in the 2021 one sessions. robust stakeholder engagement process around our upcoming irps is also well under way. while these discussions are not public, the feedback we've been receiving has been constructed. we'll continue to meet with the parties in these dockets over the coming months to discuss modeling scenarios and get feedback on preferred plans. we will file the missouri irp by april one of next year. and the kansas irp by july one of next year. i'll now move to the regulatory front, beginning with an update on the kcc docket related to concerns about our agreement with elliott management. the commission ordered this docket be closed, affirming that we had met all of our obligations in that docket, and any remaining issues be handled in the kcc's stp docket. kansa's stp review docket parties met throughout october to discuss schedule proposals, and we expect the filing soon to propose a jointly developed procedural schedule to the commission.
it's likely the docket will extend into the middle of next year to allow how for full stakeholder feedback. turning to missouri. in october, the mpsc staff requested commission and the commission granted, an extension for their stp report to january 29, 2021. this allows staff more time to study our plan and receive any updates or further develop details that could be meaningful to the report. as a reminder, we don't expect the commission to take specific action regarding stp in either of those dockets. main purpose is to gather other information on and review our stp and ensure our continued resolve in meeting previous merger commitments while providing a forum and repository for stakeholder feedback. lastly, let me touch on our covid-19 accounting authority order request. in kansas, the commission approved our request to track expenses and lost revenue associated with covid 19. in missouri, we reached a nonunanimous settlement with the mpsc staff and many other intervenors last month, which request the commission issue an order that authorizes us to track and defer incremental costs caused by the pandemic. hearings on the matter are scheduled for mid-november, and we expect the commission order in january. we realize this has been a hard time for our customers and communities. last month, we wrapped up our hometown economic recovery program, which awarded grants totaling $800,000 to nonprofit agencies. the goal of this program is to help our communities build back their local economies by retaining and attracting new business, developing workforces and supporting small businesses. this was all part of our largest to date focused charity investment which we announced in may and committed $2.2 million from our foundation to help agencies, customers and communities respond to and recover from the covid-19 pandemic. let me wrap up on slide eight before handing it over to tony.
our stp creates a compelling value proposition for shareholders and is predicated upon a proven track record of achieving cost reductions and executing on infrastructure investment, both of which provide tremendous value to customers while keeping rates affordable. our capital plan is traditional, straightforward infrastructure investment strategy that is diverse across our service territories without large project risk. combination of our competitive targeted 6% to 8% eps cagr through 2024, and an attractive dividend growth profile offers a compelling value proposition. the stp focuses on not only grid modernization, but also accelerating the transition of our generation portfolio. resulting in greener, more reliable, affordable energy for our customers and line of sight to continued earnings mix growth and value creation for evergy's shareholders. while we already provide carbon-free energy equivalent to around 50% of our retail energy demand, our remaining coal fleet provides a significant opportunity to further decarbonize and enhance our environmental profile. the policy enablers we're pushing -- pursuing would allow us to leverage the remaining plant value of our coal fleet to reduce capital cost and upon retirement, eliminate fuel and maintenance expense. this will allows us to add modern generation capacity with renewable investment over time. these circumstances, when paired with our prime geographic location, your attractive wind and solar potential make us uniquely positioned to execute a decarbonization strategy that would create significant cost savings for customers. we have an exciting opportunity in front of us. and that is a true win-win scenario to keep rates competitive while growing sustainable rate base that will be value-enhancing for our customers, communities and shareholders. our execution has produced another strong quarter and great results year to date. we're very excited about the momentum of our plan and the long-term prospects to deliver significant value to customers and attractive returns for our shareholders.
i'll now turn the call over to tony.
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, terry, and good morning, everyone. i'll start with slide 10. we reported third quarter 2020 gaap earnings of $1.60 per share compared to $1.56 per share in the third quarter of 2019. adjusted non-gaap earnings increased $0.16 to $1.73 per share compared to $1.57 per share in the same period a year ago. as shown in the chart on slide 10, eps was driven higher, primarily due to lower o&m expense and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower gross margin, driven by unfavorable weather. for the $0.10 of other margin, we estimate about half of that is due to increase in weather-normalized demand with positive residential demand being partially offset by lower commercial and industrial demand. additionally, there's another $0.02 from our energy efficiency programs. the $0.04 of other for the quarter is primarily due to the timing of when income tax benefits for tax credits and other tax items are recognized. turning to weather, compared to last year normal, we estimate weather-reduced earnings by $0.17 and $0.08, respectively. now on slide 11, i'll touch on year-to-date results. year-to-date gaap earnings were $567 million or $2.49 per share compared to $606 million or $2.49 per share for the same period last year. adjusted earnings were $642 million or $2.82 per share compared to year-to-date 2019 adjusted earnings of $621 million or $2.55 per share. primary drivers compared to last year include our significant cost reduction efforts and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower sales, primarily due to unfavorable weather, higher depreciation expense and an increase in interest expense. in the third quarter, we reduced our adjusted o&m by $41 million and year-to-date by $103 million. some of the cost savings we experienced year-to-date relate to the prudent deferral of planned outages from early in the year to the fourth quarter as we monitor the impacts of the pandemic.
additionally, we sent some of our employees and contractors to help other utilities to deal with storms, which has resulted in being a little behind in our tree trimming and line maintenance versus our plan. we will do some catch-up work on these items in the fourth quarter. and as a result, while we plan to hit our 2020 o&m target spend levels, we also expect less favorability in o&m in the fourth quarter compared to last year. we continue to see the industrial logic of our merger coming to fruition and by the end of this year, we expect to surpass $300 million of cumulative net merger savings. efficiencies are being realized across the business units through attrition, voluntary exit programs, leveraging the size and scale of our business and implementing technology solutions. turning to weather. we estimate weather year-to-date through the third quarter has been $0.18 unfavorable compared to last year and around $0.08 unfavorable when compared to normal. on slide 12, let me update you on trends we're seeing with covid-19 sales impacts. as we stated in our second quarter call, commercial and industrial sales declined significantly during april when businesses were shut down and improved in may and june as the economy opened. at the time, we were expecting a slow and steady recovery through the remainder of the year. and fortunately, that's exactly what we've experienced throughout the summer. we're still seeing commercial and industrial sales -- we're still seeing lower commercial industrial sales, but there was an encouraging trend throughout the quarter as we continue to experience elevated residential sales that modestly offset c&i degradation. it's hard to see how this trend will play out for the remainder of the year. with many schools implementing a hybrid approach and folks continue to work from home, absent a wide spread shutdown of businesses, we could continue to see residential sales help offset the lower c&i sales. even though we've seen waves of the virus, our state and local economies have been fairly resilient thus far.
for the third quarter, our estimated weather-normalized total retail sales were up about 1% compared to the same period last year. residential sales were up roughly 7%, while commercial and industrial sales both declined about 3%. we remain optimistic to realize there are still many unknowns with the coronavirus, particularly whether there will be further impact during the overlap of the flu season. wrapping up with an outlook for the remainder of this year and into next year. as you can see on slide 13, we've updated some of our earnings drivers in addition to narrowing our eps guidance range by raising the low end. absent large setback of covid-19, we're expecting to continue to see a slow and steady recovery through the end of the year. as i mentioned previously, we expect to incur some of the costs that were deferred from earlier this year and with that in mind, we expect cost savings to be less of a driver for the fourth quarter, and we've narrowed our annual adjusted o&m target to 8% to 10% lower than 2019. our guidance includes $20 million of coli proceeds. and it's worth pointing out that we had only received $4 million through the end of october. our forecasted annual effective tax rate remains at 13% to 15%. i will note that our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 was extremely low due to the amortization of excess deferred income taxes and a return to a rate closer to our 2020 guidance range is something to consider for this year. moving to slide 14 with 2021 considerations and preliminary drivers. after resurgence of covid-19, we expect weather-normalized sales growth in 2021 compared to 2020. and we'll continue to monitor the lingering impacts of covid-19 through the winter months and form more specific annual guidance for 2021. we have significantly reduced nonfuel o&m over the last two years, and we expect to maintain momentum as we begin implementing the stp-identified savings.
our original merger savings plans were outlined through 2022 as we layered on incremental savings opportunities through our stp work, we identified and extended these efforts through 2024. as part of the stp, our team has created charters to detail these savings opportunities, and we are viewing 2021 as a year to implement newly identified stp savings initiatives. we are confident in our ability to remain on plan for cost reductions in 2021 to reaffirm our long-term target of reducing nonfuel o&m by $210 million from 2019 through 2024. we expect capital deployment increases by around $150 million with all the year-over-year growth coming from transmission and distribution segment. we plan to spend over $400 million more in t&d, while our investment in the generation, general and other segments will be reduced by around $280 million. the identified additional ferc investment will be reflected in our 2021 formula rate update which we currently estimate will increase transmission revenue requirement by around $30 million. obviously, as expected with a larger capital plan in 2021, we expect to see higher depreciation expense of around $30 million to $35 million, even when considering the favorable depreciation treatment for pisa qualified projects in missouri. now coli programs are difficult to predict. we expect to include a place hold over 2021 that is in line with our current 2020 guidance. lastly, we're forecasting an effective tax rate in 11% to 13% range. the effective tax rate will be driven from lower -- from the lower state income tax exemption for electric utilities in kansas starting in 2021, which will be offset with lower retail revenues as the savings is passed through to customers. we remain confident in our target of long-term 6% to 8% eps cagr. and as we've mentioned previously, in the early years, including 2021, earnings are expected to be toward the bottom end of our range. we are very confident in our ability to deploy capital, finance that capital and stay on track with for the long-term cost reduction targets. the pandemic does create some lingering uncertainty with sales. so we continue to monitor trends and plan to issue formal eps guidance and updated drivers on our year-end call in february.
i'll now turn the call back to terry.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thank you, tony. and with that, i'll turn it over to jesse, and we're ready to take questions.

[operator instructions] first question is from the line of shar pourreza. your line is now open.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
good morning, guys.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, shahriar. how are you?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
good morning.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
oh, not to bad, not to bad. so just two quick questions here. just on the timing of the irp and sort of the stp dockets. curious, like how do you sort of formulate these irps mid next year if the stp dockets are continuing into next year? so are you going to have enough feedback there to file these irps? so how do you sort of bridge the timing between the stp conclusions and the irps? i have to imagine what you find from the stp process will provide a guidepost for the irps. so just curious how do we bridge the timing gaps there?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
well, actually, i would kind of think about it the other way around. the stp is an overlay and will include the irp findings. and so the irp is a very specific process with intervenors who -- participating in depth, and those will help us to add to, if you will, the long-term future of our generation profile. the stp, as you know, is highly focused on the front end of the plan with t&d and other investment, which is very traditional and not as involved in the irp process. that make sense?
shar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
it does.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
the irp is in general, a long-term generation planning process.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
got it. and sorry, terry, what was the timing on the missouri outcome for the process for the stp?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
it's filed in april, april 1st of next year and kansas in july.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
got it. and then just lastly, any updates on sort of the elliott information sharing agreement? has that lapsed? where is that sort of an event?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yes. the agreement terminated by its own terms earlier this week, and we're no longer under any agreements with elliott since its termination.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
was -- is there anything you can update us that came about from that agreement? or -- because you're still searching for the ceo, right? whether it's internal or external. so what actually came out of that agreement?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
well, obviously, the agreement as a whole was the basis for our entire process that it created the stp, the kind of the back-end extension, if you will, was for the opportunity to participate under the information sharing part of that during that time period. again, the period is run, the agreement has run and there's nothing else in place.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
excellent. all right. well, thanks so much guys. have a good morning.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. you too.
operator
next question is from the line of julien dumoulin-smith. your line is now open.
dariusz lozny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning. it's dariusz lozny on for julien here. just wanted to ask briefly about o&m reductions. you guys, as you mentioned in your remarks, reduced the high end of the 2020 cuts from 11% to 10%. how should we think about that in the context of 2021? obviously, you've got the longer range reduction based in there through 2024. but should we think of maybe the the longer range target as more front-end loaded given that presumably there may be some savings from '20 that go into '21?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
well, good morning. this is tony. we're still going through the -- finish up our planning process for 2021, which is why we didn't really give specific driver on o&m just yet. i think what we've shown in 2020 in prior years, this sets the table quite well for 2021 and years beyond for our ability to push toward that number of $210 million lower nonfuel o&m starting from 2019. we did discuss a little bit, i think, about the overlap between what was traditionally or originally the merger savings and which now the stp provides us with additional o&m savings that we're just starting to chart and ramp up. so there's kind of an overlap of that process in '21 happen as well.
dariusz lozny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you. and just one more, if i may. and shifting gears a little bit to the prospect of securitization, which you also mentioned in your remarks. is there anything in either kansas or missouri that we should be looking out for as far as milestones in a lame duck session potentially in calendar '20? or is that entirely a '21 item?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
no. well, i would say, in terms of seeing or hearing things, it would be a '21 item. a lot of work is going on. a lot of conversations are going on. there'll be a lot of things that are happening between the interested parties, leading up to the beginning of the year, but they wouldn't be that visible. it will basically be a '21 item from, i think, what you're talking about perspective.
dariusz lozny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
next question is from the line of paul patterson. your line is now open.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
hey, good morning.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, paul. how are you?
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
i'm managing. so first of all, on the stp, i know you guys are having discuss and stuff, what would you say are the biggest concerns or topics that are sort of -- that are in front of center people's minds that you're encountering with respect to the stp?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
i think the top concern is always going to be the effect on rates, the effect on customers. so we believe the stp balances that, provides for the ability to use traditional investment to improve reliability and bring in technology without large increases to rates. but certainly, that will always be their focus is can we execute? and will it ultimately have an impact on cost, which we think we're able to show, has been considered upfront and tied in quite nicely.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
okay. and then with respect to the cost, could you maybe remind me what the expected rate trajectory that you guys have with respect to just rates in general that you have in kansas and missouri. what is the -- if i recall, it was kind of 2% or something. am i correct?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yes, cagr of about 2%. that's right.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
okay. and then i guess the second one is sort of a procedural question or sort of a -- there's sort of an unusual thing going on in kansas with the stp and this effort to get elliott as a required party by the industrial customers, i guess, some other people sort of agree with that. and i understand where you guys are completely coming from procedurally, i understand sort of the arguments i've read. and i could completely understand why you guys don't think that's a great idea, the presidential issue, etc. where i'm a little bit confused though would be -- because this is kind of new, at least i can't recall this sort of coming up before ever. what would be the practical -- or would there be a practical impact or something? in other words, if this were -- if the kick -- i assume it hasn't been ruled on yet, at least, i haven't seen anything. i guess my question is, if, in fact, the kick proposal or motion was accepted, what would it practically mean on the ground? would it just be sort of a procedural headache? or would it be -- or is there anything more that we should think about with respect to its potential ramifications?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i would say if you first -- yes, you've read our brief, you understand this is not appropriate. and don't believe it should be approved. practically, if it were -- and i couldn't tell you everything that might come from it. but practically, what i would tell you is it shouldn't have a large effect either. as you read our brief, you would understand that we came to an agreement with a shareholder around how to evaluate issues. but in the end, the fiduciary duties and the work around the stp and the final decisions were all ours, and we made those. we were happy that when we announced the stp that elliott was supported. but to suggest that they've somehow taken some level of responsibility for our fiduciary duty, which seems to be the -- the argument is just simply not true. and if they granted some kind of ability to evaluate that, that's exactly what they'll find. so it's not appropriate. but even if they rule, they wouldn't find anything other than what we've been saying, which is we work with the shareholder holder to evaluate opportunities. but the board and management of this company made the decisions around how to move forward, and we're confident in their outcomes. and that was our job. and we've done it and done it well, i believe.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
okay. great. thanks so much.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer

[operator instructions] next question is from michael lapides. your line is now open.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. and congrats on a great quarter and a lot of progress and change under way this year. just to tell as i'm thinking about the legislative requests or some of the things you're going to see -- i mean, obviously, you guys talk a lot about securitization. but how should we think about other potential ads that could influence or revise, i guess, the rate making process in either kansas or missouri to help produce lag.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
you know, i've got chuck caisley, who's our chief customer officer and leads that area -- why don't i have him talk a few minutes about those options. chuck?
chuck caisley -- senior vice president, marketing, public affairs and chief customer officer
so what i would tell you is, obviously, securitization helps us look at retiring the fossil assets that we have. but as important as securitization i think, is making sure that anything we do does minimize any lag that might be created. and so specifically, we're looking at aspects that would or provisions within legislation that would allow us to have some certainty around the reinvestment of the proceeds as well as smoothing the timing of gaining the proceeds from the securitized assets as well as the reinvestment. so it wouldn't be subject to a situation where you take something out of rate base, but then it's a year or two until you're able to realize the benefit of the reinvestment. and then finally, i think it's just important to remember that in missouri we have to maintain and be able to maintain our finance and service accounting, or pisa authorization.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. but is there anything you can do to help -- i mean, think about both jurisdictions, both jurisdictions still have historical test years, pisa helps, but pisa has caps and pieces, not cash. is there anything you could do that's more or it's limited in the amount of cash rate increases? is there anything you can do legislatively and seek to move from a largely historical test year format for generation and distribution investment in both states? so something that's more -- either has trackers or has the full multiyear forward-looking component to it?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean i think there are multiple potential possibilities, as you suggest there. i think that the real trick will be to find the right combination that is passable in both legislatures. and with respect to securitization, those issues are known, fairly well understood and have significant coalitions built around them. i think when you start talking about what some parties may consider fundamentally altering the historical structure of the regulatory process, you could get into some more pushback, and we're really interested in moving this legislation -- legislative package forward. but again, there are multiple things that have been discussed in the past from performance-based rates to decoupling and things like that, that -- and then various riders and trackers that can be looked at.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and then one last 2020 kind of guidance question there and this is probably for tony. you've recognized very little coli so far, but you maintained the $20 million of coli in your 2020 guidance, where it's what, november, 5th right now. that -- this is a little difficult to ask, i guess, is there something that you've seen that gives you conviction in that $20 million being realized? or is that just kind of your normal annual placeholder from that?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
michael, i think it's just kind of a normal annual placeholder, and there's obviously a couple of things we looked at when we looked at our guidance this year and particularly having three really good quarters behind us. and looking at what we've been able to achieve on our cost savings. and we were just pointing that out as that could be a potential headwind, but we have levers, obviously, that we feel comfortable with to narrow the range now at $2.95 to $3.10.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you, tony. thanks guys. much appreciated.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thanks michael.
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
next question is from durgesh chopra. your line is now open.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good morning, team. thank you for taking my question. just going back to the -- just going back to the stp. so as i understand it, right, and i think you said this in your prepared remarks, no sort of official approval from the two states so how should we -- like what should we be watching for in terms of milestones here, terry and tony, between now and your rate cases and sort of toward the latter of your five-year plan to keep track of things and to sort of ensure that things are moving along from a regulatory perspective?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
well, ok. you said regulatory perspective at the end. so again, we'll be talking to you about our process and execution on the stp, because, again, remember, these dockets are for information, there's no request for approvals, there's no large projects that require approvals. so we'll be updating you on our execution on the capital and the o&m, etc. from a regulatory perspective, i think the big ones are that, obviously, we'll have an irp in the spring that april, missouri will be the first later stp, it'll be working over-the-top of that. there is, i think, january -- late january date now for the missouri staff to file a report. so that's -- that will be worth watching. but again, the report out should be commentary, if you will, or views of the stp, but not a ruling far anything or against anything. so again, as we've said before, this is not typical, maybe, but it does give us the ability to work with parties and have some insight into our plan into the work we're doing. so we think gives us a lot of opportunity to do some groundwork ahead of time so that regulators see exactly what we're doing and get buy-in from that perspective. and if there are some concerns, we'll hear that. but again, i think we feel good about the process that's been discussed and the integration between that and the irp, i think, will work very nice.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. so it's mid- to late next year is when we would hear -- when we would see some commentary from the two state commissions?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
probably more like midyear. yes, probably late summer after the irp, both states have been filed.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
excellent. and then just a quick follow-up on securitization. just can you confirm that in your current five-year plan, right, obviously, that is a huge long-term opportunity. but in the current five-year plan, there's like maybe one or two projects that sort of you would require securitization for? and what are those plants that you would require securitization for?
kevin bryant -- executive vice president, chief operating officer
hey, durgesh, this is kevin. so within the stp, we had -- we've assumed one generic plant retirement of about 500 megawatts. so you can compare that to some of the sizes of the plants within our current mix. but again, it's in the out years of the plan. it's generic. we want to make sure we keep it clean, so we can go through our irp process. and again, it would be one of our smaller units. so the impact from a securitization perspective is pretty modest. we really think about securitization as the potential to accelerate more retirements into the five-year window. so a pretty modest impact on the stp, but doesn't decrease our intensity of pursuing the enabling policy change, as chuck mentioned.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
and remember, we've talked about that our work on even a longer-term t&d perspective, if that got delayed a year or was something that wasn't as timely, we've got the ability to backfill that capex plan with additional work that we already have a vision toward. so it should keep us in a position of having a consistent growth rate that we've talked about through the full five years.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. appreciate the color, guys. thanks so much. and a really strong quarter. good job. thank you.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

next question is from the line of steven fleishman. your line is now open.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, good morning.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, terry. so just -- i guess, first question is just from -- with legislation and focus. i'm curious if there were any changes that occurred politically with the elections in your states this week just to kind of give a framework for that or everything pretty much the same?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yes. nothing material that would affect our discussions. governor in missouri was reelected or elected, i guess, for the first time, governor parsons, and remember the governor in kansas was not up for reelection. other elections went consistent with what we would expect and nothing really surprising.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then going back to the question on the elliott agreement -- standstill agreement ending. have they indicated at all what their intentions are from here in terms of just ownership of the stock or any strategic stuff?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
no. and we talk with shareholders all the time, and we'll continue to be in communication with elliott from to time, i'm sure, but no, nothing specific.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. thank you.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, steve. appreciate it.
operator
next question is from the line of kevin fallon. your line is now open.
kevin fallon -- mcgraw hill -- analyst
hey, good morning. i just wanted to follow-on on the stp. that -- is effectively the process here that there is no formal approval or anything like that at the end. it's just kind of like foreshadowing on how the future rate cases are going to go? or is there a potential to maybe settle something or get some higher level of like prudency determined?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
so -- yes, i mean, if we had not been in a very public discussion around the elliott agreement, then i would suspect, just like back in february -- year-end call, when we announced a shift in additional capital at the conclusion of our stock buyback program, we didn't have a docket. we didn't have a process, and our announcement didn't require approvals. that's no different here. but obviously, as a result of all that, we sit in a process where we have the ability, both through the irp and the stp, to get inputs and then irp requires a filing. to your point, there won't be a prudency asked or a prudency finding in the stp. we don't have any large projects that would require that kind of pre-approval. what we do think, though, to your point is that we will be able to see people's views of the plan as a whole and kind of how that works in the context, again, of cost to our customers. and we think that's a benefit. but we wouldn't see -- we don't believe any kind of pre-approval or prudency determination on the plan given the way it's structured.
kevin fallon -- mcgraw hill -- analyst
that's very helpful. and just a clarification. the review process that the board underwent as part of the elliott process earlier, does that mean that you guys have formally ruled out m&a as a future path to pursue and that the strategic -- or the ftp is the -- not just the preferred, it is the way that you're going to go forward and m&a is off the table? or is it less definitive than that?
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
well, our board of directors and our company will always do our fiduciary duty with regard to any proposal or any process that would provide shareholder value greater than our current plan. having said that, we went through a very deliberate, very exhaustive process back in the summer that's just a few months old, and we're very much committed to our stp, and we're working to execute on that as we speak.
kevin fallon -- mcgraw hill -- analyst
okay. that's very clear. and then just last on kind of an accounting question. it looked like there was a big step-up in other revenues in the quarter, which i just wasn't sure what drove that?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
this is tony. some of that was due to the energy efficiency initiatives that we get compensated for. and then as well as we've had some increased weather-normalized demand. i think that i talked about in the script.
kevin fallon -- mcgraw hill -- analyst
okay.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's mea. mea is the proper acronym in missouri.
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
mea is the acronym, yes.
kevin fallon -- mcgraw hill -- analyst
and there's some offset to that in the o&m line? or is that all just margin to the bottom line?
tony somma -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
on mea, there is offset on the o&m, but there are some performance incentives and throughput incentives that do not have a cost associated with them.
kevin fallon -- mcgraw hill -- analyst
okay. thank you very much. appreciated.
terry bassham -- president and chief executive officer

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the 4th quarter 2020 evergy incorporated earnings conference call. [operator instructions].
i would now like to hand the call over to lori wright. please go ahead.
lori wright -- vice president, corporate planning, investor relations and treasurer
thank you, michelle. good morning everyone and welcome to evergy's 4th quarter call. thank you for joining us this morning. today's discussion will include forward-looking information. slide two and the disclosure in our sec filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations and include additional information on non-gaap financial measures. the release was issued this morning along with today's webcast slides and supplemental financial information for the quarter are available on the main page of our website at investors.evergy.com. on the call today, we have david campbell, evergy's president and chief executive officer and kirk andrews, executive vice president and chief financial officer. other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
i will now turn the call over to david.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lori, and good morning everyone. it is my pleasure to join you on my first earnings call as evergy's ceo. this is an exciting time for our company. we delivered strong financial performance in 2020 and have a tremendous opportunity to maintain the momentum and the company's sustainability transformation plan or stp. before i jump into our results, let me touch on some observations in my new role. as you know, i joined on january 4, just under 2 months ago. acclimating to a new company is quite different in this covid environment. even though i am not able to meet as many people in person as i would like. i still enjoyed engaging with the teams remotely to get up to speed and have enjoyed hosting various introductory meetings with important stakeholders, including our regulators in kansas and missouri, and many of you listening in today. i would forward to building deeper relationships as we move forward.
when i first began discussions with the board about joining the company, i spent time examining the stp and the objectives it aims to achieve. i was attracted by the many value creating opportunities and a strong fit with my skills and industry experience. as ceo, i have been able to gain more visibility into the plan and i believe the value opportunities for both our customers and our shareholders are just beginning to be appreciated by the street. ultimately my role is to optimize the plan and accelerate the pace of execution as possible and appropriate. as we advanced down the path, i'm confident that evergy can become one of the best highest performing all electric utility. an important part of our journey will be our fleet transformation opportunities. customers and communities want reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy. our geographic footprint is ideally suited for wind and well positioned for solar, which allow for a path to transform relatively high cost fossil fuels into modern low cost renewables, all while ensuring reliability. we view this position as a competitive advantage, one that provides a true win-win-win as we think about shareholders, customers, and the environment. our current plan, which is comprised mainly of straightforward highly executable efficiency improvements and utility investment lays the foundation by preparing grid and enabling this compelling fleet transformation thesis over the next decade and beyond.
i have had the opportunity to make my first hire, kirk andrews joined us on monday of this week as our executive vice president and chief financial officer. you will hear from kirk for the first time in a bit. his track record of leadership and execution as a cfo, his relationships and credibility with the capital markets and his wealth of knowledge and experience will be a tremendous value for our team. kirk has been on the evergy board for the past year and played an integral part in the formation of our stp. i am thrilled to have him as a member of the executive team.
today, we're also announcing further support for our company as a result of agreements with bluescape energy partners and elliott management. john wilder who has an outstanding reputation for impact and driving value will join our board as the chair of the finance committee. in addition, senator mary landrieu, former three-term us senator for louisiana and chair of the senate energy committee will join our board and bring a distinctive knowledge and experience in energy and national policy issues. both will help us to execute the stp and enhance our ability to drive industry leading performance across our businesses. bluescape and elliott have also committed to standstill and other customary provisions. i will circle back to those agreements later that we signed today and to our new board members at the conclusion of my remarks.
turning now to slide five. this morning we reported full-year gaap earnings of $2.72 per share compared to $2.79 per share earned in 2019. adjusted earnings per share were $3.10 in 2020 compared to $2.89 per share in the prior year. the ability to overcome the unprecedented challenges of 2020 and deliver at the top end of our adjusted eps guidance range of $2.95 to $3.10 per share is a testament to the disciplined execution of our team. overall, 2020 was a strong year. we achieved 7% year-over-year adjusted eps growth. we reduced adjusted o&m by over $120 million or 10% in 2020 compared to 2019. so for the two full calendar years since creating evergy, we have reduced adjusted o&m over $250 million, nearly 20%, delivering the cost reduction opportunity that our team envisioned and well ahead of our merger commitment. consistent with our guidance, we raised our dividend 6% to an indicated annual rate of $2.14 cents per share. we invested more than $1.5 billion to enhance reliability, customer service, create jobs, and invest in our communities. we implemented pandemic response plans resulting over 2000 employees working from home while those in critical operations functions changed their way of doing business and added extra preventative measures to ensure the continued delivery of safe and reliable power. we waived customer late fees and added payment options to help customers relieve some of the strain caused by the pandemic. we launched our hometown economic recovery program which donated over $2 million from our foundation to help local nonprofits, customers and communities respond to and recover from the covid-19 pandemic.
turning to slide six. as you all know, we recently experienced an extreme sustained cold weather event, the worst our region has seen in decades. as a result, our regional transmission organization, the southwest power pool had to take the unprecedented step of instituting a level 3 energy emergency alert. this required spp participants to execute emergency load shedding power interruptions, which impacted some of our customers. fortunately, most of these customers were not without power for more than a few hours at the longest. we greatly appreciate our customers' patience as we work through these horrendous conditions to coordinate these interruptions in order to prevent a larger, more widespread event. as you can see in the pictures on the slides, our employees experienced those conditions first hand and worked tirelessly to keep the plants and the grid up and running. i cannot thank my colleagues enough for their dedication and commitment and braving the elements to keep the lights on for our customers.
with respect to the financial impact of the extreme weather event from roughly february 13 to february 19th, that evaluation is still ongoing. overall, we were pleased with the performance of our generation fleet. natural gas availability in particular was a challenge and prices reached historic highs. purchased power costs are expected to be higher as well based on initial settlement information from spp received this week. in aggregate across our jurisdictions, we estimate that our cost to procure natural gas and purchase power through the event were approximately $300 million. the purchased power portion of this number is expected to rise, it does not yet include friday, february 19th. more broadly, the purchased power costs will also be subject to ongoing review as part of the settlement process in spp over the next 30 to 45 days. as a general matter, we expect to be able to recover the excess costs associated with the event. the recovery is likely to occur over time to smooth the impact to customers. kansas has already passed an order authorizing the creation of a regulatory asset for incremental costs that we and other utilities incurred during the extreme weather event. with respect to unregulated activities, we have a small power marketing business that historically has earned between 15 million and 30 million annually or less than 1% of our gross margin in a given year. aftercost typically equates from approximately $0.03 to up to $0.07 of earnings per share. activities typically include energy management services, optimizing transmission positions, and small trading positions in a book with a closely monitored and limited [phonetic]var. the expertise and knowledge developed by the group adds value to our asset management activities and stp. during the extreme weather event purchases as a firm transmission and a long position in ercot were the primary drivers of what is expected to be unusually high gross margin from this group. given the settlements are still under way financial analysis is ongoing. overall, the potential impacts are expected to be positive and generate significantly higher results potentially in the range of 3 times higher relative to the high end of what we earn from power marketing in a typical year. we will report on this matter as part of our q1 call.
slide 7 highlights key elements of our investment thesis. this morning we initiated our 2021 earnings guidance with gaap eps of $3.14 to $3.34 per share and our adjusted eps guidance at $3.20 per share to $3.40 per share. this range does not include expected positive impacts from power marketing activities during the week of extreme weather. the $3.30 midpoint for adjusted guidance implies a 7% compound annual growth rate from our 2019 adjusted eps of $2.89. this is in line with the long-term eps growth target of 6% to 8% percent from 2019 to 2024 that we reaffirmed this morning reflecting the consistent progress that we've made in the initial implementation phase of the stp. our eps growth target plus current dividend yield of approximately 4% result in a compelling total shareholder return profile of 10% to 12% competitive with other top-performing utilities.
for the stp to be successful, we need to deliver benefits for all of our key stakeholders. the plan was formulated with precisely that objective in mind as summarized on slide 8. our cost reduction efforts to date have meaningfully benefited customers. evergy's electric rates across kansas and missouri have declined since 2018 while most of our neighboring states have experienced increases over the same time period. the plan adds to this momentum through targeted capital investments and long-term and sustainable cost reductions as well as substantial fuel and purchased power savings. these lower operating cost will be reflected in our upcoming rate cases. the infrastructure investment will also enhance customer experience through better customer tools and systems, while improving reliability by focusing on grid automation, digital communication, and data analytics capabilities that we do not have today. it will also contribute to local economic development efforts by creating jobs to implement grid and renewable generation projects. more broadly, a stronger smarter grid and greener energy will help the overall competitiveness of our region.
slide 9 lays out the capital expenditure plan from 2020 to 2025, including adjustments made as part of this year's planning process. the total amount of projected spend from 2021 to 2024 is unchanged, so there have been some relatively minor phasing and other changes. for example, the total renewable spend remains a roughly $700 million that we are phasing the spend to match up with the publication of the irps and our renewable strategy work this year. in aggregate, these changes have no impact on our view in the company's 2024 earnings power.
lastly, we added our estimates for 2025 in a range of $1.85 to $2.1 billion, reflecting the robust pipeline of projects that we see for the balance of the decade through 2030. we plan to discuss 2025 in greater depth as part of our investor day later this year.
slide 10 profiles what is an increasing area of focus for our company, advancing a continuous improvement culture and achieving high performance for key metrics across our business. as mentioned earlier, we significantly reduced our non-fuel operating and maintenance expenses from 2018 to 2020 and we're targeting another 8% reduction by 2024 resulting in an overall reduction of 25% relative to the 2018 baseline. our reliability performance as measured by saidi and saifi also improved in 2020 in each case by around 5%. i am pleased to report that our safety performance in 2020 with some of the best in our company's history, for example, achieving a 50% improvement in the osha incidence rate relative to 2019. these results are a testament to the continued dedication and commitment of our employees even in the face of the harsh pandemic conditions. we're proud of the strong performance, but we know that we have ongoing room to improve. we will stay laser focused on safety, execution, and the fundamentals of business performance.
slide 11 lays out the significant progress we have made on our carbon reduction efforts. we have achieved a 51% reduction from 2005 levels, which is far ahead of many of our peer utilities. that statistic is often overlooked as is the fact that approximately 55% of the energy that we deliver to our customers is carbon free, which also compares favorably to peers. the stp includes steps to enable the ongoing transition of our generation fleet and progress toward our long-term co2 emissions reduction target. we expect to have attractive investment opportunities in new renewables generation, that diversifies our portfolio and does so cost effectively taking advantage of the ongoing efficiency gains in the cost of building new solar, wind and storage projects. along with investment and economic new renewables, we will also pursue constructive legislation that could facilitate our longer-term fleet transformation. to that end, we have heard some questions around the role of legislation plays in our plan. the securitization bills that we introduced in kansas and missouri this year are not necessary to achieve a plan nor are they critical to pass this year. our 5-year financial forecast is not hinge on the passage of securitization. while the numbers that we present assuming the retirement of coal plant by 2024, that actually contributes to reduction in rate base roughly $350 million.
stepping back securitization as a potential tool that can provide value for customers and the company over time, but it's much more meaningful for a longer-term fleet transformation prospects, which are more likely in the second half of this decade and beyond. that said, it can take time for legislative solutions to be passed, so now is the time to move the conversation forward. in parallel, our current integrated resource plans are irps are well under way with current filing dates of april 1 in missouri and by july 1 in kansas. we are likely to seek a shortfall in missouri in light of the extreme weather event of this month. we have executed the stakeholder engagement process of our irps in both states and appreciate the input received from all of our constituents. while the irp reflects a 20 year plan, really a set of potential 20 year scenarios, we expect that it will provide a helpful roadmap for our future fleet transition advancing the goals of reliability, affordability, and sustainability. later this year we also expect to update our interim and long-term carbon reduction targets either in conjunction with the irp filings or as part of our investor day.
we are going to stay current with the dynamics in washington and how they might impact our generation transition plan. the extension of the renewable tax credits in december, enhancing the competitiveness of wind relative to when we did our initial work in the stp is a good example. these elements will be important as we advance forward with renewables development strategy in the stp. we believe that we will be able to frame a compelling proposition for participating directly in the build out and ownership of renewables. kirk's responsibilities include the leadership of our renewables development efforts, and he will play a central role in ensuring that we are well positioned to do this competitively as well chief operating officer, kevin bryant and the broader team.
before i turn it over to kirk, i will cover slide 12 and discuss the agreements we announced this morning with bluescape and elliott. as i mentioned, when i joined evergy in january, i did so with the firm belief that the stp is the right path forward for our company and our stakeholders. considerable analysis went into developing this plan and meaningful progress is being made on it. we have a strong team across the organization to help ensure we capture the many benefits this plan creates. the addition of john wilder and senator mary landrieu to the board brings valuable experience to help the board to oversee the stp and enhance our ability to achieve top quartile and industry leading performance across the company. john is a proven leader, his track record speaks for itself, while mary brings a wealth of public policy knowledge in areas of critical importance to our company. i look forward to working with the board to implement the plan and ensure that we deliver on its objectives. as you've seen bluescape will also be investing approximately $115 million in evergy and will have the option to purchase additional shares over the next 3 years. this investment represents a clear vote of confidence in evergy, our team, and the value we can achieve through the stp.
in closing, our plan is focused on driving value and benefits for all of our stakeholders. the 2020 results in 2021 guidance that we announced today show strong initial momentum and we are reaffirming the 6% to 8% annual growth trajectory through 2024. over the longer term, we see equally promising opportunities to invest in infrastructure and transform our generation fleet, harnessing the renewables potential in our region. our all-electric utility franchise will also benefit from the tailwinds of electrification across the economy. we look forward to spending more time with you on our investment thesis and strategy at our investor day in the 3rd quarter.
2020 was an unprecedented year with unprecedented challenges and our team kept our eye on the ball to deliver strong results. we look forward to building on that track record through relentless execution of the stp in the years ahead. i will now turn the call over to kirk.
kirkland b. andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks david and good morning everyone. having just begun my new role here as evergy's cfo a few days ago, i'm pleased to have the opportunity to speak with all of you so soon into my tenure. having served on the company's board as well as in the committee which oversaw the creation of our sustainability transformation plan, i was already well aware of the compelling value-creating opportunity that the stp represents for evergy and its stakeholders. as i have known and respected david for many years, i was even more compelled by the company's potential under his leadership. so when he and i began our conversations about my potentially coming in as cfo, the opportunity represented an extremely compelling and natural next step for me. i am very excited to be a part of evergy's bright future in my new role, and i'm really looking forward to being part of the outstanding team here that will help our company realize it's great potential.
on that note, i'm very pleased to share more details about our strong outlook for 2021 but before i do, let me begin the financial review on slide 14 with a review of the 4th quarter results. this morning we reported 4th quarter 2020 gaap earnings of $0.22 per share compared to $0.28 per share in the 4th quarter of 2019. adjusted non-gaap earnings were $0.28 per share compared to $0.32 per share in the same period a year ago. as shown in the chart, eps was driven lower due to reduced gross margin as a result of 2 factors, unfavorable weather and lower weather normalized demand primarily from the continued impact of the covid-19 pandemic. income tax credits were also lower while depreciation expense was higher due to increased infrastructure investment. collectively, these items were partially offset primarily by lower o&m expense as we accelerated our cost reduction efforts.
now on slide 15, i will touch on full-year results. for 2020 gaap earnings were $2.72 per share compared to $2.79 per share in 2019. adjusted earnings in 2020 were $3.10 per share compared to 2019 adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share. our greater than 7% increase in adjusted eps was largely driven by an over 10% reduction in non-fuel o&m as we were able to accelerate some of our cost savings initiatives from the stp to realize those benefits sooner. o&m was also lower due to reduced employee costs stemming from the pandemic, which helped mitigate the gross margin impact of reduced weather normalized demand due to covid-19. lower o&m and reduced share count were partially offset by lower sales, primarily due to unfavorable weather and lower in commercial and industrial sales from pandemic impacts, higher depreciation expense and an increase in interest expense. as i mentioned, we lowered and realized lower gross margin due to lower sales volumes versus 2019 due to two factors which are shown in the first two bars on the left of the chart. first, on weather, we estimate milder weather cost as $0.19 per share when compared to 2019 when weather actually drove higher than normal demand. in 2020, weather cost was only about $0.10 when compared to normal. the second demand driver was the pandemic effect and we estimate full year weather normalized retail sales were driven roughly 2% lower leading to $0.07 per share primarily due to covid-19 compared to the prior year. the decrease of over $120 million in o&m versus 2019, is a true testament to the continuous improvement culture and our intense focus on building on our success and realizing merger savings by turning that discipline to capturing stp benefits more quickly.
our team continues to push the envelope on opportunities to streamline, automate, digitize, and enhance our processes and performance execution. this commitment to continuous improvement and cost, reliability, and customer service will continue to drive tremendous value for all our stakeholders.
turning now to slide 16, we're extremely proud of our success on these key financial objectives in 2020. as david mentioned earlier, we delivered adjusted eps of $3.10, which was at the top end of our guidance range, representing a 7% increase from the prior year, placing us squarely in line with our long-term eps growth rate range of 6% to 8%. we also increased the dividend by 6% last november and maintained our payout in the middle of our 60% to 70% payout range. we delivered year-over-year reduction and adjusted o&m of 10%, which again was at the top end of our target range for o&m reduction. this was partially a result of pulling forward some of our 2021 savings initiatives. as you may recall during 2020, we raised the bar on our target o&m reduction from what was originally 5.8% and we're proud to have achieved the upper end of that higher target range. as a result, we were able to hit the 2021 stride of total o&m of full year sooner than our original stp target.
finally, our credit metrics remain strong and we maintain cfo to debt in the mid-teens at the holding company, at the upper teens at the utilities, both of which are current -- above current credit rating thresholds. we continue to maintain this balance sheet strength and as we execute the stp without relying on additional equity.
finally, turning to slide 17, i would like to provide a bit more detail on our new 2021 guidance including earnings drivers versus 2020. as david mentioned earlier, our 2021 adjusted eps guidance announced this morning is $3.20 to $3.40 per share. the chart provides a walk highlighting the key drivers versus 2020 based on the midpoint of that range or $3.30 per share, which implies a year-over-year earnings growth consistent with our long-term growth target of 6% to 8%. turning to key drivers versus 2020, starting on the demand side, our midpoint guidance is weather normalized implying a reversal of the $0.10 per share impact of milder than normal weather in 2020. beyond this, we are expecting continued gradual rebound in sales and expect weather normalized sales growth of around 2% in 2021. this rebound versus 2020 is due to two factors. first, we brought on a large low-margin industrial customer in missouri west jurisdiction that ramped up throughout last year. a full year of the new load contributes to our improved sales outlook in 2021. second, although we do not expect to return to pre-covid sales levels until the back half of the year, we do expect continued high residential demand. commercial industrial load while still lower than normal, continues to pick up, which when combined with the ongoing higher residential demand leads to higher a more favorable mix if you will despite the lingering covid effects through the first half of the year. this, when combined with more normal demand conditions as covid abates through the second half of the year also helps drive higher expected weather normalized demand versus 2020. after significantly reducing non-fuel o&m over the last few years and pulling forward opportunities last year, we expect o&m to remain relatively flat in 2021, as we have already realized our previous 2021 total o&m objective a year earlier.
we do see some upside levers that can be pulled if we experience lingering covered impacts on sales. importantly, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target of reducing non-fuel o&m by $210 million from 2019 through 2024 and we will continue to seize upon opportunities to capture these savings while remaining ever focused upon never compromising reliability and superior customer service. our planned ferc investments are reflected in our 2021 formula rate updates, which we currently estimate will increase transmission revenue by around 30 million. as expected with the larger capital plan in 2021, we also plan to see higher depreciation expense of around 30 million even when considering the favorable depreciation treatment for pisa qualified projects in missouri. and finally, we've included $20 million of coli proceeds for 2021, which would be about $10 million more than that we received in 2020.
we're very confident in our ability to effectively deploy the capital outlined within our stp while remaining on track with our cost reduction targets to meet our long-term financial objectives. we are pleased to have delivered strong growth in 2020 and we are well positioned to do the same in 2021. our compound annual earnings growth target plus our dividend yield provide a compelling total shareholder return potential that we believe compares very favorably with our peers and i am very excited to be joining such a strong team during such a transformative and exciting time for our company. with that, i will turn it back to dave.

we will now welcome questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners. your line is open.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, shar.
kirkland b. andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
good morning shar.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
so just a couple of questions here, first just on the board appointments and bluescape elliott agreement, i know john mentioned in the press release, just to quote refine and implement the stp for the benefit of all evergy stakeholders. can you just elaborate on what was meant by refine, does that david kind of relate to your prepared remarks around potentially accelerating the pace of execution where appropriate.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
so shar, i am glad to answer that question. the stp is our plan, we think the board appointments today will really just help us to execute that plan and implement the program. i think with any 5-year plan, you're always looking for opportunities to enhance to drive performance, but the stp is our plan, they are really joining to help us execute the plan. kirk, kb and i -- kevin bryant and i, and the whole team will be looking for ways to shape and implement that plan over time, and we've had discussions and some of our meetings on it and there are going be opportunities for further cost savings driving that over time. i think the company has done a tremendous job as shown in 2020 before our arrival of being on a great trajectory of cost reductions. i'm sure we'll continue to focus on that, but we would just emphasize that the board appointments are to help us to implement and execute the stp, which is -- which is our plan and we're very excited about that plan.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. and then just the exercise option for additional share purchases by bluescape over the next few years. is there any constraints or limits on how much can be purchased over that timeframe, sort of that agreed upon price, which i guess is 20% higher than the current valuation levels.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the total size of the [phonetic]warrant brand is just under $4 million, so it could be up to that amount. they are not transferable for exercise and it's, and it's just under $65 a share, 3-year term. and so that's the overall set up for.
kirkland b. andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and the mechanism shar, it's kirk, allows [speech overlap] settle that on the basis of the intrinsic value implied by us by the option at that time. so it's not -- from a dilution standpoint no [phonetic]eru focus on that, it's not the full $3.95 billion. so we've got that mechanism at our disposal.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
okay. that's what i was trying to get. and then just lastly from me david, as the current sort of these winter storm fallouts change the conversations around securitization in missouri and do you think it's going to sort of impact your ability to get legislation done this year. i mean it seems like some of the legislators were focused on it in hearings last week, but it also sounds like from your prepared remarks you may be back in a way from prior language of needing the securitization by '22 to keep the plan on pace.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
i think we think securitization is an important tool. we think that this extreme weather event, it's something that we're all going to -- the whole industry is going to step back and think about what it means. but we still think that this is an important tool, it may reflect it for some of our units is a seasonal operation option or a more limited option going to be important, especially as we think about winter peaks in the winter season. we have to think about how might that even fold into some of our legislative efforts over time. and so i actually think that this event if anything helps to spur interest in the overall topic, so we found good engagement on securitization and the different pros and cons of it as part of the greater awareness of the whole issue as a result of the event. so i don't mean to imply it all that we're backing away from securitization efforts. we think it's an important legislative effort. we're just trying to highlight that as with -- we don't develop a plan that's dependent on new legislation, it is a tool that can help and we actually think the dialog is even more constructive as a result of the difficult events that we've seen this month.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. thank you. and david, kirk congratulations on these appointments and i am sure you guys are not going to miss answering anymore cdr questions in texas. so congrats guys.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
thanks shar.

our next question comes from julien dumoulin-smith with bank of america. your line is open.
dariusz lozny -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, good morning. its dariusz lozny on for julien here, just wanted to ask about your or 6% to 8% long-term eps guidance target, i see you guys are delivering on that in 2021. i was just wondering, now that you've given a look in terms of your 2025 capex, how should we think about that 6% to 8% going forward perhaps moving beyond the 2024 time frame.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. so we reaffirm the growth rate range target for 2019 to 2024. so we -- and there were some questions when i first started around, is as management team coming in and trying to reset or remake the plan. no, the management team is here to help execute the plan and we benefit, in kirk's case, he was around on the board to help develop the plan too. so we are reaffirming the 6% to 8% through 2024. we introduced 2025 capex, but we're not yet speaking to the longer-term range. we're planning to cover that at the investor day. we expect to do that in the third quarter, following our irp filing. so expect to hear more about 2025 and going out on that year at that time. but right now we just want to make sure that everyone hears it clearly from us that we're reaffirming that 6% to 8% target through -- through '24 and we look forward to have an indepth conversation with everyone at our investor day in the 3rd quarter ok.
dariusz lozny -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thank you. one more if i can. and this is on slide 9 of your presentation and apologies if i missed this, but the 2025 capex it looks like there is some latitude to go beyond the $1.85 billion to $2.1 billion. can you just confirm what the -- what that delta represents please.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
sure. and so 5 years out, and we've talked about this. i think in some of our discussions last quarter, we have a very robust pipeline of projects through the balance of the decade. and that's really to signify that as we get closer to '25 that makes sense. of course will firm up that number over time, we've got a strong backlog, so we could see that number being higher but of course we will look at that in the overall balance of considerations and though we could certainly see that capex number trending toward the high end or the midpoint of that range. and it just reflects we have got that strong pipeline and it's also, this is something again that we will be going through in our investor day. but what i've been pleased to see is that we've got a great set of projects ahead of us in the next 4 years but then the balance of the decade we've got a very robust pipeline as well.
dariusz lozny -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. that's all from me. thank you very much.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from michael lapides with goldman sachs. your line is open.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys, congratulations to both of you. welcome to the new role and an exciting time. i have a little bit of a policy question -- public policy question. and david, i'm curious, i know you're in your first rounds of meeting all the key stakeholders in both states, but just curious, given what happens in the events over the last two weeks. do you think there will be incremental concern about shifting even more and more away from solid fuel type generation sources to more intermittent sources for reliability purposes. i know, environmental purposes and clearly cost our key and clearly coal is on the wrong side of the ledger on both environmental and cost, but i just wonder if we're in for somewhat of a paradigm shift, does it mean fewer coal retirements, does it mean more batteries, a bigger mix of gas. how do you think from a policy perspective folks in kansas and missouri going to look at what's happened both there but also south of them and think about kind of what the system should look like long term for reliability.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
so, michael that's a great question and good morning. i would say i'm new to kansas and missouri. so i look forward to engaging that dialog with our key stakeholders here. i think we're all going to learn from the event and in particular what the overall planning for reliability needs to look like for winter, because of the renewables profile matches up extremely well with summer peaks on high correlation with solar generally with on peak times, good ability to charge batteries if we intend to run at night or at the times, the winter can be more of a challenge as we think about it. so it is -- i think about that question and it's going to be a dialog again with our stakeholders. i know for me. i thought about, well, big chunk of what you described is can we replace energy production from fossil and from coal which is higher cost and higher emissions and replace a fair bit of that energy with ongoing renewables, but are we going to need maybe need to think about seasonal operations or other factors especially in peak months where you're still reducing the energy production from fossils and from coal pretty significantly. so you're still getting a displacement, but you're not losing reliability benefits. now, those plants were not designed to be peakers, but at the same time all coal units across the country has significantly increased our flexibility. i think i have certainly seen that in my past experience and having those kind of units available for peak months winter and summer may be a more prominent part of the mix. so you may see -- again this is we're all going to have to have this dialog and evaluate over time, shouldn't react in a long-term business like ours to one week. but i think we may well see where there is maybe less emphasis on retirement and more emphasis on variabilizing cost and keeping existing units that provide very critical support at critical times in the system, so that way i think the discussion might go but what can be important for us is that we participate in that dialog we listen and i look forward to engaging with our key stakeholders in kansas and missouri on that because i think we all saw that when you have sustained outages in the winter and we're very lucky that our -- our outage as well unprecedented were relatively brief, it's that much harder then to [phonetic] assembling those outages because it's so cold that's very detrimental to health and its damage harder to restart things when they are offline with that cold. so much to learn.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i have one follow-on on that when you look at around at the coal fleet, meaning year coal fleet and you look at facilities where given access to gas or existing or potential or their coal units that instead of retiring you might consider just converting into a higher heat rate peaker, we've seen a bunch of that in other parts of the country. i just didn't know if that was a low cost alternative that also might provide emissions benefits.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
that's an insightful question like we have looked at that and we'll continue to. there are a couple of facilities where that could be an option and then there are the balance -- the majority, where the pipeline infrastructure is simply not there and so would require a fair bit more than just converting, but i think that -- that will need to be part of the discussion. now, as we all know it's with the winter weather event what happened is having that inventory in a fuel pile, a coal pile was pretty helpful and gas pretty hard to come by. so the -- that i think is going to need conversion to a more of a gas peaking kind of unit where possible i think should be part of the mix, but i think we also want to think about if it is generally the case in the winter peaks in particular the gas availability can become challenged or more expensive, but we have looked at that, that's an option at a couple of spots but for many of our places you would need a more extensive infrastructure build out that might precluded it being possible.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you, david. much appreciated.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer

our next question comes from paul patterson with glenrock associates. your line is open.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
hey, good morning, how are you doing.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
doing well, good morning, paul.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
on the power marketing, i know you guys are putting it as part of your guidance, but it sounds like it was a positive, but i was wondering if you could -- could, maybe give a flavor as to what you're seeing there and why you're excluding it.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so as i mentioned that's a real small part of our business. it's been in the business for a long time as part of the legacy westar company and we found it to be helpful to have, the regulated utility, we still operate in the market. so having a group with the commercial functions and inside of the markets does help and add value to our asset management activities that are part of our core business, but it's historically been -- been pretty small. and it's, it generally takes long positions and transmission positions and relatively limited trading conditions, but what was unusual about this event is that they had those -- they still only had a relatively small number of physicians and transmission based, but they were long in ercot so with prices being so high for so long in ercot is why even a quite small business with only a couple -- a few small positions generated margins in excess of what's typical. the reason why we've excluded the excess performance during the week is that we don't expect it to recur at that size as this is going to continue to we think to be a very small part of our business, so we're not going to -- yeah, it will be reflected technically in our adjusted eps, but we're going to describe what it is, make it very clear and our guidance of 3.30 that we put out did not include the expected positive impacts from the weeks about. so it's a positive, but it's not something that this business, we expect will continue to be quite modest size. so it's a -- it did happen and it's the reflection of the sustained event that occurred in texas.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
okay. and no, i don't think of it as a big driver but it historically, but just i was just sort of curious as to, and i apologize i gotten just a little bit late. how big -- how big it might have been, if you guys [speech overlap].
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
typically in the business -- so typically the business is about 15 million to 30 million of gross margin annually. so after costs, it's been anywhere from approximately $0.03 to up to $0.07 a share, so small.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
in this quarter, what was, i mean it's not this quarter but for 2020.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so we haven't -- we haven't quantified it yet, the southern ferc still ongoing. what we estimate that the results could be up to 3 times higher than the high end of what we might earn in a typical year.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
okay, awesome. okay, well that's good new. and everything else was answered, so thanks so much.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from charles fishman with morningstar. your line is open.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
good morning. i'm specifically looking at slide 21, transmission investment over the next 5 years, 2021 to '25, it's gone a little over $3 billion. and then i'm going back on funds at the investing side back in january, the previous 5 year '20 to '24 was #1.9 billion, am i comparing apples to apples. in other words on '21, is that all ferc jurisdiction transmission investment so that will be going on.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's not all ferc jurisdictional that's our total transmission. i think you might be doing an apples and oranges.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. that's what i thought, because it's really jump of 1.9 to 3 than i thought, i mean i know it's been strong, but that looks like a long too much.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and we've added '25, but obviously that, that the difference between '20 and '25 is not accounting for the difference when you're too so. and maybe we if you've got a specific slide you're comparing to much follow up with our team and we can, we can cover that because i'm not sure which slide you're looking at, but we can definitely work that with you offline because the plan is that some phasing shifts and some recategorization. but in general '20 to '24, there weren't major changes, some phasing on renewables in particular and then we just added '25 but we have to go through that with you offline.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
but the fact that rate base, if i look at the right side of slide 21, rate base going from 12% to 17%, still a big focus of your investment over the next 5 years.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and that is, that was the case that has indicated in the stp, it will continue.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
okay, great. and let me [technical issues] sitting on that transmission or is there a specific project you're depending on or is it just a lot of little soft and certainly i would think the events over the last couple of weeks are going to make that a hurdle of getting any of that requires approval a little bit easier.
david campbell -- president and chief executive officer
so our plan is not dependent on any single or even several large projects, it is the sum total of a lot of different projects which i think is good in terms of verification. i do think that the importance of transmission was clarified and magnified by the events of last week, because you can have localized issues, you can have plants go down, you can have -- wind not blowing at some places and maybe blowing at others, the resilience of the transmission system and the importance of the transmission system, i think, was absolutely reflected in the events of this -- this past month. but we're not -- our plan is not dependent on any big large projects that are a significant percentage of the overall total. okay. thank you, you're certainly making stp look more compelling and good presentation. thank you. thank you.

there are no further questions, i'd like to turn the call back over to david campbell for any closing remarks.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the first quarter 2021 evergy, inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, ms. lori wright, vice president, corporate planning, investor relations and treasurer. ma'am, the floor is yours.
lori wright -- vice president, corporate planning, investor relations and treasurer
thank you, lauren. good morning, everyone, and welcome to evergy's first quarter call. thank you for joining us this morning. today's discussion will include forward-looking information. slide two and the disclosure in our sec filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations and include additional information on non-gaap financial measures. the releases issued this morning, along with today's webcast slides and supplemental financial information for the quarter are available on the main page of our website at investors.evergy.com. on the call today, we have david campbell, evergy's president and chief executive officer; and kirk andrews, executive vice president and chief financial officer. david will cover our first quarter highlights, our latest regulatory and legislative priorities and our enhanced esg profile. kirk will cover in more detail the first quarter results, the latest on sales and customers and our financial outlook. other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
i will now call -- turn the call over to david.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lori, and good morning, everyone. i'll begin on slide five. evergy delivered strong first quarter results and remains well positioned to meet our objectives for the year. adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.55 compared to $0.41 a year ago. as kirk will describe in his remarks, the increase in adjusted earnings was driven by favorable weather, income tax benefits and higher other income. with a solid start to the year, we are affirming our 2021 adjusted eps guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per share. we are also reaffirming our targeted long-term annual eps growth of 68% from 2019 through 2024. as we discussed during last quarter's call, in february, our region in the southwest power pool experienced the most intense and sustained extreme weather event that we've seen in decades. the february extreme weather event resulted in significantly higher natural gas and purchased power costs net of wholesale revenues, which totaled approximately $340 million. we provide a breakdown of this total amount by utility jurisdiction in our 10-q. of note, this number remains subject to resettlement activity and further review by spp.
we expect to be able to recover substantially all of these costs through multiple potential regulatory mechanisms. in selecting the path forward, we will work with regulators to implement solutions that smooth the impact for our customers. in kansas, the kcc already issued an accounting authority order or aao, which allows for the creation of a regulatory asset to track these incremental costs associated with the weather event. we expect to have resolution to the path and time line for recovery later this year. in missouri, we have filed a notice that we intend to seek aao treatment for the net fuel and purchase power costs incurred through the extreme weather event at missouri west.
we expect to make this aao filing by midyear. securitization legislation is under active review in missouri, and if passed, will provide another potentially beneficial cost recovery approach that will enable both reducing and smoothing the impact of these costs for our customers. as in kansas, we expect to have a clear sense for the recovery path in missouri later this year. as i mentioned during last quarter's call, we have a small power marketing business that historically has earned between $15 million and $30 million in gross margin annually. i also described how this group achieved unusually high gross margins during february's extreme weather event driven by purchases of firm transmission to ercot and a relatively small long position in ercot.
in total, the pre-tax contribution net of costs from power marketing activity during the extreme weather event is approximately $0.41 per share this quarter. given the nonrecurring nature of these results, we have removed this amount net of tax from our adjusted eps. the margin contributions from the business for the periods outside of this weather event will remain in the adjusted numbers, consistent with our past practice in our original 2021 plan. as is also noted on slide five, our nuclear station, wolf creek, is in the midst of its planned refueling outage. the plant has performed very well in recent years and has now completed its third consecutive breaker-to-breaker run between refuelings. a special thanks to the employees of wolf creek for their diligence and consistency in providing such reliable service to our customers. slide six provides an update on some of our key regulatory and legislative initiatives. while we don't have general rate case proceedings on the calendar in 2021, we have had an active start to the year in both areas. i'll start first on the regulatory front. after months of working with stakeholders, we filed our missouri integrated resource plan or irp last friday.
the irp benefited from a collaborative stakeholder process as we evaluated scenarios leading up to this filing. i'll go through some of the high points of the irp on the next slide. our kansas irp filing is due by july 1, although it is likely that we'll file a bit earlier. in parallel with the development of the irps, informational dockets have been under way in both kansas and missouri relating to our sustainability transformation plan or stp. after conducting multiple workshops over the last six months to educate and inform our stakeholders about our strategic plan, these dockets are nearing their conclusion. we appreciate the commissions in both states setting up these new and innovative processes to allow for feedback on our strategic plan. as we've consistently said since announcing the stp last year, the plan is designed to deliver significant cost savings, invest in infrastructure and advance the interest of all key stakeholders with an overall focus on ensuring reliability, affordability and sustainability. we're pleased the overall intervener feedback is consistent with how we've described the goals and objectives of our balanced strategic plan. the expected final step in the missouri procedural schedule is a workshop in early june. in addition, we'll file quarterly reports with the commission if there are any material changes to the stp.
the first such filing would be due on june 1. in kansas, the stp workshop schedule for may 24 is the main remaining step in the schedule. in advance of the workshop, we'll file our response to comments filed in the kansas stp docket. i'll now switch over to our legislative priorities, which have primarily focused on securitization. as it represents a cost-effective option to handle the retirement of assets that are not fully depreciated, securitization is a potential tool that could provide value for customers and the company as we advance our generation fleet transition. as we've noted, the passage of securitization in kansas and missouri is not necessary to enable the execution of our five year plan. however, we have been very pleased with the constructive dialogue that has taken place regarding securitization in this year's legislative sessions in both states.
we greatly appreciate the collaboration from our key stakeholders. on the kansas side, house bill 2072 was passed and became law in april 9, following governor kelly's signature. the bill generally has three parts. the first allows for extraordinary costs and for generation assets that are being retired any remaining undepreciated asset values to be considered for securitization. the second part allows the utility to use the proceeds from the securitized bonds to reinvest into areas such as generation, transmission and distribution or customer programs that enhance the customer experience. lastly, the kansas bill provides a predetermination process for taking generation assets out of service, similar to the process that has been in place in kansas for building new generating assets.
in missouri, consideration of the securitization bill is ongoing. draft bills have passed with strong support in both the missouri house and senate, and we are now in the final phases of the reconciliation process. we are grateful for the engagement and support of legislators and key stakeholders in missouri. while there are many factors that impact the timing and ability to transition from coal generation, not the least of which is grid reliability, obviously, one of the most important questions is affordability. securitization is potentially significant enabling tool through the cost-effective handling of extraordinary costs and undepreciated values. retirement also allows for cost savings for customers due to reduced operating and fuel costs resulting from the shift from coal to renewables. as structured securitization also provides a mechanism to collaborate with our regulators on the process of removing coal from rate base and replacing that rate base with renewables. while there are certainly procedural mechanics to work through, over time, we expect to fully utilize these tools to further advance our goal of keeping rates competitive. the first step will likely take place later this year, with the potential use of the predetermination process for the planned retirement of the lawrence energy center and solar additions in kansas in 2023. slide seven lays out the highlights of our recent missouri irp filing. you've heard us talk about the balanced approach to the stp.
our strategic approach to the irp reflects a similar balance. our integrated resource plan is focused on reliability, affordability and sustainability, delivering to power customers need at a competitive price and with a dramatically improved environmental profile. the irp process involved the evaluation of more than 50 distinct resource plans through a multifaceted review process and extensive stakeholder feedback, resulting in the identification of a preferred plan. evaluation criteria included the ongoing cost of existing generation, commodity price scenarios, the potential costs of environmental compliance and co2 regulation and the cost of alternative resources among other factors. the irp review also took into consideration the evolving mission of our fossil generation plants.
due to market conditions and ongoing growth in renewables, plants that once provided baseload capacity are increasingly required to act more as a backup for wind and solar resources. just to cite a recent example: last week, the southwest power pool set a new record by providing 85% of the total energy needs across the entire 17-state region from renewable resources, primarily wind. and this record won't last long as more than 78 gigawatts of new renewable energy are in the spp generation queue. between now and our next irp triennial filing in 2024, evergy plans to retire the last two units at our lawrence energy center, a nearly 500-megawatt coal facility, in late 2023. we also expect to add 700 megawatts of utility-scale solar, all of which is consistent with our stp. as a result of this retirement and these additions, ongoing depreciation of coal and reinvestment in our transmission and distribution system, we expect that coal as the share of rate base will drop to the low 20s by 2024.
looking further out, we plan to add a total of 4,200 megawatts of renewables by 2032, including 500 megawatts of wind, both in 2025 and 2026. those renewable investments are expected to enable the retirement of coal units at the jeffrey energy center and our la cygne plant, as shown on slide seven. as market conditions evolve, the mission of fossil plants will continue to change. in future years, our coal plants will run for fewer hours as their energy is increasingly displaced by lower-cost renewable resources. at the same time, the reliability challenges caused by the extreme weather of february 2021 demonstrated the value of keeping dispatchable generation with fuel on the ground as part of our plan as opposed to retiring them on a rapid time line.
the phased transition approach in the irp provides evergy with the ability to adjust planned additions and retirements based on evolving market technology and policy dynamics. particularly for the period following the initial three years of the irp, there's no doubt that the plan will continue to change and evolve as we monitor the key inputs that impact alternative resource plans. in summary, the fleet transition outlined in the irp is a win-win-win from reliability, affordability and sustainability perspective. given the phased retirements to maintain reliability, the favorable economics, and sustainable options for our customers from the addition of renewables and the far-reaching environmental benefits of swapping fossil fuels for green resources. slide eight lays out the long-term fleet transition plan and related emissions reduction trajectory.
as a reminder, as of 2020, we reduced our carbon emissions by 51% from 2005 levels, and 1/3 of the power used by retail customers was generated from renewable resources. factoring in our nuclear generation, our customers received more than half their energy from carbon-free resources last year. by 2030, we expect to reduce our carbon emissions by 70% relative to 2005 levels. we're also pleased to announce our goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2020 -- 2045, which is dependent on enabling technology developments and support of energy policies and regulations. these updated co2 emissions-reduction targets aligned with the goals set forth in our stp and advance our focus on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers while maintaining reliability and affordability. as reflected on the left-hand side of slide eight, our fleet profile will dramatically change over the next two decades, significantly reducing our reliance on coal generation while increasing the share of emissions-free resources in equal proportion. our favorable geographic location with ample wind and solar resources will allow us to do this cost effectively, further supported by the ongoing efficiency gains that are expected for the cost of building new renewables and storage.
before i turn it over to kirk, i'll wrap up on slide nine. to summarize our investment thesis, our balanced strategic plan is focused on driving value and benefits for our customers, shareholders and the environment. we've had a strong start in 2021 and remain focused on executing our business plan across each of our utilities. we expect this continued execution will drive our targeted 6% to 8% compound annual eps growth from 2019 through 2024. over the longer term, we anticipate that infrastructure investment requirements in transmission and distribution, in tandem with our generation fleet transition, will enable ongoing growth and deliver sustained benefits for our customers. the dedicated and experienced team we have in place, paired with our diverse qualified board, gives us high confidence in our ability to execute and deliver against our high-performing targets. we look forward to discussing our forward plan and strategy in greater depth during our investor day in september.
i will now turn the call over to kirk.
kirkland b. andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, david, and good morning, everyone. i'll start with the results for the quarter on slide 11. we reported first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $0.55 per share compared to $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2020. as david mentioned earlier, the unusually high margins achieved by our power marketing business during the winter weather event in february contributed approximately $0.41 per share of pre-tax gaap earnings, and we have excluded the after-tax impact of this item from our adjusted eps for the first quarter. remaining adjusted items for the quarter were consistent with our expectations. as shown in the chart from left to right, adjusted eps was driven higher by a number of items as compared to the first quarter of 2020, including favorable weather with an 11% increase in heating degree days versus 2020; weather-normalized demand increase of 1.1% or approximately $0.02 per share, partially offset as expected by a slight increase in o&m driven by planned outages; approximately $6 million primarily from higher-equity afudc; and we realized higher income tax benefits due to increased amortization of excess deferred income taxes or edit; and the timing of tax credit recognition to maintain our projected annual effective tax rate.
this latter item, which represents approximately $0.04 per share, merely reflects a shift in intra-year timing. with higher earnings in the first quarter, we recognized more of our expected annual benefit from tax credits and will thereby recognize less of that benefit over the balance of the year. as i mentioned, heating degree days were higher versus 2020. however, despite the extremely cold february weather, heating degree days for the full quarter were in line with historic levels due to a mild january and march, resulting in little impact from weather compared to normal. thus, the weather impact shown here was largely a result of milder-than-normal weather in the first quarter of 2020. finally, as david mentioned, our various utility subsidiaries incurred higher-than-normal fuel and purchase power costs during the quarter.
however, while evergy incurred the cash impact of these costs during the quarter, substantially all of these costs were deferred. pursuant to both the aao order in kansas and our pending aao filing in missouri, we'll be working with our regulators on constructive solutions to smooth the periodic effect of these extreme weather-related costs for our customers. turning to slide 12, which gives an update on recent sales and customer trends. as i mentioned during the walk for the quarter, weather-normalized retail sales increased 1.1% for the first quarter compared to last year, signaling the continued resiliency we've seen in our service territory.
and as the prior year first quarter was meaningfully less impacted by covid, we expect a relative increase in demand to be more meaningful as we progress through the second quarter and continue to expect approximately 2% weather-normalized demand increase in 2021. as shown on the bottom half of this slide, the 1.1% increase in overall weather-normalized demand resulted from a mix of: 3.2% increase in residential sales, which continue to be driven by the covid stay-at-home effect; industrial sales, which increased 2.9% were primarily driven by a few large customers in kansas that returned to normal load conditions after experiencing planned maintenance outage or covid-related reduced demand in the first quarter of 2020. the favorable residential and industrial sales were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in commercial sales of 1.5%. this covid-driven trend of lower commercial sales will likely linger through the first half of the year, but we continue to expect slow gradual improvement as the fully vaccinated percentage of the population continues to increase and restrictions continue to be lifted. on the right-hand side of the slide, you'll see that we experienced our 40th consecutive quarter of customer growth as total customers increased by 1% compared to the first quarter of 2020.
national unemployment rates peaked last april, and we've seen a steady decline in those rates over the last 12 months. while kansas and missouri exhibited a similar trajectory, peak unemployment in kansas city metro area was less severe versus the nation as a whole and unemployment claims dropped more sharply and fell further in 2021, landing at around 4.2% as of march. this compares favorably and remains below the national average of 6.2%. finally, turning to our 2021 outlook on slide 13. based on the solid first quarter results, combined with our outlook for the balance of the year, we are affirming our adjusted eps guidance range for 2021, which represents a year-over-year eps growth consistent with our long-term target of 6% to 8% from 2019 to 2024. although we have excluded the impact of the power marketing margins realized during the winter weather event from adjusted eps, this item is reflected in our 2021 gaap eps guidance, which has been revised upward consistent with the full year impact.
while substantially all the financial impact from this item is reflected in our first quarter results, we will recognize a small amount of associated expense in each successive quarter over the remainder of the year. we have included in the appendix to our materials this quarter as part of the gaap to non-gaap 2021 eps guidance reconciliation, a walk from our previous gaap guidance to current gaap guidance in addition to the reconciliation to adjusted eps, highlighting the components of the impact of the power marketing margins.
with that, i'll turn it back to you, david.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of julien dumoulin. your line is open.
dariusz lozny -- bofa securities -- analyst
hi good morning. this is dariusz lozny on for julien. i just wanted to ask about your missouri irp. if you anticipate pushback from customer groups that have historically been focused on the trajectory of rates, and specifically two year plan of keeping coal plants open for longer while adding renewables sequentially, just curious how you think about balancing those impacts of obviously shifting to renewables but, at the same time, maintaining a customer build trajectory.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
hi good morning. thanks for the question. we do think that we're -- the irp that we developed in missouri reflects a balanced approach. and it's focused on, as you know, rates and also reliability as well as sustainability. so we've got a paced and phased approach adding renewables. the first retirement we're going to do is our lawrence plant in kansas, and our first solar addition will be -- it's planned to the kansas side as well. and you'll see that we phase in over time. we do expect that you will see ongoing reductions in the amount of energy produced from our coal fleet. that will result in lower fuel and o&m costs as it's energy produced -- renewables resources, obviously, is effectively 0 marginal cost.
so we do think it strikes a good balance. we have got a tremendous base of resources to pull from. so you'll note that we're adding wind. in '25 and '26, we're planning to. there's no better place to add wind in a more cost-effective place to have wind in our jurisdiction. so we think we do strike that balance. one thing that we saw and our constituents saw as well through the winter weather events is that we need to make sure that we balance reliability. so we can further reduce the energy produced from coal, reduce costs in that way but help to maintain reliability with the phased report approach to retirements.
dariusz lozny -- bofa securities -- analyst
great. thank you. and one more, just a housekeeping question, if i could. it looks like the 500 megawatts of wind that are in your irp proposal are not in your capex slide in the latest presentation. just curious, at what point in the irp process do you anticipate gaining enough confidence in order to be able to add that capex in '25?
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
yes. you know, i'm sure that we'll talk about that as part of our analyst day in september, but it's part of the dialogue that we had. you saw that we included a range for '25, and that range was reflective of our baseline transmission/distribution infrastructure. but when we put out that plan, we hadn't yet completed the irp exercise. it's obviously a dialogue that we have. the most certainty in any integrated resource plan is in that first three year implementation period. we even had much discussion about the irp that we filed three years ago, for example. i don't know if many of you all are that familiar with this detail. so we know it's dynamic. nevertheless, it is our expectation that the renewables investments will continue, and we'll talk more about that in our analyst day. but obviously, it's important to go through the process. we haven't yet filed the irp. we still haven't filed the irp in kansas. so we want to make sure we respect the dialogue and the input that we received. and intervening information is important as we saw with the winter weather event. so we'll say more about that at our analyst day. but as a technical matter, we did not include that in the range that we show for '25 in our year-end call.

your next question comes from the line of shar pourreza. your line is open.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hi. good morning guys.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
good morning sir.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
so just a couple of quick ones. obviously, the february storm and kind of the biden administration's goals seem to have a real high interest in transmission. just obviously given evergy's position on a seam and really the proximity of some great wind resources, do you guys see additional opportunities for transmission spend in the near term? or would you even consider partnering with others? and i'm thinking, similar projects like the greenbelt d.c. line. so how are you sort of thinking about that?
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
i think that the transmission dialogue is going to be an important one. we already have a partnership in place on the transmission side with aep, and that's a partnership in which we participated for many years and will continue to. i think there will be incremental opportunities for transmission. and the spp has a process that they go through. so when it relates to rebuilding our lines, we obviously will drive that. and if there are lines where there's potential competitive opportunity that we need to participate in the process, which in our current set we would do in our -- through our partnership. greenbelt is a project that, as you know, has been around for -- gosh, i think it's at least a decade or longer. and it's recently been taken on by invenergy, which is a very capable organization and has got tremendous experience. it's a merchant project, so a different kind of investment. you'd have to make sure that it would work from a rates perspective overall and would work from a regulators perspective. so something that we would continue to evaluate. but obviously, any project of that scale and scope and size, as different as it is, requires a lot of review. but it's -- invenergy is very capable, and it could well be part of the mix going forward. i think as we clarify federal policies and potential carbon regulation, that will help to inform what the path forward is going to be for transmission overall. and so we look forward to continuing to evaluate opportunities in that space.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
got it. in the early september analyst day that the right podium to maybe provide additional visibility?
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
yes. potentially. and we haven't set a specific time line. i don't think we're going to have the analyst day on labor day, but i -- we haven't set the date to september. mid to late in the month, but we'll see.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
got it. got it. and then, david, any sort of color you can share on how bluescape's involvement is driving any change? and any line of sight to incremental impacts that you can maybe discuss from this relationship, i.e. maybe from the generation side and efficiently managing the assets versus prior to the relationship? so what's the incremental things you're seeing from that relationship, i guess?
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
so we -- thank you, shar, for the question. i think we've got a very capable board with a balanced set of experiences. so we added senator mary landrieu and john wilder as part of the changes that were implemented in february. and both of them bring, i think, a significant additional and complementary capabilities: senator landrieu with her national network and experience in washington; and john wilder, obviously, with his vast experience in the space. and both kirk andrews and i have personal experience with john in prior context. john is now chairing our finance committee. i would characterize that john is helping us to implement our sustainability transformation plan along with the other board members and taking a systematic approach to setting high-performance targets in each of the areas of our business. so you cited generation. but i think the discipline that john and the board are seeking for us to show is on driving performance in each part of our business to make sure that we drive benefits for customers, for all our key stakeholders, that we're achieving efficiency gains, that we're achieving reliability improvements and we're driving benefits from our investments. so i think it's a systematic disciplined approach that the board is complementing. i think our team is bringing, but i think the board is further complementing that effort. and we value john's input and experience as we do all our board members, and i think it's been a very -- partnership is off to a great start.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
got it. and then just lastly for me. obviously, we're all watching the ferc roe reforms really closely. maybe just if you could provide a ferc roe sensitivity if we do see those adders get cut.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
so you're talking about the 50 basis points that is under contemplation?
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
correct.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
yes. shar, we estimate that the impact of that is in the range of $0.02 to $0.03 per share in the '23-'24 time frame.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
great. that was it. terrific. and congrats on the regulatory and legislative initiatives. it's terrific. thanks.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer

[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of paul patterson. your line is open.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
hi. good morning guys.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
good morning paul.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
so just some quick questions, the -- just with missouri and the securitization legislation. is there any significant difference between these two competing -- well, i don't know about competing bills, but these two different bills, one in the house, one in the senate, that is of any significance or -- from our perspective?
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
no. paul, they're pretty close. i think it's just the typical process to go through to make sure all the words match, but there are not any material differences. so we're -- i think we're as well positioned as we could be. but in general, the provisions are very similar. and we expect that -- we're optimistic. obviously, we've got to work through the process, but we're optimistic. and either way, we'll know within the next week, but we think we're well positioned.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
okay. great. and then with respect to the -- you guys called out the -- in kansas, the utilities discretion of reinvesting securitization proceeds. and i sort of think of funds being fungible. so i'm just sort of wondering how should we think about that? i mean is there some prudency predetermination? or i guess why are you guys calling that out, i guess? i'm not completely clear as to what the concern was or just if you could elaborate a little bit more on that benefit.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
so paul, i think that's a good question, a good point. i think we were -- it's really more to say that there aren't restrictions as opposed to saying that, that will dictate how the funds are used. we're -- just know that it's not always the case of securitization that there's discretionary of funds. but to your point, broadly, all i was saying is that it's -- there are not restrictions that we do plan to use those proceeds, as you note, in the general purpose. we do have the opportunity for predetermination on plants that we're seeking to retire, just as we do predetermination for new investments. we like that approach because that is a separate matter that allows us to get a read on things before taking action. but to your note, there's nothing special about the flexibility other than its allowed for us.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
okay. and then just in terms of the size of -- the potential size of securitization that we're thinking about, i guess, during the sort of -- maybe during the stp process or whatever you mean, in the next few years or something, how should we think about what the potential -- do you guys have -- or maybe i don't know if you -- maybe you guys are -- haven't come up with one that you want to share, but do we have any idea that you could share with us about what the size of the securitization might be that can come out of this?
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so we'll -- and obviously, if we do a predetermination filing, we have a very good sense for it in advance. but the planned retirement of the lawrence plant in late '23 is about $350 million that would go through the -- we anticipate would go to the application for the securitization as part of that process. so it will be roughly that amount. as i noted in my remarks, through the retirement, through the general transition of our rate base, given relative investment in t&d, we do expect that coal as a share rate base will get down to the low 20s by 2024.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
okay. so just to understand that $350 is sort of what we're thinking about. the lawrence plant -- other than the lawrence plant, we're not thinking of anything else there being securitized, at least at this point?
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
not during the three year implementation phase. as we know that we see, the retirements that are later in the 20s. and obviously, we'll continue to assess timing in the overall plan as market conditions evolve. but we would anticipate, if securitization is an option in both missouri and kansas, that would be used for the future retirements in the irp as well.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. and then in terms of the stp, it looks like you guys got some sort of favorable remarks from staff and what have you, at least, talked about being a little bit of refinement or whatever suggestion. but what's not clear to me, i guess, in the stp process is, is there an eventual sign-off from the commission on that? i mean it's not a -- it's a little bit of a -- not a standard, i guess, proceeding, if you follow up, at least from my perspective. so you've -- when do you expect to have sort of this stp thing wrapped up, i guess, in kansas?
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
so as you know, it's an innovative process, and we appreciate the opportunity that the commissions have provided for us to go through the plan and get -- and receive feedback. but they are informational. there's not a formal sign-up that will result from the proceedings. in terms of the procedural calendar, the next step for us in kansas will be we're going to file responsive comments. i think it's next week. and then we'll have a session on may 24. so it will be an interactive workshop and dialogue. and that's currently the next remaining step in the process, but it could -- obviously, it could be adjusted. but it's informational, and we appreciate the comments. we think that the comments overall reflect that we have a balanced plan. and we've seen that reflected generally in the comments we saw in both missouri and kansas. in missouri, we expect to have a similar sort of wrap-up workshop in early june. again, because they're informational dockets, the time line could evolve, but the current schedule has us wrapping in the late may or early june time frame.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of michael sullivan. your line is open.
michael sullivan -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi guys. good morning.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
good morning mike.
michael sullivan -- wolfe research -- analyst
just a question on the irp. curious, to the extent you guys -- i mean you got a pretty good example of a stress test situation back in february. and was the conclusion there basically we could do without lawrence but we pretty much needed everything else in terms of dispatchable resources and then that kind of factored into the decision to keep the rest of the plants around a little longer?
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
mike, i think that it's fair to say that the review across stp is still an ongoing process, right? the -- i think that we and the entire system have a lot to learn, and the analysis is not yet done. as a technical matter, we have a accredited capacity requirement that we need to meet. and we can -- with the retirement of lawrence, we are within our buffer. so you're right in looking at it that way. and the more we retire, the more we're going to have to look at replacement capacity. but i think it's also fair to say that the event reinforced that a lot of the rules and approaches are geared toward summer peaks and not necessarily toward winter peaks. so the irp exercise is much a balanced one of thinking about, ok, if we are factoring in reliability along with affordability and sustainability, a measured approach to retirements is it makes the most sense because your additions of renewables, particularly wind, but also solar, which is -- is less effective in dealing with winter peaks, you need to factor that in as you're considering how you're going to be ensuring the reliability part of the equation. so it did -- the winter weather event at least factored into the dialogue overall.
but i think it's fair to say that it's going to be an ongoing evaluation and not just in our area. we'll be able to learn across our system and other systems as well. but i think it is certainly fair to say that as we consider the event, we do believe the energy production from coal will continue to decline. and in that way, you will see ongoing benefits for customers, lower o&m and fuel costs. but there will be a reliability benefit of keeping them in the system until you've certainly got sufficient replacements to ensure reliability. so some of that thing is reflected in the plan. but of course, we'll -- the irp is most certain for the three year implementation period. and as market conditions and technology evolves, there's no doubt that we'll continue to look at it. but we think this plan reflects the right balance for now.
michael sullivan -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. yes. i was kind of -- you kind of answered it, but my other question was just going to be how soon could this be -- like can anything change as soon as the analyst day potentially? or i would think that definitely before the next triennial irp? or just how do you think about the cadence of providing further updates on.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
yes. the -- on the irp calendar, there's a -- so file kansas effectively sooner than july one deadline, but there's still a kansas filing, of course. then you give an annual update before the triennial filings. so will the next irp get it update will be in a year's time. then there'll be a formal triennial update in three years. but gosh, i think for everybody, if you look back last year or two years ago or three years ago, there's been a lot of changes to the irps because it's a pretty dynamic environment. so hard to predict the future. i think you're right about the analyst day. i don't expect fundamental changes to the irp per se. but in the next year, two years, three years, i'd be surprised, frankly, there are changes for everyone just because the landscape continues to change, as you know well.

thank you for standing by, and welcome to the second quarter 2021 evergy, inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions].
i would now like to hand the call over to lori wright, vice president, investor relations and treasurer. please go ahead.
lori a. wright -- vice president, corporate planning, investor relations and treasurer
thank you, michelle. good morning, everyone, and welcome to evergy's second quarter call. thank you for joining us this morning. today's discussion will include forward-looking information. slide two and the disclosure in our sec filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations and include additional information on non-gaap financial measures. the releases issued this morning, along with today's webcast slides and supplemental financial information for the quarter are available on the main page of our website at investors.evergy.com.
on the call today, we have david campbell, evergy's president and chief executive officer; and kirk andrews, executive vice president and chief financial officer. david will cover our second quarter highlights, our latest regulatory and legislative priorities and preview our upcoming investor day. kirk will cover in more detail the second quarter results, the latest on sales and customers and our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
i will now turn the call over to david.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lori, and good morning, everyone. i'll begin on slide five. this morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $0.85 per share compared to $0.68 per share a year ago, equal to a 25% increase. on a period-over-period basis, these results were primarily driven by higher transmission margin, an increase in weather-normalized demand, higher other income and income tax benefits. on our prior earnings call, i highlighted that our nuclear plant, wolf creek, had started its planned refueling outage. i'm pleased to report that the wolf creek team completed the outage under budget, continuing the excellent operational performance at the plant. companywide, we've maintained a steady trend of strong cost management as we strengthen our continuous improvement culture.
our team's execution has enabled a solid start to the year, and we are reaffirming our 2021 adjusted eps guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per share. we plan on giving an updated perspective on 2021 performance as part of our investor day next month. this morning, we're also reaffirming our target of compound annual eps growth of 6% to 8% from 2019 through 2024. moving on to slide six, i'll provide a summary of our regulatory and legislative priorities and recent activities. first, with respect to our sustainability transformation plan dockets, we completed the final stp workshops in kansas and missouri, wrapping up the items outlined in both procedural schedules. these dockets will remain open as we continue to file responsive follow-up information.
as i've said before, this constructive process has been beneficial as it has allowed us to educate and inform our stakeholders on our strategic business plan while also providing a channel for receiving constructive feedback from the parties. another policy priority that we have identified is securitization legislation. while passage of this legislation was not critical to the near-term elements of our plan, through hard work with staff and other parties in both states, we are pleased that securitization was passed this year in both kansas and missouri. kansas house bill 2072 was signed into law in april, while missouri house bill 734 was signed by governor parson in early july and becomes law at the end of this month. given the filing deadlines for our long-term resource plan in both states, securitization financing was not considered in the analysis relating to our respective integrated resource plans.
however, having the law in place in both states, we'll factor into our ongoing analysis of the preferred plan for the future evolution of our generation portfolio and the approach that will optimize affordability, reliability and sustainability. securitization is particularly helpful with respect to optimizing the affordability aspect of our ongoing generation fleet transition. along with enabling the cost-effective handling of extraordinary costs and undepreciated values, the securitization law in kansas also includes predetermination features. this will allow us to collaborate with regulators on the topic of removing coal from rate base and replacing it with renewables in advance of implementing any actions. within the next few months, we plan to file for predetermination of our latest plans for the retirement of coal at the lawrence energy center and the upcoming solar edition in kansas.
the missouri legislation shares many features in common, but there are distinguishing elements. for example, in kansas, a predetermination is required before retiring coal with the securitization of financing order. the missouri decisional prudence process is similar to predetermination, though in missouri, it is optional rather than mandatory, and missouri approach contemplates an asset retirement plan that can be broader in nature. the missouri law also refers explicitly to evaluating the retention of coal and rate base for reliability purposes, even if capacity factors remain relatively low, for example, due to such factors as seasonal coal operations or low spp energy prices as more renewables come online. in addition, the missouri legislation provides for a new investment in replacement assets up to an amount equal to the securitized assets.
in both states, these features will help to enable a well-planned and predictable process as we advance our fleet transition. i'll turn now to winter storm uri costs. in kansas, we've been granted authority to defer these costs and we filed an application seeking a recovery in return of storm impacts through fuel adjustment mechanisms starting in april 2022. the net impact for kansas central would result in approximately $115 million of costs recovered from customers over a two-year period. at kansas metro, during winter storm uri, we experienced higher-than-normal off-system sales. these sales exceeded the fuel and purchase power costs during the event. as a result, the increased margin will benefit kansas metro customers by an estimated $35 million, which will be passed through the fuel costs over a one-year period beginning in april 2022.
in missouri, we have requested similar aao deferral treatment for the winter weather costs and expect a commission order on this process later this year. metro customers on the missouri side will receive their allocated portion of the higher off-system sales margins, which we currently estimate is around $25 million in customer benefit, which we have asked to deliver to the fuel adjustment mechanism over a one-year period. conversely, missouri west customers were subject to higher fuel and purchase power costs during their winter weather event. given the amount of these higher costs upon receipt of deferral authority, we intend to utilize the recently signed securitization legislation to request commission approval to securitize the excess costs and recover them over an extended period.
specifically, we expect to request securitization of approximately $295 million with recovery over a fifteen-years period, which would minimize and smooth the impact for our customers. slide seven highlights topics that we expect to cover during our upcoming investor day, which will be held virtually on september 21. at the event, we expect to focus on our strategic business objectives and overall priorities for the business. along with an update on stp execution through 2024, we expect to comment on 2021 and provide a first look at the company's 2022 earnings outlook. we'll describe how evergy is driving operational excellence across our business, including reliability, customer service, generation availability and cost. we'll discuss our capital deployment and infrastructure investment plans.
we'll also profile our ongoing focus on regional rate competitiveness, which is a key priority for our team as it is for our customers and our regulators. our objective as a company is to become recognized for driving operational excellence and delivering excellent service to our customers at regionally competitive rates. we aspire to be clear in our objectives and consistent in our execution so that our regulators, investors and all of our stakeholders know what to expect and know that we will deliver. we will also discuss our long-term growth drivers and objectives, including those relating to our esg profile and generation fleet transition. investor day will give kirk and i, along with our colleagues, a chance to expand on the significant value potential we see at evergy. along these lines, slide eight summarizes evergy's investment thesis.
as an all-electric midwestern utility, well positioned geographically to capitalize on cost-effective renewables options, we strive for consistency in performance and being known for execution and delivering results. customers are at the forefront as affordable and reliable service are paramount objectives. operational excellence is a critical enabler to achieving these objectives, and we are committed to a continuous improvement path in reliability, customer service, transmission and distribution services and fleet operations. stakeholder collaboration and constructive relationships with our regulators and other key partners in kansas and missouri are also foundational. the passage of securitization legislation in both states was a great example of that collaborative process in action, and we look forward to an open constructive dialogue with stakeholders throughout the years ahead.
as we've described, infrastructure improvements are featured in our sustainability transformation plan. investments in grid modernization and the ongoing transformation of our generation fleet will enable us to better leverage technology, improve resiliency and efficiency and help us to optimize across the objectives of affordability, reliability and sustainability. disciplined cost management and rigorous performance benchmarking are necessary complements to our investment program in order to ensure that our service and rates remain cost competitive and affordable. the company has established a strong track record in cost management since the merger, and we see ongoing opportunities to maintain that trajectory.
the final element of our investment thesis that i'll highlight is financial excellence, including a strong balance sheet and an attractive total shareholder return, driven by our targeted 6% to 8% annual eps growth from 2019 through 2024, plus our dividend yield. in summary, we are very excited about the opportunities for our company during this period of change in our industry, and we are committed to the sustained effort that will be required to deliver against our high-performance objectives. we look forward to discussing our strategy and investment thesis in greater depth next month.
i will now turn the call over to kirk.
kirkland b. andrews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, david, and good morning, everyone. i'll start with results for the quarter on slide ten. for the second quarter of 2021, evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $195 million or $0.85 per share compared to $154 million or $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2020. the 25% increase in second quarter adjusted eps was driven by the following items as shown on the chart from left to right. first, although cooling degree days were relatively consistent versus the second quarter of 2020, we saw fewer heating degree days this past quarter resulting in a $0.02 per share unfavorable contribution from weather versus 2020.
this weather variance was more than offset by the following: a 3.4% increase in weather-normalized demand or approximately $0.03 per share; higher transmission revenue drove about $0.05 per share, resulting from our ongoing investments in transmission; o&m expense was approximately $11 million lower or $0.04 per share due to lower bad debt expense during the quarter as collections and aging of receivables improved; other income increased $0.03 per share, driven by a $4 million increase in equity afudc, $5 million of higher investment earnings resulting from unrealized gains on equity investments and $2 million of higher coli proceeds; finally, we realized higher income tax benefits due to increased amortization of excess deferred income taxes, or edit, and the timing of tax credit recognition to maintain our projected annual effective tax rate.
adding to our first quarter results to these numbers, i'll turn next to year-to-date results, which you'll find on slide 11. for the six months ended june 30, 2021, adjusted earnings were $320 million or $1.40 per share compared to $248 million or $1.09 per share for the same period last year. again, moving from left to right, our year-to-date adjusted eps drivers versus 2020 include the following: the colder winter weather during the first quarter more than offset fewer heating degree days in the second quarter leading to $0.05 per share favorable contribution from weather year-to-date versus 2020. as weather overall during the first half of 2020 was near normal, this $0.05 per share also represents the eps contribution versus normal weather.
weather normalized demand increased just over 2% year-to-date, driving approximately $0.05 of eps. as expected, higher transmission revenues helped drive a $0.06 increase versus 2020. year-to-date, we've also realized approximately $0.08 of increased earnings from lower tax expense driven by higher amortization of excess deferred income taxes as well as accelerated timing within the year of tax credit recognition. as you may recall from my remarks during the first quarter, this latter item, primarily resulted from the increase in earnings during the first quarter as our recognition of benefits from tax credits is driven by the shape of pre-tax earnings during the year.
this item represents approximately $0.05 of positive eps year-to-date and is merely the result of this intra-year timing. consequently, we do not expect this $0.05 per share to result in a variance to our full year results. finally, $0.07 of the year-to-date eps increase was the result of higher equity afudc, higher unrealized gains on equity investment and higher coli proceeds. although coli proceeds represent a year-over-year increase versus 2020, where the majority of our earnings from this item came late in the year, our year-to-date contribution from coli in 2021 is nonetheless modestly below expectations. turning to slide 12, i'll provide a brief update on recent sales and customer trends.
weather-normalized retail sales increased 3.4% during the second quarter as compared to last year. this was primarily driven by the partial recovery of the commercial industrial sector from the initial shutdowns from covid-19 in 2020. residential sales decreased compared to last year when extensive lockdowns kept individuals at home. while these shifts indicate a continued trend toward a more normal demand mix, commercial and industrial recovery has been slower than expected while residential demand remains above expectations. year-to-date, weather-normalized demand increased 2.2%. when combined with favorable weather year-to-date, overall sales were in line with our expectations. turning finally to slide 13.
based on our year-to-date results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our adjusted eps guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per share. and as we continue to execute our cost management and rate base investment objectives as part of the stp, we are also reaffirming our long-term compounded annual eps growth target of 6% to 8% from 2019 through 2024. we've had a solid start to the year, but with about half of our annual earnings typically showing up in the third quarter, we will remain focused on execution through the summer, and i look forward to speaking with all of you again during our investor day on september 21.
and with that, i'll turn it back over to david.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
why don't we go ahead and shift to questions. let's open up to q&a.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from michael lapides with goldman sachs.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey guys, thank you for taking my question. i have two, totally unrelated to each other. first, on thinking about the long-term generation plan, i want to make sure i heard you correct that your original plan, your stp did not incorporate securitization.
how does securitization potentially impact the plan? and how do you think about the reliability needs of having solid fuel assets on the system, given just what your region and a large swath of the country over the last six months have experienced?
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
good morning michael, so -- and thank you for your question. that will give me an opportunity to clarify. so the securitization legislation didn't impact our financial plan outlook in 2021 to 2024. so the passage of the law didn't impact the growth rate that we teed up in our objectives during that time period. it has been a long-term objective and we view it as a pretty important enabler beyond that forecast period. so passage of law in both states, we think is going to be a helpful enabler as we work the plan over the coming decades. now we've published our integrated resource plan. and in that, you'll see that the phasing and pacing of coal retirements is one that is relatively -- it's done on a relatively steady basis as opposed to accelerated over a near-term time frame.
we do think that the utilization of coal will increase over time, but part of the factor impacting the phasing or retirement of coal and solid fuel reflects the factors that you identified, which is making sure that we can ensure reliability, the extreme weather that we saw in february and the first rolling outages in spp and then the extreme heat in parts of the country that we've seen. we haven't seen extreme heat in our part of the country that we have seen a couple of resource alerts in spp so far this summer. and obviously, in other parts of the country, it has been extreme and has led to some strains on the grid, all reinforce that making sure we leave an eye on reliability is very important as you work on the -- as you think about the fleet transition, and we think securitization will help. all that said, we updated our emissions reduction targets as part of our last quarter call. as you saw, we've got a 70% reduction by 2030 objective and a net zero target by 2045. so we think we're driving to strike the right balance, and we'll constantly be looking at that to make sure that we're balancing across affordability, reliability and sustainability. hopefully, that gets to your question.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
no, that helps. that helps. that helps a ton. follow-up, o&m has averaged about year-over-year, down about $12 million, $13 million a quarter. kirk, should we assume a similar run rate when we think about the second half of the year? and then the pace of o&m reductions as you enter 2022, do you still see a pretty sizable cost savings opportunity for 2022 and beyond?
kirkland b. andrews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, michael, we do. just as a reminder, when you think about the year-to-date results or year-over-year differences, as i noted, one of those contributing factors, at least this year, we saw some favorability on bad debt expense, which is certainly a positive. overall, our outlook for the year remains unchanged from the indications i gave on the fourth quarter call when we first introduced guidance. one of the key success factors, that having joined the company in 2021 as the cfo, i can take little credit for, but the management team, as you'll recall, was able to deliver a cadence of o&m in 2020, which actually was in line with our 2021 objective. so we -- if you think about it that way, we got a year ahead on our savings pace.
so therefore, our expectation, as a reminder, as i'd indicated when we provided guidance initially was our year-over-year 2020 to 2021 o&m -- total o&m, we expect to be relatively flat, and we're on pace to deliver that. a little bit of intra-year timing is largely the contribution for what we're seeing year-to-date. but we do expect a good, continued cadence of o&m reductions as we move forward into 2021, 2023. going toward that target to be well comfortably below $1 billion a year by the time we get to 2024.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, kirk. so i want to make sure i followed. just for the second half of 2021, you don't expect to see similar savings that you've seen year-over-year relative to the first half of 2021?
kirkland b. andrews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. and that would align with our expectation, which continues to be relatively flat year-over-year overall in o&m.
operator
our next question comes from julien dumoulin-smith of bank of america.
dariusz -- bank of america -- analyst
hey good morning.this is dariusz [phonetic] on for julien. just wanted to ask about the retail customer count that you guys highlighted on one of your slides. it's pretty impressive at over 1% year-to-date. just curious if you could talk a little bit about the composition of that, and perhaps how it compares against your expectations for the year and perhaps how that might look on a prospective basis as well?
kirkland b. andrews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so sure, it's kirk. our customer growth, while it's certainly a good indicator year-over-year, the mix, i can't quote you of that off the top of the head, but largely in line with our expectations. however, as i also indicated, despite the fact we've got an increase in customer account, our overall utilization per customer is down year-over-year.
that's in line with our expectations because we expected the impact of stay-from-home, which was most acute in the second quarter of last year, to abate as people kind of return to work. that level of abatement has been a slower pace, right? so the stay-at-home effect on a utilization perspective, notwithstanding the fact, we did see that nice year-over-year increase in customers has been elevated relative to our expectations.
and that certainly understand we expect that to continue a little longer now that we've got the impact of the delta variant on the stay-at-home. but overall, despite the fact that we're certainly pleased with the overall increase in customer count. as we expected, the utilization rates per customer comparable year-over-year is down again due to that covid effect.
dariusz -- bank of america -- analyst
great, thank you. and one more, if i can. on your 2025 capex, you've had the potential for a $250 million increase in your last couple of slide deck. just curious if you could maybe discuss the puts and takes as far as what is driving or what will drive the decision as far as when to formally include that in the plan?
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
so thanks for the question, and we look -- we're glad to clarify that. so we plan to lay that out as part of our investor day and just be more specific around it. so we work through our annual planning process with our operating team. we also consider, of course, the renewables plans that we have, and we're going to plan on giving you a -- giving the street a more firm view of that as part of our investor day, just rolling forward into the next year.
operator
[operator instructions] there are no further questions. i'd like to turn the call back over to david campbell for your closing remarks.
david a. campbell -- president and chief executive officer
okay. great. so i'll close with a comment on 2021, and sort of implicit in some of the questions we received, just so i'll go ahead and hit at this. as i mentioned, and as kirk noted, we're maintaining our guidance range. there are some items in the first half. and as a general matter, q3 is our biggest quarter -- just some timing onto the first half. q3 is our biggest quarter.
coli has some uncertainty. we'll, of course, continue to model the impact of the pandemic. but all that said, given where we are now, we would be disappointed if our results in 2021 don't end up in the top half for the full year. we'll plan to provide an update on 2021 as part of our analyst day in september, but we're pleased with our solid start, and we appreciate your time with us today, and we wish you a good day. thank you.

thank you for standing by, and welcome to evergy's third quarter earnings call. [operator instructions]. please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions].
i would now like to hand the conference over to your host, vice president, investor relations and treasurer, lori wright. please go ahead.
lori wright -- vice president of corporate planning, investor relations and treasurer
thank you, latif. good morning, everyone, and welcome to evergy's third quarter call. thank you for joining us this morning. today's discussion will include forward-looking information. slide two and the disclosure in our sec filings containing list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations and include additional information on non-gaap financial measures. the release is issued this morning, along with today's webcast slides and supplemental financial information for the quarter are available on the main page of our website at investors.evergy.com.
on the call today, we have david campbell, evergy's president and chief executive officer; and kirk andrews, executive vice president and chief financial officer. david will cover our third quarter highlights, recap our recent investor day and provide an update on our near-term resource plan. kirk will cover in more detail the third quarter results, the latest on sales and customer information and our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
i will now turn the call over to david.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you, lori, and good morning, everyone. i'll begin on slide five of our presentation. this morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.98 per share compared to $1.73 per share a year ago equal to a 14% increase. on a period-over-period basis, these results were driven primarily by favorable weather, higher transmission margin, higher other income and lower income taxes, partially offset by a decline in weather-normalized demand. for year-to-date september 30, adjusted earnings were $3.38 per share compared to $2.82 per share a year ago, equal to a 20% increase. as with the quarter, favorable weather is the most significant driver. with these strong results, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted eps guidance range to $3.50 to $3.60 per share, an increase from $3.20 to $3.40 per share.
i commend and thank our team's ability to execute and focus on providing safe and reliable electric service to our customers throughout the first nine months of the year, notwithstanding the lingering pandemic impacts and a significant winter weather event in february. kirk will detail the drivers of our financial performance that resulted in the upside guidance revision. in addition, we are affirming our 2022 adjusted eps guidance of $3.43 to $3.63 as well as our targeted annual adjusted eps growth target of 6% to 8% through 2025, as we laid out during our investor day. lastly, this morning, we also announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.5725 per share or $2.29 per share on an annualized basis. this increase is consistent with our growth trajectory and reflects our board's confidence in the execution of our plan.
moving on to slide six, i'll provide a brief recap of the business plan highlights from our recent investor day. as part of the event, we rebased and extended our key targets through 2025. our five-year capital investments are estimated to be $10.4 billion through 2025, of which nearly $1.5 billion is for renewables projects. this spending plan drives our projected rate base growth of 5% to 6% annually over that same time period. we also extended our target for cost efficiencies and added nearly $20 million of savings in 2025, increasing our total estimated annual o&m savings from our 2018 base year to $345 million annually in 2025.
this represents more than a 25% overall decline. building on the strong performance and realized cost savings achieved over the last three years, this trajectory implies a 1% to 2% annualized cost productivity gain through the five-year forecast period. the planned beneficial infrastructure investment and additional o&m savings enabled us to extend our top-tier 6% to 8% annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share through 2025. we're able to fund this plan with significant cash flow and modest incremental debt, allowing us to maintain our strong balance sheet and credit metrics with no planned incremental equity through 2025.
lastly, we showcased our strong esg profile, including our significant progress in clean energy and changing our generation mix. in 2020, 50% of our energy was emissions free and we achieved a 51% reduction in evergy's co2 emissions relative to 2005 levels. we stack up well relative to our midwest peers in terms of both clean energy delivered to our customers and reduction in carbon emissions. we have ambitious, but achievable goals as we advance toward our target of net zero carbon by 2045.
slide seven outlines our resource plan through 2026. to further lower energy cost for customers and reduce emissions, we plan to add more than 1,300 megawatts of new renewables split between over 500 megawatts of solar and 800 megawatts of wind through a series of yearly additions. we also plan to retire coal operations at our plant in lawrence, kansas. in september, we initiated a regulatory proceeding in kansas called predetermination, seeking approval in advance for the lawrence coal retirement and for the first 190 megawatts of solar generation. we expect to have an order in this proceeding by mid-2022.
in october, we also issued a request for proposal for 800 megawatts of wind generation projects we have sequenced across 2024 and 2025 for the benefit of kansas and missouri customers. bids are due later this month, and we plan to select a short list of projects before the end of the year. we are targeting having negotiations completed by mid-2022. in parallel, we will continue to evaluate potential opportunities to buy in and repower existing power purchase agreements as initial production tax credits expire.
before handing it over to kirk, i'll wrap up on slide eight, which summarizes the evergy value proposition. the left-hand side of the page covers what we're focused on and how we plan to execute our strategy, which i discussed in depth during our investor day. the core tenets of our strategy are to advance affordability, reliability and sustainability through a relentless focus on our customers, supported by stakeholder and collaboration, sustainable investment and financial and operational excellence. the right-hand side of slide eight features what we believe are particularly attractive and distinctive features for our company.
first, we are an all-electric regulated utility with significant benefits delivered since the merger and further opportunities that we will capture through continuous improvement, performance management and sustained consistent execution. second, we have significant opportunities ahead for the ongoing transition of our generation portfolio. and we can do so cost effectively given that we'll be replacing coal with low-cost renewables, which is a win-win for affordability and sustainability. third, we are geographically advantaged given our proximity to world-class wind resources in kansas. we are well positioned to participate in the renewables and transmission build-out that will occur as part of the national transition to a clean energy economy.
and finally, we are targeting a high-performing 6% to 8% annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share through 2025 at the top rank with our peers. we are very excited about the opportunities for our company, and we are deeply committed to the sustained effort required to deliver against our high performance objectives.
i will now turn the call over to kirk.
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, david, and good morning, everyone. i'll start with results for the quarter on slide 10. for the third quarter of 2021, evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $455 million or $1.98 per share compared to $393 million or $1.73 per share in the third quarter of 2020. the 14% increase in third quarter adjusted eps was driven by the following items as shown on the chart from left to right.
first, there were significantly more cooling degree days this past quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2020, resulting in $0.20 of favorable contribution from weather. adjusting for milder than normal weather experienced in the third quarter of 2020, the third quarter of this year saw $0.13 of eps versus normal weather assumed in our original plan. the strong favorable weather impact this quarter was partially offset by a 1.2% decline in weather-normalized demand or approximately $0.06 per share. higher transmission revenue resulting from our ongoing investments to enhance our transmission infrastructure drove about $0.06 per share.
other income increased $0.04 per share, driven by higher investment earnings from some of our investments in early stage energy solution companies. income tax-related items, which include the impact of kansas income tax rate exemption effective this year and higher amortization of excess deferred income taxes, partially offset by the timing of tax credit recognition to maintain our effective income tax rate for the year drove a net increase of $0.04 per share. and finally, other items, which consist primarily of higher depreciation and amortization and property tax expense as well as the impact of shares issued to bluescape in april were partially offset by lower o&m, which, when combined, represent a net $0.03 decrease.
i'll turn next to year-to-date results, which you'll find on slide 11. for the nine months ended september 30, 2021, adjusted earnings were $775 million or $3.38 per share compared to $642 million or $2.82 per share for the same period last year. again, moving from left to right on the slide, our year-to-date adjusted eps drivers versus 2020 include the following: favorable weather from the first half of the year when combined with the warm weather in the third quarter contributed $0.25 year-to-date. when compared to normal weather assumed in our original 2021 plan, weather was $0.18 favorable. and although weather-normalized demand increased about 1% year-to-date, the margin impact of higher commercial and industrial sales was more than offset by an estimated 2% decline in residential sales, resulting in about $0.01 of lower margin versus the first nine months of 2020.
as expected, higher transmission revenues driven by our ferc transmission investments resulted in a $0.12 increase. other income was also $0.12 higher, driven primarily by an increase in investment earnings due to a realized gain from the monetization of an investment in the first half of the year combined with investment gains in the third quarter as well as higher afudc. the impact from the kansas income tax exemption and higher amortization of excess deferred income taxes contributed $0.11 of favorability year-to-date. and finally, higher depreciation and amortization, property taxes and a slight increase in share count were partially offset by lower o&m and interest expense, leading to a net decrease of $0.03 per share.
turning next to slide 12. i'll provide a brief update on recent sales and customer trends. weather-normalized retail sales decreased 1.2% during the third quarter compared to last year. this was primarily driven by lower residential sales, down 3% compared to last year, with fewer customers working from home compared to 2020. weather normalized commercial sales were up slightly, reflecting the slow, steady return to normal. industrial sales were flat with some puts and takes from multiple sectors. the ford plant in our jurisdiction is still experiencing headwinds from chip shortages, which have slowed down production, and in turn electricity usage.
on the positive side, extensive oil refineries and pipelines in our jurisdictions are seeing a surge in usage as the commodity market was driven higher in demand for their product. the pandemic recovery continues to be slower than we originally planned and year-to-date weather-normalized demand has only increased about 1% compared to our original full year expectations of around 2%. and as i mentioned during our investor day in september, we adjusted our demand expectations for the balance of 2021, as likely due to the impact of the resurgence of covid-19 over the summer, we now expect some of the recovery to more normal demand and mix to take place in 2022.
turning next to slide 13. i'll provide greater details on the drivers of our increased and narrowed guidance range for 2021. starting with our previous guidance range, the left of the slide and moving again from left to right. due to the shift in expected demand recovery from 2021 to 2022, the earnings contribution of weather-normalized sales is about $0.14 per share lower versus our original expectations. however, favorable weather through the first three quarters, which as i mentioned earlier, we estimate contributed $0.18, has more than offset the delay in normalized demand recovery.
the net of these two items is a positive $0.04 in total sales compared to our original plan. continuing across the chart, the remaining positive drivers of our revised guidance include: $0.09 from income tax benefits driven by higher excess deferred income tax amortization, $0.07 from higher afudc and lower interest expense. and finally, our revised guidance includes the impact of the amount by which we expect our nonregulated businesses to exceed our original 2021 plan.
specifically, evergy ventures, the entity through which we make investments in early stage energy solution companies as well as our power marketing business are on track to contribute greater than normal earnings in 2021, partially offset by the timing and phasing of certain costs, resulting in a net increase of $0.05 versus our prior guidance. together, these items lead to our revised 2021 adjusted eps guidance of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. of note, although as i mentioned, our evergy ventures business outperformance is one of our contributing factors to our revised guidance. this outperformance is primarily based on year-to-date results.
in october, an equity investment in which we own a minority state, went public through an acquisition by a special purpose acquisition company, or spac, and evergy received shares in the public company at closing subject to a lockup. as a result, we expect to record an unrealized gain on this investment in the fourth quarter. although this fourth quarter item is not yet reflected in our revised guidance, we expect this impact to be positive. and depending upon the fair value of accounting for the investment, it could cause our results for the year to even exceed our updated guidance range.
however, we consider any potential gain from this investment, which we expect to monetize in 2022 when the lockup expires, the additional nonrecurring earnings for the year relative to our ongoing expectations for this part of our business. lastly, we also recognize our updated 2021 guidance implies a lower fourth quarter compared to last year. so on the right-hand side of the slide, we've included the key drivers which will impact the expected year-over-year fourth quarter results. these drivers include the following: first, given our strong year-to-date and expected earnings, we've made a few changes in the timing and phasing of certain cost items, which are expected to drive about $0.06 per share in the quarter.
second, although we've seen favorable bad debt expense in 2021, largely due to lower write-offs resulting from the extended moratorium on disconnections, which expired in may, we've now begun to see write-offs increase and believe this temporary trend is likely to continue, resulting in the realization of write-offs later in the year than we originally expected. as a result, we expect to make a change in our receivable reserve calculation in the fourth quarter, which will lead to about $0.03 of additional bad debt expense. these two factors combined with other items, including the expiry of certain tax credits in 2021, lead to the implied difference in expected fourth quarter earnings versus 2020.
and finally, turning to our affirmed 2022 adjusted eps guidance on slide 14. we've updated the bridge from our revised 2021 adjusted eps guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 to our 2022 adjusted eps guidance range of $3.43 to $3.63. starting on the left-hand side of the slide with our 2021 guidance, we normalized $0.18 of favorable weather and a roughly $0.05 of earnings primarily from power marketing in evergy ventures. although we expect these businesses to continue to contribute earnings going forward, this adjustment is merely associated with the outperformance in 2021, leaving their expected run rate contribution in our 2022 guidance.
after adjusting for these items, the drivers of our 2022 guidance midpoint are largely unchanged from the walk we provided on investor day and include $0.12 of increased retail demand, about 2/3 of which reflects the realization of more normal demand in 2022, which we originally expected to occur in this year. and this shift is due to the observed delay in returning to normal demand mix due to lingering covid effects in 2021. the remaining portion or about 1/3 of this $0.12 demand impact reflects normal year-over-year load growth in '22.
we expect approximately $0.09 of additional earnings from transmission revenue as we continue to make investments to improve transmission infrastructure. next, additional o&m savings are expected to add around $0.05 as we continue to progress toward tier one cost efficiency and our more robust long-term o&m savings objective, now representing an over 25% reduction in o&m from 2018 to 2025. the remaining drivers include the impact of expiring merger-related bill credits and a slight increase in interest savings and afudc equity, all of which are offset by depreciation expense not yet reflected in rates and $0.01 of other items.
with that, i'll hand the call back to david.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you, kirk. so for everyone on the call, we appreciate your time with us today. and now we'd be happy to take your questions.
",":
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
[operator instructions]. our first question comes from the line of shar pourreza of guggenheim partners. your question please.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
good morning, shar.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
just a couple of questions here, if i may. first, the updated guidance for '21, which obviously even ex weaker weather-normalized demand is somewhat noticeably higher, right? are you including any pull forward of opex from '22? just trying to get a sense on potential flexibility in next year's guide, especially as we're seeing some demand drag continuing into '22 versus your prior expectations?
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
so shar, as kirk mentioned, we do have a series of timing and phasing of operating costs. so that's timing within this year. some of that's pull forwards from the forward plan. we're not adjusting our guidance for 2022. any time you have the opportunity to do prudent management your cost, that you look at that across the forward plan years and it can help with confidence in execution.
but given the size of the numbers, we're not changing our guidance for 2022. but as companies do in this circumstance with some favorable weather, we are certainly looking at how -- and we'll continue to look at how are the pull-forward items or other items that we can address this year. there are limits in what you can do in that range, but as all companies look at that piece. so a chunk of it does relate to timing into year in '21.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. so you have some contingency there to cushion.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
we're not changing our guidance in '22, but we're -- we feel good about our ongoing execution trajectory.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
okay. got it. and then just on the o&m side, obviously, some pretty sizable reductions you're expecting through '25. how do we sort of think about where you're currently guiding versus the overall kind of opportunity set? do you see more to squeeze, especially as you guys are kind of shooting for tier one utility status, and even further looking at asset level transition opportunities. i mean 25% reduction is a lot. i guess the question is, can you do more?
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
so that's a great question, shar. i know we've talked about this in prior calls. i think the company had done a terrific job for kirk's and my arrival coming in this year, a lot of cost savings achieved post merger in '19 and '20, ongoing trajectory of those reductions. and we teed up as part of our investor day, we described how we think there's an ongoing opportunity for 1% to 2% productivity gains. so we think it will be along the lines of executing the plan that we've laid out and then continuing to drive improvements across our business through a systematic process. so i think that, that's how we view our opportunity set is really driving that continuous improvement over time, consistent with what we've laid out in the investor day plan.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. got it. and then just lastly for me, if i may, just on the irp, [indecipherable] you filed earlier this year. we've already seen multiple stakeholder groups make some noise in the kansas docket. staff made some positive and constructive comments. what should we be watching for in the process for the balance of the year across the states. and more importantly, is there any concerns around the irp-related spending opportunities in light of some of the input cost pressures we've seen in the renewable space. i mean, how do you price in these headwinds as we think about future generation opportunities through '26 and beyond? thank you.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
so thanks, shar. on the -- and i'll ask kirk to supplement the commentary. we filed for a predetermination relating to the 190 megawatts of solar. so we'll have the chance to review that spend program and our planned addition as part of a regulatory filing before we advance the process. part of why that program was sized down a little bit in scope from the initial estimates, the 350 megawatts, reflected the overall supply chain environment and the maturity of the solar pipeline in spp relative to the more mature pipeline on the wind side.
so we'll continue to evaluate that. but we like that we have the opportunity to have that dialogue proactively as part of the predetermination process. and we've launched the rfps for wind in 2024 and 2025 as we described. so we'll see where those bids come out. now it's -- we'll see how long the supply chain pressures advance. but i noted that we've got a target for reaching agreements related to the rfps at least for the first year in mid-2022. so we'll have a good sense. we'll have plenty of time to evaluate what we're seeing in the supply chain to make sure that what we're achieving drives our objectives of reliability, affordability and sustainability. so we'll always keep a focus on that.
i think the intervenor comments in the irp proceedings are relatively consistent with what you'd expect, which probably reflects that we're striking a balance in what we're striving to do. and we'll continue to do that, being mindful of the affordability impacts, as you know, of some of the supply chain pressures. that's why we're trying to take a pretty systematic and diligent approach to how we tackle it. kirk, anything you'd add?
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
the only thing i'd add, just building on that last point. i mean, certainly, we're mindful of and not immediately seeing the cost and supply chain pressures, they're affecting across many sectors, including, but not limited to, renewals. part of the reason why we made the slight shift that we did [indecipherable] magnitude of the solar and advancing wind. but beyond that, as we've indicated at our investor day, we're looking at all facets of opportunities.
obviously, david mentioned, we launched recently our rfp. that's our primary focus. but we have some self-development opportunities, the potential around some of those ppas buy-ins and repowerings and given the existing dialogue around the -- some of the aspects of the bill back better framework, which is still a framework, but some of the potential for tax incentives, that can be potential mitigants and help aid affordability to help offset some of that cost pressure for us. so i think we've got a lot of levers and flexibility where that's concern, but we're certainly laser-focused to finding the right blend from an affordability and a reliability standpoint on that on the renewables front.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
appreciate it. that is a great color. thanks, guys.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from julien dumoulin-smith of bank of america. your question please.
dariusz lozny -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is dariusz on for julien. thanks for taking my question. just wanted to --
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
good morning.
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
good morning.
dariusz lozny -- bank of america -- analyst
-- start off thinking about average customer bills as we head into the heating season. obviously, quite a bit of news out there about fuel, volatility and the impact that could have on bills. do you have -- have you quantified sort of your average estimate for how much bill could increase either on a percentage basis or on a dollar per customer basis? and could you perhaps maybe speak to how that compares to your regional neighbors? i know there's fuel mix differences. so i think that might go in your favor, but if you could speak to that, please.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
sure. so it's obviously something we track closely. and we have a much smaller natural gas position than some of our neighbors. i can't comment on where their bill trajectory will go, but i'm sure you've been able to note the relative mix of gas relative to others. we -- about -- in 2020, only about 5% of our fuel and purchased power was natural gas related. so natural gas price movements have not had a significant impact. we do have a relatively sizable amount of coal, so the 40% range, and there has certainly been moving in prb pricing. we've got some protection around that from a hedging perspective over the near term.
if those pricing pressures persist all the way through 2022, then obviously we'll have to see what those impacts are and see what the net impacts are in the wholesale market, of course, as well. we have a very sizable wind portfolio. and that wind portfolio will benefit relatively from higher prices when their fuel prices don't move, of course, on the wind side. so net, we are in a lower general bill season, where our enterprise is summer heavy. so the highest customer bills are typically in the summer. so in the fall, we are rolling into what are typically significantly lower customer bills.
but it's something we're very focused on. again, net relative to those who are more natural gas intensive, they are likely to be facing more intensive fuel costs. but again, it all depends on what their hedge approach is. but on a relative mix basis, we don't have the same exposure to natural gas as others.
dariusz lozny -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. great. thank you for that detail. and just on the predetermination filing in kansas that you referred to in the opening remarks, could we potentially see -- i know you talked about the time frame for when you expect an order, i think you said mid '22. should we expect to see a securitization filing shortly thereafter, assuming you get a favorable order in that predetermination docket?
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so that proceeding includes asking for securitization relating to the retirement of the coal facilities at lawrence since the retirement of lawrence unit four as well as the shared coal handling facilities is relatively modest in size, but we would expect to see securitization relating to that assuming that proceeding goes as planned.
dariusz lozny -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. great. i will leave there. thank you very much.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael sullivan of wolfe research. your question please.
michael sullivan -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, everyone. good morning.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
good morning, michael.
michael sullivan -- wolfe research -- analyst
kirk, i just wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made a little bit ago on the biden build back better plan. if maybe you just want to give a little more color on what some of the changes there could mean for you guys in terms of the wind rfp, the ppa buy-ins and then maybe also direct pay. yes, just how we should be thinking about some of the puts and takes there?
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure, michael. so starting on the wind side, obviously, the prospects of an extension and kind of returning to full power, if you will, on the production tax credit side, that's just -- that is certainly a net positive, both in the context, as i mentioned before, from an affordability standpoint, which we're very focused on. the magnitude of those tax credits and the reliability over a longer period of time, being more robust. i think that's just added benefit in terms of meeting our objectives around affordability. it also speaks to greater flexibility in terms of the cadence and pace and mix of renewable investment.
and as you recall, we sort of pull forward some of our wind investments to take advantage or at least to an account for the existing expiry of the production tax credits, obviously, an extension thereof and an increase thereof would give us greater flexibility where that's concerned. and i think the knock-on effect there, as we mentioned, certainly, the buy-in of ppas is one thing. but combining those ppas with repowerings, and those repowerings are going to be certainly dependent upon taking advantage of those production tax credits. so that gives us a greater tailwind on the latter portion of that two-pronged strategy about that ppa buy-in, combining of repowerings.
the last piece of it, i would say, is on the solar side, where the investment tax credit is concerned, certainly the prospects of direct pay, for example, which is a more efficient way to deal with that itc, which we have to deal with, all in one lump sum, also a benefit on the solar side to us, again, from the affordability standpoint and how that's reflected in rates. so a lot of details to come. there are certain requirements there around that, that we need to see more details on in terms of things like wage fairness and domestic content. but we feel optimistic that both on the solar and wind side, that certainly creates a tailwind for us, both in terms of flexibility and affordability for our customers as we make good on our renewables objectives.
michael sullivan -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. super helpful. and just a follow-up there. any thoughts on potential cash flow or balance sheet impact from things like direct pay?
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
to some extent, yes. i think in terms of the direct pay aspect of things, i mentioned before, obviously, as we reach the middle of the decade, we gain a greater appetite for cash taxes. and obviously, the itc is an offset to that. to the extent to which it becomes direct pay, then that isn't as directly impact on our cash flows. but an increase in the magnitude of the ptcs can help offset. it's just another form through which we can take advantage of that tax appetite. so net-net, again, i'd say that's certainly a positive. maybe it's just a different mix of how we take advantage of our increasing tax appetite once we reach the middle of the decade and thereafter.
michael sullivan -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. and just the last one, kind of small, but on the power marketing benefit that you guys are realizing in '21 that's in the new guide that, that's separate from uri and just any more color on that?
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. yes, that's correct. good question. as you recall, we did have some power marketing margins that we earned during the winter weather event. those remain and have been excluded from our adjusted eps. the upside of the outperformance, as i termed it, is in addition to or above and beyond that item that we had excluded from our adjusted earnings. so we had certain expectations going into the year, and the power marketing business has just exceeded those expectations, again, above and beyond the excluded item there.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
still a small proportion of our total business. but i think our -- if you look across power marketing evergy ventures, transource, prairie wind, altogether, it's even in the revised guidance with a stronger performance, a little under 5% or less than 5% of the earnings.
michael sullivan -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. great. thanks a lot. goody expert.
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you. your mouth to god's ear. thank you.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
okay, moving on from the wake forth. inner-- inner jokes circle. other questions?
operator
our next question comes from michael lapides of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for taking my question. kind of a high level one about the repairing opportunity. can you remind us how many megawatts of wind you have under ppa currently? and how many of those are contracts that are, call it, 10 years old or older?
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure, michael, it's kirk. it's about 3.8 gigawatts in total on -- in terms of our ppa portfolio. and as we had laid out, i think, on the investor day in one of our slides, we kind of showed the roll-off. and we're very focused on the subset of that portion in terms of contracts. those contracts really don't begin expiring until just after the middle of the decade. but our focus here is on the expiry of the ptcs. we've got a little more than 1.2 gigawatts of that or almost 1.3 gigawatts of that, 3.8 gigawatts was ptcs rather, production tax credits, are expiring between now and the middle of the decade.
as those ppa or ptcs expire, we think that's probably the most meaningful subset of those 3.8 gigawatts ppas, that we're focused on in the near term around repowering and buying opportunities. because our counterparties have obviously taken full advantage at that point of all of the ptcs. and i think that's probably the targets that we're looking at, if that helps.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and if you do a buy in a couple of things. first of all, that's not embedded in your capex guidance, so in your rate base guidance. that would be upside to that. and then the second question. lots of those projects have project debt. how would you -- would you just basically take out the project debt or assume -- or most of those on -- have project debt that was an amortizing loan, so you're kind of near the tail end of that debt. i'm just curious about kind of taking a project off the books of a nonregulated developer and put it into a utilities rate base?
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, good question. i think we probably would not look to transfer, obviously, the project debt because it's relatively fully amortized. it would probably be a full buy-in. and so we purchased this on an unlevered basis. and obviously, some of those proceeds would go to -- take out the existing project debt. so they think about it as a pure rate base investment on the ppa buy-in side.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
and michael, your first part of your question, you are correct. none of this is in our current capex guidance. the ppa buying and repowering, we're able to get those negotiated. those would be upside or in addition to our current guidance.
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you, guys. much appreciate it.
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from paul patterson of glenrock associates. your line is open.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
hey, good morning.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
good morning, paul.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
just i apologize, but if we could just go over the investment income and the expectations for 2022. when looking at slide 14, i assume that the investment income -- let me ask you this. so what do you -- and i apologize for not just completely getting this. but in 2021, what is the expected investment income in total? i see it's $0.12 so far to date. but with the spac and everything else that you're talking about, where is it going to sort of come in, in 2021?
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. in 2021, on the power marketing side, we've probably got about $0.05 of total impact from investment income that comes from a couple of sources. some of that is, we, like a lot of other utilities, invest in other funds, energy impact partners is one of those. so some of that is the mark. some of that is, as i mentioned before, earlier in the year, on a direct investment side, we actually had an actual monetization of that, and that's probably the disproportionate share of that through the first half of the year is that monetization event. so it's a combination of those two things. obviously, that contributed to exceeding our expectations on the upside, obviously.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
and i'll just clarify. kirk is absolutely right. he prefaced that and said power marketing, but that's the evergy ventures --
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
oh, evergy ventures that is -- yes. i am sorry.
david campbell -- president, chief executive officer & director
-- investment arm.
kirkland andrews -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
evergy ventures the investment arm. thanks, david. and then if you look forward into 2022 and beyond, as i mentioned before, that $0.05 is outperformance. on an ongoing basis, certainly in our '22 guidance, it's more like a $0.01 or $0.02 -- on the evergy ventures contribution.
paul patterson -- glenrock associates -- analyst
okay. okay. great. okay. and then, the rest of my question have been already answered. so, thanks so much.
