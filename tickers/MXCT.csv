doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
well, thank you, sean, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining maxcyte's fourth quarter and full year earnings call. i'll begin with a discussion of our business and operational highlights during the quarter, followed by a detailed financial review from amanda. we will then open the call for questions. i'm very excited with our team's performance in 2021 as we became a nasdaq-listed company and continued to deliver on all of our financial and strategic objectives in our plan.
maxcyte's platform remains the premier cell engineering technology, supporting the development of advanced cell therapeutics, and we continue to invest in our people and capabilities at a measured but healthy rate. amanda will provide more details during the call, but i note that we generated very strong fourth quarter and full year 2021 results as outlined in the press release published earlier today driven by robust performance in our core cell engineering business to both cell therapy and drug discovery customers. fourth quarter revenues were $10.2 million, up 19% over the fourth quarter of 2020. we saw very strong growth in our core business with growth in revenue to customers in cell therapy of 43% and drug discovery of 32%.
for the full year of 2021, total revenue was $33.9 million, representing growth of 30% compared to 2020. our core instruments and disposables in cell therapy and drug discovery grew 37% in the year, ahead of our historical five-year cagr of approximately 25%. our installed base of instruments, both sold and leased, grew to over 500 by the end of 2021 compared to over 400 at the end of 2020. during the year, we also recognized $2.5 million in pre-commercial clinical milestone revenues from our strategic platform license, or spl, commercial partners.
as we have previously indicated, we take the confidentiality of our partnership agreements very seriously. so we'll be unable to answer any specific questions related to our spl partners and their respective development programs. however, i can say that we are generally excited about the progress our partners have been making in the clinic over the past year. we continue to see additional spl programs enter the clinic and have seen our existing clinical spl portfolio progress in the later stages, including pivotal trials, suggesting we may see our first commercial product as early as 2023.
we are extremely proud to be able to support our partners and their efforts to bring advanced therapeutics to patients. we have continued to see our partners invest in ex vivo cell therapies and expand the scope of their research, including new cell types, modalities, and indications, which, if successful, would be positive for maxcyte over the long term. in addition, our value continues to be further validated by our expanding customer base, including the ongoing success we have had in signing spls, with four new spl agreements in 2021 and one agreement with intima biosciences signed in early 2022. we now have 16 spl partners covering more than 95 programs, of which more than 15% have entered the clinic.
this compares to our last update in january 2021 of 12 spls covering over 75 programs, of which more than 15% have entered the clinic. the total pre-commercial revenue potential from our total spl programs is now greater than $1.2 billion, up from $950 million at the end of 2020. in the near term, we are optimistic about the potential for our spl partners to generate meaningful revenue from both the research and production progress, as well as clinical milestones over the next 12 to 24 months. our partners continue to achieve both scientific and clinical success, particularly in moving their next-generation product candidates into pivotal trials.
we also see the potential for several new ind filings by our existing spl partners for novel ex vivo engineered cell therapies this year. amanda will share more details around the progression of potential pre-commercial milestones that we expect to see over the next few years. with ongoing investment in the ex vivo engineered cell therapy space, we continue to see strengthening of our spl pipeline across a variety of geographies, cell types, approaches, and indications and expect additional spl partnership announcements later this year. the economics of our recent spl partnerships remain comparable to prior partnerships, representative of the value maxcyte brings to the relationships and the customers' commitment to a long-term partnership.
much of our focus in 2021 was investing in the business and refining our strategic plan. one of our investments has been in the vlx instrument, which we released under the expert brand in 2021. after alpha testing the product for several years with select customers and receiving valuable feedback, the vlx has entered the marketplace and we believe will be a disruptive technology in large-scale bioprocessing applications. in 2022, we plan to work with several beta customers on the expert vlx to build applications data that support our expansion into the large-scale bioprocessing market, and we have been encouraged by the interest we have seen from customers participating in the vlx beta testing program.
while the market expansion opportunity for the vlx in the large-scale bioprocessing applications will take time to evolve, we are encouraged by the progress to date and look forward to updating investors on the evolution of the vlx product road map over time. finally, we launched three new processing assemblies for single-use disposables in 2021, which continued to strengthen the core business for the full year and particularly in the fourth quarter. we are also investing in manufacturing and process development as our partners move closer to the commercial launch of therapeutic products. we are on track with our plans to move into a new facility this year, which more than triples our manufacturing space and expands our process development capabilities.
we also continue to further in-source key elements of our manufacturing process, particularly around processing assemblies. additionally, we are investing meaningfully in sales and marketing and made substantial progress in 2021, scaling our commercial organization, including our field scientist team. we are hiring at a strong pace and remain committed to maintaining maxcyte's strong culture of excellence. we are also excited to announce cenk sumen joined us earlier this month as maxcyte's chief scientific officer.
cenk brings deep experience in technology, applications, and platform assessments, the development of commercial partnerships, and leading collaborations to accelerate scientific and technical innovation. as we look more into 2022, we expect maxcyte to continue to grow its team across most areas of the organization, particularly in research development and sales and marketing. in closing, we have had an excellent 2021 as we continue to execute our financial and strategic goals. we are very excited about our opportunity going forward, particularly in the cell therapy market, and believe we are making the right investments to drive growth across the business.
i will now turn the call over to amanda to discuss our financial results. amanda?
amanda murphy -- chief financial officer
thanks, doug, and good afternoon, everyone. focusing on the first quarter, as doug mentioned, we're happy to report we realized record revenue and growth in our core business in the fourth quarter. sales to cell therapy customers in our core business grew a robust 43% over the same quarter last year, while sales to drug discovery customers also grew strong 32%. we saw broad growth across the business with strength in instrument sales to both cell therapy and drug discovery customers, as well as processing assemblies, in part aided by the new processing assembly launches that doug has mentioned earlier.
we did not recognize any spl program-related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021, although we recognized $2.5 million for the full year of 2021. we do appreciate, however, the need to provide more transparency on our program economics near term and long term. so we'll provide more details on that front a bit later in the call. moving down the p&l and looking at the fourth quarter.
gross margin was 88% in the quarter versus 89% over the quarter prior. the decrease in gross margin was driven by the lower spl program-related revenues. excluding those dynamics, gross margin was relatively unchanged. total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $14 million compared to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
as doug mentioned, our current strategy is to continue to make meaningful investments in r&d and sales, and marketing to take advantage of the many opportunities we see to accelerate organic growth over the next few years. the increase year over year was primarily driven by increased headcount across all areas of our business, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation as we outlined in the press release. ultimately, we came into 2022 with a very healthy balance sheet with total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $255 million as of the end of the fourth quarter and no debt. moving to our outlook.
for 2022, as we outlined in our press release, we expect revenue from our core business, which includes sales of instruments and disposables to cell therapy and drug discovery customers, as well as lease revenue to our cell therapy customers, to grow between 22% and 25% over the prior year. as doug mentioned, we remain optimistic about the prospects for our business and believe our spl partners are well capitalized in 2022 and into 2023. in addition, the business momentum we saw in 2021 continued into the first quarter of 2022. that said, we believe we've captured a more prudent outlook in our guidance given the current broader macro environment and ongoing fluctuating covid dynamics.
turning to our spl program economics. as we've discussed in our prior -- previous call and also in discussions with investors and analysts, the timing of our spl revenue recognition is predicated on our customers' clinical and regulatory process and fda decision making, which obviously we have limited visibility into. that said, we do appreciate the need to provide some forward visibility and transparency externally. over the past year, we've seen strong progression in our customer pipeline and an increasing number of potential milestones added into the milestone stack as we add more spl partners.
we expect the timing of milestone revenue to continue to be lumpy over the near-term quarter to quarter as our spl pipeline continues to mature. we do, however, based on current information, expect 2022 spl milestone revenue of approximately $4 million. in addition, to help provide some context on the spl milestone revenue opportunity for maxcyte over the next couple of years, we've added an additional slide where corporate deck, where we wanted to call your attention to, which can be found on our website at www.maxcyte.com. this new slide no.
14 attempts to provide a snapshot of how milestones have trended over the past five years in terms of number and phase and how we expect them to trend through 2024. over the past five years, we've received approximately 20 milestones, which have been comprised of early stage milestones such as ind filing in phase 1, as you would expect. looking forward, however, based on the information we currently have, we see the total potential of approximately 50 milestones pre-commercial, which is almost three times as much we had over the past five years. these milestones are also increasingly related to later-stage development.
we estimate about a quarter of those 50 are pivotal or later, and 40% are phase 1. these numbers are based on our current spl partnerships that don't include any future spl agreements we may sign. as doug mentioned, there are several opportunities in front of maxcyte, and we continue to plan on making necessary investments in r&d and sales and marketing to capitalize on those opportunities. should we expect those investments to increase throughout the year in 2022 as we see the full year impact of headcount added in '21 and continue to invest in those areas in '22.
now i'll turn it back over to doug.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
thanks, amanda. in summary, we remain excited about the opportunity to lead the industry forward as the premier cell engineering platform technology supporting the development of advanced cell-based therapeutics. we were pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year results, as well as set our outlook for 2022. maxcyte remains well-positioned for growth, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead.
i want to take this special opportunity to recognize our entire global team and board for their full commitment to providing unparalleled technology, products, and support to bring the new generation of cell-based products to patients, providing them additional treatment options. with that, latif, i'd like to open this up for q&a.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] please stand by while we compile the q&a roster. our first question comes from jacob johnson of stephens. your line is open.
jacob johnson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, good evening or afternoon. maybe, amanda, following up on the comment you just made about the progression of spls as customers ramp. i guess thinking about it from the core business perspective, can you just frame up what the scale-up for these customers looks like in terms of the number of instruments and the amount of consumables, somebody moving into pivotal kind of needs and what that looks like potentially as they move into commercialization? just kind of what that scale up in kind of the core business looks like from those customers.
amanda murphy -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll take a first stab at that and then turn it over to doug for more comments. i mean we haven't really given that level of context at this point. and obviously, it's variable depending on the approach and indication and all that type of thing.
what we have said, though, is that we've consistently seen the same trend, meaning from a preclinical perspective, we tend to see a lot of usage with our lower-scale processing assemblies because obviously, they're working on optimizing and things like that. and then as you work through the clinical trial process, you tend to see a bit of a dip from a unit perspective because typically the phase 1 trials are smaller. again, depending on the indication, it can be variable there. and then ramp over time as the customers move through the regulatory process into pivotal and beyond.
so we've kind of laid that out, but that's pretty much what we've given at this point. doug, i don't know if you have anything else to add there.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think, you know, there's an algorithm here we're trying to build. and it's still low numbers, jacob. but certainly, auto versus allo, and if it's auto, it's going to -- or both of them is going to be how many manufacturing sites they have, and that would also be driven by how many locations they're running clinical trials.
some of our customers, the partners, use ballroom-type manufacturing processes where other use manufacturing trains. we're seeing also, as customers get more comfortable with our technology and they put products into the clinic, they add more preclinical and nonclinical programs into their own. so we end up with additional product sales for that purpose. so i don't think there's any real clear algorithm we've been able to build.
i think we're still building it. but obviously, they do increase over the course of the relationship with the partner.
jacob johnson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yeah. thanks for that helpful context. and then on the kind of beta testing with vlx, i think there's a wide range of use cases for that instrument from maps, viral vectors, and maybe most interesting, the allogeneic side of things. can you just talk about in those kind of areas where you're seeing the most initial interest, understanding that it's pretty early innings for vlx?
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think it is still pretty early. i think that the one that we're focused on initially would be the map production because i think that there's an immediate need in the marketplace for that broad -- i think it's a broad tam expansion opportunity for the company. and we do quite a bit of that in smaller scale with our stx today.
so it's a natural progression for our company or our partners that want to scale the stx up the larger volumes. i think there's still work that has to be done on the vlx applications. the viral vectors are still biology. i mean one of the reasons we brought -- what cenk joined us was to help kind of across the board and really figure out what sort of use cases we had to ensure we had in place in order to commercialize that in the proper way, the way that maxcyte likes to do that.
and as i think i've mentioned in prior calls, there's quite a bit of work in making sure that this technology, although it's very disruptive, it does require significant pre- and post-electroporation engineering work, that engineering work that has to be done. and that's one of the reasons that we're investing in process development as a company moving into a new facility so that we can better mirror what our beta testers are using the technology for.
jacob johnson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. thanks for taking my question. i'll leave it there.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from julie simmonds of panmure. your line is open.
julie simmonds -- panmure gordon -- analyst
thank you very much. great for the results, guys. just a question following up on the vlx as to whether you have any idea as to what the business model for that is going to look like yet. is this going to be another licensing model? or is it going to be an outright selling of consumables type of model?
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
julie, so, you know, part of the beta testing is to really spend the time testing that model. i think it will vary based on the application and very based on the value we bring to the customer. i think it's fair to say that our mindset around this has been to work closely with partners and understand where the pain points are. and work to solving those and then sharing in that upside with them as we do that.
so i think that same mindset will, i think, will be valuable for the company and our partners, frankly, as they see the long-term opportunities for this technology.
julie simmonds -- panmure gordon -- analyst
excellent. thank you. and just on the expenses side. clearly, you sort of going to step up since your nasdaq ipo, as expected.
i mean how much more on a quarterly basis do we expect that to go up? i mean can we use q4 as a sort of indication as to what it's like going forward? or is the moving to the new site, the continued recruitment, going to mean that we're going to see continual step-up going into 2022 through 2023?
amanda murphy -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll take a first crack at that. i mean, i think, as you mentioned, we see quite a bit of opportunity from an investment perspective in terms of driving further growth in cell therapy. and so we're investing quite a bit in headcount, particularly in r&d and sales and marketing.
so i would expect that to increase just because, obviously, we have hired quite a few people. and then you'll see that full year, as i was saying, the full year impact of that in 2022. and then, in addition, we're continuously hiring as well. so we're not giving specific guidance, so to speak, but that's how i would think about it in terms of investment.
julie simmonds -- panmure gordon -- analyst
lovely. thanks very much. i'll just [inaudible] thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from paul cuddon of numis. your line is open. paul, please make sure your line isn't muted if you're in a speakerphone with your handset.
paul cuddon -- numis securities -- analyst
oh, hi there. [inaudible] sorry. is that working now?
operator
yes, sir.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
yes.
paul cuddon -- numis securities -- analyst
ok, very good. yeah, good to hear from you both, and congratulations on 2021. i was just hoping for a little bit more color on sort of growth within cell therapy in particular. i mean any major differences between drug discovery actually between capital sales, the processing assemblies and the leases? and with over 500 instruments in the installed base now, are you finding customers are sort of managing and happy with the machines they've got? or are you having to get a little bit more support sort of alongside those to keep them running smoothly?
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
i'll answer the last part of that, paul. i mean these instruments are built to last, and there's very little work that has to be done to have them operational. so we really don't have that as an issue. we don't have to really invest much to do that.
i don't -- we can't give specifics, but i will say that the business is performing just really well across the board, leases, product sales, disposables. and every aspect of the business has really been particularly strong.
paul cuddon -- numis securities -- analyst
ok. superb. and in terms of applications, we've seen the importance of your technology for cell therapy. we've spoken about sort of viral vectors and potentially sort of biomanufacturing in the past.
i think this year has seen sort of quite for the last two years, serology has become quite lucrative. there's pseudovirus kind of assays sort of happening within drug discovery. so i'm just wondering whether there's sort of other kind of avenues where you're finding sort of early interest within the expert system that are emerging that could complement where it's historically been very strong?
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
well, i think in two areas i can comment on directly. i mean one is that we're -- there's a lot of work that's being done on identifying new pathways in cells, right, for engineering and new cell types when we did the intima deal, which is a [inaudible] cell. and we're knocking down the cish pathway, which is apparently an important one. so there's a lot of basic research, i think, that's being done or translational research is being done in the cell therapy space.
so we're seeing a lot of interest in that. in the drug discovery side, on the -- not bioprocessing but small molecule drug discovery, there's still quite a bit of early stage work that's being done to identify new ion channels, new ways of creating ipsc cell lines for the identification and screening of targets, for instance. so that's an area that we keep an active part on, but -- so it's across the board. what we want to be careful of, and i think we've talked about before, is we don't want to get pulled into the academic research part of the life sciences business.
we really want to focus our attention on more business-based commercial-directed and clinical-directed and eventually, commercially directed therapeutic development.
paul cuddon -- numis securities -- analyst
ok. excellent. and just finally, on the -- i think i've got slide 12 of the corporate presentation, the example, spl npv. you've got six programs per agreement launching one year: two fail in preclinical, four enter clinical, one reaches commercial.
ok. so i mean that would be sort of a typical sort of example within the cell therapy applications that you're in and the weighted average npv of $85 million. i mean that would be sort of a standard calculation that you've run?
amanda murphy -- chief financial officer
so paul, let me take a first stab. so we did -- so that was part of -- that actually was also in the s-1. and what we were trying to really do there is not give a specific or rather give an example spl. so of course, each individual partnership is different and there's a different number of programs.
so we were trying to give some perspective on if you apply to level of clinical risk through an spl, which roughly averages six programs per partner. but obviously, that in reality varies. and then just thinking through, assuming one gets to commercial and then the others drop out, you can obviously apply whatever clinical risk you feel comfortable with. but we were just trying to provide an example of what each partnership could be worth in terms of pre-commercial milestones, which are actually pretty consistent across the partnerships given they're more related to regulatory timing and events versus the commercial side, which is, i think what you can see from there is that it could be meaningfully higher, but obviously more variable because you're then talking about indications and that type of thing.
we did only use the first five years of theoretical commercial revenue in that analysis for that perspective. but it was just really to give an example of the value potential from a revenue perspective.
paul cuddon -- numis securities -- analyst
yeah. very useful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dan arias of stifel. your line is open.
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi, guys. thank you for the questions. doug or amanda, i wanted to just ask about drug discovery revenues. if i look back the last couple of years, you've been in a pretty tight $7 million to $7.5 million range for a while, but you did step up this year to closer to $8 million or to over $8 million.
and i remember you talking about the vlx system as having a pretty good opportunity in drug discovery. in fact, i think you just mentioned it on this call. so as we think about that, i mean, is it likely that this with the step-up that we're seeing here and with vlx having a nice opportunity in that portion that we could start to see the drug discovery revenue kind of consistently tick higher in the $8 million to $9 million range going forward, maybe not this year as much but 2023?
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
i'll leave amanda to talk about the specific numbers. but as i've been -- as we've been talking for the last couple of years, we've recognized that there's a couple of issues going on. one is that the drug discovery bucket is a huge opportunity for us. and we've been able to show, i think, more value to our customers on the cell therapy side.
so i think that there's a -- there's been more attention being paid to the cell therapy group. we've also had the opportunity, since we had more capital, to really start to expand out our commercial team. and part of that expansion is providing us the ability to go a bit deeper into these drug discovery and bioprocessing partners. i think that, that's what you're seeing as a result of that concerted effort to really rebuild that business from where it was several years ago.
so i'm not sure we're going to land from a numbers perspective. but the folks we're bringing in have -- most recently have come out of that world as well. and so we're trying to really balance the cell therapy opportunity with the bioprocessing opportunity and the drug discovery opportunity. hopefully, that helps.
amanda murphy -- chief financial officer
yeah. and just to add a couple of things. so as you mentioned, we introduced some new processing assemblies, which, i think, benefited the drug discovery part of the business in terms of multi-well pas that sort of help lower the per-transaction cost. i think that's been a driver.
from a vlx perspective, we're, as you mentioned, seeing very strong interest in the beta customer perspective. but again, this is a new market for us in terms of unnecessarily new applications of the -- as we do those with some of them with pharma customers now, but certainly need to build out the use cases and the supporting data for those over time. so i think what we've been saying and continue to say is that we're very excited about the market opportunity there, as doug talked about. but again, this is kind of a longer-term two- to three-year-type revenue driver for the company.
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. i mean i don't want to -- i don't mean to be overly picky on the numbers per se because it's $1 million or so here. but i guess the essence of the question was just do you think that drug discovery -- the trajectory for drug discovery could start to tick up a little bit as you work through some of your new products and as you -- to doug's point on just the opportunity set in front of it such that in a couple of years, maybe you do find that in the double-digit million number? you don't have to endorse the number. i guess i'm just thinking about whether i should start to be a little bit more incrementally positive on where that line goes.
amanda murphy -- chief financial officer
again, we're not giving specific guidance by market. but i think we definitely are encouraged by what we have seen to date in terms of the adoption of some of these new pas, as we mentioned. there is some sort of -- obviously, with the growth -- on the growth side of it, you're -- there's a comparison dynamic. but i think, obviously, we're -- the run rate now that we have is not with the vlx in the large-scale market.
so that's sort of our current business. and the team continues to look at new pas that can help continue to meet customer needs, and i think we saw success there on both sides of the equation this year and this quarter so -- especially this quarter. so i'll just kind of leave it at that.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
yeah. ok. but just one thing i would add to that, dan, is that we -- i think we mentioned that we did see some compression on the drug discovery side because of the pandemic and the inability to really get into some of these bigger companies as they weren't operating at full capacity. and i think you're seeing now the big pharma companies, the big biotech companies are coming back in a big way, and i think that's going to be helpful for that segment.
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah. that is definitely good to hear. ok. and then, amanda, on the gross margin line, is there anything you would call out from a cadence perspective over the course of the year just given the impact that milestones and royalties have there?
amanda murphy -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think, look, outside of the royalty -- the milestones, sorry, dynamics, we're seeing -- it's pretty consistent. it may -- there may be some puts and takes there, but it's been fairly consistent over the past several years. the quarterly cadence at the milestones is really hard to pin down, as you can imagine, just given it's sort of out of our control, right? it's our customers' regulatory timelines and fda decision making, which is pretty hard for us to pin down outside of that.
i think we expect gross margin to be fairly consistent. i don't know, doug, if you have anything to add there, just all else equal with our current business anyways.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
no. i mean the band is pretty tight. if you look at it, it's one or two points, right? so it's -- so i think amanda hit it. i think we're comfortable with kind of that level of gross margin to the business.
and as i also mentioned, i think the milestones are going to help push that gross margin number up a little bit. and as we become more basic in manufacturing, certainly in the earlier days when we're manufacturing more skus, you're going to see some erosion -- a little bit of erosion in the gross margin, but i think they're going to offset each other.
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. very good. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt larew of william blair. please go ahead.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. in terms of the future market opportunity, i think at the time of the nasdaq ipo, you'd characterized an spl pipeline of around 50 and i think growing to somewhere like 130 or 140 over the next five years. just curious if there's been any change to those thoughts.
and then, i guess, part two would be just thoughts around your ability to participate in those opportunities, so more of a competitive question. i know there's been a couple of recent competitor product announcement, and maybe just get your take on that.
amanda murphy -- chief financial officer
well, let me just -- i'll take the first part in terms of the market and how we calculated that and then turn it over to doug. so that slide's in the deck and essentially, it was sort of a point-in-time analysis where we looked at the pipeline and we said it -- obviously, we don't -- from an spl perspective, we partner with companies. so we looked at the pipeline that's in our -- that was in our current market where we're seeing a lot of success, so io and inherited disorders. and we said, ""all right, how many of those should be spl opportunities?"" and that's where we came up with the 50.
we have seen incremental interest outside of those markets -- sorry, indications, so autoimmune as an example. and then when we factored in the forward five-year growth, we made an estimate around the impact of current investment and adoption of nonviral technology. so that was really our take at the time. i think as the -- we're continuously seeing increased complexity, right, in the market in terms of cell type and engineering or how much engineering at the cells companies are doing.
so that would all sort of point to increased adoption of other nonviral or nonviral delivery technologies. i think the other thing i would say there is that we're also seeing interest outside of kind of the u.s. and europe as well. and so that wasn't factored into that analysis.
so we haven't updated that, honestly, since the ipo, but we were just trying to give a perspective. so i would say, if anything, the market is sort of larger at this point. doug, do you want to take the --
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
let me comment on that in the second part of the question, matt. so first off, with strong cell therapy growth, if we're selling or leasing instruments into non-spl customers, that's a good indication of the strengthening of the pipeline of potential spl customers, right? because anyone who's acquiring the technology or licensing technology, they're licensing it for all the attributes that we have and the benefits we provide to our customers. so that's using the baseball analogy because hopefully, we'll start seeing some baseball again, that's the on-deck circle for us. so we want to really make sure we've got a lot of people in the pipeline, a lot of companies in the on-deck circle.
so when they come up for the spl deals, we've got them captured. and so we just continue to focus our attention on capturing these companies at the early stage. in terms of competition, there's a lot of noise out there, but i think that we're not seeing that having an impact on our close rate, frankly. and we've often talked about kind of the four pillars of our offering, which is high performance of the system in terms of efficiencies, the flexibility in terms of being able to use single buffer, for instance, and preloaded library of validated cell-specific products.
i have to mention that, that's becoming a bigger and bigger issue with the cmc issues around fda. the scalability is still key and is -- we stand alone in that aspect. and with vlx, we've actually just extended the game by basically 10 times the stx and the gtx. and then the quality, it's the cgmp, it's single-use disposables, it's the master file.
and all four of those things, we excel in each of those four, and there's no one out there that can touch us any of those four. so we're not going to be complacent, continue to push the envelope, but we're not seeing an impact on the business.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
ok. that's great. and then another year for strong instrument placement. would just be curious if you can give us any sort of color around instrument placement location in terms of cell therapy versus drug discovery or how many of those placements were driven by current customers scaling up their efforts versus new customers adopting the technology.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
yeah. i don't think we can give any guidance on that. i do, though, think that we mentioned in the earnings call earlier that we're seeing an uptake in other geographies, which i think is quite important for the company and i think quite important for the whole industry. so we're seeing the fruits of our labor and setting up beachheads in asian countries and throughout europe.
and the u.s. is starting to pay dividends. it takes time. we're a small company, but i think you're starting to see kind of the flywheel effect as we put -- as we build out our sales and marketing team, we build out our field application scientists.
we're able to solve -- uniquely solve customer problems in locations that we couldn't really touch before we had the capability and capacity and capital to do so, but now we can do that. so i think we're going to see an increase across the board in the performance of the business.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
ok. and then the last one for me in terms of bringing more manufacturing in-house. i guess could you remind us, is the intention that at the conclusion, all pa assembly will be done internally? and how much at that point would still need to be in-sourced in terms of components versus largely assembled internally?
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
well, i think it's always wise to keep a balance of external and internal manufacturing. i think it's always prudent from a manufacturing perspective to have multiple sites, at least be able to rely on multiple sites if you run into an issue with either capacity or something were to happen at the site, right? so i don't see us putting all our eggs in one basket. we're not going to be basic in injection molding, for instance. we think that that's better left for companies that are out there doing that on a daily basis.
but what we're really focused on is making sure we have better control over all the components and better control over the assembly and final preparation of the products for our customers. because what we want to ensure there's obviously some commonality among these different disposables, and we want to control them and we'll be able to control better the mix of finished goods based on the ability to leverage certain individual components. and so i think it's going to help us to build inventories, become more flexible. and as our customers move toward commercialization, i think it's going to be even more important that we've got excess capacity in our manufacturing capabilities to support them.
as you know, in the therapeutics business, there can be rather significant variations in terms of demand for these products, and we want to make sure that we're able to support that.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
great. thanks, doug.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
thanks, matt.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from max masucci of cowen and company. your question, please.
max masucci -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. congrats on the continued momentum in the business. first one, the fda released some new draft car-t product development guidance last week. it covers a range of topics, the ideal time to implement manufacturing changes, call to action for better monitoring of critical-quality attributes but -- it's a comprehensive draft guidance, but from a bird's eye view, doug, it would be great to hear your perspective, if you've had a chance to review it just in the context of your spl business and your non-spl core business.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
well, sure. well, you know, a lot of that guidance is focused on cmc and manufacturing control, right? and so there's also -- there's been some comments about the ability to use information around certain manufacturing processes that could be eventually used for cross-referencing for a bla, for instance. so i think that puts favorably for maxcyte. i think -- there's also, i think, more interest in ensuring that the consistency of each of these processes is important and that, again, you can manufacture the same product on the same instrument from one run to another and then from one instrument to another instrument and from one location to another location.
and i think we've been working for the last couple of decades to make sure that we can do that. and so our sense is that we've -- this is a welcome validation of what we've been really focusing our attention on over the last at least decade to ensure that we can provide our partners with what they need to move all the way -- into the clinic all the way through the clinic with our master file. i think we mentioned we now have over 40 clinical trials associated with it. so we feel like we're in the right -- we're doing the right stuff.
we think also that guidance provides us with additional opportunities to build the business because what we've learned -- i think we've learned with our partners that consistency and product characterization are important. and i think our company is really set up to look at new potential technologies and new potential solutions to these problems. as partners move closer to commercialization -- and again, we're working with, as you recognized, with some of the leaders in the commercialization of cell therapy. so i think we've been kind of an inside view of what's really important.
so our sense is that guidance was -- is a good validation. there's a really important interface between industry and fda, whether that be through bio and/or through arm or isct. and maxcyte is actively involved in all those organizations to ensure that we can help to provide the standardization for the industry. so that's an investment that we quietly make and spend time, ensuring that the industry is well supported by technology providers at maxcyte.
max masucci -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's great. maybe just a little follow-up there. it seems like the fda is nudging car-t developers to at least attempt to lock down manufacturing methods a bit earlier in development. so just curious if that would be that nudge or that urge from the fda would be -- could spur a tailwind for some gmp-grade closed platforms or gmp-grade pas in the core razor-razorblade business.
and the pa portfolio is -- it's continuing to expand and round out and you do have, i believe, the three processing assemblies are being sold to both research and gmp customers. so it would be great to hear if you're seeing that shift to gmp products occurring earlier in the process and if that could be a tailwind.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think, you know, our view with our customers have been get involved with us early because we can provide you the same platform, the same product, the same electroporation settings, all the way through for ind-enabling studies, all the way through scalability, all the way through to commercialization. and so i think that does play well. i think we've been at the -- let's say, the forefront.
but i think we've recognized the need and the opportunity, and i think we've seized it. so i think we're in pretty good shape.
max masucci -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. appreciate it.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
thanks, max.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of mark massaro of btig. please go ahead.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for the question, and congrats on the strong end to the year. i guess your business is nice and stable. you signed four spls in 2021, one here in '22. i think at the time of the ipo, you talked about a goal of signing three or four spls per year.
are you still confident you can sign three or four this year? and i guess what i'm really trying to get at is just your comfort level in your funnel near term.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
well, the funnel has never been stronger. it continues to strengthen. i think that's evidenced by the strong quarterly quarter-over-quarter growth in cell therapy. again, that builds pipeline for the spls.
we don't control the spls, obviously. that's something that we have to do with a partnership. but we see no reason why the dynamics are changing in a negative way for us. i don't think we've provided any further guidance on what '22 will bring, although i think our track record has been pretty consistent.
and i think we've been able to sign three, four, five a year over the last several years, and that's something that we continue to work toward.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
ok. great. and -- yeah, go ahead, amanda.
amanda murphy -- chief financial officer
i was just going to add just one quick comment there. obviously, these are negotiations and contracts that are long term, of course. so it's sort of hard. again, you're putting -- not you, but putting december to a december time frame is difficult, right? but to doug's point, we have an ever-increasing pipeline, which i think has been driven by a lot of things, especially just the clinical support that we continue to build with the master file and that type of thing.
so just to reiterate that point. and i -- we can go through the numbers off-line in terms of historical signings. but again, we still have the same comment around the pipeline being really strong and building. so --
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
ok. yeah, that's encouraging. i guess, as analysts, we see that there's been a little bit of a shift in capital market dynamics in the last several months. some of your customers admittedly are start-ups.
so would just be curious to ask about access to cash, access to capital, and whether or not you're seeing any softer demand from some of your customers as it relates to maybe some customers trying to preserve capital.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
well, i think, you know, what they're working on with us is probably central to what their business model is all about, right? i mean -- right? so if they're working on a product that's in -- going toward a pivotal, they're probably not going to be backing away from that from an investment perspective. so we're -- we obviously track the cash that our partners have. but we're not seeing any softening in demand based on their cash needs or their cash end dates. we do pay attention to that, of course.
amanda murphy -- chief financial officer
and another thing, just to kind of wrap up both of your questions, we're also not seeing any change in the economics as it relates to the partnerships. so as you said, they've been fairly consistent in terms of the pre-commercial sales retainment structure. so just to kind of tie both your questions together, we're not seeing any change there either.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
yeah. ok. that's great. and then if i can ask one last one.
you've talked about the vlx really being additive into new indications like monoclonal antibodies and viral vector production. so i think you've addressed this before, but is it safe to say that you're not expecting customers to return atx, stx, gtx in exchange for the vlx? so any comments about that? and i know it's early days now, but curious if you could just speak to that over the next year or two.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
i don't see this as cannibalizing any of those products. in fact, i think it's just going to be the opposite. when you talk to these customers in bioprocessing, the vlx is actually a scaling down of their process to some extent. they're working in thousand, a few thousand legal bioreactors that are scaling down.
and as they scale down, they'll want to have even more flexibility at the lower end to do their design and experiment. so i -- we're -- at least my optimistic view, my pragmatic optimistic view is we're going to not see cannibalization. we're actually going to see more opportunities because now these companies will be able to convince the process development folks on the larger-scale side that they can move from the stx or the vlx. and that will, i think, open up, frankly, new opportunities for the stx and the gtx in these companies because there'll be more products that they can develop knowing now that they can scale up even further with the vlx, if that makes sense.
mark massaro -- btig -- analyst
yeah. that makes perfect sense. all right. thanks, guys.
doug doerfler -- chief executive officer
thank you all. and i just -- thank you again for all of your participation in today's call and your interest in maxcyte. great questions, and i look forward to talking to you all individually. thank you very much.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the maxcyte first quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, sean menarguez, director, investor relations. please go ahead.
sean menarguez -- director of investor relations
good afternoon, everyone. my name is sean menarguez, and i'm the director of investor relations here at maxcyte. thank you all for participating in today's conference call. on the call from maxcyte, we have doug doerfler, president and chief executive officer; and ron holtz, interim chief financial officer.
earlier today, maxcyte released financial results for the first quarter ended march 31st, 2022. a copy of the press release is available on the company's website. before we begin, i need to read the following statement. statements or comments made during this call may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.
any statements contained in this call that relate to expectations or predictions of future events, results, or performance are forward-looking statements. actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our sec filings. the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise. and with that, i will turn the call over to doug. 
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, sean, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining maxcyte's first quarter earnings call. i'll begin with a discussion of our business and operational headlines during the quarter, and follow that -- a detailed finance review from ron. we will then open the call for questions. we are very pleased with the start to 2022, as our team continued to deliver on all financial and strategic objectives in our plan.
maxcyte's expert platform continues to be the premier cell engineering technology, enabling the development of a growing set of advanced cell-based therapeutics. with our additional resources at hand, we continue to invest in our people and capabilities at a measured, but healthy rate, as we seek to ensure the success of our partners. ron will provide more details later in the call, but i note that we generated very strong first quarter 2022 results, as pre-announced last month and outlined in the press release published today. these results are anchored in robust performance in our core cell engineering business, which was up 48% year over year.
we generated significant spl program-related revenue in the quarter, with revenue timing running a little sooner than our internal planned forecasted, yielding strong year-over-year growth in the quarter. as you know, we have very limited visibility into the timing of our partners' clinical progress. and as such, it's a challenge for us to provide precise information regarding program-related revenue beyond general expectations for the year. first quarter revenue was a record $11.6 million, up 78% over the first quarter of 2021, with a very strong growth in the core business.
growth in revenue to cell therapy customers was 57% year over year and to drug discovery customers was 23% year over year. cell therapy growth was primarily driven by both instrument and pa sales. we are seeing expansion of our global customer base across all stages of development and encouraged by our traction with cell therapy customers at early development stage, which continues to strengthen our robust spl pipeline. during the quarter, we recognized $2 million in clinical milestone revenues.
as we have previously indicated, our partnership agreements are strictly confidential and so we will not be answering any specific questions relating to our spl partners, their clinical progress, or their respective development programs. however, we remain excited about the progress our partners have been making in the clinic. we continue to sign new spl partners and see additional spl programs enter trials. further, we have seen our existing clinical spl portfolio progress into later stage, including pivotal clinical study, suggesting we may see our partner's first commercial product as early as 2023.
overall, our core business revenue growth and recognition of the spl program-related revenues are signs of both strong execution by our growing commercial team and robust customer demand. this strength is seen in new sales and leases of instruments, as well as strong pa sales. the timing of customer pa purchases and leased instruments as they prepare for pivotal trials and commercialization can be hard to predict. and we would expect them to remain lumpy, until our spl portfolio and clinical progress of those partners is broad enough to smooth out that lumpiness from individual programs.
given our strong performance, we wanted to highlight that we have not seen weakness in the demand for our products and associated support from our customers. we have strong relationships with our partners and customers and believe maxcyte's expert platform is a core aspect of their therapeutic development strategy. we continue to meet and exceed our customers' expectations for supply and scientific support, and we continue to have a growing new business development pipeline. our spl pipeline remains strong, and we continue to expect additional spl partnership announcements this year, at comparable economics to prior partnerships.
in the first quarter, we signed an agreement with intima bioscience, which we highlighted on our last call. we now have 16 spl partners, covering more than 95 development programs in the aggregate, of which more than 15% have entered the clinic. in the near-term, we are optimistic about the potential for our spl partners to generate meaningful and growing revenue from both their preclinical research and clinical progress, as well as hopefully commercialization of partner therapeutics over the next 12 months to 24 months and beyond. we are making important investments to support our future revenue growth, including investing in our commercial teams, developing and expanding in-house manufacturing, and in our in-house bioprocessing and cell therapy applications and process development labs.
these investments will advance our ability to take advantage of expanding markets, the emergence of new therapeutic development programs and companies, and support our partners, as they move toward and into commercial launch of therapeutic products. this investment will come with continued growth in headcount across most areas of the organization, particularly in r&d and sales and marketing, including alliance management. these kinds of investments have delivered strong growth to date, as we support our partners' potential success and we continue to be upbeat about the value of these investments we're making in 2022 and beyond. in closing, we have had an excellent first quarter for 2022, as we continue to execute on our financial and strategic goals.
we're very excited about our opportunity going forward, particularly in the cell therapy market, and are making the right investments to drive growth across the business. i will now turn the call over to ron to discuss our financial results. ron?
ron holtz -- interim chief financial officer
thanks, doug. hello, everyone. as doug mentioned, we realized record revenue of $11.6 million in the first quarter, compared to $6.5 million in the prior year's quarter, based on strong performance in both our core business and through the clinical progress milestones delivered by our spl partners. core business revenue was $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $6.5 million in the first quarter of '21.
this includes revenue from cell therapy customers of $7.4 million, growing 57% year over year, while revenue from drug discovery customers was $2.2 million, growing 23% year over year. we saw broad growth across the business, with particular strength in instrument sales in cell therapy and in processing assembly sales in both cell therapy and drug discovery during the quarter. we recognized $2 million of spl program related revenue in the first quarter of 2022, compared to a material program-related revenue in q1 2021. moving down the p&l, gross margin was 91% in the quarter versus 89% in the first quarter of the year prior.
the increase in gross margin was driven by the higher spl program-related revenues. excluding that spl revenue, gross margin was relatively unchanged. total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $14.7 million, compared to $12.2 million in the first quarter of 2021. and recall that, q1 2021 included $3.9 million of expense from winding down investments in our carma platform.
as doug mentioned, our current strategy is to continue to make meaningful investments across the business to take advantage of the opportunities we see to accelerate organic growth over the coming years. the overall increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased headcount to support growth in field sales and field science, manufacturing, and lab teams. growth in public company related and stock-based compensation expense, also contributed to the higher level of expenses compared to the same period a year ago, as our nasdaq listing did not occur until the third quarter of 2021. we have a very healthy balance sheet, with total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $246 million as of the end of the first quarter, and no debt.
note that in q1, we began to see the first portion of cash investments in construction of our new facility. total investments this year in our new headquarters is expected to be approximately $12 million in 2022. we are increasing our outlook for 2022. we now expect revenue from our core business, which includes sales and leases of instruments and sales of disposables to cell therapy and drug discovery customers to grow at least 25% compared to 2021 core business revenue.
we saw strong business momentum in the first quarter and remain cautiously optimistic about the balance of 2022. turning to our spl program economics, as we have discussed in previous calls, the timing of spl revenues is predicated on our customers' clinical and regulatory progress, where we have limited visibility. taking into account the earlier than expected q1 program-related revenue, we continue to expect 2022 spl milestone revenue of approximately $4 million. doug?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you, ron. in summary, we remain excited about the opportunity to lead the industry forward as the premier cell engineering platform technology, supporting the development of advanced cell-based therapeutics, for patients that may not otherwise have treatment options. as always, we want to take this opportunity to thank our team, board, suppliers, investors, and the amazing industry that we have the honor of serving. we are very pleased to report strong first quarter results, and maxcyte remains well-positioned for growth, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead.
we are now opening up the line for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from max masucci from cowen. your line is open.
stephanie iannetta -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, this is stephanie iannetta on for max masucci. thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a great quarter. if you look broadly at some of the more recent therapies, your spl partners have launched in the clinic and compare them to the therapies you supported during the 2017 to 2020 timeframe? what sort of diversity of cell types or molecules are you seeing? are there any emerging trends to call out?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
good questions, stephanie, and thanks for the question. we are seeing quite a bit of movement since 2017. one of our first deals was with crispr, and we're seeing that continuing. we're seeing multiple edits being done to cells.
we're seeing companies move from t-cells and some t-cell subsets of nk cells. a lot of focus now on different sorts of gamma, delta t-cells, and b-cells. so the cell population, the subsets are increasing. i think, again, we're seeing more complex, and it's what i just mentioned, we're seeing different tools being used.
some of them have been around for quite some time, like zinc finger nucleases and transposon transposase. and so we're just seeing a lot of difference. we're also seeing movement in some new indication areas, principally it was [inaudible] disease with crispr and their sickle cell program, obviously into autologous stem cell, also an allogeneic t-cell treatments and we're also seeing for cancer. and we're also seeing movements into autoimmune disease and some of our earlier stage customers are working in neurodegenerative disease and infectious disease.
so we really think this whole field is just beginning to explode, as people become much more comfortable with these engineering tools and manufacturing methods.
stephanie iannetta -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. and also with the recent pullback in publicly traded biomanufacturing peers and likely some degree of a pullback in private asset values. has your approach toward m&a changed at all? are you leaning more toward tuck-in, complementary m&a or are you entertaining some later, more transformational deals?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think -- well, we're seeing some movement in the private financing now. it's reflective, i think a few months behind the decrease in financings in the public market. i think, just to put an exclamation point. we're not seeing any reduction of demand for our products with our partners, so that's good.
we've always thought about expanding our corporate development group. our targets are confidential. but i think it's fair to say that, we have talked about staying very close to our knitting, staying close to the cell engineering space, not moving too far upstream and downstream, and really looking for opportunities where we can solve really big pain points that customers are having in the cell therapy field. how we do that? i think we're open to -- with all the different opportunities.
but i think if we do a deal, if we do several deals, we are going to be, again around solving these engineering problems for our customers.
stephanie iannetta -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. that's great. super helpful. and if i could squeeze in one more.
so, during the last call, you highlighted that you were working with several beta customers on the expert vlx to build application data. can you provide some more detail on the progression of the beta launch or share any additional milestones on the vlx product road map?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
well, sure. so we released that product in the fourth quarter of this year, and much of the focus at that point was really investing in the business and refining our strategic plan. so we did the release in 2022. we think it's a very interesting marketplace and we think this is a highly disruptive technology in large-scale bioprocessing.
so we're working with these customers with the expert vlx to build applications data, to support that movement. we think the opportunity is large. it's going to take time to -- if you follow that opportunity with our partners, i think one of the areas that we're very excited about, is the rapid production of monoclonal antibodies. we think there is an immediate need for that in the marketplace.
it's a -- i think it's a broad tam expansion opportunity for the company. and we're doing quite a bit of this in small scale with the stx today. so it's a bit of a natural progression for us to move, as our companies, or partners want to move kind of from a mid-scale, which is the stx up to larger volumes. and, again, you know, work has to be done in this area and the applications.
it's -- there is significant amount of work that's done, pre and post electroporation engineering and process development. that's one of the areas that we've focused investments, is to ensure that we have the ability to support our customers all the way through their process.
stephanie iannetta -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. thanks so much for that color. really appreciate it.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
you bet thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from matt larew from william blair. your line is open.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
so doug, [inaudible] loud and clear that no change in terms of demand from customers. but just because it's been such a topic, this earning season, perhaps -- often you have six to seven programs per customer and it certainly would make sense that with lead assets, there'll be no change. but just curious, if you've seen any reprioritization or deprioritization of pipelines from customers at all beyond sort of the -- maybe lead or secondary assets?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we're not -- matt, we're really not seeing it at this point. i mean, i think that our focus is typically on the lead asset or no. 2 of the company, like you suggested.
and as far as we can see, these companies are pulling back on those. well, a lot of the work, if they're pulling back, they may be pulling back on some preclinical programs. but again, that's pretty -- that's usually pretty confidential with our partners and we wouldn't have much vision on that or ability to see what's going on. the other issue is that our business has grown quite a bit.
we had a very strong core business growth in the first quarter. so i think that's evidence that things continue to be moving forward to a pretty, pretty good rate.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
ok. and then just in terms of hiring, just curious what you're seeing out there and if you've been able to hire at pace with what you're expecting. i think opex might have -- came in a little bit light of what we were thinking, and just curious if that's -- any sort of efficiencies that you've built in, or if you've began scheduling on the hiring front?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
well, i'll let ron talk about the expense side of it. but we have a very active hiring group. we've expanded our human resources and team building. we're also being -- i think we're being very creative in terms of how people work in the company.
over the last couple of years, as many of you know, it's been primarily virtual. we're still seeing that as a primary way of bringing in great people. and of course, that has its own series of leadership and management challenges. but if you -- i think, you find the right people, you bring them in and you provide them the tools that they need to work virtually.
i think we're going to do pretty well. ron, would you like to talk at all about the expense changes for the first quarter?
ron holtz -- interim chief financial officer
yeah. so we're being successful in hiring the people that we want. i think it's a more competitive environment that we've seen in prior years. that means we might be a little bit behind what our plan was for ramping headcount.
i don't think it's a material effect. but that competitive environment makes it take a little bit more time to find people. we are being successful hiring the people we want. when we find a candidate more often than we've seen in the past, they have other offers in hand, but we're winning the people that we want.
so i think that's going well.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
ok. thanks, ron. last one, just -- just about two months ago, there was a competitive launch in this space. well, just to be curious, over the last couple of months as you've been out and perhaps heard feedback on that device or had to compare it to your own technology, is there anything you would highlight about what you're hearing or what you see as key differentiators, which have been maintained, even relative to this newer launch?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll say a couple of things, matt. but i'm obviously not going to give -- we're not going to give the playbook to the competition. this is a product that they've been talking about, it's the thermo-fisher product for quite some time.
they are showing it up, it's showing up in major meetings. we're not seeing it playing any role in the commercial, like break-offs with customers. so we're not seeing the impact of that. i think, the thing that i think differentiates us is performance and flexibility and scale and cgmp, and our focus on supporting our customers in the cell engineering space.
so we welcome the competition, and i think it just brings more validation that this is a pretty interesting -- an area that's going to have a lot of future benefit for our company.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
that makes sense. thanks.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from dan arias from stifel. your line is open.
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. doug, you mentioned some lumpiness that can arise with respect to the individual programs that you have in your prepared remarks. i'm just kind of curious, whether as some of your partners have pushed into the later stages, you've gotten comfortable with the purchasing around key milestone events. in other words, how consistent are you finding their spending to be into a scale up to a new trial stage, and then may be out as well? should we think about there being step-ups ahead of a milestone and step down afterwards, or is that something to be mindful of, or is it more or less consistent?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
i think the lumpiness is really around the milestones themselves, because, we know, we have a number of those, but we have 15 in the clinic. i think at some point, we're going to need a larger number of anda, actually smoothen it out. i'm not a mathematician, so i don't know how we really get to that number. i think it's still new to us, and so we're seeing ramp-ups, obviously, preclinical into the clinic.
we're actually seeing quite a bit of non-clinical work that's been going on with some of these products as well. i mean, once they don't -- these companies don't call it all pre-clinical, they call it non-clinical because they're doing experimentation alongside the product that's been in clinical development. so i think because of the relatively small number of programs, where we don't really have a good handle on what demand looks like, i think that's one of the reasons why we have elected to start doing more in-house manufacturing. so we have the flexibility to support these customers.
and obviously, we want more of that, once we start moving into a commercial launch of one of these -- of some of these products in the next couple of years. hopefully, that answered your question, i had a couple of things -- 
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah. it does, and you're right, and i think it just is -- it seems like it's naturally tbd on what happens from here. maybe just on a different topic, new business development and new account wins. if i go back a year ago to when we were talking about the business at the time of the listing, you guys had mentioned share within the clinical non-viral delivery market, that was like 40% or so.
and then there was another 15% that were in discussion as you put it, which kind of felt like it had good conversion potential. are you able to sort of update us on that chunk and how you've converted the business that looked like it was coming your way, call it six to 12 months ago?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i can't update it quantitatively. but i can say qualitatively that we're meeting all of our goals, and we're winning that business and converting companies even in early stage through our technology. we're also -- we've invested in -- we've invested a bit in working in these translational medical centers, where you have a cgmp manufacturing suite within an academic setting. and we've begun to have a much more focused marketing effort and sales effort in that.
because at the end of the day, that's where many of these companies are spawned from, right. they're coming out of an academics lab, and once they get into the clinic or they backfill into the clinic, someone's forming a company around them. and so, if we can get that -- our technology kind of embedded in that early enough, we think that's going to just feed that spl pipeline for the future.
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. maybe if i could just sneak one more in here, since i feel like we have the time here. on the strategic plan that you were kind of touching on, you had alluded to it, i think in your comments with the vlx. but i think part of what you were trying to do this year or into this year, was move upstream and downstream of where you are today in cell therapy or at least evaluating how you can do that.
is that something we should keep an eye out for? and if so, would that be an organic effort or more on the inorganic side?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so we're building out a corporate development group. we've been spending a lot of time on strategy and where we want to play. and i think, we can win around -- again around, like i said, with the first call around the cell engineering step.
some of these are going to be organic, where we've already identified some opportunities that we can kind of build into what we do. we do believe that there's a real need in the marketplace for product consistency, product characterization, ways of being able to control product potency, which has become more and more of an issue. and we think there's some analytical techniques that we may be looking to become more basic in. these opportunities will most likely be in the manufacturing area, not in the early phase discovery area.
so i think, you know, i think we've got a -- if you think about our company, we're -- in the quadrant, we're up in the high-value proprietary manufacturing enablement. we want to stay up in that sector. we only focus our team on that. so there's a -- we think there's quite a bit of opportunity there.
technologies that may be being used in other ancillary industries, like in bioprocessing [inaudible]. and there's also a number of technologies and products are being developed by smaller companies that have to make that decision, whether or not want to make those investments in sales and marketing. and in today's environment, where capital isn't quite as -- capital markets aren't quite as robust as they were six or nine or 12 months ago, i think there's going to be boards of smaller companies, that will be thinking hard about if they want to make an investment, and take that risk, because execution is -- it can be very difficult in that marketplace. and i think we've been able to achieve a certain level of success in that.
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. helpful, doug. thank you. 
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks. thanks, dan.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from jacob johnson from stephens. your line is open.
mac etoch -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hi. this is mac on for jacob. just a couple of quick ones from me. on the drug development side, can you talk about how much of the investments in r&d and sales and marketing are focused on this side of the business? and how much do you think this could accelerate growth in the segment?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so some of the, i think we're starting to see the benefits and some investments we've made over the last couple of years on new processing assemblies. so we try to -- we continue to have a rather robust voice of customer and voice of customers is focused on drug discovery, we've been talking about that for a bit, because that market has been, i think flat -- slightly growing and we wanted to really try to accelerate that a bit. and i think we were reasonably successful in the first year -- the first quarter of picking that up with that.
we'll continue to do that. and i think the more we can focus the use cases and drug discovery, which includes bioprocessing, i think the better off we're going to be able to build that business. the vlx is that launch -- the initial launch when it happens, will be probably over in the bioprocessing side, not in cell therapy. because in our minds, drug discovery would include the mid and large-scale production of monoclonal antibody.
so i think you're going to see, i think, hopefully quite a bit of growth in that sector, as we continue to make investments in the drug discovery side.
mac etoch -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
thanks. and also, last quarter, you commented on -- that you're seeing interest outside the u.s. how large of an opportunity are the european and asian pacific markets for you?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we've been in europe for quite some time, and there just continues to be strong growth throughout the e.u. and u.k. so we're pretty basic in sales and sas and marketing operations there.
so, you know, we think -- i think, we're making the rightful investments to be there. you know, we're seeing growth in cell therapy, certainly in china. we're figuring out the best way of approaching that, it's a tough market to, i think, be successful in. i don't think it's particularly tough market to get into, but i think it's a tough market to maintain some level of sustainability.
and that's what we're really focusing our attention on. we've had some success. i think we've had a lot of success in japan, and in some extent, korea. so i think, you continue to see us focusing our interest in asia and of course, in europe.
i mean, europe, is one of the backbones now for our cell therapy.
mac etoch -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
all right. thanks, doug.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our next question comes from mark massaro from btig. your line is open.
vidyun bais -- btig -- analyst
hey, guys. this is vidyun on for mark. thanks for taking the question. so for your existing spl portfolio, can you share any detail on the rough split of your customers that are in the clinic at present or in later-stage development?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so the only -- what we do share, and we said that there's 16 partners out at the end of last year, at 2021. and of those 16 partners, 95 programs were associated with those partners and 15% are in the clinic. and then i know there's been quite a bit of, i think, speculations and views by some analysts in terms of what products we're supporting.
we have publicly disclosed that we're supporting the ctx001, which is obviously the drug for sickle cell disease. i think we've been a bit less forthright in some of the other programs, because all these deals, as we mentioned are confidential. so we really don't feel comfortable talking about those in any setting.
vidyun bais -- btig -- analyst
ok. got you. and can you just touch on the spl funnel? i think you have previously discussed, you need to sign three to four spls per year. and just any updates there, and how are the conversations around these progressing?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so the pipeline continues to be very robust, since they have been larger. we just signed into the first quarter of this year. we continue to guide to -- i think three or four i will let ron talk about that specifically.
and we're building out our business development groups, our alliance management groups. so we think that there's a tremendous amount of opportunity to that. a lot of that has to do more with the progression of our partners, and it does actually in our negotiations, because as they move from kind of preclinical into ind-enabling studies. so that's the turning point where they will want to have access to our patents or technology or masterplan, those sorts of things.
vidyun bais -- btig -- analyst
thank you. great. thanks for answering the question.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. and i'm showing no further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the conference back over to doug doerfler for closing remarks.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
great. well, thank you, all, for the questions and your interest, and your support of maxcyte. it's been indeed, an amazing 2021 and a great start to 2022 despite the -- obviously the investor sentiment in the industry, and we're quite hopeful and i think we're very confident that we're going to see some really amazing clinical data coming out of our partners over the next several quarters. and that -- i think that's going to portend well for the cell therapy industry in general and maxcyte in particular.
so again, thank, you, all for your support, and look forward to any subsequent discussions we will have. but we will be in meeting with investors in the next several days, and if you have any particular questions, you can certainly contact us at ir@maxcyte.com. thank you, sean. thank you, ron.
and thank you all for -- and gigi, thank you as the operator for this call. be safe. thank you.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to maxcyte second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, sean menarguez, director of investor relations. please go ahead.
sean menarguez -- director of investor relations
thank you, norma, and good afternoon, everyone. my name is sean menarguez, and i'm the director of investor relations here at maxcyte. thank you all for participating in today's conference call. on the call from maxcyte, we have doug doerfler, president and chief executive officer; and ron holtz, interim chief financial officer.
earlier today, maxcyte released financial results for the second quarter ended june 30, 2022. a copy of the press release is available on the company's website. before we begin, i need to read the following statements. statements or comments made during this call may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.
any statements contained in this call that relate to expectations or predictions of future events, results or performance are forward-looking statements. actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our sec filings. the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. and with that, i will turn the call over to doug. 
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you, sean, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining maxcyte's second quarter earnings call. i will begin with a discussion of our business and operational highlights during the quarter, followed by a detailed financial review from ron, along with an update on our revenue outlook for the year. we will then open the call for questions. i am very pleased with our start to 2022, as our team continues to deliver on the financial and strategic objectives in our plan.
maxcyte's expert platform and team continue to be the premier cell engineering technology and partner, enabling the development of a growing set of advanced cell-based therapeutics. with additional resources at hand, we continue to invest in our people and capabilities at a measured but healthy rate as we seek to take advantage of the growing markets and support our customers' and partners' growth. ron will provide more details later in the call but i'd note that we generated very strong second quarter 2022 results, as outlined in the press release this morning. we continue to build traction and saw steady growth in our core business, which was up 45% year over year, led by revenue from cell therapy customers, which increased 61% year over year, while revenue from drug discovery customers increased 4%.
cell therapy revenue growth was driven by significant increases in both instrument and pa sales. we are seeing expansion of our global customer base across all stages of development and are encouraged by our traction with the cell therapy customers in early development stages, which continues to strengthen our robust pre-spl partnership pipeline. our partnership pipeline is the strongest it's ever been and spans across a wide array of cell types, approaches and indications. we did not recognize any spl program-related revenue during the second quarter and we remain excited about the progress our partners have been making as they progress their clinical programs, including into pivotal studies.
we are also hopeful regarding the potential for some of our partners' therapeutics to reach commercialization over the next 12 to 24 months with others reaching that space thereafter, which we believe will generate meaningful and growing revenue to us. in addition, we continue to sign new strategic platform partners. i do want to note that due to the confidentiality of our partnership agreement, we will not be able to answer any specific questions related to spl partners, their clinical progress, or their respective development programs. a few weeks ago, we signed an spa with lg chem, korea's largest chemical company and a globally diversified petrochemical advanced materials and biotechnology company.
we are excited to partner and support their car-t programs for solid tumors. this represents our first spl with a south korean company and broadens our reach in asia. with this most recent agreement, we now have 17 spl partnerships, covering more than 95 development programs in the aggregate, that's based on the calculations we talked about in january 2022, of which more than 15% have entered the clinic. we remain optimistic regarding the potential to add additional spl partnerships this year and the comparable economics to prior partnerships.
we maintain strong relationships with our partners and customers and believe the combination of maxcyte's expert platform and the support of our team is a core aspect of their therapeutic development strategy. our partners are well funded and leaders in the cell therapy industry, developing a wide-ranging set of innovative gene editing approaches. our platform continues to lead the industry in transfection efficiency, cell viability and scalability, which are critical capabilities through the development of cell-based therapeutics. and combined with our unparalleled scientific support is the core of what brings customers to our platform.
a key element of our work this year is the ongoing investment we are making to support our future revenue growth. these investments include expanding our commercial teams, expanding in-house manufacturing, enhancing our applications and process development capabilities and ongoing product development, as well as reinforcing our business infrastructure. all these investments are central to supporting our customers and partner success in driving continued revenue growth. this summer, we are completing our move to new headquarters in a facility nearby in maryland.
a key part of our headquarters project is the expansion of our instrument and disposables manufacturing capacity from research and clinical scale to now commercial therapeutic scale. building out in-house manufacturing is expected to increase our manufacturing capacity, build redundant disposable manufacturing capability and enhance our control over supply chain. these developments are critical to supporting our spl partners as their programs advance. in addition, we continue to see exciting growth in our end markets, particularly in novel cell types and gene editing applications.
our ongoing investments in our applications and process development labs will keep us at the forefront of these changes, where we play a central role enabling innovation in cell therapy as the field advances. additionally, the pd lab is building out the platform and processes needed to support the use of the vlx platform in large-scale bioprocessing, including the production of monoclonal antibodies. we also are investing in our sales, marketing and field science applications team to further our ability to capitalize on growing markets. finally, we are making the necessary investments in our business infrastructure, information systems, quality systems, regulatory, legal, finance and accounting to support the growth of the company.
these investments will advance our ability to support expanding markets, engage successfully with emerging therapeutic development programs in companies and support our partners as they move toward commercial launch of therapeutic products. we remain confident in the value of these investments to our partners and that they will continue to deliver strong growth. as we make these investments, important to note that we remain well funded with modest cash burn and a strong balance sheet as we move toward profitability. in summary, we had an excellent second quarter, 2022.
we remain excited about our opportunity going forward, especially in the cell therapy market as we continue to execute on our financial and strategic goals and make the right investments to drive growth across our business. i will now turn the call over to ron to discuss our financial results. ron?
ron holtz -- interim chief financial officer
thank you, doug. hello, everyone. as doug mentioned, we reported total revenue of $9.6 million in the second quarter, compared to $7.1 million in the prior year's quarter, driven by strong performance in our core business. core business revenue was $9.6 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $6.6 million in 2021.
this includes revenue from cell therapy customers of $7.7 million, which grew 61% year over year, while revenue from drug discovery customers was $1.9 million, up 4% year over year. the increases were primarily driven by strong instrument and disposable sales growth in cell therapy. we did not recognize any material spl program-related revenue in the second quarter of 2022, as compared to $0.5 million of program-related revenue in the second quarter of 2021. moving down the p&l.
gross margin was 88% in the quarter versus 89% in the second quarter of the year prior. total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2022 were $17.2 million, compared to $10.7 million in the second quarter of 2021. the overall increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased staff and field sales science, manufacturing, lab teams that support customers' and partners' growth. the increase also included growth in public company-related stock-based compensation and marketing expenses compared with the same period a year ago.
furthermore, we have a very healthy balance sheet with combined total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $240.9 million as of the end of the second quarter and no debt. as communicated last quarter, total investments this year in our new headquarters is expected to be approximately $12 million in 2022. based on the growth year to date and a robust pipeline, we are raising our revenue outlook for 2022. we remain cautiously optimistic about the balance of 2022 and now expect revenue from our core business which includes sales and leases of instruments and sales of disposables to both cell therapy and drug discovery customers to grow approximately 30% compared to 2021 core business revenue.
turning to our spl program economics. as we've discussed previously, the timing of spl revenues is predicated in our customers' clinical and regulatory progress and, therefore, is fundamentally more difficult to predict than core revenues, which we manage directly. based on that more limited visibility, we continue to expect 2022 spl milestone revenue of approximately $4 million. lastly, we believe that our modest cash burn and debt-free balance sheet will support our future plans for profitable growth.
we expect to end this year with approximately $220 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. now i'll turn it back over to doug.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you, ron. so in summary, we remain optimistic about the opportunity to lead the industry forward as the premier cell engineering platform technology, supporting the development of advanced cell-based therapeutics for patients who may not otherwise have treatment options. we are very pleased to report strong second quarter results and raise our full year revenue outlook. we're excited about the opportunities ahead.
and as always, we want to take this opportunity to thank our team, the board, suppliers, investors, partners and the amazing industry that we have the honor of serving. thank you and i'm open for any questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from max masucci with cowen. your line is open.
max masucci -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the questions. first one related to the core cell therapy business, another strong beat in the segment. it would be great to understand how much of that strong growth in the core cell therapy business, both on the instrument placements and processing assembly side of things, how much of that growth is being driven by spl partners versus customers that you haven't signed spl agreements with?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
ron, do you want to take that one? thanks, max.
ron holtz -- interim chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so the spl customers on the cell therapy side tend to be the larger customers. and so more of the growth comes from them than from smaller customers and new customers where they're typically buying one instrument or have a single instrument on lease. so it's -- i don't have the proportion in my head but it's certainly the larger proportion is coming from spl customers.
max masucci -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. great. and then second one, could you -- is there a way for us to better understand maybe even qualitatively, just how licensing fees have evolved as a contributor to revenues and growth, maybe compared to the time of the nasdaq ipo or in recent quarters?
ron holtz -- interim chief financial officer
yeah. so i don't think that there's been a lot of movement in the proportion. so the mix is kind of recurring revenue, so you have instruments that are licensed and those are -- those grow. and because they're recurring, as long as the instruments are in place, that gives us a strong base for growth.
process and assemblies tend to be repeating and also a consistent proportion of revenues. and i don't -- i was looking at it today. i don't think there's been much in the way of the shift in the past, even few years, really.
max masucci -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. got it. maybe final one. several maxcyte engineered therapies in various phases of clinical development, all with aspirations of regulatory approval and launch.
i think for us, at biomanufacturing conferences, there seems to be an emphasis on companies preparing for commercialization, logistics and scale up a bit earlier than, say, a few years ago. so just a broad question. is that what you're seeing on your end? and if so, is there anything that you need to do at maxcyte to sort of prepare yourself operationally for that next wave that will be coming over the next, call it, three to four years?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
hey, ron, let me take that. it's a great question. precisely what we've been investing in the last year or so. we talked about moving into our new facility that basis for that move is to substantially expand our manufacturing operation and to become more basic in the manufacturing of processing assemblies.
so we want to build up a lot of capability. we also -- you also will see some increase in inventory and that's a result of us, again, becoming more basic building in our supply chain so that we can support our customers as they move from late stage clinical development into that launch phase. and as you can imagine, there's a lot of speculation on what those numbers could look like but we want to make sure that we're in a position that we can support our commercial customers at any level that they need. and so we're spending a lot of time thinking about that.
we're also investing in regulatory field support because these companies are typically thinking about global launches or at least eu, u.k. and u.s. launches and also building out our operating group as it relates to quality group and making sure we have all the processes built redundant to support audits by our customers. so there's a lot of work going on.
i think it's fair to say at maxcyte, that's our no. 1 priority right now is preparing for our partners' launches.
max masucci -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. well, appreciate all the detail, and congrats on another great quarter.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from julie simmonds with panmure. your line is open.
julie simmonds -- panmure gordon -- analyst
thank you. hi. excellent quarter, guys. well done.
just looking at the split between cell therapy and the drug discovery side of things, cell therapy obviously going amazingly well. drug discovery is slightly lower in terms of the growth. is there anything particular behind that? is just that due to sort of an internal refocusing or where the sales team are focused because i know they do both now? or is there something else going on underlying in the market we should be thinking about?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
well, hi, julie. and thanks for staying up late in london. i know it's late there. this -- the drug discovery market for us is smaller in revenue compared to the cell therapy market.
so naturally, you're going to see some lumpiness in the growth rates from quarter to quarter. that being said, we posted double-digit growth.
ron holtz -- interim chief financial officer
did we lose doug?
operator
ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. again, ladies and gentlemen, we're experiencing technical difficulties. please stand by. and thank you, doug.
you may resume.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
hi. sorry. i'm not sure where i cut off here, but my internet completely went down. i'm sorry, julie.
i'm trying to -- ok. sorry about that. so the drug discovery business is a smaller business than cell therapy just from a revenue perspective. and so i think you're going to see some -- we're experiencing some lumpiness from quarter to quarter.
that said, if you look at the first half of 2022, i think the growth rate was around 13% or maybe 15% which is a bit higher than it until that point. i think our growth rate is in the mid-single digits. so i think you're seeing an increase in the -- we released the vlx in the drug discovery area. so we're pretty -- we're quite excited about that launch, which will happen from --
julie simmonds -- panmure gordon -- analyst
you just disappeared again. and when was the vlx launch, the full launch expected? because that was going to be my next question.
ron holtz -- interim chief financial officer
julie, formal launch of the vlx will be sometime this year. so it's placed into the market at the beginning of this year and we're going to put it out formally at the appropriate conference and that's something that's in our planning. we just haven't announced the date.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'm sorry. i'm just trying to move between two different computers. i'm sorry about this.
julie simmonds -- panmure gordon -- analyst
and i suppose just one final question. just as far as cost is concerned. clearly, they're continuing to ramp, which is what we'd expect given what we're doing at the moment. are you expecting by the fourth quarter of this year, you'll sort of reach a more sort of, i suppose, stable and gently growing run rate than the step-up we're seeing at the minutes? i mean, do you think by that point, you will be at the sort of closer to the level of sort of ongoing costs at that point?
ron holtz -- interim chief financial officer
julie, i missed a piece of that. were you asking about the operating growth step up in the second quarter?
julie simmonds -- panmure gordon -- analyst
yeah.
ron holtz -- interim chief financial officer
yeah. ok. so that makes sense. so it's actually sort of an ordinary pattern for us to have a bigger step-up quarter on quarter in operating expenses when we get to the second quarter as people are starting the hiring process early in the year, which takes a little while to get going and then putting the people in place, which is most of the expense growth, as they go into the second quarter.
and those expense growth rates tend to moderate in the second half of the year. so we won't see the kind of step-up we saw from q1 to q2. and will be -- i'm not completely flat but quite a bit flatter than what we saw in the first half of the year. and this has been a big investment year for us, as doug talked about in the initial comments.
and we would expect that as we go through future years that that expense growth year over year would moderate from the big step-up that we took here as we did a lot of important investments as doug talked about, in-house manufacturing and the new facility and expanding the team on a broader basis.
julie simmonds -- panmure gordon -- analyst
brilliant. thank you very much.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, julie.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from dan arias with stifel. your line is now open.
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
afternoon, guys. thanks for the question. doug or ron, maybe to ron's point on the growth skew toward the spl programs. when we were talking last year, you noted that the average number of platforms per strategic partner was, i believe, three or four.
so assuming that there are one or two in the mix and that would also mean that there maybe are some like five or six. so the question is, one, is that sort of the installed base range within the spl subset? and then i'm just curious if there is a pull-through difference per instrument within that subset that kind of speaks to sort of the consumables runway per unit that you might expect as these partners progress? or does the pull-through per unit basically stay the same, they just have more unit?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me take a crack at that. ron, you can follow up. thanks for the question.
it's something we're trying to think through with our partners right now. i don't think there's enough end to actually have a meaningful expectation of how many placements these customers are going to need, these partners. a lot has to do with the indication they're pursuing, their manufacturing strategy, their launch strategy in which countries, their regulatory strategy. so all that has to be built in, each of these as an individual almost snowflake.
so i really can't -- we don't know where we are with some of these customers in terms of -- are we just beginning to see a surge in placements? or is this kind of steady state? so we're watching that very closely. that said, we're prepared for a surge, if that's the case. so -- and what we're also seeing is pull through and i think it's -- we had suspected that some of the pull-through would go down as partners move further into the clinic. but i think what we're seeing is that a number of these partners are actually doing quite a bit of nonclinical work in parallel to the clinical work.
so we're really not seeing a reduction in pull-through when they move late-stage clinical, they're actually increasing that because they're doing additional research work to substantiate their cmc and their controls. hopefully, that's helpful.
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah, it is. but doug, can i just -- just for clarification, is that total pull-through as they accumulate more instruments or pull-through per instrument, such that as we think about these customers moving forward, their utilization of one instrument is higher and so therefore, maybe more revenue generating.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. dan, i understand the question. i don't think we have enough data yet to suggest -- that's the point -- yeah.
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
i gotcha. ok. maybe just a follow --
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
ron, did you want to comment?
ron holtz -- interim chief financial officer
dan, yeah, i just wanted to add one other thing, dan, that one of the things that also drives the number of instruments per spl partner is the number of programs that run through the clinic. i mean i think their revenues pull forward, as doug talked about, is hard to summarize. but you tend to see a balance between the revenues of -- coming from the instruments and the revenues coming from miles -- from processing assemblies; they tend to grow together. but if you're thinking about the number of instruments, it varies a lot for program but the number of programs drives that, how many instruments you might see per customer.
so a customer within program is a small number of instruments and a customer that has two programs or three or then four, then five in the clinic that in the clinical stage, is really driving their instrument counts.
dan arias -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yup. definitely makes sense. and maybe relatedly, just as a follow-up, doug, obviously, a lot going on in biopharma and cell therapy specifically. one of the assumptions that has underpinned your long-term model is that you would average three new spls per year.
is that an assumption that you're more or less still comfortable with when you look out, say, at the next like three to five years?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we are very comfortable. i mean, i think we've done two already this year. so we're very comfortable with that expectation. and we're building an organization around that.
ok. super. thank you, guys.
thanks, dan.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from matt larew with william blair. your line is now open.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
hi. this is matt on for matt. thanks for taking our questions. i just wanted to start off with a high-level question around funding.
obviously, there's been a lot of attention paid to the slowdown we've seen year to date in biotech funding. just wanted to get your thoughts and see if you've seen any sort of impact from the slowdown in biotech funding observed year to date. doug, i think maybe in the past, you mentioned a little bit of pipeline rationalization, expected at some point in the future. but i'm just wondering how things have trended so far since the end of the quarter and whether or not you're seeing a slowdown in activity so far here in the back half of the year?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's obviously something we're paying a lot of attention to and thinking through and communicating not only with our partners but with other capital sources to make sure that we see this on a longer-term basis. that said, we're really not seeing a pullback in the cell therapy side of the business, evidenced by our second quarter and first half gross numbers. and i think we mentioned before that in [inaudible] on their leader no.
2 asset and that's -- they're going to tighten their belt. they're not going to do it in later stages of element. they're going to probably do it in the front end and the research side. so we're really not seeing that as an impact to us.
but we're watching it. we're also seeing quite a bit of kind of new capital formation, new companies that are being launched with more complex cellular therapies as their base asset, which really portends well for maxcyte that's what we -- that's in our wheelhouse in terms of doing these more complex cell therapies.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. thanks, doug. for my second one, i wanted to follow up on julie's first question around the outlook for the different segments.
so you're guiding to 30% growth now for the base business for the year. just wondering if you can provide any detail around how to think about growth in the back half of the year for each segment. apologies if i missed this earlier when you're cutting out a little bit. but -- and then moving forward, in terms of 2023, i mean, you pointed to 25% growth in the base business long term.
just trying to get your initial thoughts on whether or not you think that's a reasonable bar for next year and your thoughts on how to think about the growth rates for each segment beyond 2022?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
ron, do you want to take that first and i'll jump in?
ron holtz -- interim chief financial officer
yeah. so as doug said, if we dial back a little bit from a single quarter, drug discovery, we think is growing nicely. it's been growing double digits in the first half of this year. that's an increase from where we were in covid, which hit pretty drug discovery pretty hard.
and i think that kind of expectation below the consistent grower capable of doing double digits, that's reasonable. and -- we don't see much change in the trajectory on cell therapy, either, maybe quarter -- in a particular quarter, it will be lumpy in some way but consistent with what you've seen in the past to deliver the kind of growth that we've been doing in the past generally 18 months.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
ok. got it. on vlx, just a quick one. so you talked about rapid production monoclonal antibodies being a broad, tam expansion opportunity for you.
but how realistic should we think of this being -- given it would require the fda to waive its requirement for maxcyte to be produced from the master cell line. are there any other applications that you're thinking about in the near term that can lead to some vlx revenue here, either in the back half of the year or in 2022?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so the uptake -- the eventual large opportunity in monoclonal production would be when fda clears the use of transit materials, right? and i think that's the big opportunity. but there's also a significant opportunity before that and that is larger volumes of monoclonal antibodies to do later-stage preclinical work. many of that work is being done with stable cell line produced material, which can take anywhere from months to years to produce.
so we're going to see some uptake. can't really talk too much about the use case that will happen when we launch the product and we mentioned we'll launch it in the second half of this year. so the other applications are behind it would be the production of allogeneic cell lines, which i think is going to be a large opportunity but that's going to come much more -- a bit longer, longer term. near term would be the production of viral vectors in suspension cells versus the current process of manufacturing them on adherent cells.
so that would be -- the next major area will be putting applications, information into the marketplace to produce those products.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
all right. got it. thank you.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from jacob johnson with stephens. your line is now open.
unknown speaker
hey, it's hanna on for jacob. good afternoon. a couple of questions. you just signed your first spl in apac with lg and it seems like you've had traction in this area.
are there any updated thoughts on traction internationally, especially as it relates to apac?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so that announcement was just right after we closed the second quarter. lg chem is a pretty large biotech group. they go a little over $0.5 billion invested in biotech now.
we've had a standing group of relationships in korea as we do in japan and in china. the challenge for us is really around the licensing model and does that work in those environments. we've been cautious about entering in a big way the china market for a lot of different reasons. but we are beginning to make more investments to secure licensed deals in that market.
so it's part of our strategy for the next couple of years. again, there's a huge opportunity, we think, in that marketplace but i think we have to be really thoughtful about how we enter it, how we protect our franchise and how to ensure we work with the right partners that can provide us kind of the long-term value that we're seeing with our existing 17 partners.
unknown speaker
thanks. and one follow-up. as we think about the cell and gene therapy pipeline. at a high level, it seems like interest in gene editing and allogeneic therapies continues to grow.
as you think about your customer conversations now versus a year or two ago, are you seeing more opportunities at the macro level?
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. we started talking about this when we went public about a year ago, about the burgeoning, if you will, increase in allogeneic cell therapies. and that's really -- that really has come to fruition. and now companies are moving away from autologous when they can because the opportunities we think are larger and allogeneic.
when you move into allogeneic, nonviral becomes a very important part of that engineering strategy and also multiple edits, which really falls into maxcyte sweet spot. so one of our key -- one of our key themes when we went public about a year ago was the increase in the attention in allogeneic cell therapies. and i think we're extraordinarily well-positioned in that space and that's turning out to be an area of increasing interest by companies and increasing interest by investors. so we're quite excited about some of the new programs we're seeing coming out of that -- in that area.
unknown speaker
thanks. i'll leave it there.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and at this time, i'm currently showing no further questions. i would now like to hand the conference back over to mr. doerfler for any closing remarks.
doug doerfler -- president and chief executive officer
