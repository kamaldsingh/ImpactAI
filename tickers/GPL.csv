[operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to fiona grant leydier, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
fiona leydier -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone. i'm fiona grant leydier. thank you for taking the time to participate in our call today.

dollars, unless otherwise noted. to reference, during the call, aisc refers to all-in sustaining costs. detailed cautionary statements can be found at the end of the presentation. i would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay later today.
replay information and the presentation slides accompanying this conference call and webcast will be available on our website at greatpanther.com. on the call this morning, we have rob henderson, president and ceo; neil hepworth, chief operating officer; and jim zadra, chief financial officer. 
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, fiona. and thank you, everyone, for dialing in today. 2020 was a year of substantial growth for great panther as our transition into a diversified intermediate gold producer continues. we've met a challenging environment brought on by the covid-19 pandemic.
our team was able to adapt quickly and efficiently, ultimately delivering significant operational improvements and record financial results. we produced more gold equivalent ounces in 2020 than we did in 2019, and i'm pleased to report that total revenue in 2020 increased by 31% over 2019 to $261 million on production of just over 150,000 gold equivalent ounces. our mine operating earnings before noncash items was $124.5 million or $0.37 a share. our adjusted ebitda came in at $98 million and cash flow from operating activities was $67 million or $0.20 a share.
our costs came down and consolidated aisc, excluding g&a, improved by 11%, when compared to 2019 at a cost of $1,228 per gold ounce. we also delivered on increases in our mineral reserves and mineral resources. at tucano, we successfully replaced mine depletion and added another year of open pit mine life, while strengthening our level of confidence in the deposit for future mine and operational planning. at gmc in mexico, the updated mineral resource estimate reported in november delivered an increase of 17% in measured and indicated category, and we doubled the inferred resources there, as well as higher grades.
since the acquisition of tucano in 2019, we've been steadily building our cash position. we ended the year with $63 million in cash and cash equivalents, and our working capital was $31 million. we also saw a meaningful decrease in debt, placing the company in a strong financial position. i'm incredibly pleased to close out the year with such a robust balance sheet, a testament to the hard work being executed by our team to deliver value for our shareholders.
and so building on the success of 2020, this year, we'll see an aggressive ramp-up of our exploration efforts, with a total of $13 million and 90,000 meters planned to further define our known resources, while tapping into the huge potential we see at tucano. our key objectives will be to continue to extend the tucano open pit mine life, further prove up the underground with a view to extending the high-grade zones and probably most importantly, make meaningful inroads into key targets in tucano's expansive regional land package. building on our 2020 exploration success in mexico will also be a key focus this year for us. in 2021, consolidated gold equivalent production from the tucano, topia and gmc mines expected to be 135,000 to 150,000 gold equivalent ounces, with the second half of 2021 expected to account for at least 55% of our annual production guidance.
aisc is expected to come in between $1,350 and $1,450 per gold ounce sold. and note that the costs in the first half of the year will be higher than this guidance due to lower production levels and higher stripping in the first half. i will now turn it over to neil hepworth, our chief operating officer, to discuss operations in more detail.
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
ok. thank you, rob. i will now provide an overview of 2020 results at our various producing assets. at tucano, our wholly owned gold producing asset in brazil, we've managed gold production for the year, increasing by 19% to just over 125,000 ounces.
please note that the comparative data presented for 2019 is for the period from march 5, 2019 to december 31, 2019. this is the period for which tucano owned -- sorry, for which great panther owned tucano following the acquisition. 2020 saw an improvement in mining productivities over 2019, with mined material up 32% and total plant throughput up by 33%. aisc for the year came in at $1,200 per ounce, a 15% improvement over 2019, mainly due to the weakening of the brazilian real.
at urucum central south, the work by knight pisold indicated that the movement in the pit walls were related to the high phreatic surface in the west wall. the phreatic level recorded in january was modeled by knight pisold and indicated that mining to the ultimate pit geometry could be done under stable conditions provided phreatic levels in the west are controlled. note that this is still work in progress and needs to be confirmed. at tucano, we continue with an aggressive near-mine and regional exploration program.
the near-mine program is aimed at replacing open pit reserves and expanding the high-grade underground reserves. the open pit drilling is primarily aimed at expanding the resources below the oxidized ore that was mined from tap c during [inaudible] times. there will also be additional drilling in the urucum east, also in torres areas are also part of the seven-kilometer tucano trend. for urucum north underground, there's a very focused drilling program to validate extent and dimensions of the high-grade zone 1 below the urucum north pit.
the first 5,000 meters of holes will be in the upper zone, with the second 3,000 meters looking at the upland extension. so they're going to evaluate the merits of bringing in the decline from the south following the plunge of the high-grade zone. turning to our mexican silver mines. firstly, at topia, production in 2020 was approximately 1.1 million silver equivalent ounces, with silver recoveries of 92% and silver grades of 352 grams a tonne.
the silver equivalent grade of 670 grams a tonne, reflecting the byproducts of gold, lead and silver. aisc was $19.75 per payable ounce of silver, a 29% increase over 2019 and reflects the impact of the federally mandated covid-19-related shutdowns in mexico. these were for most of april and may, and plus the voluntary suspension we implemented for five weeks in quarter four as a measure to protect our workforce in the community. all these covid-19 disruptions in q2 and again in q4 operations at topia are now back to normal.
the covid disruptions also prevented us getting permits for exploration drilling at topia. but the 2020 drilling budgets has been added to the 2021 drilling budgets in order to make up for this delay. at gmc, the full-year production was also approximately 1.1 million silver equivalent ounces, and this was comprised of 520,000 ounces of silver and nearly 7,000 ounces of gold. average silver grades were 125 grams a tonne, silver and gold grades were 1.66 grams per tonne gold, which translates to a silver equivalent grade of 275 grams a tonne.
at guanajuato, aisc came in at $21.88 per payable silver ounce, reflecting the impact of federally mandated covid-19-related shutdowns in mexico. in november, we announced an updated mineral resource set for gmc, measured and indicated resources increased by 17%, while inferred resources more than doubled. the 2021 surface drill program of 5,000 meters in san ignacio commenced in mid-january and should finalize in mid-june. this drilling is for further exploration of the purisima vein, expanding the santo nino vein and infilling all of the existing non-areas of the purisima vein system.
at guanajuato, the 2021 drill program, 10,000 meters commenced on february 8, with three drills and we're expecting it to end in july 2021. initial targets include los pozos above this 290 level between valenciana and carta on the 290 level and must process above the 275 level. in peru, at coricancha, an exploration program of 5,200 meters is proposed that targets a high-grade and easily accessible mining areas of escondida, constantia and wellington veins. the start of this program is subject to final discussions with the local visa community.
i'll now turn the call over to great panther's cfo jim zadra to discuss our financial results.
jim zadra -- chief financial officer
thank you, neil, and welcome, everyone. i'm pleased to report that strong gold and silver prices, together with strong execution by our operating teams, led to significant improvements in our financial results across the board. revenue increased by $62.2 million, thanks to higher gold production and sales at tucano and higher realized gold and silver prices, which were $17.85 and $21.28, respectively. these represent increased [audio gap] for gold and 29% for silver.
overall, production costs decreased by $20.5 million, primarily due to the weakening of the brazilian real and mexican peso relative to the u.s. dollar, leading to the noted 11% reduction in consolidated aisc, excluding g&a, $12.28 per payable gold ounce for 2020. i also note that aisc reflects full impact of the covid-19-related operating suspensions in mexico, including the care and maintenance costs during those suspensions and higher operating costs as a result of health and safety protocols and productivity impacts at our operations. as mentioned earlier, 2020 was a year that saw solid operational improvements.
aisc for q4 saw an even greater improvement when compared to the same period in 2019, reflecting a decrease of 23%. the strong metal price environment and favorable foreign exchange rates [inaudible] for noncash items, which increased to $124 million -- and $124.5 million or $0.37 per share, compared to $41.9 million in the prior year. after accounting for noncash depletion and amortization charges, mine operating earnings were $83.9 million and adjusted ebitda came in at $98 million, each up substantially over 2019. operating earnings were $57 million after accounting for non-capitalized exploration and development expenditures, and we were breakeven on the net income line after accounting for interest charges, noncash foreign exchange translation losses and settlement costs and foreign exchange hedges, which were wound up last month, leaving us unhedged to any currencies at the current time.
cash flow from operating activities or operating cash flow before changes in noncash working capital was $69 million or $0.20 per share and represented a substantial improvement, modest outflows in 2019. our free cash flow was $26.9 million for the year and $9.1 million in the fourth quarter. we ended the year on a solid financial footing with cash -- with a cash position of $63 million and net working capital of $31 million. we paid down $14 million of debt in q4, leading to significant deleveraging and a strong net cash position going into 2021.
in 2021, we will maintain a focus on building our working capital and strengthening the balance sheet in order to bolster our ability to leverage potential growth opportunities, including acquisitions, as we continue to evolve as a diversified precious metals producer focused on the americas. thank you, again. it's -- that's all we have for formal remarks, and i'll now turn it back to the operator for the q&a session.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from heiko ihle with h.c. wainwright. please go ahead.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
hey there. thanks for taking my questions. your outlook has you doing 55% of your guidance in the second half of the year. i mean, it looks like that's mostly due to the higher stripping in brazil.
but just to confirm, because it's not -- i didn't see it completely stated anywhere, mexico should not have a similar production breakdown. but rather, we can just see much more of a trend line quarter over quarter in mexico for the year, right?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct, heiko. our mexican producers are very steady. they're all underground operations. they're not subject to swings that we see in the open pits.
so yeah, the weak first half of the year is entirely due to our stripping requirements at tucano, and we get into the higher-grade ore in the second half of the year.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
that's what i figured --
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
sorry?
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
that's what i figured. i just wanted to clarify. and then completely, completely different question. with your continued transition to becoming more of a gold company, are you seeing any changes in your investor base, in people that are ringing you up, asking questions? what are you thinking in regards to multiple adjustments for higher trading multiples? are you seeing anything that maybe we're not privy to? or anything that you want to like let us know?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
no, i don't think so. i think we've got a healthy mix of retail investors who've always been big supporters of our strong silver position in mexico. we have a few more institutional investors, thanks to tucano, but the mix has stayed pretty consistent, and we're not getting any different messages to what we were getting last year. so i'm pretty happy with our investor base.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
excellent. thank you for the answers. stay safe.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from jake sekelsky with alliance global partners. please go ahead.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. at tucano, you mentioned you're expecting to see some higher stripping costs in the first half of this year. i'm just wondering if you're able to quantify this quarter over quarter at all.
i'm just trying to get a handle on how aisc might look on a quarterly basis throughout the year.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
i don't think we've typically given that guidance. jim, you got any flavors there? i think, generally, it's just -- the first and second quarters will be a bit low. and there will be improvements in the third and fourth. but i don't think there's going to be any significant difference between q1 and q2.
but jim, do you have any color on that?
jim zadra -- chief financial officer
sure. jake, i would say that the stripping costs in the first half were probably 55% to 60% of the full year.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then just more of a housekeeping item in mexico. i noticed you aren't providing aisc guidance there.
i'm just wondering what the reason is for that. is that related more to the level of investment you're expecting to make this year at a higher sustaining costs?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
jim, can you take that one?
jim zadra -- chief financial officer
sure. i think it's more to do with mexico representing 20% of our production. and really, it's tucano's the driving force in terms of the aisc at the end of the day. and if you can see from -- you can see from the guidance that the tucano aisc is really the equivalent of our consolidated aisc.
so we're really expecting mexico to be at the same level on a gold equivalent basis.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. it's all from me. thanks again, guys.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jake.
operator
the next question comes from matthew o'keefe with cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thanks, operator. good morning. nice year for you. just a couple of quick questions.
i may have missed it, i apologize if you addressed this already. but the work toward defining an underground potential at tucano, how is that progressing? and when would we expect an update there?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt. good question. so we've just got back to looking at the underground. we've kind of put it on the shelf for a number of years.
but the plan is to look at the ore body extension beneath the urucum north pit. so it's a banded ironstone information. it extends well below the pit, and we should have mined out the urucum pits in the second half of next year. so that would be the time that we could start looking at putting a decline down into the ore body, which is just a couple of a hundred meters below the open pit.
so right now, what we're doing is drilling the underground ore body, looking for extensions of that high-grade zone and pulling together a study as to where best to locate the portal and how best to mine the deposit. so we're starting drilling again, and we're starting to look at studies to support a capital decision in the second half of next year.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. so we would see economic numbers on that in 2022? if i understand correctly --
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct. that's correct. yes.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. ok. good. good.
and on the exploration front, i know you provided an update just in january, you had a good exploration update and increased the budget there. what's the news flow look like for exploration? because that's always been a big part of the great -- well, that's in the last -- since you got to [inaudible], what interest me and is a big part of the story at tucano was the exploration.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so last year was mainly infill drilling. we don't typically release infill drill results because they're just confirming that we know what is there already. so last year was a little bit slow on the drill results because of the infilling nature of them.
this year, we are drilling the region. so we're looking for brand-new deposits. so it's hard to predict exactly when the geologists are going to have enough information to be sure of a regional target, but i suspect we are drilling them now. so the regional news release could be any day.
the underground we are -- again, it's of the infill nature, but we are looking to extend the body. so i think we will be looking at getting some underground news releases out probably in midyear. that will confirm the extent of the ore body. and the infill drilling that we're doing on the pits, about $3 million of our budget -- of the $8 million budget next year is mainly looking at the open pit reserves, and again, they're pretty much of an infill nature.
so it's not going to be a huge news release around that. so in summary, if and when we hit the regional deposits, that will be big news. and the underground is probably going to be midyear and onwards.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
great. that's it for me. thanks very much.
operator
the next question comes from joseph reagor with roth capital partners. please go ahead.
joseph reagor -- roth capital markets -- analyst
hey, rob and team, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on a good, strong finish to the year.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, joe. good morning.
joseph reagor -- roth capital markets -- analyst
good morning. so first thing, kind of following on a little bit of the last caller's question. with the exploration, especially the non-infill as you go forward this year, is there like a certain threshold that you guys would need to achieve to release individual or small set drill holes instead of kind of doing quarterly updates or so?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a good question. i mean, typically, if we just hit one drill a hole with some interesting results, that wouldn't be considered material. but if we certainly got a handful, three or four, then we would be releasing a press release. so it is -- there's no hard science about a threshold, but i think once we've got a set of numbers that we feel are material, we would release that to the market.
joseph reagor -- roth capital markets -- analyst
ok. and if you had any regional success with your drilling, what's the time line to being able to add something to the mine life? what's the permitting climate like? would it just be an amendment to the current mine plan? or are there areas where you'd have to start like from square one to get it added? how do you guys think about that?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure. good question. we are looking at opportunities that are in our tenements and are truckable to the mill.
but maybe, neil, you can give joe a bit more flavor on the permitting environment in brazil?
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
yeah. i think as soon as we start hitting some interesting results, even before we've actually got a sort of a proper resource defined, we'll start the permitting process to give us a little bit of a head start on it. ok. this would be in the sort of in the areas of mutum and lona amarela and in a couple of other places as well.
so yeah, so it will still take a couple of years, but we'll try and fast track it as much as possible by anticipating where things are starting to go right.
joseph reagor -- roth capital markets -- analyst
ok. fair enough. and switching gears, gmc q4 all-in sustaining costs were quite elevated. was there some unique capital allocation number or some specific driving force behind why it jumped so much even quarter over quarter?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. of all the mines, i think gmc was most affected by covid. it's an underground mine. we had to reduce one of the shifts just because we couldn't get the level of supervision that was required for safe production.
so gmc's production was quite badly hit in q4 and as a result, the unit cost went up. so i think we're over those issues now. we're back at three shifts at gmc. so it was just mainly as a function of just insufficient manpower to do efficient mining.
joseph reagor -- roth capital markets -- analyst
ok. and maybe one final thing. any comments on what the m&a markets like either both potentially acquiring in brazil or south america or potentially selling off the older mexican assets? like, has the climate changed at all since the middle of last summer?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, that is an interesting question on the m&a climate. i think it's still -- covid is definitely slowing things down a bit. but from our side, we are keen to get into the 200,000-ounce-plus producing range.
and exploration is one way of doing that. the other way is mergers and acquisitions. so we are actively in discussions with other small producers in mexico, u.s. and brazil that would help us get above the magic 200,000 ounce level.
so m&a is certainly still very much a focus for us.
joseph reagor -- roth capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
the next question comes from spencer [inaudible] with -- a private investor.
unknown speaker
yeah. hi, guys. one of the other fellows mentioned this question about the gold versus silver mix. and i'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on that.
with silver price holding at so much better than gold and maybe even the future with being a commercial or do you have some flexibility as far as your exploration and as far as your focus on your mine -- mexican mines and all that, where you can ramp up that part where you can become more of a silver company due to the price? bottom line, can silver wag the dog?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
i believe it can. certainly, our mexican assets are exactly the same as the ones we had three years ago when bob was running the company. so our mexican assets do well when silver price is high. and turkey last year had some pretty spectacular results there.
our exploration, as you know, the underground narrow vein, high-grade operations, you can only drill them from underground. but certainly at gmc, we had a lot of success last year. so we added over 10 million ounces, which is really good for three or four years of production at gmc. the mining rate is limited because, again, it's underground.
so the only way we could increase silver production was by increased tonnage. so we're working on that. but from an exploration point of view, i think we saw significant success at gmc last year. we're now turning our attention to topia, which didn't get as much love as we would have liked last year due to the covid-related permit delays.
but we do like topia a lot. it's much higher grade than gmc. so we are focusing on drilling at topia and working at how we can increase our tonnage to our mills there. but bottom line, silver is contributing to our margins.
we like silver, and we're spending the necessary money on exploration in mexico.
unknown speaker
ok. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from aaron franklin with investors group. please go ahead.
aaron franklin -- investors group -- analyst
hi, rob. how are you doing today?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
good. thank you, aaron.
aaron franklin -- investors group -- analyst
awesome, awesome. i've got a couple of questions. are we going to get a decision on the peru mine on how you guys are going to go forward with the mine in peru, either as a joint venture or reopening or some type of time?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. what -- as neil outlined, we do have a drill program for coricancha. so we're hoping to get in there -- yes. yes.
so we are planning to drill coricancha to get those results out midyear. so that will help you make the decision. we're also dealing with the regulators in peru. and peru has been in a pretty tough year in terms of the political climate.
so we are seeing changes in the ministries there. so getting a decision on the legacy tailings there is also going to help us make a decision. so we're probably going to be better placed in the second half of the year to make a call on a restart there.
aaron franklin -- investors group -- analyst
ok. starting with the -- with the amount of cash that you guys are holding, would it not make sense to look at some type of purchase program to your shares, just because it seems it's a little bit undervalued in comparison to here and the rest of the gold market?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that is a good question, and we do look at capital allocation quite carefully. but i think there's still hesitation that covid is not over. there is talk of a third wave.
so we like the cash buffer we've got. but i don't think we're quite in a position with confidence in, certainly covid-related, in order to deploy our cash in any other way right now. so we're just focusing on exploration as the best way to add value.
aaron franklin -- investors group -- analyst
ok. and last question is the tailing dam in mexico. i think it's what topia? or no, it's gmc, that you're having some permitting issues. i didn't know if i missed -- were you guys able to -- the mexican authority, to you guys, with your options?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
not yet. so we're still -- there are covid-related delays to that as well. neil, maybe you can give aaron a bit more color on the status in mexico?
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
yeah. we're still waiting for conagua to get back to us. we keep on thinking that it's fairly imminent. but yes, it hasn't happened yet.
that's for the cata tsf at gmc. the topia tsf, we had problems last year in terms of stability issues, which we seem to have basically resolved now. so topia, we're in a pretty good -- we're in pretty good standing with our tailings capacity.
aaron franklin -- investors group -- analyst
ok. would you guys be able to -- here's a question. topia and gmc, would you be able to divert your ore to the other facility if there was an issue?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
no --
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
no. it's just too far, basically. sorry. i was going to say, but now, other alternatives in the area for toll milling.
so it's -- if we did have changes, capacity issues.
operator
this concludes the question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to rob for any closing remarks.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, operator. so 2020 was a banner year for great panther. and having joined the company as ceo in april 2020, i've been in the seat for eight months, and i'm incredibly pleased to see how the team has stayed focused on achieving safe and profitable growth during a challenging year given the covid-19 pandemic. this will be a year that none of us will forget.
and as we turn our attention to this year, i'm excited for what's ahead, as this is a year for exploration, during which we plan to unlock a great potential, which we see in our assets, particularly at tucano. we have a land package there in a world-class greenstone district, approximately 90 kilometers by 30 kilometers, that really has yet to see a drill bit outside our seven-kilometer mine tenement. and i share our geologist's excitement. so thank you for your participation today.
and on behalf of everyone here in great panther, i look forward to sharing our progress with you in the next quarter.

thanks fiona, and thank you, everyone, for dialing in today. it's now been just over a year since the global covid-19 pandemic began and people everywhere have been affected in one way or another. our business has had to adapt in ways we never imagined, but i'm very proud of how the team at great panther has adapted to our new health and safety protocols while continuing to successfully conduct our business. the pandemic has undeniably impacted efficiencies at our operations and i have immense appreciation for the team, delivering as they have, even amid these adverse conditions.
i'm pleased to report that operations continue safely despite covid-19 and we remain on track with our proposed guidance for the year. the first-quarter is typically a low production quarter for us due to the rain in brazil and our consolidated metal production in the first quarter of 2021 was 30,556 gold equivalent ounces, inclusive of 24,978 ounces of gold and 360,000 ounces of silver. we are benefiting from a strong metals price environment for both gold and silver which resulted in revenues of $52.6 million, an increase of 9% over the same quarter last year and mine operating earnings of $11 million which is an increase of 85% when compared with q1 2020. the weak brazilian real, in relation to the u.s.
dollar had a positive effect on costs with our all-in sustaining costs, excluding corporate g&a, coming in at $1,557 per ounce of gold sold which is a decrease of 11% over q1 2020. our adjusted ebitda increased to 94% over q1 2020 to $12.4 million and cash flow from operating activities before changes in noncash working capital was $7.3 million, compared with $0.9 million in the same period last year. we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with $45.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and we reduced our debt position to $27.6 million, but our primary focus for 2021 is untapping the potential at tucano. in the 90-kilometer by 30-kilometer tenement package that we wholly own in brazil.
this really is a year for the geologists. and to that end, this quarter, we saw a significant ramp-up in drilling at tucano with a 68% increase in meters drilled over the same quarter last year. our exploration team is headed up by nick winer, a seasoned geologist with extensive experience, particularly at tucano. we plan to do 60,000 meters at tucano this year and we have four exploration drills on the sites with another two rigs on their way.
the three-pronged exploration program will focus on near-mine open-pit targets, underground targets, as well as, the regional targets. in march, we announced encouraging results from the open pit drill program which is focused on the shallow tap c pit which is located between the tap ab pits and the urucum pits that are currently in production. these results demonstrate the continuity of open pit-able sulfide mineralization below the current tap c pit floor. i'll now turn it over to neil hepworth, our chief operating officer to discuss the operations in more detail.
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
ok. thanks, rob. focusing first on tucano, gold production for the quarter was 22,996 ounces, compared with the 26,176 ounces in q1 2020. this is a 12% decrease, but it's attributed to the lower ore production in the mine, reduced process plant availability in lower grades.
tucano processed a higher proportion of low-grade stockpile material this quarter due to the focus on stripping of the upper levels and position of mining activity relative to the ore in the lower benches. production was also affected by seasonal weather and a disruption to our oxygen supply. during the wet season, normally from january through june, production rates are lower than during the dry season which is normal july into december. purchase of oxygen supply was affected as scheduled deliveries were redirected to brazil's hospitals to meet much needed demand related to the pandemic.
shortages in the purchased oxygen supply are expected to decrease recovery rates and reduce throughput at tucano over the next few months. aisc for the quarter was $1,549 an ounce. this is a 12% improvement over q1 2020 which is mainly due to the weakening of the brazilian real. as rob said, we had four diamond drill rigs turning in this quarter focused on near-mine resource definition specifically at tap c open pit and urucum north underground.
the focus on the urucum north underground drilling is to better define the upper high-grade shallow north-plunging ore shoot, specifically, looking at the up-plunge area to the south to guide location of an exploration and underground access run. in q1, approximately 2,800 meters were drills of the 8,000 meter drill program. ok. turning to tap c.
the initial results from tap c open pit drill program were announced subsequent to the end of the quarter. in the first phase drill program conducted in q1, the grades in which we are seeing are good, but what excited the team most at these results is that these results indicate continuity of the mineralization down to 70 meters below the current pit which is sitting at 50 meters deep. these results have helped us put together a high confidence model that is being used to target further testing in the second phase drill program currently under way. we believe that this new model and ongoing drilling will allow inclusion of the tap c open pit in the next mineral resource statement for tucano.
in mexico, our focus on stricter management controls in our stopes is resulting in reduced dilution and improvement in grades. at the guanajuato mine complex, a total of 279,306 silver equivalent ounces were produced with silver recoveries of 86.1% and average solvent grades of 124 grams a tonne. total recoveries were 86.5% and the average gold rate was 1.53 grams per tonne. production was down 29% over q1 2020, mainly because of lower throughput due to covid-related workforce shortages.
this was essentially reduced supervision due to vulnerable workers being -- staying at home. the aisc was $332 per payable ounce of silver compared with $14.21 in q1 2020. this is reflecting the lower sales given lower production and higher local currency operating cost that were partly due to some one-off costs related to restructuring and covid. at topia, the total production was 363,318 silver equivalent ounces, a decrease of 3%, compared to q1 last year.
average grades of 398 grams per tonne silver and 0.87 grams per tonne of gold were achieved, along with byproducts of lead and zinc. metal recoveries were 92.4% for silver and 55.4% for gold. aisc per payable ounce was $18.71 versus $17.73 in q1 2020 due mainly to higher local currency operating costs and lower input due to covid-related workforce shortage. in this case, it was mass tests that just took place over a couple of weeks.
at coricancha, our development project in peru, negotiations with the local community were advanced and work started in preparation for the planned drill program in q2. this drill program is targeting high-grade zones that are readily accessible to mine. i will now turn the call over to great panther's vice president, finance, shawn turkington, to discuss our financial results.
shawn turkington -- vice president of finance -- analyst
thank you, neil. the strong metal price environment we are experiencing has provided great tailwinds for our financials over the last year. q1 2021 saw revenues of $52.6 million, an increase of 9% over q1 2020, thanks to higher realized metal prices of $1,750 for gold and $25.35 for silver, representing an increase of 11% and 66%, respectively. this in turn led to an increase of 85% in mine operating earnings to $11 million from $6 million in q1 2020.
consolidated aisc approval that were sold, excluding corporate g&a, was $1,557, an 11% decrease, compared with q1 2020, mainly due to the benefit of a weakening brazilian currency and higher average realized metal prices. during the quarter, we settled the final forward exchange contracts that were entered into at the end of 2019 and early 2020 as part of our risk management strategy to reduce the exposure of our costs at tucano due to foreign exchange fluctuation. the weakness of the brl all experienced in q1 2020 contributed to a net loss in that quarter of $4.5 million. for the current quarter, our net loss was $300,000 adjusted ebitda of $12.4 million, an improvement of 94% over the same quarter in 2020.
currently, we have no forward currency contracts in place. cash flow from operating activities before changes in noncash working capital was $7.3 million, a significant improvement from $894,000 in q1 2020. during q1 2021, we also paid down borrowings of $5.8 million, bringing our total borrowings to $27.6 million at quarter end and closed the quarter with $45.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. thank you.
that's all we have for formal remarks. i will now turn it back to the operator for the q&a.

[operator instructions] and the first question comes from heiko ihle with h.c. wainwright. please go ahead.
tyler bisset -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
hey, guys. this is tyler bisset on for heiko. thank you for taking our questions.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
tyler bisset -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
you provided some drill results for tucano on april 7th and reiterated the focus on drilling in your news release today. you previously had a focus on the tap c pit situated between the tap ab and the urucum pits that are the current focus of production at tucano. can you walk us through your focus and plans for the rest of the year in a bit more detail? and what are you seeing with cost and timing for drill results?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i appreciate the question. yeah, we released the results because we were thought they're pretty significant in that we have discovered mineralization on the existing seven-kilometer trend that is beneath some very shallow pits. so the results were to essentially model the geologic continuity of the vein.
so we have the proof of concept now. we know that these veins are -- exist beneath a pit so it's very minable material. it's about three kilometers from the plant, so it's easy truckable and the second phase of the program is essentially to do infill drilling to bring those resources onto the books, so we can put them on to the mine plan. so the second phase of tap c is essentially infill to bring them to mineral resources.
the other two prongs of our exploration program are the -- and the biggest one is the region. we have the 90-kilometer by 30-kilometer region which is essentially undrilled. so nick winer is proving up targets and we hope to get diamond drills into some of them this year and that really would be a game changer once we find a regional discovery. and what we're looking for is more open pit material that we can truck to our 10,000 tonne a day mill and then the last one is the underground.
the underground is very intriguing. it's four- to five-gram a tonne, it lies directly beneath our northern most pit which is the urucum pit and the urucum pit is scheduled to be complete next year. so we would have the opportunity to start drilling underground there. so we're doing some more drilling on the underground to prove up exactly how much we could potentially get from an underground mine at urucum.
so the workers -- we're doing there is in order to prepare ourselves for the potential of going underground in urucum once the pit is depleted.
tyler bisset -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
perfect. i appreciate that.
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
ok. i was just going to add a little bit to that as well because i mean, we're pretty excited about these tap c results. because if you remember, i mean, we took a huge hit on our resources in 2019 and a lot of that resources was actually material that was removed from the tap c resource base because basically because rpa didn't understand the model. and now we've got nick winer, who happens to be an expert in structural geology, geophysics, and geochemistry.
he's put together a new model and he's busy sort of tweaking it at the moment. but it's quite exciting because it means we've got a good chance of recapturing a lot of those reserves without -- or resources from 2018 without doing a huge amount of drilling.
tyler bisset -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
i appreciate that. and any sort of timing on when you might expect drill results from phase 2?
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
well, i mean, we're basically aiming to have a new mrmr out before the end of the year, so we'll probably be shutting off the drilling round about the end of july. i mean we're bringing in these two extra rigs and among these basically, i mean, the pit's sort of 50 meters deep and they basically stopped at the base of the oxide. and it actually lends itself to our sending in the rc rig and drilling a fairly closed pattern of holes in there so we could and that with a pretty good idea of what we're going to be mining. so, yeah, i think i think toward the end of july, we'll be cutting off the drilling and sometime october, november, we should be coming up with the revised mrmr for that.
tyler bisset -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
perfect. then just kind of building on that, you had expected the inclusion of tap c in the next mineral reserves and resources statement for tucano. has any new information surfaced in the last 30 days or so that you could use to provide some color on the future for this area?
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
no. i mean, no, not really because i mean we're still doing -- i mean, what we'd started off doing was doing a series of holes along the entire strike length and they all came up positive showing that we've got extension of the mineralization. now we're starting to sort of fill in a little bit on those holes. it's showing the same thing, not so -- so nothing particularly new on that at this stage.
i think that once we -- once sort of nick finishes off the model and that we get the rc drilling done, then i think that's -- then, i think we might end up with another sort of press release before the mrmr.
tyler bisset -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
perfect. appreciate that and one last question, guys. you stressed the workforce shortages that you experienced during the quarter at the gmc and topia mines. are you seeing any meaningful issues in april and may thus far?
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
no, not really. i mean, this is part of the restructuring cost that we picked up at gmc. unfortunately, i mean, a lot of these people that's -- we're having to sort of reorganize the workforce a little bit and bring in a lot of new people to make -- to actually cover those shortages. so, yeah, so i think that's -- we don't expect -- we're expecting things to get better, not worse in terms of the people shortages related to covid.
tyler bisset -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
perfect. that's all for me. i'll hop back in the queue.
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
thank you.
tyler bisset -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
thanks, guys.
operator
the next question comes from joseph reagor with roth capital partners. please go ahead.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for taking the questions.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
i guess, hey, so first thing, on capital spending. you know, it was a bit elevated. i think q1, i think that was part of the plan was for it to be, i think, first half elevated was the prior conversation on that. what should we expect for total capex rest of the year?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, joe. yeah, as noted, the first half of the year is very biased toward stripping costs at tucano. so it's just the mining phase we're in.
so, yeah, we've got to do a lot more capital stripping in q1 and q2 and then we get into higher grades lower down. shawn, i don't know if you have the details on capex spend for the year, but certainly, most of it is in the first half.
shawn turkington -- vice president of finance -- analyst
i don't have the full numbers, but thanks for the question. the deferred stripping costs are heavily weighted toward q1 and tail off by the end of q2, and those are the bulk of our capital costs during the year. so we'd expect the q2 costs will be significantly lower than q1 and we don't expect significant deferred stripping in the second half of the year.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. and then, as far as the first quarter went with that, was it in line with the expectations, a little higher, a little lower?
shawn turkington -- vice president of finance -- analyst
our costs were in line with our expectations.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, pretty much in line. you know, things never go in a straight line. you have some highs and some lows and yeah, we -- i think overall, the team did a really good job and then delivered what they intended to deliver.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. one more on tucano. you guys processed a very high percentage of the low-grade stockpiles in q1. what should we be modeling as far as percentage of total tonnage on a quarterly basis that's coming from those low-grade stockpiles, compared to fresh ore?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. these -- the first two quarters, yeah, we are putting stockpile through because the mining phase is associated with overburden. we do get into the higher grades, so the grades pick up considerably in the second two quarters. so consequently, the stockpile material drops down.
so what we'll see is the gold ounces pick up in q3 and q4 because we stopped mining the stockpiles. so, yeah, the q1 and q2, we are seeing a lot of stockpile material come through q3 and q4. there won't be nearly as much, so grades go up significantly and it stays the same but grade goes up because we are into the better ore in the pits in q3 and q4.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. ok. that's fair enough and then just one on gmc. you guys gave a little bit of color in the release and in your comments on operating costs at gmc being elevated in the quarter.
i think you guys referenced lower -- lower total ounces and slightly higher operating cost. but any color on what you're expecting next quarter to look like and the rest of the year to look like? obviously, the $22.57 was quite elevated on a cash cost basis.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it is. and as neil said, i think gmc has probably been one of our facilities that have been most impacted by covid. just that affects your labor productivity and your ability to mine safely, so we did see a number of inefficiencies at gmc in the quarter and covid cases have dropped significantly. so we do expect things to get better going forward.
so we would expect gmc to get back on track and they are improving as we speak. so i think gmc, we can expect much better results from in the second half of the year and particularly, as silver price gets up to where it is now, the ability to generate cash improves significantly at gmc.
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
i mean, rob, could i just add a little bit to that?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
i think one of the -- i mean, as i said, there's been a fair amount of sort of restructuring at gmc that cost us quite a bit of money, but it's probably worth it. but one of the things that we've done is we brought the general manager from coricancha and we -- he's now located at guanajuato working at the gmc mine. and this guy is an exceptionally strong manager technically and in terms of dealing with people and he's already sort of like grasped things extremely firmly, and one of the things he's jumped into is the dilution and dilution control. so there's a huge amount of work that's going on there in terms of getting that sort of under control.
so i think the things -- you know, i think he's also looking at introducing another shaft to the mine in some of the places where we've got the reasonable ventilation. so i think things are going to be moving forward extremely positive in this quarter and in the next quarter going onwards. that's my contribution.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thank you. i'll turn it over.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, joe.
operator
the next question comes from matthew o'keefe with cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thanks, operator. good morning, good afternoon. just a couple of questions for me. first off, can you talk a little bit more about the oxygen shortage and the impact that it's going to have? i mean, basically, how badly does that impact recoveries sort of quantifiably? and how long -- what's the best estimate for getting your supply back?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt.
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
shall i take this, rob?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
i'll take it.
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
ok.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's -- i think what you've seen in the results that recoveries are impacted by about 2% to 3%. you know, we do have a supply of oxygen, but it's not a good stuff. the good stuff was diverted to hospitals to help with the covid case. the good news is that we do have oxygen back at site again, it came on last week.
so, you know, that to me, it indicates two things. one, the hospitals are not urgently needing oxygen anymore, so that's really good for the communities. and two, you know, we do have oxygen back again at our plant, so we expect recoveries to get back up again to where they should be, i think in the 91%, 92% range. so of course, oxygen could disappear again if covid hospitals need it.
but right now, things are stable and we have our oxygen supply back, so it's good news.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. so that 88.6% recovery, that was reflective -- that you had this quarter was reflective of the oxygen shortage?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
correct.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. got it. ok. and then as far as -- we're always struggling here a little bit with the grade profile at tucano quarter to quarter.
i guess it was about 0.9% feed grade -- i'm sorry, 0.9 grams per tonne feed grade this quarter. so is first quarter similar for the second quarter? do we see a little raise there and then higher in q3, q4? like is it ramping up or is it a step-up?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's really -- it's a story of halves and not quarters.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yeah.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
the first half of the year, you know, the second quarter is going to be similar, maybe a little bit better than the first quarter, but the big increases come in q3 and q4. that's when we're into the high-grade ore.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
right. is that -- ok, similar to what we saw in sort of the second and third quarter of 2020 kind of range?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i don't have the numbers on hand, but certainly, the budget for this year is --
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
like 1.3, 1.4 grams or one yeah --
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
55% of our production comes from the second half of the year and 45% comes from the first half, so you know, you can use that math.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. so we're still holding our guidance? you're still holding to the original guidance for the year?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
that is correct.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. ok. yeah. that was it for me.
i mean, all eyes on tucano and really looking forward to the -- to ongoing explorations -- some exploration success.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from spencer leman, a private investor. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- private investor
hi, guys. i came in a little bit late, so i might have missed if you've commented on the gmc tailings and that situation. did you talk about that yet?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
um, good morning. neil can address that question.
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
yeah. the situation at the moment is that we've got sort of two embankment raises in the process of being permitted, that's lifts 18 and 19 and what happened is that the environmental people have handled it. this -- obviously, the water authority is conagua, to basically -- to give their ruling on it. they're looking after the big dams now.
so we're still waiting for conagua to get back. we should have actually already had the results about a month ago, we should have had it. but unfortunately, they changed the director at conagua, so that's delayed things a little bit. so in the meantime, we've done some modifications to the way that we put the material in there, the way we deposit and we've managed to gain ourselves some capacity up until the first week in july.
so we're hoping that this will be resolved. the new director should have sort of like sort of bedded themselves in by now and being able to sort of make some decisions and things. and we're obviously pressurizing them all the time to do that, but -- so we're hoping that that's going to come about. now we have a couple of plan bs, but i'm not sure whether they've sort of fully just disclosed yet.
rob? can i talk about toll milling?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
um, sure.
neil hepworth -- chief operating officer
yeah. so we've been approached by one operator that's sort of within reasonable trucking distance of guanajuato that could take at least all of our production from the guanajuato mines. so we have that sort of plan b and there's other people around us as well that could possibly take some of the san ignacio. so that's -- so the plan a is that we sit tight and keep on pressurizing conagua for that permit and the plan b, is that we go toll milling.
now we've already done a whole bunch of sums looking at what sort of rates we need to do this and it doesn't look that bad to be -- funnily enough, but anyway, that's the situation at the present.
unknown speaker -- private investor
ok. thank you for that.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
this concludes the question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to rob henderson for any closing remarks.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for their time today. just to emphasize that our consolidated production guidance remains unchanged at 135,000 to 150,000 gold equivalent ounces. we do expect the second half of 2021 to account for over 55% of this production and our aisc to be within guided range as we move into the better sectors at tucano. i'm pleased to report that we ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet.
our mines are performing as expected and our exploration is delivering results that will contribute to the future at tucano. so on behalf of everyone here at great panther, i look forward to sharing our progress with you in the next quarter, and thank you for your time today.

operator
thank you for standing by. this is the conference operator. welcome to great panther mining second-quarter 2021 results conference call. as a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded.
after the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to fiona grant leydier, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead. 
fiona grant leydier -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone. i'm fiona grant leydier. thank you for participating in our call today.
before we begin, please note that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation. you should be cautioned that actual results and future events may differ from those noted in today's presentation. the commentary also refers to various non-gaap measures, definitions, and reconciliations that are included in the company's md&a for the three months ended june 30, 2021. all dollar amounts expressed in this presentation and the associated financial statements and md&a are in u.s.
dollars unless otherwise noted. for reference during the call, aisc refers to all-in sustaining costs. detailed cautionary statements can be found at the end of the presentation. i would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay later today.
replay information and the presentation slides accompanying this conference call and webcast will be available on our website at greatpanther.com. on the call this morning, we have rob henderson, president and ceo; sandra daycock, chief financial officer; and fernando cornejo, chief operating officer. 
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, fiona, and thank you, everyone, for dialing in today. i'm very pleased to have sandra and fernando in the room with me today, two significant promotions within our leadership team. sandra daycock was promoted from vice president, corporate finance and treasury, to chief financial officer; and fernando cornejo, previously vice president of operations in brazil, was appointed chief operating officer. i've been with the company for a full year now, and i'm very pleased with the team's performance to date.
covid-19 has certainly made things complicated, but our team has shown me how they can adapt quickly and work effectively despite the hardships. during the quarter, we remain fully committed to our covid-19 protocols and, in particular, maintaining awareness about prevention practices across the organization, as well as in our surrounding communities. as i have emphasized before, this is a year for exploration for great panther. our team has had some very nice results from tucano in the quarter, and the high-grade intersections we reported from the urucum north deposits are very encouraging.
q2 was a challenging quarter from a production viewpoint, but i'm pleased to say that in july, ahead of schedule, we safely recommenced mining of ore at tucano's urucum central south open pit. in may, we had temporarily suspended mining of ore at ucs for safety reasons due to movement detected in the west wall of the pit. this suspension led to reduced production in q2, as well as higher costs related to the additional stripping and the remediation to ensure wall stability. production is now ramping back up, and the higher-grade ore that we didn't mine in q2 will now be mined in the upcoming quarters.
in the second quarter, consolidated metal production was 27,722 gold equivalent ounces, inclusive of 22,804 ounces of gold and 334,423 ounces of silver. the suspension of mining of ore from ucs resulted in lower revenue for the quarter than originally forecast. however, those ounces, about 10,000 in total, will be mined in upcoming quarters and will contribute to our overall revenue for 2021 and into next year 2022. although mining of ore at ucs was temporarily halted, we continue to operate with a full mining fleet on stripping activities and continued our exploration and capital programs.
these are significant investments required to position great panther for future growth. as a result, our costs went up and our unit costs increased. all-in sustaining costs, excluding corporate g&a, were $2,021 per gold ounce sold, compared with $1,027 in q2 2020. these higher costs are attributed to the additional stripping at ucs, as well as processing of lower-grade stockpile material, which resulted in fewer ounces produced and sold.
our quarterly revenue was $52.1 million, and mine operating earnings was $7.2 million. we ended the quarter with $35.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and we reduced our borrowings to $26.3 million. given the lack of progress in securing permits to expand our tailings facility at gmc in mexico, we have adjusted down our consolidated annual 2021 guidance to a range of 120,000 to 130,000 ounces of gold equivalent for the year. we've also reviewed and revised our consolidated guidance for aisc, taking account the lower anticipated production and the high costs experienced in q2 2021.
so we expect our annual aisc to range from $1,700 to $1,800 per gold ounce sold. so what this means is that the second half of the year, we expect to produce about 60,000 to 70,000 ounces of gold equivalent at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,550 to $1,675 per gold equivalent ounce sold. in june, we published our 2020 sustainability report, mining for good. this report highlights our progress in the areas of health and safety, environmental responsibility, and community engagement and development.
and i'm pleased to say that in 2020, we adopted an official diversity policy, and we achieved 24% of leadership positions now held by women. we had zero environmental incidents and improved our lost time injury frequency rate by 57%. safety is a key area of focus for us, and we continue working across the organization on new initiatives this year to further strengthen our safety practices. i'm very proud of how the team has delivered on our sustainability mandate and encourage everyone to read the report, which is available on our website at greatpanther.com.
i'll now pass it over to fernando cornejo to discuss results from operations. 
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
thank you, rob, and good morning, everyone. focusing first on tucano. gold production for the quarter was 20,696 ounces, compared with 35,421 ounces in q2 2020, a 42% decrease related to lower ore production due to temporary suspension of mining in urucum central south, which resulted in the processing of lower-grade material from stockpiles and ore from the urucum north pit with lower recovery rates. the second half of 2021 is expected to account for 60% of production guidance, which, for tucano, is expected to be between 100,000 and 105,000 ounces of gold in the year.
all-in sustaining costs for the quarter was $2,214 per gold ounce sold, compared with $982 in q2 2020, due to lower gold production, higher operating costs due to additional reclaiming of stockpiles, and higher stripping costs at ucs. a total of 1.4 million tonnes of waste material was removed in q2 and a further 1.2 million tonnes is expected to be removed in q3. moving forward, groundwater monitoring and water management will be key to continue operations in urucum central south. the installation of the cylinders in groundwater monitoring stations will be completed over the next two months.
we are evaluating the installation of vertical drains to maintain a higher degree of control over phreatic levels in the west wall, especially when mining at pit. as rob mentioned earlier, exploration efforts at tucano have been producing some very promising results. to date, over 17,281 meters of drilling have been completed for the near mine and regional programs. the exploration team will continue with the drilling program over the next two quarters to achieve the 60,400-meter annual target.
at tap c, drilling continues to intersect mineralization down to 70 meters below the current pit. the drilling, along with our reevaluation of historical data, has led to an improved understanding of the controls of mineralization in a new geological model that will be integrated into the next mineral resource statement for tucano later in the year. at urucum north, a series of deep holes were drilled to test the deeper portions and down-plunge extension of the urucum north hybrid zone. results from this drilling program demonstrate the potential for additional near gold production, and we are expediting studies to support a production decision next year.
in addition, drilling intercepted high-grade mineralization near-surface, which we believe could further extend the urucum north open pit. to date, the regional soil sampling has been completed, along 438-line kilometers of the budgeted 500 kilometers, and the geochemistry results are currently under evaluation. drilling is scheduled for the second half of the year to test regional targets once this evaluation is complete. the main areas of focus will be targets within 20-kilometer radius of the mine, which includes mutum and lona amarela.
at the guanajuato mine complex in mexico, a total of 284,883 silver equivalent ounces were produced with silver recoveries of 87.4% and an average silver grade of 118 grams per tonne. gold recoveries were 87.6%, and the average gold grade was 1.58 grams per tonne. production increased 111% when compared with q2 2020. this variance is associated with the suspension of activities in the second quarter of 2020 due to covid-19.
all-in sustaining costs in q2 2021 was $39.3 per payable ounce of silver, compared to the $27.3 in q2 2020, mostly due to higher mine development costs with lower-than-expected ounce production. in terms of permitting, we continue to await approval from conagua for the expansion of the tailings dam storage at gmc. however, as per our news release on july 14, we have identified technical alternatives to extend the tailings capacity under existing permits until december 2021. we continue to proactively engage with conagua to help expedite the permitting process and we'll provide an update to the market once a resolution has been found.
at topia, total production was 312,259 silver equivalent ounces, an increase of 114%, mainly due to higher throughput, higher grades, and higher recoveries for all metals. contributing to this variance was also the government-mandated shutdown in mexico during q2 2020 due to covid-19. average grades were 432 grams per tonne silver and 1.07 grams per tonne gold, along with byproducts of lead and zinc. metal recoveries were 93.5% silver and 60.3% gold.
all-in sustaining cost per payable ounce was $21.7 versus the $22.3 in q2 2020, mainly due to a higher number of payable silver ounces, which decreased the all-in sustaining cost on a per payable silver ounce basis. at coricancha, a community agreement was received in may, and a 5,000-meter drill program started in july i will now turn the call over to sandra to discuss our financial results. thank you.
sandra daycock -- chief financial officer
thank you, fernando, and good morning. q2 2021 was a difficult quarter. revenues in q2 2021 were $52.1 million, a decrease of 22% over q2 2020, due to lower metal sales volumes, offset partially by higher realized metal prices of $1,818 for gold and $27.45 for silver. mine operating earnings before noncash items decreased from $35.8 million to $7.2 million.
consolidated aisc for gold ounce sold, excluding corporate g&a, was $2,201 compared to $1,027 in q2 2020, primarily due to higher costs at tucano related to the ucs pushback activities. as rob already said, we continue to run a full mining fleet and invest in stripping and remediation activities during the quarter. paired with the reduced balances of production, this resulted in higher costs. this investment, however, is expected to contribute to the company's future growth, and we expect mining to be back to normal in the coming quarters.
net loss was $10.1 million, compared with net income of $8.6 million in q2 2020. adjusted ebitda was negative $0.5 million, compared to $30.2 million. and cash flow from operating activities before changes in noncash working capital was negative $0.9 million, compared with $24.1 million in q2 2020. this decrease is due mainly to higher cash costs attributable to the pushback activities at ucs and lower gold ounces sold, partly offset by higher realized gold and silver prices.
we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, net of working -- net working capital of $9.8 million, and $25.5 million of current borrowing. we've made significant progress in recent quarters in negotiating potential new credit facilities. we expect to finalize these arrangements in the third quarter, which would bolster our working capital position. and thank you.
that's all we have for formal remarks. i'll turn it back now to the operator for question and answers. 
",":
operator
thank you. we will begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from joseph reagor of roth capital partners. please go ahead. 
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, rob and team. thanks for taking my questions.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
so, i guess, first thing is gmc, you know? can you give us any additional color on what's causing those delays? is it just covid-related issues? or is there more to it than that for the permitting? and then also, can you give us any concept of a handicap of what your expectations are at this point like odds of getting to the finish line by the end of the year?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, joe. yes, it's -- i think we're not the only ones experiencing this issue with permits. we are engaged with conagua, but we have not had a formal response from them yet. so it is a frustrating process in mexico right now regarding mining permits.
we -- as i noted, we do have capacity to the end of the year, but we do have to make capital decisions. we need to invest into development at gmc. and unless we get more certainty around our ability to secure those permits. you know, we're questioning whether we can actually run to the end of the year.
so, the engagement with conagua is still going on, but the response has been disappointing to date. so that's why we decided to adjust our guidance downwards based on our lower expectation of getting those permits in time to make the necessary capital decisions.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. fair enough. and then on a capital spend basis, i realize there's a little uncertainty at gmc. but first half of the year has been, you know, $27 million, $28 million, something like that, that you guys have spent on capex.
what does the second half of the year look like? and maybe what are the largest components of it?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so the first half of the year was a stripping-intensive half, and we knew that going into the year, we had to spend more than budgeted in q2. but certainly, capex in the second half of the year is going to be a lot lower. sandra, can you give any color on that?
sandra daycock -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, the capex -- the three components in the capex is stripping and capital and also exploration. and we have invested heavily in the first half in exploration, but we do expect to increase that somewhat in the second half now that we have better access to drill rigs. and the capital expenditure for the second half is more weighted to the second half on certain projects -- cost-saving projects initiatives primarily in tucano.
the stripping will reduce significantly, as we've already guided, in the second half as we reach the higher-grade ore body in ucs.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. and is there any -- you know, even a wide range you guys could put around it on a dollar number basis?
sandra daycock -- chief financial officer
i think we're reviewing all our capex, so i think it would be premature to put a dollar range at this point.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. understandable. i'll turn it over.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, joe.
operator
our next question comes from jake sekelsky of alliance global partners. please go ahead. 
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, jake.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
just looking at tucano from a grade perspective for the second half, do you think some of that higher-grade material is going to make it into the mine plan, you know, in the latter part of the third quarter? or do you think that's more of a fourth quarter-type of event? 
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
yeah. hi, jake, fernando cornejo here. yes, absolutely. the higher-grade material from urucum central south is starting to be mined as of now.
and the grades are expected to increase over the next two quarters, starting now in august.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. and then on the underground scenario at tucano, i know you've seen some drill results there.
when do you think that more comprehensive update will come out? will it be around the time of the resource update toward year-end?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
what we intend to do there, jake, is to carry on drillings through the year-end, and the studies will probably be complete in the first half of next year to enable us a decision to put down an access portal in the second half of the year. so in summary, we're going to carry on drilling to the end of the year. the study is going to be complete in the first half of next year, and the expectation is that we would start going underground in the second half of next year.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
ok. perfect. and then lastly, back to mexico, just sort of building on one of joe's questions. any color on the remaining capacity there? and how quickly do you think you can move forward with some of the other areas that you've identified, if that's the route that you choose?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the -- you know, we're doing a bunch of studies on what we can do as alternative tailings storage options, including a dry stack. the problem with that is we will need permits to do dry stack as well. and we're back into a log jam of one to two years to get the permits for an alternate tailings solution.
so, you know, we continue to push for our lifts on the existing facility, which would give us another five years. and in parallel, we're looking at alternative options for dry stack, but that will require a new permit. and so we may have to hit a pause button at gmc in order to get those new tailings permits for an alternative facility.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
got it. ok. that's all for me. thanks, again.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. 
operator
our next question comes from heiko ihle of h.c. wainwright. please go ahead.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
hey there, thanks for taking my question.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, heiko.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
hey, there. good afternoon. i'm in europe. it's 6 p.m.
here. but related to the improvement in the ucs wall stability, you state that you have already removed, and that is a quote, approximately 1.4 million tonnes of waste material from the upper west wall of the ucs pit, with a further 1.2 million tonnes planned to be removed in q3. i was mentally trying to see how much 2.6 million tonnes really is and then, frankly, failed. but i do understand numbers.
so building on that, can you provide some color of approximately what you pay to move each tonne? and also, looking ahead, are there efficiencies where costs go down by doing it more and more? or vice versa, does it get more expensive to haul stuff as you got to haul it up more? 
sandra daycock -- chief financial officer
so, it's sandra. we don't generally guide on our cost structure for competitive reasons, but it's typical in the industry.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, you know, it's not so much a cost issue that we're facing. it's access to the pit and delay in getting those ounces. so yes, it's not a lot of tonnage.
we can move that tonnage in a month, really. so it's not the volume that's the issue. it's getting access to the ore at the bottom of the pit which has hindered us. so, now that we are back in there, we've still got some final smoothing to do on that wall.
so that's the balance of work that we expect to happen in this quarter. but the main focus is that we're back in the pits and mining efficiently again. so we do have access to those higher-grade zones of ore, which we were prevented accessing in q2 for safety reasons.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
fair. second question, and i'm asking this because the topic came up on another call earlier today. what are you seeing with treatment charges in mexico? are you seeing any meaningful improvements? and i have a feeling i want to get the -- we can't talk about this for competitive reasons. but can you quantify what you're seeing as well?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
you're talking about our smelter returns? or are you talking about the mill efficiencies?
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
no, the smelters.
sandra daycock -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean that's pretty sensitive information. so, yeah, we do -- we contract our charges on an annual basis and put them up for tender each year. so, we probably defer a comment on that.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
ok. so, thank you.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from matthew o'keefe of cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thanks, operator. good morning. just some follow-up here on tucano. first off, tucano and a quick question on gmc.
so on tucano, the ucs pit, you'll be getting into there now to get a high grade. is that it for ucs this year? or how many -- how much more time do we have? or how much more will ucs be contributing to the overall mine plan? and where else are you getting ore from to feed the mill? 
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
yes. good morning. ucs, as per the current mine plan, will extend into 2022, perhaps for one additional quarter. and that will be part of the sequence for next year as well. 
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. so, we won't be seeing a recurring issue with pit wall stability there? 
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
that's correct. i mean the overall strategy behind installing distometers and water monitoring holes and having drains is to prevent water accumulation or increasing on the phreatic level during the rainy season. so that will give us some assurance that, once we go into the rainy season, which starts normally by december, we will have some control over that phreatic level and continue mining at depth safely.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok, ok. thanks. and then going back to mexico here with gmc. i know you're -- so it sounds like things aren't going to -- going, as well as planned there.
you'll be -- if you do shut down, what will your care and maintenance cost be roughly? and are you looking at -- were there -- was there some discussion about toll milling options? are there any options on that as well?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, obviously, we haven't come to a decision yet. we're just probability weighting things. we've got to make those decisions this quarter, but toll milling is an option. there are two other operators in the region with mill capacity, so that may be an option.
so whether -- a decision on care and maintenance has not been made yet, but there are some alternatives that we are actively looking at.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
no, i understand that you haven't made that decision, but you must be kind of -- i mean it sounds like we're going in that direction. so is there -- cost wouldn't be that severe to put it on care and maintenance. and i mean, if it's just a matter of timing on this permit, it might be, what, another year or something? 
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, exactly. so, you know, an option is for us to carry on mining and then do toll milling in nearby mill, so that is actively under consideration.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
do you have a preferred option?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
not yet. so, work is in progress.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. all right.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
we don't have certainty on the permit. so, that's making things a little bit complicated.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yeah, you don't even have a -- you said you didn't have a response. so that's a bit troubling, too. so, yeah.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
it is. if it was -- if we had a response today, it would make things a lot clearer, but we're dealing with levels of grayness and uncertainty.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
right. got it. ok. i'll leave it there.
thank you.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from troy george, private investor. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
thank you for taking my call. i had a couple of questions. first, you foresee -- do you foresee profitability in 2021 at the end of the year?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, troy. so, you know, we do expect to produce 60,000 to 70,000 ounces of gold in the second half of the year at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,550 to $1,675. so, short answer is yes. 
unknown speaker
ok. great. that's great to hear. and then the new discovery at tucano, is that going to extend the mine life, do you believe? 
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely. the -- it will extend mine life. but the most important thing is the grades. we're looking at much higher grades in the underground and even, in fact, in the urucum north near surface.
so the work in the second half of the year is looking at how we would capture those higher grades into the mine plan, which would increase production. 
unknown speaker
great. fantastic. and then i had a comment. i have to follow up avino mines.
and they had problems for over a year, getting approval from the mexican government because of covid. i don't know if you might want to give them a call and see how they finally got through. ok. thanks.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
this concludes the question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to rob henderson for any closing remarks.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, operator. the investments we've made, not only into tucano to ensure the stability of the pit wall at ucs but also into significant mine development and exploration at all of our operations, we -- i believe will contribute significantly to the future growth of the company as exploration is the key to unlocking the value of our land package in brazil. we expect to have a steady stream of news informing you of our exploration results in the coming months. along with the strength of our new leadership team, great panther is well-positioned for growth, both organically and through accretive acquisition opportunities that will further grow our production profile.
so, on behalf of everyone here at great panther, i look forward to sharing our progress with you in the next quarter. and thank you for your time today.

operator
thank you for standing by. this is the conference operator. welcome to great panther mining third quarter 2021 financial results conference call. as a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded.
after the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions]. i would now like to turn the conference over to fiona grant leydier, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
fiona grant leydier -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone. i'm fiona grant leydier. thank you for participating in our call today.
before we begin, please note that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation. you should be cautioned that actual results and future events may differ from those noted today. the commentary also refers to various non-gaap measures, definitions, and reconciliations that are included in the company's md&a for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2021. all dollar amounts expressed in this presentation and the associated financial statements and md&a are in u.s.
dollars, unless otherwise noted. for reference, during the call, aisc refers to all-in sustaining costs. detailed cautionary statements can be found at the end of the presentation. for today's call, please refer to the q3 2021 financial results news release issued yesterday and the accompanying financial statements and md&a which were posted on our website and have been filed on sedar and edgar.
this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay later today. replay information and the presentation slides accompanying this conference call and webcast will be available on our website. on the call this morning, we have rob henderson, president and ceo; sandra daycock, chief financial officer; and fernando cornejo, chief operating officer. 
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, fiona, and thank you everyone for dialing in today. on today's call, we will walk you through our third quarter production and financial results, as well as spend some time discussing our plan to address the challenges we have in our operations. we provide some revised 2021 guidance and some preliminary forward-looking guidance for 2022, to give you a clear picture of the company's outlook. our tucano gold mine in brazil has optionality that affords us the opportunity to shift gears and source production from multiple other open pits plus a high grade underground reserves.
the high geological perspective of the region also underpins the long-term value of tucano as we continue to invest in the regional expiration targets. the land package and the potential for a second or even third mine is where the long-term value exists for great panther and shareholders.q3 was undoubtedly a challenging quarter. at tucano poor mine fleet availability related to maintenance and supply issues lead to lower tonnage in mine, and a delay in the completion of the urucum central south or ucs pit pushback activities. in mexico, the implementation of new labor laws lead to temporary staff shortages resulting in delays in tonnage mined.
in addition production at the gmc mine was primarily from historically mined areas and actual tonnages available were lower than estimated. and as a result, our consolidated metal production was 22,444 gold equivalent ounces, which included 18,423 ounces of gold and 280,245 ounces of silver. as we reported in the second quarter, the ucs pushback activities were expected to continue into the third quarter. therefore, low grade ore was mined from the urucum north pit and it was supplemented by stock power resulting in lower average grades in the mill.
and this resulted in an increase in our unit costs. lower metal sales volumes and lower prices for all metals resulted in a revenue of 38.4 million, a mine operating loss of 7.1 million, and a net loss of 18 million. we ended the quarter with 35.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. turning our focus now to events subsequent to quarter end.
we made the difficult decision to put the guanajuato mine and the cata processing plant on care and maintenance at the end of november. this course of action was necessary given the uncertainty related to the permitting required to expand the tailings storage facilities at our cata plant. we intend to operate the higher grade san ignacio mine and we're exploring alternative arrangements for the mine, including third-party processing of ore. in mid-october following a review of ongoing monitoring of the ucs pits, we're advised by tucano's geotechnical committee that additional remediation work would be required to improve safety factors.
and we've decided to postpone this work to mid-2022, so that this remediation can be done more effectively following the rainy season. and now we turn our attention to optimize the mine plan to manage cash flow and safeguard strong production for next year. limited mining of ore had been authorized in the southern portion of the ucs pit. so we will continue mining there until the end of this year.
it's important to note that ucs is just one of many pits at tucano. the contained ounces are relatively low and it is not the driver of future of growth for the mine. we have a total of seven pits at tucano including tap ab, which accounts to the majority of our current reserves. we're doing the work to adapt the mine plan, looking at how much we'll be able to mine from ucs, how soon we can deploy the fleet to tap ab, and how to make the best use of our resources to optimize production next year.
initial engineering designs indicates that our production will be weighted to the back half of 2022. the first half will see production continue from urucum north and tap c, while we invest in the stripping of tap ab. and we're looking at how that stripping can be accelerated to bring tap ab onstream sooner. in the first half of 2022, we plan to complete the work necessary to accelerate our plans to bring on the urucum north underground project into production, where we have roughly 288,000 ounces of reserves.
with approval expected in q2, production could come onstream as early as q4 next year. we also plan to continue investing to secure future production from tucano by a continued regional exploration. our tucano exploration budget for 2022 is planned to be roughly in the same order of magnitude as it was this year. however, we'll be undertaking the majority of this work in the second half of 2022, when we expect stronger operating cash flow.
i'll now pass it over to fernando cornejo, our chief operating officer to discuss results from our operations.
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
thank you, rob, and good morning, everyone. focusing first on tucano. gold production for the quarter was 16,325 ounces, compared to the 31,803 ounces in q3 2020. average gold recovery was 88.8% as a consequence of lower gold rates at 0.64 grams per ton.
the decreasing production was mostly related to low ounce mine in urucum central south pit, which was affected by low fleet availability, geotechnical restrictions due to slow movement, and higher than anticipated rate levels. low fleet availability also affected mining rates in other pits, such as tap ab and urucum north. during the quarter, lower grade ore from the stockpiles supplemented fresh one from the urucum central south and urucum north pits. despite the high plant throughput, lower feed grades and lower metal recoveries resulted in an increased asic with an average of $2,051 per ounce, compared with the $1,061 per ounce in q3 2020.
as rob mentioned earlier, the tucano geotechnical committee advised that an additional pushback will be required to improve safety factors in north central portion of the pit. at the same time, the committee after a site visit and evaluation of the overall situation from the ground authorized the company to continue mining in the southern portion of the pit, which remains stable as per rate of monitory. the company has decided to defer additional pushback activities until mid-2022, right after the rainy season. this to ensure safe conditions for our workers and also to ramp down mining activities in the southern portion of the pit by the end of december.
as a reference, the rainy season in that part of brazil typically runs from january for about six months. the geotechnical analysis and modeling is still ongoing. therefore we do not know yet the size of this pushback. more information will be provided once we know more.
on the exploration front, we saw some very promising results in q3. we completed a total of 15,000 meters of drilling both in the open pits and the underground. the underground drilling program, which has started in late 2020, continued throughout q3. we are fast-tracking studies for this development to support the start-up decision in late 2022.
the project has ambition as a 40,000 to 50,000 ounce per year underground mine; plan to extract ore from below the current urucum north open pit. moving onto tap c, the resource replacement and expansion drilling conducted in this pit has demonstrated continuity of mineralization. in regards to the regional exploration of our nearly 2,000 square kilometer land package, this year, we've started with extensive soil sampling campaign and a mapping program over high potential exploration corridors, which were defined last year. as results are received, drill targets are being defined within these corridors.
the regional exploration program focuses on the identification and fast-tracking of gold targets within a 20 kilometer radius of the mine that could be exploited by authentic methods and processed by the tucano plant. the mutum trend is the first of eight high priority exploration targets being evaluated with multi element soil geochemistry. q3 exploration results have shown that mutum has a continuous 3.8 kilometer long elevated gold trend. drill testing is planned to commence this month and continue into 2022.at guanajuato complex in mexico, a total of 278,000 silver equivalent ounces were produced, with silver recoveries averaging 87.1% and average silver grades of around 240 grams per ton.
total recoveries were 86.4% and average gold grades were 1.64 grams per ton. production was decreased by around 17% due to lower throughput and lower silver grades. the lower throughput was mainly related to the implementation of new labor laws in mexico, which led to labor shortages at the mine. this was also paired with lower than estimated production from historically mined areas.
as a result of this lower production, the aisc was $46.9 per ounce of silver, compared to the 18.8 in q3 2020. as rob noted earlier, the company has made difficult decision to put the guanajuato mine and the cata processing plant on care and maintenance at the end of this month. at topia, total production was 242,000 silver equivalent ounces, a decrease of 37% mostly related to lower throughput and lower grades in gold, lead, and zinc. the lower throughput was related to the implementation of new labor laws in mexico, very similar to gmc.
the average grades in q3 were around 373 grams per ton silver, 0.64 grams per ton gold, along with byproducts of lead and zinc. metal recoveries were 93.7% silver, 72.2% for gold. at coricancha in peru, a 5,000-meter drill program commenced in july, focusing on the escondida, wellington, and constancia base. the drilling program was completed in late october, with finalized rates to be received by the end of this year.
i will now turn the call to sandra daycock, cfo, to discuss our financial results.
sandra daycock -- chief financial officer
thank you, fernando. in the third quarter, revenue was $38.4 million, a decrease of 50% over q3 2020 due to lower metal sales volumes and lower metals prices of $1,780 per ounce for gold and $22.79 per ounce for silver. the mine operating loss before non-cash items was $7.1 million, versus mine-operating earnings of $31.9 million in q3 2020.consolidated aisc per gold ounce sold excluding corporate g&a was $2,247, compared with $1,023, primarily due to lower production attributed to lower grades and recoveries, which resulted in an increase in cost per gold ounce sold. as of july 1, 2021, the company seized the capitalization of mining costs for the urucum open pits as all mining costs, including the pushback will be expensed for the remainder of the pit life.
please note that this will result in higher cash costs reported for those pits going forward. the net loss in q3 2021 was $18 million, compared with net income of $18.6 million in q3 2020. adjusted ebitda was negative $8.8 million, compared with $34.9 million, and cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital was negative $8.7 million, compared with $26.2 million in q3 2020. this decrease is due primarily to lower gold ounces sold, lower realized gold and silver prices, and higher cash costs stemming from the factors described previously.
we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $35.9 million, net working capital of $3.8 million, and $33.7 million of current borrowings. we secured new 18 month credit facilities with asahi and samsung, and we established a $25 million at the market facility to underpin the company's working capital position and to execute on growth objectives. due to the q3 production disruptions in tucano, we have revised our 2021 production guidance for tucano to between 74,000 and 84,000 gold ounces and consolidated production guidance to a range of 94,000 to 109,000 gold equivalent ounces. please note that there was an inconsistency in the text of our news release that stated tucano guidance as ranging from 70,000 to 80,000 gold ounces although the table provided contain the correct information, as does the company's md&a.
consolidated aisc guidance for 2021 has been increased to a range of 1,950 to $2,050 per gold ounce sold. looking forward to next year, our preliminary mine plans for 2022 include production of up to 100,000 ounces from tucano, approximately 75% of which would be delivered in the second half of the year when the tap ab pit accelerates mining of ore. as we head into 2022, we are cognizant of the need to judiciously manage the capital and we are reviewing a number of potential avenues to set ourselves up for growth in the new year. we have necessary development costs in the first half of the year that will underpin strong cash flow in the second half, and we are managing capital accordingly.
we are also executing on global cost cutting initiatives, managing controllable costs, and prioritizing capital programs. overall, we expect production to be healthy in 2022. thank you. that's all we have for formal remarks.
i will now turn it back to the operator for q&a.

operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]. the first question comes from jake sekelsky with alliance global partners.
please go ahead.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
hey, rob and team, thanks for taking my questions.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
hello jake.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
starting with ucs and i know you talked about deferring some of the pushback activities to the middle of next year. are you able to provide any additional color on the number of ounces remaining there? i guess i'm just wondering if there's been any thought given to fully transitioning away from ucs altogether and moving on to the other pits?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
certainly in our 43-101, we don't give a detailed breakout. but we do give some analysis of what the pits look like and there's probably about six months of production left in ucs. so in the order of 50,000 ounces. so ucs, it's high grades.
we are mining it right now. but it's not the future of tucano. tap ab has over a 100,000 ounces for instance. so we do need to move on from ucs and start extracting the gold from the multiple other pits that are available to us.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
ok. that is helpful. and then in that being with tap ab, i mean, obviously, it's going to count for the majority of production in the second half of next year. it might be a bit early, but do you guys have any indications on sort of the development and stripping costs that we might see there in the first half next year?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we're still getting our budgets, but fernando maybe you can give a bit more color on the nature of tap ab and stripping requirements.
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
absolutely. tap ab is conventionally known as a super mining, because it's soft material easy mining almost free digging. and it's much, much closer to the plant the crushing portion of the plant. so, in terms of costs, we're anticipating that ab will be much cheaper than obviously urucum, which is located six and a half kilometers away from the plant.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
ok. that is helpful. and then, just lastly, on the underground scenario, and you may have played on this if i missed it i apologize. should we still expect a formal study there over the next quarter or so? i know you guys kind of mentioned you might make a development decision later in the year on that front?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we're doing work on that study as we speak. we're continuing to close down to extend it and to confirm the continuity of the higher grade portion. so yes, we would look at getting that result out in the middle of next year.
we would then go to the board for approval to spend the capital, which is in the order of 10 to $15 million. and the mineralization it's vertical banded iron formation that continues just right on from the bottom of the urucum north pit. so we'd be into the mineralization pretty quickly. so, if we get a q2 decision we could see gold coming into the plant as early as the end of next year.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
got it. ok. that is all [inaudible]. thanks again.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jake.
operator
the next question comes from heiko ihle with h.c. wainwright. please go ahead.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, heiko.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
good morning. with the tailing permit at guanajuato, can you provide some color about the terms trucking distances, and just more clarity with the associate costs for the alternative arrangements that you're currently looking into?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, as you know, our tailings facility is reaching capacity. so without a permit for our mill, we're looking at our two neighboring mines to see if they have capacity and they indicated they have. so the san ignacio mine is right next door to the [inaudible] and trucking distance is very short.
on the other side of town, the el cubo mine, the trucking distance is in the order of 15 kilometers. so it's something that we're doing right now. we're trucking our san ignacio ore to the cata plant. and it's been a bit -- it's an established process.
so we're pretty confident that san ignacio has good grades and we can come to some agreements with our neighboring mines for a ore processing agreement.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
ok. and then just thinking out loud here your outlook for the second half of next year tucano is actually pretty good again for the second half. in total, although we have to mine model previously for the full year, given the issues that you've faced in the first half of the year. building on all that extrapolating out the 75% of the 100,000 ounces to the second half, you're looking an average of 37,500 per quarter and we're back on track to at least for how we model this.
with all that said two questions, could we model out the second half 2022 and just sort of keep that figure constant going forward thereafter? and also, i assume the answer is yes, but i just want to double check given that tap ab is, is this a gradual ramp up or should we expect q1 to be more or less the same before it jumps up as this is all done?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yes, very good question. so the -- so tap ab, it's a pretty big pit that's been previously mined, we're currently doing a pushback on the next phase right now. so we do get a steady release of gold and that release does occur in q1 and q2. we do get some production from tap ab, but it accelerates in q3 and carries on into q4 and indeed on to 2023.
so we are -- we do see that tucano is a 100,000 ounce a year open pit producer that's what we're looking at next year and that's what we're looking at 2023. but yes, we've got to get into tap ab and remove a bunch of that soft waste material before we get into the richer or benches, which released the gold into the mill. so, yes, tap ab is a steady ramp up into q3 and then it's sustained into 2023.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from joseph reagor with roth capital partners. please go ahead.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the questions. following a bit on one of heiko's questions, gmc, what can we expect on a throughput basis from saying now, if you do sign one of these off-take agreements or a 12 million agreements?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
it's obviously it's going to be contingent on, what's the neighboring mills can receive. i think, right now the san ignacio mine is the main contributor to our production at gmc. so we would expect that to continue. the cata mine has not provided much ore to the mill in this last year.
so gmcs production this year has predominantly been from san ignacio. so that level, we would hope to continue that next year, obviously, dependent on the ability of the old purchasing agreement, that's still tbd.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok, fair enough. and then just kind of following on a bit of the other guy's questions on tucano. we're just trying to model this out from a cash flow standpoint, do you think you're going to need some form of additional capital in order to fund everything given the low production rates in the first half of the next year? and would your preference be another forward gold sale, some kind of debt facility or equity, if you had to do something?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
i think our balance sheet right now, we've got $36 million in cash, $44 million in debt and sandra is obviously looking at some financing alternatives to us, and maybe she can give some more color on that.
sandra daycock -- chief financial officer
and i'd say yes, i mean, we recently, we have cash on hand as i think we recently reestablished our 25 million atm facility, which we can look to use to supplement our working capital needs. we're looking at all options. we haven't made a decision at this point on any future financing. but so we don't have a preference to answer your question.
but we do have a number of opportunities for exploring.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. and then, the bigger picture up, the problem with tucano is that there's a lot of potential not only in the existing pits, and then the underground but also in the region. is there any opportunity to bring in a neighboring project to kind of accelerate your movement away from ucs?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yes, the -- our tenement at tucano is big, it's 90 kilometers by 30 kilometers. so it's a massive, massive area. to the south of us, we do have an iron ore mine that's getting looking at being reactivated. so the old iron ore mine look might come on to production again in a few years.
but i think our attention right now is to drill the greenstone anomalies that we have in the region. so we've identified three or four very high prospective targets. we've done over 500 kilometer of soil sampling, we've identified mutum as the highest priority project, and we're drilling that as we speak. and we have two others, to the north of the mine, they're all within trucking distance of the mill.
so the thinking is that, this district does have additional potential, and we do need to get into the region. the underground course is also a high priority. so underground, we do have -- we've got the identified underground at urucum north, and we're pushing hard on that one. but again, this is a banded iron formation vertical and the underground opportunities below all of our pits, so we've got to examine those as well.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. fair enough. i will turn it over.
operator
[operator instructions]. the next question comes from matthew o'keefe with cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thanks, operator. thanks for taking my call. just a question here going back to tucano, so i understand your -- so you've got you sourced from several pits. how much now is coming from various pits and tap ab seems to be kind of on deck to be the big provider next year.
what's the cost of the pushback there and what kind of grades are you expecting to get out of tap ab?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
yes, tap ab is kind of our second highest grade. the highest grade we have right now is on urucum central south, tap ab is the next highest and it runs at around about 1.7 grams a ton. in terms of quantity material, fernando, you got some color on that?
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
yes, absolutely. for next year, we're anticipating around 8 to 9 million tons coming from ab 1 as we start drilling into ore. so this is why it's taking around four to five months to get that stripping done.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. and what was the cost of the stripping there? you've mentioned it was pretty soft material.
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
so it's softer material, so with the rates we manage right now is probably below brl 10 per ton.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. i don't know how many times you're going to move. so like, i'm just kind of trying to understand what kind of money has to be invested here or capitalized here to get into it.
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
that's what i said between 8 to 9 million tons that we need to strip or we can probably --
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. i see. i see. ok.
eight to nine, ok.
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
apologies.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
no, that's fine. excuse me. ok, great. and then so [inaudible] is that going to be -- that's not your sole source of rate.
it sounds like you're still taking some from ucs and from other pits but the majority is -- yes.
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
we're scheduling ore coming from urucum north still; we have tap c going live in q1 and q2. and we are basically moving ourselves to start with the stripping in urucum central south by late june next year. and in parallel, we will do maybe one.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. ok. and when i look at the guidance for next year, for tucano. obviously, like you say it's heavily weighted to the second half.
so does that suggest that we're looking at similar to lower grades being produced in the first half. then we saw this like, i think it was 0.64 in this quarter 0.64 grams per ton to the mill. i think so we're going to be seeing similar to lower grades in the first half. and does that also suggest your stockpile is largely done?
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
in lower grades will continue in q1. as we move into q2, they are going to start improving because of tap c and some initial are coming from maybe one in urucum north. but in terms of the stockpiles, yes, we're starting to run a little bit lower on those. but there's a portion of the central south that we're still mining, which is the southern portion of the pit is going to help us to preserve some stockpile for q1 and q2.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. ok. thanks. and then just if i can ask one more question.
thanks for your patience. on the exploration front, so there's been a lot of drilling a lot going on, several pits here that we've been mining over the year. are we going to -- when do we expect to resource update? i forget when you normally do that, but when should we expect to resource update and what kind of granularity will we see and will we get kind of update pit-by-pit or sort of just sort of a global type number?
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
the update probably going to happen early next year and it's going to -- we -- the updatewill be very similar to the one we released a year ago. so it does give details for all the pits. all the analysis says it'll be an update of what we currently have right now. but yes, it's probably going to come out in early next year.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
right. but it should include some of the results from the extensive drilling you've done this year to correct.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely, yes.
matthew o'keefe -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. that is great. ok. that is it for me.
i will leave it there. thanks.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
this concludes the question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to rob henderson for any closing remarks.
rob henderson -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, operator. we know it's been a difficult year and we're fortunate to be able to adapt to resequencing of the tucano mine design in order to tap into gold production from our numerous other pits and our underground opportunities. we are expecting a good year in 2022 from a total production perspective, production that will be back-end weighted. and therefore we have to be prudent about our capital spending to navigate through the first half of the year.
and we are doing just that through a number of initiatives and that's preserving capital efficiently deploying resources and securing financing. i am a gold bloom, and i believe in the strength of the gold price moving forward. it's why i joined great panther and why i believe we have a solid future. we're fully leveraged to the gold price, which given inflationary pressures across the globe should result in value creation for all stakeholders.
we have a large package with district sale potential, a differentiating factor that offers us significant upside and we have the team to execute on our growth objectives with the acquisitions an integral part of our strategy to grow into an intermediate gold producer. on behalf of everyone here at great panther, we thank you for your support and look forward to sharing our progress with you in the next quarter. thank you for your time today.

operator
alan, i think you're muted.
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
sorry, i was on -- put myself on mute. thanks. thank you, fiona, and thank you, everyone, for dialing in today. this quarter was transformative for great panther mining with the agreement reached to sell the topia mine and the guanajuato mine complex in mexico.
both silver mines, there were the assets the company was originally founded on and had provided numerous years of solid results. with the sale of these assets, so ever, the company can now focus -- focuses these sources primarily on tucano, as this is where we see the most long-term value creation potential for the company and its stakeholders. to that end, we are seeing progress at tucano as shown in this quarter's results. during the quarter, we saw improving levels of production from tucano and moved a significant amount of material to position the mine for the second half of the year.
we're starting to ramp up in the tap ab pit and expected to be back to a regular rate of production by the fourth quarter. regarding the underground, the studies for the urucum north underground project continue to advance, assets permitting, and we expect to complete an updated resource estimate for the underground by the fourth quarter. we hope to have most report next quarter. as with many in the industry, we are seeing inflationary headwinds impact our cost of operations significantly more than anticipated for the year.
for that reason, we have had to adjust our 2022 cost guidance, which sandra will detail later in the call. we continue to look for ways to best manage our liquidity, taking cost-improving actions and deferring capital expenditures where possible. revenue for the quarter was $30 million on production of 16,629 gold ounces. inflation and necessary spending on capital programs led to cash costs of $1,575 per gold ounce sold, an asic excluding corporate g&a of $3,080 per ounce for gold ounce sold.
as previously stated, we expect to have high costs in the first half of 2022 due to the heavy stripping required position tucano return to steady-state production in the second half. we expect costs to normalize and cash flow to improve as production increases throughout the second half of the year and into 2023. we ended the quarter with $21.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowings of $43.4 million. sandra will go into further detail on these financial results later in the call.
i will now pass the call over to fernando cornejo, coo, to discuss results from our operations.
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
thank you, alan, and good morning, everyone. production from tucano during the second quarter was in line with expectations. asset stripping continues in preparation for accessing main or lenses and therefore, their grade in the second half of 2022. when looking at the production results this quarter, compared to the last quarter, we are starting to see modest improvements in line with our plan to return to a normalized rate of production.
gold production for this quarter was 16,629 ounces compared with 14,037 ounces in the first quarter of this year, which is an increase of 18%, and 20,609 ounces in q2 2021, a decrease of 39%. total mine tonnage increased by 76% compared to q1 2022 and 36% compared to the same quarter last year. this is a result of having two mining contractors, u&m and minax operating in parallel throughout different pits. tucano is in the process of moving into better operational conditions with lower stripping ratios for the year and mining higher volumes of ore for the next several months.
mine ore tonnage in gold grades during the second quarter, were also higher compared to the first quarter of 2022. a total of 291,160 tons of mine ore were processed this quarter versus 232,213 tons in q1 2022, an increase of 25%, and 211,930 tons in q2 2021, also a 37% increase. the plant feed grade for the quarter was 0.69 grams per ton compared to the 0.57 grams per ton in q1 2022, an increase of 21%, and 0.81 grams per ton in q2 2021, a decrease of 15%. as alan mentioned, inflation has had a significant impact on all key consumables and services used in our business, including diesel, cyanide, and others.
in addition, due to higher-than-normal rainfall levels in northern brazil, particularly in the first quarter of this year, it was necessary to fast-track the expansion of the tucano tailings facility, as well as the installation of operators to manage water levels in our tailings facilities. these two items led to an increase in capital spending and led to a higher than anticipated cost for the quarter. cash cost per ounce sold were $1,575 compared with $1,617 in q2 2021. and asic per gold ounce sold, excluding corporate g&a was $3,080 mostly due to higher stripping levels and the additional capital expenditures explained a few moments ago.
during the quarter, the resource conversion program for the urucum north underground project was completed in an updated resource estimate is currently being developed by our team in brazil. in parallel, the company has started trade-off studies for land development and mining methods in parallel with engineering and metallurgical project work, while planning activities are underway. the permitting process has also started with the state environmental agency, sema, project development including the update of mineral resources and reserves is on track to be completed by the fourth quarter of this year. regional target definition, validation, and prioritization is currently underway in consultation with goldspot discoveries.
this project began in june and results are expected in early august. portable drills are being contracted in a 2,500- to 3,500-meter drill program is expected to begin in august upon completion of the goldspot study. at coricancha, we are continuing to evaluate options to optimize the project and will report new developments as they arise. i will now pass the call over to sandra daycock to discuss our financial results in more detail.
thank you.
sandra daycock -- chief financial officer
thank you, fernando. revenue for the quarter was $30 million, compared with $39 million in the same quarter last year, on gold sales of 16,076 ounces, compared with 21,459 ounces in the same period last year. the average realized gold price was $1,865 per ounce versus $1,850 per ounce in q2 2021. and our mine operating income was $0.1 million, compared with a loss of $2.6 million.
our net loss was $12.1 million, compared with a net loss of $8.7 million in q2 2021, and ebitda was negative $5 million, compared with negative $0.9 million in the same quarter last year. net cash flows from operating activities before change in noncash working capital was negative $8.3 million compared with negative $0.9 million in q2 2021. we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $21.1 million, compared with $35.2 million for the same period in 2021 and $33.4 million at the end of q1 2022. we made significant investments in the business in the second quarter, including $15 million in stripping, $7.1 million in capital investments, and $1.8 million in exploration.
further, we repaid $5.5 million in debt on a net basis with borrowings totaling $43.4 million on june 30, 2022. in addition, during q2, the company issued shares for proceeds of $3 million through the atm facility. finally, we received $13 million in cash proceeds from nyrstar in relation to a settlement in nyrstar's rights and obligations, including their start indemnity agreement in connection with the coricancha mine.as alan and fernando both mentioned previously, we have determined that tucano cost guidance for the year must be adjusted. cash costs have been revised from $1,200 to $1,300 an ounce sold to a range of $1,400 to $1,500 per ounce of gold outsold.
asic, excluding corporate g&a, has been revised from a range of $1,600 to $1,700 per gold ounce sold, to a range of $2,200 to $2,300 per gold outsold. the significant difference between asic and cash cost reflects investments in stripping, which will yield gold production in 2023, as well as necessary capital expenditures, fernando mentioned earlier on the tucano facilities. tucano forecast reduction remains within the previously guided range of 85,000 to 100,000 ounces. the company expects to generate positive cash flows from its mining operations in 2022 prior to capital investments, debt repayment obligations, and exploration and development costs.
however, further financing will be required to improve working capital, fund planned capital investment and exploration programs for operating mines, and meet schedule set repayment obligations. we are evaluating options to secure new sources of capital to allow us to achieve our longer-term objectives. thank you. that's all we have for formal remarks.
i will now turn the call back to the operator for the question-and-answer period.
operator
thank you. we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question is from heiko ihle with h.c. wainwright.
please go ahead.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
hi there. thanks for taking my questions. hope everyone is doing well. going through your release, there was a sentence in there that you expect to return to normalized rate of production in the second half.
can you maybe just provide a bit of a month-to-month overview? i mean, we're now in august. i assume -- july is obviously done, and you put this out after july was over. can you maybe just give a little bit of color of how july went given that there is no reg issues given that there's a public setting here?
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
hi, heiko. i think it's fair to say by the fact that we've kept our guidance unchanged. i think you can work out, but we also mentioned that two-thirds of our production will come in the â the second half of the year. so, we're seeing a progressive ramp up through q3 and then i would characterize q4 as kind of a steady state.
hopefully, that helps.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
that's fair. ok. just moving on a little bit, alan, you started talking this call we're talking a little bit about inflation. i mean, it's a topic that's on everyone's mind just open up a newspaper, but just moving on from all of that.
are you having trouble getting any specific components at site? i mean, it seems like random little spare parts or like random odds and ends are hard to show up. it seems like the important things tend to show up even though the higher costs. but is there anything that you're not getting to site that you need? is there any bottlenecks that are starting to develop -- or is it just as long as you pay up everything comes? and just maybe building on all of that, are you seeing anything get worse in that regard?
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
there were certain issues around some parts associated with the mining contractor mobilizing. i think that was just also part of the mobilization process, things like bucket teeth and things like that, but i think we're on top of those now. there have been some delays in measly mobilizing because of some equipment supply delays, but delivery dates are set, it's not really that much of a slippage maybe about a month. i don't know if fernando can add any additional color.
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
yeah. i mean, the delays we have seen with the contractor in terms of parts in the stock components are just part of the mobilization process. but in terms of key consumables in tucano, we haven't experienced any delays. tucano is a consolidated mine operation has many years that has been operating in the supply chain is quite well structured.
so, yeah, no issues from a production perspective, specifically on delivery of those supplies.
heiko ihle -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
that's encouraging to hear. i appreciate everyone's time. i'll get back to queue. thank you.
operator
the next question is from jake sekelsky with alliance global partners. please go ahead.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. so, sandra touched on this a bit, but i'm just trying to get a handle on where costs might settle in once steady state is reached later this year. i mean, do you think longer-term asic of $1,200 an ounce or so, sort of like what we saw in 2020 is achievable? i'm just trying to get a sense of what the thinking is there.
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
well, you can see the ranges that we've guided to. so, that should give you a feel for what our expectations are for the balance of the year. a big component of the cost increase has been fueled, it increased very significantly in brazil. and i mean, i don't know if you saw today that the victory oil price below $90.
so, obviously, it's come off quite significantly from its recent high. we're hoping that we might, in some areas, see some mitigation of some of these significant cost increases that we've had to bear this year. but it's obviously, very hard to tell. i mean, the world is a very uncertain place right now.
so, it's really hard to look that far into the future, and we just projected for the balance of this year and the revised guidance.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
fair enough. ok. and then just on urucum north underground. i know originally, you guys had plans to potentially start development work there later this year.
is that still the plan, or has that been deferred to the first half of 2023?
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
the first thing that we have to really get an understanding on is what the permit taken timeline should be. we think the permitting should be relatively simple given it's within existing operations, but we haven't had that confirmed. so, the exact timing may have been moved our hands in any case. that being said, obviously, we're still doing the engineering and the optimization work.
so, that's underway. and we obviously also had to apply some capital this year to address the churns. and what a balance city likely had reported a number of companies we've done unusually high rainfall at the early part of this year and have had to alter our capital plans accordingly, especially we think that the way the world is going is higher rainfall may actually be the new normal. so, i think we'll just have to see how the permitting progresses and where we stand from our ability to fund the project before we commit the dollars.
so, certainly, wouldn't anticipate commencing construction this year, but hopefully, it would be something that we'd be able to move forward next year.
jake sekelsky -- alliance global partners -- analyst
makes sense. that's all for me. thanks again.
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
thank you.

the next question is from joseph reagor with roth capital partners. please go ahead.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the questions. obviously, the stuff i want to touch on has already been asked. but any update on the fine related to the fish kill that you guys announced, i guess, is it late 2021 or early 2022?
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
no, there's been no update on that.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. and then i guess all the settlement around -- on accountability. is this an indication that you guys might be looking to sell that asset as well?
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
well, certainly assessing -- and, as we've said, assessing all our options, including potential to restart operations there. but certainly, everything is on the table right now in terms of what we do with coricancha. as we've said previously, our capital allocation priorities are on tucano.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. fair enough. and then if you don't sell coricancha and you just complete the current asset sale based on your guys' revised cost estimates, do you feel comfortable you can cover your debt with the return to positive cash flow from tucano?
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
yes. i mean, as i say, we should be back to steady state -- to steady-state operation by q4. and our current mine plan shows healthy 2023. so, we should be in good shape on that basis.
we just had to overcome the real pivot in the main plan with the [inaudible] issues that urucum central south, but we're now coming out of the other side of that, and i think we're very close to, as you said, returning to steady state production.
joseph reagor -- roth capital partners -- analyst

hi. thanks for taking my question. last week in the united states, that court trial for those precious metal traders who accused of manipulating gold and silver price that is due to a close. what message do you think that mining companies might want to tell potential and current investors?
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
sorry, could you repeat that?
unknown speaker -- akamai capital -- analyst
yes. so, last week, there was that court trial for those precious metal traders that were accused of manipulating gold and silver prices, what message do you think that mining companies might want to tell potential and current investors?
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
i have to confess not familiar with what you're referencing. and really --
unknown speaker -- akamai capital -- analyst
moving on to my next question. it's a macro question about the junior mining industry. it's an interesting time for investors thinking of entering or returning to mining stocks where some investors see buying opportunity at reasonable stock prices. when you are speaking with investors, how are you addressing the risk of inflation, recession, and these other economic terms?
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
well, i think -- we, as a company, are no different from other mining companies and other industries, i think, as i said earlier, we're trying to navigate our way through uncertain times. and by doing that, we have to say, being careful with our capital allocation. we are looking to where we can reduce costs and improve efficiencies, all the typical things that any company tries to do through a downturn, especially mining companies that are subject to the metal price cycle impact. so, i don't think we're doing anything that we wouldn't be doing in other similar situations that the company has faced in its history.

operator
alan, i think you're muted.
alan hair -- chairman and interim chief executive officer
sorry, i was on -- put myself on mute. thanks. thank you, fiona, and thank you, everyone, for dialing in today. this quarter was transformative for great panther mining with the agreement reached to sell the topia mine and the guanajuato mine complex in mexico.
both silver mines, there were the assets the company was originally founded on and had provided numerous years of solid results. with the sale of these assets, so ever, the company can now focus -- focuses these sources primarily on tucano, as this is where we see the most long-term value creation potential for the company and its stakeholders. to that end, we are seeing progress at tucano as shown in this quarter's results. during the quarter, we saw improving levels of production from tucano and moved a significant amount of material to position the mine for the second half of the year.
we're starting to ramp up in the tap ab pit and expected to be back to a regular rate of production by the fourth quarter. regarding the underground, the studies for the urucum north underground project continue to advance, assets permitting, and we expect to complete an updated resource estimate for the underground by the fourth quarter. we hope to have most report next quarter. as with many in the industry, we are seeing inflationary headwinds impact our cost of operations significantly more than anticipated for the year.
for that reason, we have had to adjust our 2022 cost guidance, which sandra will detail later in the call. we continue to look for ways to best manage our liquidity, taking cost-improving actions and deferring capital expenditures where possible. revenue for the quarter was $30 million on production of 16,629 gold ounces. inflation and necessary spending on capital programs led to cash costs of $1,575 per gold ounce sold, an asic excluding corporate g&a of $3,080 per ounce for gold ounce sold.
as previously stated, we expect to have high costs in the first half of 2022 due to the heavy stripping required position tucano return to steady-state production in the second half. we expect costs to normalize and cash flow to improve as production increases throughout the second half of the year and into 2023. we ended the quarter with $21.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowings of $43.4 million. sandra will go into further detail on these financial results later in the call.
i will now pass the call over to fernando cornejo, coo, to discuss results from our operations.
fernando cornejo -- chief operating officer
thank you, alan, and good morning, everyone. production from tucano during the second quarter was in line with expectations. asset stripping continues in preparation for accessing main or lenses and therefore, their grade in the second half of 2022. when looking at the production results this quarter, compared to the last quarter, we are starting to see modest improvements in line with our plan to return to a normalized rate of production.
gold production for this quarter was 16,629 ounces compared with 14,037 ounces in the first quarter of this year, which is an increase of 18%, and 20,609 ounces in q2 2021, a decrease of 39%. total mine tonnage increased by 76% compared to q1 2022 and 36% compared to the same quarter last year. this is a result of having two mining contractors, u&m and minax operating in parallel throughout different pits. tucano is in the process of moving into better operational conditions with lower stripping ratios for the year and mining higher volumes of ore for the next several months.
mine ore tonnage in gold grades during the second quarter, were also higher compared to the first quarter of 2022. a total of 291,160 tons of mine ore were processed this quarter versus 232,213 tons in q1 2022, an increase of 25%, and 211,930 tons in q2 2021, also a 37% increase. the plant feed grade for the quarter was 0.69 grams per ton compared to the 0.57 grams per ton in q1 2022, an increase of 21%, and 0.81 grams per ton in q2 2021, a decrease of 15%. as alan mentioned, inflation has had a significant impact on all key consumables and services used in our business, including diesel, cyanide, and others.
in addition, due to higher-than-normal rainfall levels in northern brazil, particularly in the first quarter of this year, it was necessary to fast-track the expansion of the tucano tailings facility, as well as the installation of operators to manage water levels in our tailings facilities. these two items led to an increase in capital spending and led to a higher than anticipated cost for the quarter. cash cost per ounce sold were $1,575 compared with $1,617 in q2 2021. and asic per gold ounce sold, excluding corporate g&a was $3,080 mostly due to higher stripping levels and the additional capital expenditures explained a few moments ago.
during the quarter, the resource conversion program for the urucum north underground project was completed in an updated resource estimate is currently being developed by our team in brazil. in parallel, the company has started trade-off studies for land development and mining methods in parallel with engineering and metallurgical project work, while planning activities are underway. the permitting process has also started with the state environmental agency, sema, project development including the update of mineral resources and reserves is on track to be completed by the fourth quarter of this year. regional target definition, validation, and prioritization is currently underway in consultation with goldspot discoveries.
this project began in june and results are expected in early august. portable drills are being contracted in a 2,500- to 3,500-meter drill program is expected to begin in august upon completion of the goldspot study. at coricancha, we are continuing to evaluate options to optimize the project and will report new developments as they arise. i will now pass the call over to sandra daycock to discuss our financial results in more detail.
thank you.
sandra daycock -- chief financial officer
thank you, fernando. revenue for the quarter was $30 million, compared with $39 million in the same quarter last year, on gold sales of 16,076 ounces, compared with 21,459 ounces in the same period last year. the average realized gold price was $1,865 per ounce versus $1,850 per ounce in q2 2021. and our mine operating income was $0.1 million, compared with a loss of $2.6 million.
our net loss was $12.1 million, compared with a net loss of $8.7 million in q2 2021, and ebitda was negative $5 million, compared with negative $0.9 million in the same quarter last year. net cash flows from operating activities before change in noncash working capital was negative $8.3 million compared with negative $0.9 million in q2 2021. we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $21.1 million, compared with $35.2 million for the same period in 2021 and $33.4 million at the end of q1 2022. we made significant investments in the business in the second quarter, including $15 million in stripping, $7.1 million in capital investments, and $1.8 million in exploration.
further, we repaid $5.5 million in debt on a net basis with borrowings totaling $43.4 million on june 30, 2022. in addition, during q2, the company issued shares for proceeds of $3 million through the atm facility. finally, we received $13 million in cash proceeds from nyrstar in relation to a settlement in nyrstar's rights and obligations, including their start indemnity agreement in connection with the coricancha mine.as alan and fernando both mentioned previously, we have determined that tucano cost guidance for the year must be adjusted. cash costs have been revised from $1,200 to $1,300 an ounce sold to a range of $1,400 to $1,500 per ounce of gold outsold.

however, further financing will be required to improve working capital, fund planned capital investment and exploration programs for operating mines, and meet schedule set repayment obligations. we are evaluating options to secure new sources of capital to allow us to achieve our longer-term objectives. thank you. that's all we have for formal remarks.
